In this past year I have attended more funeral services , memorials , and celebrations of life than I care to think about . Yet , with each event , certain situations have revealed themselves ; crying out for me to write about . Let the following be a wake up call on how to attend wakes , funerals , and other memorial services , to care and respect : <p> 1 . ARRIVE ON TIME . At every funeral I attended , more than a handful of guests arrive long after the service begins even when the service was already delayed in starting . This is totally unacceptable . It is each guests responsibility to arrive on time . This means taking into consideration the availability of parking and any unforeseen traffic delays . <p> It is not acceptable to say you were delayed due to a ball game . My husband Ron keeps both the S.F. Giants and 49er at-home schedules on his bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ball park to reach an event or appointment . It is all about caring more about others than yourself . Being late shows your lack of respect and selfishness . Arrive no closer than 10 to 8 minutes ahead of the appointed time . If you do arrive late , be quiet in all you do . Do not hold conversations with other guests . Respectfully wait until an appropriate break in the service to enter the room to take a seat . <p> 2 . TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE . A while back , I attended a funeral where at the beginning of the service , someones cell phone sounded . The person allowed their cell phone to ring all four times-through to voicemail-before it became silent . Now , you would think this was a wake-up call to other guests to check their phones . Unfortunately , four other cell phones rang , the last of which was during the final prayer . Need I say more ? Make it a habit to check and turn your cell phone to silent , vibrate mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or event . <p> 3 . WEAR PROPER ATTIRE . In Western culture , the proper color to wear at funerals has been black . While black is still best , especially for the immediate family of the deceased , guests have more options . They should still wear subdued , conservative clothing that is respectful to the event . Wearing jeans or the same clothes you would wear to a back-yard barbecue shows a great lack of care and respect for the person who has died , their family , and others . Everyone should have at least one nice set of clothes to wear for special occasions . <p> Colors to avoid include red , orange , and yellow and anything that has bright and cheery flowers or other bold and loud patterns . Wear clean , neat , well-pressed clothes . Men should wear a dark jacket with dark slacks , dark dress shoes , white or plain solid colored shirt , and a subdued tie . For younger men , the minimum should be a well-pressed solid-colored shirt , slacks , and dress shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , or similar outfit that is subdued . <p> The key here is to have at least one good set of clothes for occasions like these . If you do n't  , buy something even at Goodwill . Never wear the same old wrinkled shirt , blue jeans , flip-flops , sandals , or sneakers . One of my pet peeves is how parents allow their children to wear sloppy clothes and jeans to special events such as weddings and funerals , rather than appropriate clothing . <p> 4 . SEND A MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY . It is often awkward to know what to say to a parent , spouse , or other immediate family member when someone passes away . Its always nice to send a message of sympathy , whether by email , fax , or by regular mail . It shows you care and are sympathetic . <p> Unless you are part of the family and are extremely close , do not call them especially between the death of their loved one and any service or event being planned . It is an extremely stressful period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less intrusive . <p> When expressing your feelings , be genuine with your words . Do not sound like you are using " canned " phrases copied from a commercially printed sympathy card . Among the phrases to avoid are : <p> Its awful , but when your time is up , its up <p> I know how you feel <p> Be sure to stay busy , they say it is the best way through this <p> At least he went peacefully <p> Know that he s in a better place now <p> You must stay strong through this <p> This was probably a blessing in disguise rather than to continue suffering <p> At least he is no longer in pain <p> Its truly sad he died so young <p> Only the good die young <p> 5 . SEND A GIFT OR CONTRIBUTION . Historically flowers have been the tradition to send to bereaved familys home or funeral home , today if you wish to express your feelings beyond a written message of sympathy , do not automatically send flowers for the funeral or a live plant for the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family member to confirm this is something they will prefer and enjoy . Many people now choose donations to their favorite charities , over flowers . <p> 6 . RESPECT THE FAMILYS WISHES . Do not criticize the process leading up to the funeral or the event itself . Rituals and styles have shifted in recent years whereby they are not as formal or ritualistic as in the " old days . " Families may choose not to adhere to certain historic customs . Focus on the positive aspects , not the negative . <p> 7 . OBSERVE CULTURAL , RELIGIOUS , AND OTHER PRACTICES . When invited to an observance for someone who is from a culture or faith with which you are less familiar , ask someone about it or go on the web to learn what will be taking place during the event and what you may be expected to do . Doing research will help you be more relaxed and comfortable when certain practices take place . By knowing ahead of time you can participate and enjoy the experience more fully . <p> 8 . BRINGING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a funeral , brief them ahead of time about the importance of what they are attending . Set aside practice time to learn how to whisper and sit quietly for long periods of time ; to demonstrate to you that they are matured enough to attend this important event . Bottom-line is if your child is unable to whisper or sit quietly for 45-60 minutes at home , it may be best to hire a babysitter for a few hours , rather than cause disturbances at the event . <p> Question : What other items do you have to add to this list ?

I began to dread the question , " How are you ? " The answer was obvious I was n't very good , but most people do n't  want to hear that . Also , in those emotionally charged days I never knew if I could get the answer out without falling apart . One day I bumped into an acquaintance , who had lost her husband a few months ahead of me , and she said , " I am very glad to see you , " while touching my forearm gently . It occured to me that I did not have to say anything except , " thank you . " I now use that phrase when I see people who have lost loved ones . <p> Understanding proper etiquette to console someone who is grieving is an important attribute to have . People will be born and people will die and learning what is appropriate can help console others in a time of loss . My favorite tip is to turn off your cell phone . One way to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give full and undivided attention . I truly appreciate friends who have dropped everything to help me when I have grieved over losses in my life . <p> i am 81 years oldi am going to a funeral for my wifes 1st cousin.the funeral will be in peoria arizona and the temperature will be in the 100s .. i can not stand the heat.is it proper to wear black dress pants , black shoes and a white collared short sleeve shirt ? js <p> Jerry : Black dress pants , black shoes , and a white collared short sleeve shirt with a blazer jacket or suit jacket would be fine . The key is you should wear a jacket during the actual service ; however , during the reception that may follow is fine to then take the jacket off . I 've only seen it in Hawaii might you not wear a jacket and short sleeves . Then perhaps wearing a tie in lieu of a jacket would be appropriate . <p> Jerry , I know the time has long since passed , but my advice to anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your white shirt , black/navy dress pants , and black shoes would be fine . You might consider a tie . The family will be grateful that you attended , and no one wants you to become i 'll or faint . <p> Thanks for the information ! My friends mom died a few days ago , so I 'm going to her funeral to support my friend and his family . I 've never been to a funeral before , so I 'm not sure about what the protocol is for attendees . Respecting cultural and religious practices during a funeral is a very good point . My friends family practice Buddhism , so it seems like a good idea to find out if there 's anything that I should know about ceremonial practices to avoid offending anyone . <p> I thought all these etiquette tips were very appropriate . I think respecting the familys wishes is on the top of the list . Everyone grieves differently and each family views a funeral differently and so communication of support is so important . These are are a good reminder for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral service . I have yet to be one but I 'm sure that it would be very respectful to pay my respects with simple things . Such as giving the a small gift or just expressing my sympathy to the family . <p> This may sound odd , but I collect vintage handkerchiefs , and when I greet the widow or mother , etc , of the deceased , I press a clean , pressed , beautiful hankie into her hand . Its much nicer than the wadded up tissue she is probably holding , and its a reminder of my sympathy for her . <p> As a parent who has lost a child , I can positively tell you that it DOES NOT matter what you wear . Do you think I even remotely remember what someone was wearing at my sons funeral ? ? ? The ONLY thing that mattered to me was you had the decency to come . Do I remember you being there , probably not . <p> Tammie : I understand your comment having attended both my parents funerals . I suppose the perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event and to everyone attending . I know for a fact people do notice , including the bereaved . Thanks for writing . <p> Karen : Whenever I am seek information , the Internet is always a great place to start . Also , its fine to ask someone from that culture about what will be appropriate to wear and what will be taking place at the service . In many cultures wearing bright colors , especially red , is " not " as appropriate . Personally , I would wear neutral , solid colors , including medium blues , grays , or black . In the Asian culture , white is the color of death . <p> My Wife and I will be attending a Funeral of her work Colleague Partner . All I have is a grey suit white shirt and a black ties with black shoes . Is that going to be okay or should i go and buy a black suite . <p> I think the tips are great but honestly . I think you wear what you can within reason . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had were jeans and cowboy boots . Who cares what you wear really ? You 're there to pay respects to the dead and support the living left behind . I agree do n't  show up in a bikini but do n't  go broke buying an entirely new outfit that is just silly . Maybe I am less judgmental than most but I think the fact that you show up to any funeral at all means that the person who died meant something to you or their family did . Dress as appropriately as possible but do n't  stress over it . <p> Rene : I do agree with your comments . However , in many instances , people where clothes without any respect or care in situations they could have cared better . What then is of equal importance is to wear clean and neat clothes , not something that is dirty or tattered . <p> Preparing your children is probably for the services sounds like a really good idea . At a young age , they may not fully grasp what is going on with the ceremony . Helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and everyone around you during the services . Thanks for posting these great tips for everyone to see . <p> Being observant of religious customs is really important if you ask me . What I would do is maybe prepare a little bit by doing some research and getting an idea of what to expect . This way , there wont be any shocking parts of the ceremony that you werent prepared for . Thanks for posting these awesome tips ! <p> A family member attended calling hours for the sister of my grandmother . She was very upset because after standing in line by the casket for a very long time , she was never approached by the family . She was caught standing there for so long because the line had been held up . From what I had been told the bereaving family held conversations with other people and even skipped her in line to talk to other people . Relations had been strained between my grandmother and sister so these two sides of the families had never mixed . She left feeling snubbed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Should she feel snubbed or should she approach this with the mindset that she went to support the family but something happened , a misunderstanding for example ? What kind of mindset should someone have when attending calling hours ? <p> Katherine : Regrettably do not have any comment about how to approach this situation . I cant say whether your family member should or should not feel snubbed . This much I can say is some things are best left alone and should not cause any further anxiety . However , if this is something you can not leave alone , the best approach is to call someone who knows all parties involved to share your feelings and ask for advice . As to the mindset for anyone attending a wake or calling hours , it should be with all the best memories and feelings of the deceased . <p> On Wednesday , I will be attending my cousins funeral , which will be the first one that I have ever attended . I would love to send a gift to his family , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  last very long . What are other common things that are given as gifts at funerals ? <p> Faylinn : Gifts for funerals are guided by the culture of the deceased . In some cultures a donation to the deceased favorite charity is welcomed ; others give flowers ; and others give even money to help with funeral expenses . What is most universally appropriate is a note/card to share in your sorrow over the loss of your friend/relative . When in doubt , you can ask a relative or good friend what would be most appropriate . 190397 @qwx810397 190429 @qwx810429 
@@83772897 @5272897/ <p> Many Americans hit the road on vacation each year . In an effort to cut down the number of accidents due to not knowing or understanding road signs , this tip is dedicated to everyone who drives U.S. highways . <p> ON A PERSONAL NOTE : This tip is also dedicated to my brother Melvyn Seid who passed away in May 2009 . He was a man who loved traveling the world and often took his family on fun road trips all around the United States in their family van . <p> <p> Road signs and other highway markings are the drivers guide to road safety . Knowing what these signs mean and using them and other rules of the road properly makes life easier for you and more pleasant for all the drivers and pedestrians you encounter . So how you drive is an important part of etiquette . <p> How well do you know road etiquette ? Answer the following seven questions after reading each description of the situation : <p> QUESTION 1 : Youre driving on a freeway , nearing a large city and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanes to three , four , and then five , and traffic is getting heavy . A large green sign for your exit shows , " North US 57 , Main Street 1 mile " with a small sign on the top-left reading " EXIT 32 . " What must you do to exit as safely and quickly as possible ? <p> A. Ask passengers to keep a lookout for your off-ramp so you can get into the appropriate lane to exit . <p> B. Stay in the right lane so you are ready to exit . <p> C. Move to the far left lane to be ready to exit . <p> D. Move to the middle lane so you can move to your exit quickly when you see it . <p> ANSWER : The small exit number sign on top of a larger directional sign is always on the same side as the exit . Since the " EXIT 32 " sign is on the top-left of the big sign , your exit ramp is on the left . Therefore , " C " is correct . <p> QUESTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-23 at " EXIT 42 " and get off at " EXIT 163 . " In what direction are you driving and how far have you traveled ? <p> A. East , 19 miles <p> B. North , 121 miles <p> C. South , 121 miles <p> D. West , 205 miles <p> ANSWER : Almost all Interstate and US highways and some State highways going north and south are numbered in odd numbers . Those going east and west are numbered in even numbers . Most states follow federal guidelines and number their exits according to the mile markers . On even-numbered highways they begin in the west and increase as you drive east . Odd-numbered highways begin in the south and increase driving north . <p> Therefore , " B " is the correct answer . Because the number increases , it indicates you are driving north , for 121 miles ( 163 42 = 121 ) . <p> Note : To my knowledge , the State of New York numbers its exits consecutively west to east and south to north without any regard to the mile markers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markers until recently ; they are appearing more and more in certain sections of the state . These are the only exceptions . If you know of other exceptions , please let us hear from you . <p> QUESTION 3 : Driving at night on a rural road with no streetlights , your headlights are the only illumination . A sign appears ahead of you , a tall rectangle with alternating black and yellow stripes slanting down to the left . Without looking at the roads edge stripes or anything else , this sign indicates you should immediately : <p> A. Stop ! The road is about to end . <p> B. Drive cautiously around the sign on either side and watch for an obstruction . <p> C. Drive to the left of the sign and continue . <p> D. Drive to the right of the sign and continue . <p> ANSWER : This sign is an object marker . It warns of an obstruction , such as a bridge abutment or other intrusion into the roadway . The slanted lines always point down toward the lane and direction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " C " is correct . <p> Similar signs and barriers with slanted lines guide you around construction zones and other hazards or obstructions . Always note the direction in which the lines slant down and go around the barrier to that side . <p> QUESTION 4 : You are entering a freeway on the on-ramp , driving in unfamiliar territory . You notice a continuous white line on your left and a solid yellow line on the right . Without hesitation , you should : <p> A. Proceed cautiously onto the highway . <p> B. Cross the line quickly into the next lane . <p> C. Accelerate to highway speed . <p> D. Back up immediately ! <p> ANSWER : Oops ! Yellow stripes separate traffic traveling in opposite directions or mark the left edge of the highway . If you ever see a yellow line on your right , you are going the wrong way into opposing traffic . White edge lines always define the right edge of the road . In this case you have turned onto an exit ramp . Stop and back down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> All roads conform to this rule . In many cases there are red reflectors on the yellow line , which you see in the headlights of cars going the wrong way , in case the yellow line is not readily visible at dusk or at night . <p> QUESTION 5 : You are driving on a six-lane highway with three lanes on your side . You are in lane Number 3 , the far right lane , and you want to pass the slow trucks and cars that are using the lane as well . Cars in the other two lanes are moving faster and passing the slower cars and trucks . You should : <p> A. Carefully move into lane 2 to pass one or more of the slower vehicles . <p> B. Move into lane 1 if the vehicles in the middle and right lane are slower than you and you want to pass . <p> C. Move into the Number 1 lane and stay there to be sure you are never impeded by slower traffic . <p> D. Drive in whatever lane is comfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always drive in lane 2 when there are three lanes , so you have room to maneuver . <p> ANSWER : " A , " " B " or " E " are correct . I hope you did not choose " C. " This is my biggest pet peeve , when drivers remain in the far left Number 1 lane , no matter what . Driving etiquette says you only use the left lane as a passing lane , except when all lanes are full of traffic . <p> If you want to pass , do so to the left . If you are passing and a faster car comes up behind you , do not continue to block that car . Slow down and move into a lane to your right until the car passes you . In other words , do not hog the fast lane whenever cars are behind you . If you chose " D , " this could be you . <p> Especially at night , if you come upon a slow vehicle and want to pass , do not immediately go around it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high beams on and off to let the driver know you want to pass . If the car does n't  move over in a reasonable time , then signal a lane change and move around the car . <p> When changing lanes for any reason , use your turn signals so all the drivers around you know your intention . Surprising other drivers with unannounced lane changes can cause accidents . <p> QUESTION 6 : You are driving on a two-lane winding road either at the speed limit or a little slower , so you can enjoy the scenery . Four cars and a truck are piled up behind you . You should : <p> A. Continue driving . When you get to a road with more lanes or a passing lane , cars can get around you . <p> B. Speed up to the limit or faster so you can leave cars behind . <p> C. When it is safe , pull over into a turnout or wide shoulder to let cars pass , then resume your journey . <p> D. Slow down even more to give the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the road or when they can see no cars coming the other way . <p> ANSWER : Its the law ! When four or more cars pile up behind you on any road because you are going slower than others may wanteven if you are driving at or over the speed limityou must pull into a turn-out or onto a safe shoulder to let them pass . Therefore , " C " is correct . <p> When you see another car behind you on a one-lane road , the courteous thing to do is drive at least as fast as the limit until you reach a place to safely let the other car(s) pass . Causing other drivers to get frustrated or angry because you are holding them up , often causes them to do dangerous thingssuch as pass you when it is not safe on curves or when cars are coming the other way . Some may try to pass you on the shoulder which is not only unsafe , its also illegal . <p> QUESTION 7 : Youre renting a car and its time to fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which side the gas tank is located . To find out , you should : <p> A. Pull into a gas station and do n't  worry about it . If its on the wrong side , the hose will stretch <p> B. Look at the dashboard for a gas pump icon <p> C. Have your wife or child hang out a window and look <p> D. Look at your cars reflection in a store window as you drive by to see it <p> ANSWER : Choose " B. " If there is an icon of a gas pump , the side on which the hose is shown indicates which side of the car your gas tank is located . Check it out on your own car . It should be consistent . If not , let us hear what make and model you have . <p> I hope this tip has been fun for you to check out a little of your EIQ ( Etiquette Intelligence Quotient ) with regards to road sign etiquette . <p> Question : What other road signs do you have to add to this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do let us hear from you by locating this article at **30;96;TOOLONG .

@@83772898 @5272898/ <p> Anthropologist Terry Y. LeVine said it best : " The practice of giving and receiving gifts is so universal it is part of what it means to be human . In virtually every culture , gifts and the events at which they are exchanged are a crucial part of the essential process of creating and maintaining social relationships " <p> While December is the biggest gift-giving month of the year around the world , there are endless reasons to give gifts throughout the year : personal gifts for birthdays , weddings , graduations , and holidays , as well as business gifts to say thank you for a job well done , congratulations on a promotion , or I 'm sorry for not performing as expected . <p> The purpose of giving gifts is to bring joy to both the giver and receiver , promote goodwill , and make for a closer relationship . However , if gift-giving goes amiss , there is a risk of making the receiver uncomfortable and creating an unpleasant situation for both sides . To avoid any ill-effects from your gift-giving practices , keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Be sure of the true purpose of the gift . Beyond saying the gift is for a particular holiday or occasion , think through how well this gift will express your feelings for this person . To figure this out , ask yourself : How much do I really care about this person ? How much time , energy , and money am I willing to spend to select just the right gift for him or her ? Let the answers guide you throughout this process . <p> Do your homework about the receiver . Be observant about his or her favorite items , things he or she might need , or things that would be a meaningful expression of your relationship . Try to remember comments about favorite colors , foods , or beverages . As needed , ask someone else who knows the person , explaining that the purpose of your inquiry is to help learn something that will help you select a special gift . I think most people are willing to help with ideas . <p> Be sensitive to personal and cultural differences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to learn something about a persons ethnic , religious , and cultural practices along with their personal likes and dislikes , before you present a gift . Take time to learn what 's appropriate and what 's not in different communities to gain insights on what a person would or would not appreciate as a gift . For example , giving a bottle of wine to someone who does not drink alcohol could make the receiver less than overjoyed with your gift . <p> Know when corporate logos are appropriate . Some times a gift with a company logo cheapens its appearance . The best gifts are those without any company logos or promotion on it , especially when given as special thank-you gift . Logo gifts are fine as small tokens and remembrances for meetings held , not generally as the sincerest form of a thank-you gift . <p> Present your gift with style . The best way to present a gift is always beautifully wrapped and in person . And when you do , present your gift held with both your hands as though you are holding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian culture to show the utmost respect and care . In business situations , when sending the gift by messenger or mail , include your business card with the gift , along with a handwritten note on personal note card or stationary . <p> WHEN YOU RECEIVE : <p> Show your appreciation when receiving a gift in person . Always put a smile on your face as a gift is being presented . Receive the gift with both hands ( again an influence from the Asian culture ) . Say thank you along with a brief expression of appreciation . <p> Let the giver know as soon as possible when a gift has arrived . Make every effort to let the sender know you received a gift sent by mail or messenger ( email , fax , or telephone call is fine ) . Then follow it up by sending the proper thank-you note as soon as possible ( see Tip 10 for more details ) . <p> Be sensitive to opening a gift in front of others . Americans typically open gifts as soon as it is received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Know that in many countries it is not customary or appropriate to open gifts in front of other people . They are kept to be opened alone . When receiving house gifts , special guest and speaker gifts , be sensitive as to whether you will or will not be encouraged and expected to open it right away . <p> Know the bottom line . Always , always hand write a thank you note for every gift you receive , no matter what---regardless of whether you like the gift or not , even if you plan to exchange the gift or give it away . Simply said : Sending a thank-you note is the right thing to do . ( see November 2004 Tip for additional information on writing thank you notes ) 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

Be sure to include your email address for a personal response . <p> LETTERHEAD : Generally business letters are written on 8.5 x 11 sheets of quality plain paper or pre-printed stationery . Your name or company name should be clearly identifiable . Your address and other contact information should also be easy to find and read . <p> FORMATTING THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to read and helps define your overall company image . The most common layout style for business correspondence is to justify to the left margin and to place an extra line space to indicate new paragraphs . Whether you indent the first line or not is a matter of style and both are fine . My only recommendation is not to right-justify the letter as it often makes the letter more difficult to read . Take care in laying out your letter to have balanced margins all around . <p> HEADING : Begin all business letters with the following information , in this order : <p> Date List the date the letter is being sent , spelling out the entire date in either the American ( April 1 , 2004 ) or European ( 1 April 2004 ) styles . Do not use any form of abbreviation . Typically no more than two to three line spaces follows this line . <p> Addressee and Inside AddressWrite the following information each on separate lines : Name Title or position Company name Street Address , including suite number City , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> As a sign of respect , especially for first-time letters to someone you have never met , it is best to address the person properly as Miss , Ms , Mrs. or Mr. ( as applicable ) , followed by their first and last name . If the addressee has a designation , such as M.D. or Ph.D. , use only one style at a time . For example , list John Smith , M.D. , not Dr. John Smith , M.D. Please remember Ms is a proper word requiring no period to stand for an abbreviation . <p> When entering the name of a state type the entire name , such as Pennsylvania , not the postal code PA . The postal code should only appear on the envelope . Follow this block of information with two line spaces . <p> GREETING AND SALUTATION : Letter writing protocol dictates all letters begin with " Dear " followed by the addressees honorific and last name , followed by a colon , not a comma . For example , write " Dear Dr. Smith : " Again , Dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you become better acquainted with the person , one style is to type in their proper name , then strike it out by pen and hand write their first name to show less formality . Follow this information with two line spaces . <p> BODY TEXT : The current style is to write letters in as conversational a manner as possible . Long gone are the days where letters were written to sound more formal in an attempt to elevate your level of professionalism and education . Avoid phrases such as " Pursuant to " or " Please find enclosed " and stick with the same phrases you use in business conversation . I like to write letters using a sandwich approach : begin and end all correspondence with positive and cordial sentiments . Sandwiched in the middle , write the core information you want to convey . Separate each paragraph of text with two line spaces . <p> CLOSING : End letters with a cordial phrase you are comfortable using-Sincerely , Yours Truly , or Best Regards-followed by a comma . Depending on space left at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a signature . <p> SIGNATURE LINES : Type the name of the person who wrote and signed the letter , using both their first and last name . In cases where a woman wishes to be addressed a specific way , be sure to add Mrs. , Ms , or Miss in parenthesis before her name . If the letter is written by more than one person , include a signature line for each . A second signature line may be used to list the person 's title or position , as applicable . <p> NOTATIONS : At the bottom of the letter , typically two line spaces below the second signature line list notations for Enclosures , Postscripts , and Courtesy Copies . List courtesy copies as " cc " with the names of all individuals who are receiving a copy of the letter . I like to highlight each " cc " person 's name when sending their copy . <p> IDENTIFYING INITIALS : When someone other than the author types and finalizes a letter , it is customary to include a line indicating who performed this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capital letters , followed by either a colon or forward-slash and the assistant 's initials in lower case letters . For example , RFH:sjs or RFH/sjs . <p> PROOF READ:Always print out a copy of your letter and read it before signing and mailing . Look that the margins and format are pleasing to the eye . Read the letter for spelling , grammar , and correct contact . <p> FOLDING : One of my biggest frustrations in receiving a letter is how sloppy and incorrectly it is folded . A crookedly folded letter communicates a lack of care , interest , and professionalism . Letters typed on standard 8.5 x 11 paper , mailed in a standard #10 business sized envelope should be folded in thirds , leaving the top flap just slightly short of meeting a perfect one-third fold . Leaving a little flap allows the receiver to open the letter more easily . If you are using a smaller envelope , fold the paper first in half lengthwise , then in thirds horizontally . <p> INSERTING : Place the folded letter into the envelope with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the person opens the envelope he or she can easily pull the letter out , open it , and read it . Inserting it any other way makes it more difficult to open and read . <p> ADDRESSING THE ENVELOPE : For that initial good impression , use printed envelopes that match your letterhead . Your return address should be easy to find and read . When addressing envelopes , use the U.S. Postal Service guidelines for the fastest delivery service : Type all addresses . Use all capital letters . Eliminate all punctuation . Insert one space between the city and state and two spaces between the state and zip code . Again , there is not comma between the city and state . Use only the two-letter state code . For complete details on this and other related postal guidelines , see LONG ... <p> BONUS : Print a draft copy of every letter before it is finalized on letterhead . Another irritation is how letters are received with typed information all bunched up at the top of the letterhead . Again , this shows a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well on the page . Take care in laying out your letter to have balanced margins . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

@@83772910 @5272910/ <p> As I mature ( versus getting older ) the death of someone I know or love becomes increasingly heartfelt and difficult . In this past year I have attended more funeral services , memorials , and celebrations of life than I care to think about . Yet , with each event , certain situations have revealed themselves ; crying out for me to write about . Let the following be a wake up call on how to attend wakes , funerals , and other memorial services , to care and respect : <p> 1 . ARRIVE ON TIME . At every funeral I attended , more than a handful of guests arrive long after the service begins even when the service was already delayed in starting . This is totally unacceptable . It is each guests responsibility to arrive on time . This means taking into consideration the availability of parking and any unforeseen traffic delays . <p> It is not acceptable to say you were delayed due to a ball game . My husband Ron keeps both the S.F. Giants and 49er at-home schedules on his bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ball park to reach an event or appointment . It is all about caring more about others than yourself . Being late shows your lack of respect and selfishness . Arrive no closer than 10 to 8 minutes ahead of the appointed time . If you do arrive late , be quiet in all you do . Do not hold conversations with other guests . Respectfully wait until an appropriate break in the service to enter the room to take a seat . <p> 2 . TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONE . A while back , I attended a funeral where at the beginning of the service , someones cell phone sounded . The person allowed their cell phone to ring all four times-through to voicemail-before it became silent . Now , you would think this was a wake-up call to other guests to check their phones . Unfortunately , four other cell phones rang , the last of which was during the final prayer . Need I say more ? Make it a habit to check and turn your cell phone to silent , vibrate mode , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or event . <p> 3 . WEAR PROPER ATTIRE . In Western culture , the proper color to wear at funerals has been black . While black is still best , especially for the immediate family of the deceased , guests have more options . They should still wear subdued , conservative clothing that is respectful to the event . Wearing jeans or the same clothes you would wear to a back-yard barbecue shows a great lack of care and respect for the person who has died , their family , and others . Everyone should have at least one nice set of clothes to wear for special occasions . <p> Colors to avoid include red , orange , and yellow and anything that has bright and cheery flowers or other bold and loud patterns . Wear clean , neat , well-pressed clothes . Men should wear a dark jacket with dark slacks , dark dress shoes , white or plain solid colored shirt , and a subdued tie . For younger men , the minimum should be a well-pressed solid-colored shirt , slacks , and dress shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit , or similar outfit that is subdued . <p> The key here is to have at least one good set of clothes for occasions like these . If you do n't  , buy something even at Goodwill . Never wear the same old wrinkled shirt , blue jeans , flip-flops , sandals , or sneakers . One of my pet peeves is how parents allow their children to wear sloppy clothes and jeans to special events such as weddings and funerals , rather than appropriate clothing . <p> 4 . SEND A MESSAGE OF SYMPATHY . It is often awkward to know what to say to a parent , spouse , or other immediate family member when someone passes away . Its always nice to send a message of sympathy , whether by email , fax , or by regular mail . It shows you care and are sympathetic . <p> Unless you are part of the family and are extremely close , do not call them especially between the death of their loved one and any service or event being planned . It is an extremely stressful period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less intrusive . <p> When expressing your feelings , be genuine with your words . Do not sound like you are using " canned " phrases copied from a commercially printed sympathy card . Among the phrases to avoid are : <p> Its awful , but when your time is up , its up <p> I know how you feel <p> Be sure to stay busy , they say it is the best way through this <p> At least he went peacefully <p> Know that he s in a better place now <p> You must stay strong through this <p> This was probably a blessing in disguise rather than to continue suffering <p> At least he is no longer in pain <p> Its truly sad he died so young <p> Only the good die young <p> 5 . SEND A GIFT OR CONTRIBUTION . Historically flowers have been the tradition to send to bereaved familys home or funeral home , today if you wish to express your feelings beyond a written message of sympathy , do not automatically send flowers for the funeral or a live plant for the persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family member to confirm this is something they will prefer and enjoy . Many people now choose donations to their favorite charities , over flowers . <p> 6 . RESPECT THE FAMILYS WISHES . Do not criticize the process leading up to the funeral or the event itself . Rituals and styles have shifted in recent years whereby they are not as formal or ritualistic as in the " old days . " Families may choose not to adhere to certain historic customs . Focus on the positive aspects , not the negative . <p> 7 . OBSERVE CULTURAL , RELIGIOUS , AND OTHER PRACTICES . When invited to an observance for someone who is from a culture or faith with which you are less familiar , ask someone about it or go on the web to learn what will be taking place during the event and what you may be expected to do . Doing research will help you be more relaxed and comfortable when certain practices take place . By knowing ahead of time you can participate and enjoy the experience more fully . <p> 8 . BRINGING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a funeral , brief them ahead of time about the importance of what they are attending . Set aside practice time to learn how to whisper and sit quietly for long periods of time ; to demonstrate to you that they are matured enough to attend this important event . Bottom-line is if your child is unable to whisper or sit quietly for 45-60 minutes at home , it may be best to hire a babysitter for a few hours , rather than cause disturbances at the event . <p> Question : What other items do you have to add to this list ?

I began to dread the question , " How are you ? " The answer was obvious I was n't very good , but most people do n't  want to hear that . Also , in those emotionally charged days I never knew if I could get the answer out without falling apart . One day I bumped into an acquaintance , who had lost her husband a few months ahead of me , and she said , " I am very glad to see you , " while touching my forearm gently . It occured to me that I did not have to say anything except , " thank you . " I now use that phrase when I see people who have lost loved ones . <p> Understanding proper etiquette to console someone who is grieving is an important attribute to have . People will be born and people will die and learning what is appropriate can help console others in a time of loss . My favorite tip is to turn off your cell phone . One way to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give full and undivided attention . I truly appreciate friends who have dropped everything to help me when I have grieved over losses in my life . <p> i am 81 years oldi am going to a funeral for my wifes 1st cousin.the funeral will be in peoria arizona and the temperature will be in the 100s .. i can not stand the heat.is it proper to wear black dress pants , black shoes and a white collared short sleeve shirt ? js <p> Jerry : Black dress pants , black shoes , and a white collared short sleeve shirt with a blazer jacket or suit jacket would be fine . The key is you should wear a jacket during the actual service ; however , during the reception that may follow is fine to then take the jacket off . I 've only seen it in Hawaii might you not wear a jacket and short sleeves . Then perhaps wearing a tie in lieu of a jacket would be appropriate . <p> Jerry , I know the time has long since passed , but my advice to anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your white shirt , black/navy dress pants , and black shoes would be fine . You might consider a tie . The family will be grateful that you attended , and no one wants you to become i 'll or faint . <p> Thanks for the information ! My friends mom died a few days ago , so I 'm going to her funeral to support my friend and his family . I 've never been to a funeral before , so I 'm not sure about what the protocol is for attendees . Respecting cultural and religious practices during a funeral is a very good point . My friends family practice Buddhism , so it seems like a good idea to find out if there 's anything that I should know about ceremonial practices to avoid offending anyone . <p> I thought all these etiquette tips were very appropriate . I think respecting the familys wishes is on the top of the list . Everyone grieves differently and each family views a funeral differently and so communication of support is so important . These are are a good reminder for me . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral service . I have yet to be one but I 'm sure that it would be very respectful to pay my respects with simple things . Such as giving the a small gift or just expressing my sympathy to the family . <p> This may sound odd , but I collect vintage handkerchiefs , and when I greet the widow or mother , etc , of the deceased , I press a clean , pressed , beautiful hankie into her hand . Its much nicer than the wadded up tissue she is probably holding , and its a reminder of my sympathy for her . <p> As a parent who has lost a child , I can positively tell you that it DOES NOT matter what you wear . Do you think I even remotely remember what someone was wearing at my sons funeral ? ? ? The ONLY thing that mattered to me was you had the decency to come . Do I remember you being there , probably not . <p> Tammie : I understand your comment having attended both my parents funerals . I suppose the perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event and to everyone attending . I know for a fact people do notice , including the bereaved . Thanks for writing . <p> Karen : Whenever I am seek information , the Internet is always a great place to start . Also , its fine to ask someone from that culture about what will be appropriate to wear and what will be taking place at the service . In many cultures wearing bright colors , especially red , is " not " as appropriate . Personally , I would wear neutral , solid colors , including medium blues , grays , or black . In the Asian culture , white is the color of death . <p> My Wife and I will be attending a Funeral of her work Colleague Partner . All I have is a grey suit white shirt and a black ties with black shoes . Is that going to be okay or should i go and buy a black suite . <p> I think the tips are great but honestly . I think you wear what you can within reason . I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had were jeans and cowboy boots . Who cares what you wear really ? You 're there to pay respects to the dead and support the living left behind . I agree do n't  show up in a bikini but do n't  go broke buying an entirely new outfit that is just silly . Maybe I am less judgmental than most but I think the fact that you show up to any funeral at all means that the person who died meant something to you or their family did . Dress as appropriately as possible but do n't  stress over it . <p> Rene : I do agree with your comments . However , in many instances , people where clothes without any respect or care in situations they could have cared better . What then is of equal importance is to wear clean and neat clothes , not something that is dirty or tattered . <p> Preparing your children is probably for the services sounds like a really good idea . At a young age , they may not fully grasp what is going on with the ceremony . Helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you and everyone around you during the services . Thanks for posting these great tips for everyone to see . <p> Being observant of religious customs is really important if you ask me . What I would do is maybe prepare a little bit by doing some research and getting an idea of what to expect . This way , there wont be any shocking parts of the ceremony that you werent prepared for . Thanks for posting these awesome tips ! <p> A family member attended calling hours for the sister of my grandmother . She was very upset because after standing in line by the casket for a very long time , she was never approached by the family . She was caught standing there for so long because the line had been held up . From what I had been told the bereaving family held conversations with other people and even skipped her in line to talk to other people . Relations had been strained between my grandmother and sister so these two sides of the families had never mixed . She left feeling snubbed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? Should she feel snubbed or should she approach this with the mindset that she went to support the family but something happened , a misunderstanding for example ? What kind of mindset should someone have when attending calling hours ? <p> Katherine : Regrettably do not have any comment about how to approach this situation . I cant say whether your family member should or should not feel snubbed . This much I can say is some things are best left alone and should not cause any further anxiety . However , if this is something you can not leave alone , the best approach is to call someone who knows all parties involved to share your feelings and ask for advice . As to the mindset for anyone attending a wake or calling hours , it should be with all the best memories and feelings of the deceased . <p> On Wednesday , I will be attending my cousins funeral , which will be the first one that I have ever attended . I would love to send a gift to his family , but I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do n't  last very long . What are other common things that are given as gifts at funerals ? <p> Faylinn : Gifts for funerals are guided by the culture of the deceased . In some cultures a donation to the deceased favorite charity is welcomed ; others give flowers ; and others give even money to help with funeral expenses . What is most universally appropriate is a note/card to share in your sorrow over the loss of your friend/relative . When in doubt , you can ask a relative or good friend what would be most appropriate . 190397 @qwx810397 190429 @qwx810429 
@@83772913 @5272913/ <p> Imagine this : Your party guests will be arriving in 20 minutes , and you 're not worried . All is ready ... and you 're feeling pretty smug about it , too . The house is clean and the atmosphere you 've created is warm and friendly . The chocolate mousse is in the freezer . The salad is crisping in the refrigerator . The hors d'oeuvre are in the oven and all the other foods are in serving trays and bowls . You 're dressed , not stressed . <p> You have time to relax , perhaps have your first glass of wine , and look forward to spending time with the people you 've invited over . <p> What 's the secret ? . Party planning ! <p> In May , 2004 , I was invited to speak about cocktail party planning and etiquette at the luxury five-diamond resort Ritz-Carlton , Half Moon Bay ( **41;489;TOOLONG ) for their " Summer School " workshop series . A number of subscribers wrote me saying they were unable to attend this event , but were interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high season for informal barbeques and other types of parties---I offer the following tips as adapted and originally presented by my mentor and friend , Dorothea Johnson , Founder and Director of The Protocol School of Washington , in her booklet titled , " Entertaining with Ease &amp; Elegance . " The result of following these tips : a terrific party and a host who can enjoy it ! <p> Plan ahead.Organize everything ahead of time as much as you can so you will be free to enjoy your guests and have fun at your own party . A " To Do " list is indispensable . Start your list as soon as you decide to entertain . Think through everything from the party style to your guest list to your menu . Then , order the tasks as they need to happen . Always allow more time than your whole plan could possibly require . That way , if any step takes longer than expected , you 'll have leeway . <p> Make a manageable menu.Plan a menu that will need the least possible attention after your guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stove capacity . If you plan a party that requires multiple uses of the stove and you have only one oven , it 's not going to work . If you have only one refrigerator , beware of trying to cram in your salad , vegetables , and dessert all at once . It 's a matter of juggling and balancing your space . <p> Cook in advance.Select items that can hold well in the oven , in the refrigerator , or on the table . Do n't concentrate on impressing guests with individual dishes and overlook the enjoyment of the party as a whole . Do as much as you can before the party day so you 'll be relaxed and with your guests , not in the kitchen . <p> Practice.If you 've planned to make a new recipe for your party , try it out first to avoid any surprises . At least a day ahead , do a dress rehearsal of the table and seating arrangements you plan to use . Label each serving piece and place it on the serving table for fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party , organize them in the refrigerator or preparation area in the order you 'll need them . <p> Do n't blow the budget.Fancy food is not the key to a successful party , it 's hospitality , presentation , and attention to a few details . Planning ahead often results in saving money , because you will have time to look for sales on items you want to serve . You 'll enjoy your party more when it is designed within your means , even if it 's just a good bowl of nuts , cheese , and fruit . <p> Use what you have . Personal expression is the primary guideline for today 's table settings . Tableware need n't match and centerpieces do n't have to be flowers . Let your imagination soar and use what 's on hand . Traditional rules for using matched china , crystal , and silver no longer apply . <p> Work out traffic patterns.Consider all seating and walking patterns . Try out every chair you expect a guest to sit on and walk every path you expect a guest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try out the floor space yourself . For larger parties , spread refreshments around to keep people moving around . Place food in different rooms of the house and drinks in possibly two locations , at opposite ends of the house . <p> Decide in advance what to wear.It 's best to let your guests know the event style , so they may dress accordingly . Prevent surprises by telling your guests on the invitation if it 's casual , informal , black-tie , or to bring their swimsuits . Know what you 're going to wear and discuss and coordinate your outfit with that of your partner or spouse ( and children ) so you wo n't look like the odd couple ( See May Tip for an image ) . <p> Brief your helpers.Whether your partner helps or you are hiring some helpers , be sure to go over your plan together . Make a written to-do list for all duties and tasks , including a timetable so everyone will know what is expected . Have extra help arrive an hour ahead of guests to direct them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they will need to do their work well . They ca n't guess where extra plates are stored . Again , your to-do list is key to success . <p> Avoid being rushed.Do n't let haste be your enemy . Haste can tire , irritate , and generally lead to an unpleasant party . If you find yourself rushing when you start to serve , slow down and count to ten . Despite all your advanced work , sometimes a party simply takes on a life of its own . Only you know everything you planned for the party . If something does n't happen exactly as planned , you may just want to smile and enjoy the event as it unfolds . <p> BONUS : After everyone 's gone.Take the load off your feet and relax . Perhaps finally enjoy that second glass of wine . Do a mental review of all that transpired throughout the party . Open the gifts you received from guests and marked upon their arrival . Make a list of those you plan to write thank-you notes . Use this time to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did well . Be mindful of the items you can do better next time . <p> Although it is said , " practice makes perfect , " it is as another saying states , " The road to success is never finished . " Never stress out over what could have been ... just enjoy each experience to the fullest and know there will always be another time to practice again . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

Start developing new good habits on etiquette today and by summer you will have changed how you do things and act toward others forever . <p> Start today . Studies have shown that you must practice new skills for 21 days to develop a new pattern . It will take about 100 days for a new pattern to become an automatic habit . <p> Choose your changes . Pick two or three etiquette adjustments you want to master during this Spring Cleaning period . If you need ideas , review the past " Etiquette Tip of the Month " articles sent over these past two years or dedicate some time to read one of the hundreds of self-help , personal , or professional development books you 've collected for years .

Find creative ways to remind yourself of what you 've pledged to work on for the next three months : Keep the list visible on your desk , on the refrigerator , or on your bulletin board as a constant guide . Write your goals on sticky notes and place the notes on your April and May calendars . Code your computer calendar to remind you of your Spring Cleaning commitments on various days for the next 12 weeks . <p> Do it .

It is considered rude and a sign of bad luck . <p> Instead you are to leave your chopsticks on the chopstick holder. - You may also leave it resting diagonally on the plate , which is perhaps closest to western etiquette . Do not drop your chopsticks ; it is considered bad luck . <p> Sticking your chopsticks straight up in your rice bowl is rude , since they will resemble the joss sticks used in religious ceremonies . <p> 8. - Business is not generally discussed during a meal. - Good topics of conversation include Chinese art , food , and sights .

Small toasts among two or three guests are also appropriate . It does n't  always have to be among the entire table . You can toast with soft drinks , tea , or the brandy , wine or beer you might have . <p> Toasts are performed with the utmost respect using both hands around the cup or glass , raised to shoulder height , make eye contact with the host and all , smile , and taking a sip or " bottoms up , " similar as in Western culture . - If one hand is used it must only be the right hand and the Chinese do not typically clink glasses . <p> 10 .

Each November Americans commemorate the bounty of our nation and our lives , by spending a day of appreciation , called Thanksgiving . <p> Along with enjoying football games and a holiday feast , this November I suggest you take time to send at least eight ( . remember it 's a good luck number ) quick and simple thank-you notes . Show your appreciation and thankfulness to someone you know for whatever " gift " they 've given you . <p> A gift can be many things : a physical item , a good job someone has done for you at work or at home , and an invitation to a party or meal .

It takes the most effort and time and is the most tangible evidence of our genuine appreciation of the person to whom it is addressed . <p> Here is a simple guide for thank-you notes for both business and personal use : <p> Ideally , send thank-you notes within 24 to 48 hours of receiving the gift . The sooner you send it , the greater the impact it will have . However , it is never too late to send a note . Use this month of " thanks " to catch up on your " thank-yous , " no matter how much time has gone by . <p> To save time and stress , keep a supply of note cards and stationery , plus postage stamps to have ready at all times . <p> Write all your notes by hand .

I ca n't tell you how many times I receive cards written on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For vertical , left-creased cards : Begin writing on the inner , right side of the folded card . <p> For horizontal , top-creased cards : Begin writing on the inner , lower side of the folded card . <p> Some cards are difficult to tell which way it is intended to face . Be sure to look at the back side of the card for guidance in this area . <p> Begin the note based on your relationship with the receiver . <p> For personal correspondence where you are accustomed to calling the person by their first name : Dear John and Mary , ( first name followed by a " comma . " ) is correct . <p> For business notes , stick to formal salutations until you are invited to address the person by the first name : Dear Ms Smith : ( an honorific and last name , followed by a " colon .

When thanking someone for inviting you to a meal or event , mention how happy you were to share in the experience , mention a person you enjoyed meeting , or a food item you particularly liked . When thanking someone for performing a favor for you , explain how important their gift of time was for you . For physical gifts , name the item , along with something nice and complimentary about it . <p> Rather than say : " Dear Aunt Sarah , Thank you for the lovely gift . I really like it . Love , Syndi .

It 's just the perfect item to wear at an evening occasion , where I want to stay warm , yet still look dressy .

@@83772923 @5272923/ <p> This months tip was suggested by Marilyn D. Johnson of IBM Corporation . Like many busy people around the world , Ms Johnson regularly participates in conference calls as a viable alternative to traveling for in-person meetings . She asked me about the commonly accepted codes of conduct and behaviorconference call etiquetteto ensure everyone feels at ease and produces a successful meeting . My main response is that participating in a telephone- or video-conference call is much like attending an in-person meeting , with a few twists . <p> PARTICIPANTS1 . Synchronize Your Watches : Our individual clocks are not synchronized . Bookmark and use the world clock at http : **33;658;TOOLONG as your official time piece when scheduling all your tele- and video-conference calls . Make every effort to be on time . Set your alarm at least 10-15 minutes before the conference call is to begin . <p> 2 . Use a Land Line : Avoid using a cell phone if at all possible . Technology is not up-to-speed in providing clear , uninterrupted transmission . If you must use a cell phone and are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole into which sounds are transmitted and keep it there throughout the call . When speaking , make every effort to keep your comments brief . Listening to someone speaking over cell phones for any length of time can be tiresome . <p> 3 . Keep Technology Simple : Disengage the call waiting , on-hold music , and other telephone special features that may disrupt the meeting . Place a small note on your telephone to turn these features back on when the call is completed . <p> 4 . Use a Headset : As a single participant , avoid using a speaker phone . The voice quality and clicking sounds caused by turning on and off the mute feature or picking up and lowering your telephone handset to engage the speaker is annoying . Holding a handset for a long period of time is tiring . The best way to enjoy long conference calls is a headset . It reduces the ambient noise in the room and leaves your hands free for taking notes . <p> 5 . Organize Your Materials : Ready yourself for a conference call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Review the agenda and ready all materials ahead of time . Formulate your questions , ideas , suggestions , and comments and jot them down for the meeting . Contact the facilitator to confirm meeting goals and objectives . Gather the supplies you will need for the meeting such as a pen and paper , a printed copy of the agenda , beverage , and the telephone number and codes you must call . <p> 6 . Prepare for the Long Haul : Just as for an in-person meeting , stop your work in advance and be sure to visit the rest room . An extra step necessary for a conference call : Place a sign on your door or cubicle so others will not disturb you during this time . For video calls , avoid wearing a heavily patterned shirt or tie , clean your desk , and be sure the area behind you is not distracting to those watching . <p> 7 . Remain Professional : Speak professionally at all times . Be sure to introduce yourself before speaking each time . Control yourself from using slang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your in-person business meetingsas they rarely work as well on the telephone . <p> 8 . Stay Focused : Its easy to be distracted during a conference call . Avoid the temptation to check email or do any other work while attending this meeting . Be attentive to the flow of the agenda and discussions , just as in an in-person meeting . You never know when you may be called upon for your thoughts . However , avoid making any audible sounds , such as " yeah , hmm , huh ? , a-huh " during the course of the call . Remain as silent as possible while other participants are speaking . <p> 9 . Announce Your Arrival and Departure : If you come in late to the call , be sensitive and listen first to what is being said before interrupting to announce your arrival . Wait until a convenient break in the conversation or agenda item to introduce yourself with minimal extra commentary as to why you were delayed . If you must leave the call early , let the facilitator and group know at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict . When actually leaving say " Its Syndi and I 'm leaving the call now . " If you re-enter , announce yourself only at an appropriate interval , otherwise , remain silent . <p> GUEST SPEAKERS:Special Guests Have Special Tasks : If you are a presenter or guest speaker on a telephone- or video- conference call Confirm with the facilitator when you will appear on the agenda and how long you will be given to present your portion of the meeting . <p> Provide the facilitator with a copy of your main talking points plus any background reading materials well in advance for distribution to all participants for review . <p> Be among the first participants on the conference call , just as you would at an in-person meeting . <p> As you go through your items , call attention to the page number or item you are discussing , one by one . <p> FACILITATORS A conference call facilitator , moderator , or leader needs to take charge of the entire meetingbefore , during , and after the call . <p> 1 . Schedule Participants : Set a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty-four hours before the meeting , confirm the agenda and specific guidelines for the call . Let all participants know who else will be in on the call . <p> 2 . Make Everyone Techno-savvy : If someone has not participated in a conference call previously , be sure to review both the mechanics and the etiquette involved . Give all participants the telephone number , and explain to them how the call will work , and who to contact if it does n't  . It is especially important to explain how to use the mute feature for the call . For most telephone systems this is either a *6 or #6 to mute and un-mute your telephone . <p> 3 . Create the Agenda : Prepare and distribute an agenda and other background reading materials to all participants for review and comments . Try not to cover too many topics in any one agenda . As with all meetings , the best policy is to use the KISSS method and keep it simple , short , and sweet . Its better to hold several short meetings than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of items , just as in an in-person meeting . For calls much longer than 60 minutes , schedule appropriate quick breaks for everyone to take a stretch and leave the call for a moment . <p> 4 . Arrive Early : As with an in-person meeting , arrive at the meeting ahead of other participants . For conference calls , about 3 minutes ahead of the scheduled time . <p> 5 . Make Introductions : As the first order of business , conduct a role call by having all participants introduce themselves . Unless you are sure everyone knows everyones voices , request that each person identify themselves each time before speaking . If new callers enter the call late , at an appropriate break in the discussion , ask new callers to introduce themselves . Depending on the specific conference calling system you are using , explain how you want people who wish to speak to identify themselves , such as a flag via email or simply waiting for the appropriate break in the previous persons comments . <p> 6 . Keep Up the Pace : Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , calling attention to every page number or agenda item you are about to discuss . Be clear in your introduction to each section as to whether it will be an interactive time or a listening time where all participants should be muting their telephones for best listening . <p> 7 . Get Everyone Involved : When you notice certain participants are not contributing , request comments from them by name , such as , " Susie , we have n't heard your views , what do you think ? " <p> 8 . Stick to the Agenda : Manage the timing of each item on the agenda . Reel in those participants who get off point . If you are getting close to the end of the scheduled time , but not the end of the agenda , you must stop and consult with your participants . Make an educated guess on how much more time you need . Ask all participants if they are available to meet longer . If not , be prepared to reschedule . <p> 9 . Signoff with Style : At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and next steps with reminders of all due dates , and thank everyone for participating . <p> 10 . Raise your hand : For video and group conference calls , a way to avoid everyone speaking at once is to request participants to raise their hand and be acknowledged before speaking . <p> SHARE THESE TIPS : To receive a FREE , nicely formatted copy of this months tip to forward to others or print out and provide for your office , email us at **35;693;TOOLONG <p> BLOG QUESTION OF THE MONTH : What pet peeves or uncomfortable situations are in your workplace that prevents you from fully enjoying your job ?

It 's inconvenient and sometimes it seems down right rude , but its also part of work . Should I say something ? What 's the protocol on printer use ? Also , who should replace the toner and paper when the machine runs out ? <p> RESPONSE : Most importantly , anyone sharing office equipment must use it with the utmost respect , care , and courtesy , and also be sensitive to the needs of others . Remember , if you expect everyone with whom you work to clean up after themselves , you must model that behavior yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Photocopy Multiples . If you have a big print job , perhaps requiring more than ten copies of more than five pages each , consider printing one set and photocopying the rest . Photocopiers are typically faster and less costly to operate than printers . The efficient worker makes every effort to plan ahead in sending large print jobs to the photocopy department for duplication . <p> Schedule Around Others . If you must send a large job to the printer , try to schedule it when your co-workers go to lunch , or on a break , so you can complete your work uninterrupted . <p> Breakup Large Print Jobs . When you must complete a large job during prime work time , break up the large job by printing 25 copies at a time , allowing co-workers to print their work between sets . Overall , let small print jobs take precedence over large print jobs . <p> Know Who Is In Charge . Designate an attendant , and have it be part of their job responsibilities , to restock the paper shelf and other equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when repairs are required . <p> Establish a Supply System . Do your part in maintaining the supplies needed to operate the machines . Decide as a group that the printer should never be left empty of an ample supply of paper in all bins , and that everyone understands the system . As a reminder , mark the last ream of paper with a large marking pen : " LAST REAM ! Contact ( name ) at ( extension number ) to restock shelf " and remind everyone to contact the attendant when they open that ream . Depending on the needs of your company , you may want to mark the last two reams . <p> Know Basic Maintenance . Every person using shared equipment should be trained on how to use it properly and to take care of everyday situations , such as how to un-jam the machine , replenish paper bins , and , as appropriate , replace the toner cartridge . <p> Leave the Machine Operable . If the machine stalls or jams , or an indicator light appears , take time to undo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before leaving the machine . Never leave a machine in an inoperable state without letting others know . <p> Avoid Wasting Paper . When using letterhead , colored paper , or any other type of specialty paper , be sure to remove all extra sheets before leaving the machine . Leave the bins with an ample supply of plain white paper . <p> BONUS : Keep It Clean . Avoid eating , drinking , or setting food and drinks near the printer . Accidents can happen . <p> NOTE : If you would like an authorized FREE copy of the above guidelines to post near your shared printer , please email me at **26;730;TOOLONG and we 'll be happy to send you a copy , suitable for framing . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

When it comes to shaking hands , I believe in the law of the draw in the Old West ... whoever extends their hand first is the winner . It should be you , regardless of being a man or woman . ( See the March 2003 tip on Shaking Hands : A critical factor in giving a good first impression ... or not ? as a reminder on proper hand shaking techniques . ) <p> Rehearse your introduction . Plan the best way to briefly describe yourself and the products and services you provide , from a benefit-and-results basis . Avoid long , technical descriptions that simply tell the person boring facts as well as the sales pitch approach . Instead , make the tone a friendly yet informative conversation . <p> Make business card exchanges meaningful . The " speed dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hello , my name is Jane Smith , have a card . " Instead , only exchange cards with someone when it will be of benefit to both of you . There are two basic reasons to give someone your card : when the other person asks for one or when you offer assistance with something they want or need and want them to follow-up with you . After giving them your card , then ask for their contact information . <p> Enter group conversations sensitively . When entering a group , approach and stand quietly for a second or two . Wait for a break in the conversation or for someone in the group to look your way . If no one looks in your direction and everyone continues the conversation without any break or glance in your direction , exit immediately with " excuse me . " It is apparent they are in a heavy conversation , not choosing to invite anyone else into the conversation . <p> Exit conversations politely . Even if you are face-to-face with someone you 've wanted to meet at this event , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolized by someone else , as well . After a reasonable time , exchanging some meaningful information , comfortably move from the conversation by saying , " Please excuse me , I 've enjoyed speaking with you . " Then smile and move on . <p> Introduce yourself to tablemates . When being seated at a large table , go around the table to introduce yourself before taking a seat . Choose a seat on the opposite side of the person(s) youve just met , leaving seats on either side of you vacant , to be filled by other arriving guests . This way you will comfortably meet everyone at the table . <p> AFTER THE EVENT <p> Follow-up with new acquaintances . The key to successful networking is to show you are interested in the people you meet . For the most impact , sending a personal handwritten note---by regular mail , within 24 to 48 hours---to every person you met and reconnected with at a networking opportunity is the best . Emailing and placing a personal telephone call is also appropriate , including writing or calling someone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfill any promises you made to people you 've met . . <p> Get permission before sharing contact information . Check-in with someone before you share their contact information , even when you think you are doing someone a great favor . In instances where I have gained overall permission to share someones information , I send both parties an email , stating : " By copy this message to both of you , I am referring Jane Doe to John Smith , in hopes you two may be of service to each other by . " Then I include full contact information on both people . This way everyone is fully informed of the situation . <p> or sending us an email with their name and e-mail address .

@@83772929 @5272929/ <p> With the holidays just around the corner , now is the time to begin preparations for all those upcoming parties . Your first step to successful entertaining is a properly extended invitation . Keep these tips in mind if you plan to entertain this autumn and winter : and whenever you plan to entertain . <p> TIMINGFor those special events , such as weddings and when guests must travel , do extend invitations about 60 days in advance . Extend invitations to formal events at least 30 days in advance . For informal get-togethers less notice is acceptable , about two to three weeks should suffice , although more notice is practical , especially if the party is planned during the busy holiday season . <p> METHODThe best parties begin the moment the guest receives their invitation . Take care in choosing the style and method in which you plan to notify your guests . The invitation should reflect the style of the event : Special and formal events traditionally require written invitations sent via regular mail , although it is increasingly popular to use the various on-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal events . Invitations to informal events can be extended via telephone , email , fax , on-line services , or postal mail . <p> CONTENTSWhether you plan to extend the invitation in writing or orally , be sure to include all pertinent information . If inviting over the telephone , jot down your facts and read it so you 'll be sure to remember everything . <p> All invitations should contain : <p> Who : <p> The hosts of the partyJohn and Mary Jones request the pleasure of your company <p> What : <p> Purpose of partyat a Holiday Dinner Party <p> Date : <p> Both the day and date are helpfulon Friday , December 12 , 2003 <p> Time : <p> Start and ending times7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m . <p> Location : <p> Specific site of the eventAt home 123 Terrific Lane San Francisco <p> Attire : <p> Any special information that will make your guests comfortableInformal Evening Attire <p> Response : <p> How and by what date to respond and to whomYour kind response is appreciated by Monday , December 1 to Jane Smith 415-123-4567 or Jane@whatever.com @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Acceptances Only . Despite your best intentions , these phrases rarely work as desired . Guests should know they must respond to all personal invitations ( See Etiquette Tip of the Month on the RSVP ) . <p> ADDRESSESWhile it is tempting to utilize ever-increasing technology and use database-generated labels on social and business invitations , you should avoid this practice at all cost ! Write invitations by hand or give the appearance of having each envelope personally handwritten or nicely typewritten through your printer . <p> Traditional etiquette for formal invitations states that each word be spelled out completely on your invitations , including Street , Apartment , and state name . <p> Be mindful of using the proper honorific when sending invitations and addressing the envelope . Honorific and proper titles can be abbreviated , such as Mr. , Ms. , Mrs. , and Dr. For doctors , use M.D. or Ph.D . on the envelope and Dr. in the salutation , never both . <p> When addressing an envelope to a couple with one person having a higher rank and status than the other , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other person . For example , Senator Dianne Feinstein would go on the top line above her husband , Mr. Richard Blum . <p> Couples with the same last name can be addressed together as Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jefferson . Couples with different last names may be listed on one line as Mr. Ron Hildebrand and Ms. Syndi Seid or on two separate lines as Ms. Syndi Seid ( next line ) Mr. Ron Hildebrand . Unmarried couples are listed on two separate lines . If you are not sure of marital status , list the names on separate lines . <p> EXTRA GUESTSUnless an invitation indicates a guest is included , only the person listed on the invitation is to attend ... Hint , hint : uninvited guests are NOT to attend . As the host , if you welcome a single friend or family member bringing a guest , and do not know that persons name , add " and Guest " so the primary invited person will know they may extend the invitation on your behalf . <p> When sending a formal invitation with both an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primary invited person at that address only , with the inner envelope stating , " Mr. John Jones and Guest " . <p> For an informal party , address the outer envelope to include the invited person only . Add a handwritten note to the invitation extending the invitation to a guest . Just as guests should never assume they may bring an uninvited guest , the host should never assume the primary invited person will know they are welcome to bring a guest , unless the invitation is extended . <p> Happy Hosting ! <p> I hope this helps address the basics on party invitations .

@@83772932 @5272932/ <p> Each year people ask me what 's appropriate when giving holiday gifts . I tell them gift giving should come from the heart . Although our customs and culture have created occasions where gifts appear to be required , you should never feel obligated to give a gift . Instead , view gift giving as a way give joy and show your love and appreciation . <p> I was recently asked to comment on whether tipping someone during the holiday season was an appropriate act . To me , tipping is a gratuity provided for services rendered . You give it immediately at the conclusion of receiving the service , such as tipping your hairdresser , waiter , or bellman . While it is fine to give your regular hairdresser an extra tip during your December appointment , you may want to be more cautious when giving an extra tip to your favorite waiter . Many restaurants pool their tips and they are divided equally among the staff . Thus , your favorite waiter may not get the full tip you intended . <p> Give someone a well thought-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shows how much you care to have gone that extra step . A gift can be as simple as a handwritten note or letter , sent by regular mail . Gifts need not be elaborate or costly , just something from the heart . <p> From a psychological viewpoint , the act of giving gifts is part of our human interaction with others . It defines and strengthens our relationships with family , friends and business associates . Psychologists have discovered that often the giver derives even more pleasure than the receiver . <p> Have you ever wondered how the practice of gift giving began ? It has been practiced for thousands of years . One of the earliest known forms of gift-giving , stems back to a practice known as the " potlatch . " <p> According to Wikipedia , " The potlatch is a festival or ceremony practiced among indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of the United States . At these gatherings a family or hereditary leader hosts a feast for guests in their family 's house . The main purpose of the potlatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any given family is raised not by who has the most resources , but by who distributes the most resources . " <p> Receiving a gift creates a sense of excitement and a glow of appreciation . Just thinking about the times Ive received gifts brings a smile and warm feeling in me . Think about it yourself and I 'm sure a similar smile and glow will arrive . But the biggest kick I get is when someone tells me my gift is appreciated . It reinforces my feelings for the person , makes me feel happy , and rejuvenates my friendship and relationship with that person . <p> A Holiday Activity Throughout December , be in touch with people you care about . Take these three simple steps : <p> Make a list of eight ( a good luck number for Chinese ) people whom you would like to contact before years end . Include someone youve not been in contact with much all year , or someone living far away . <p> Bring to work some nice stationery and take one lunch period---instead of simply doing nothing---to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Address an envelope ; affix the correct postage stamps , and mail it . <p> I promise if you do this , it will not only light yourself , it will surely light up the person who receives your note or letter , to know you cared enough to take the time to write . <p> Heres wishing you and yours a wonderful holiday season .

@@83772933 @5272933/ <p> First , a special thank you to Greg Dalton for submitting the suggestion to write about proper introductions . It is a subject I am asked about often ; yet to fully discuss it , can get a bit involved . Therefore , to keep within the style intended for this publication - brief , fun , and educational - this month 's tip is only the core of proper introductions . For additional information on international , country specific , and diplomatic situations , please contact me with your questions and I 'll be happy to address them . <p> When performing introductions , here 's what I call my 2-step golden rule to proper business introductions : <p> Step 1 : <p> The first person 's name you say is always the most important person . <p> Step 2 : <p> Thereafter , everyone else 's name is introduced to that most important person . <p> ALWAYS say the most important person 's name first . In business rank and status are the primary determinants to who takes precedence over whom . Gender and age are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet " when introducing people . For example , read the following sentence and tell me who 's the CFO and who is the newly hired staff member . " Jane Doe , I would like you to meet John Smith . " <p> Which person is the most important person in this sentence ? Who sounds like the most important person ? Is Jane or John the CFO ? <p> We just learned the most important person is the first person . Yet by the way this sentence reads , it appears John is the more important person of the two . So who 's the CFO ? <p> When you use the word " meet " to introduce someone , you will always throw the emphasis off toward to the wrong person , thereby falling out of protocol for a proper business introduction . In my mind , throw that " m-word " out of your default brain and mental dictionary of proper introductions . <p> Rather , for an informal introduction , use the words " this is " as the bridge between saying the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jane Doe this is John Smith , our new staff member . Jane Doe is our CFO . " <p> REMEMBER : Be careful not to get too wordy when using the word " introduce . " For instance , which of these three sentences are correct ? <p> A ) <p> Jane Doe may I introduce John Smith <p> B ) <p> Ms. Doe may I introduce to you Mr. Smith <p> C ) <p> Jane Doe may I introduce you to John Smith . <p> ANSWER : A is correct and best by using the fewest words ; B is correct although wordy ; C is not correct , because by switching the words " to you " to " you to " you have again thrown the emphasis onto the wrong person . <p> Other reminders : <p> <p> Keep the forms of the address equal . If you use Ms. Doe , you must use Mr. Smith . You should not say , " Jane Doe this is Mr. Smith . " <p> <p> In regular situations , it is best to use both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To use only a first name is not introducing the total person . <p> <p> Do say something about the people you are introducing so they will have something from which to springboard their own conversation . Then you may excuse yourself to meet and greet others . <p> BONUS TIP : Whenever introducing dignitaries and other notable people , such as elected officials , you may want to use the word " present " instead of the words " this is " or " introduce . " It is the style most often used in diplomatic and international arenas . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

@@83772936 @5272936/ <p> People ask me during my etiquette workshops whether I conduct seminars on ethics , thinking it is much the same thing . While these are related concepts , there is a distinction between ethics and etiquette , especially as they relate to decision making in business and in society . <p> As defined in The American Heritage Dictionary of The English Language , Third edition : <p> Ethic ( n ) 1. a . A set of principles of right conduct . b . A theory or a system of moral values . 2. ethics . The rules or standards governing the conduct of a person or the members of a profession . <p> Etiquette ( n ) . The practices and forms prescribed by social convention or by authority .

To use proper etiquette means you are familiar with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , culture , and society . In businessas in lifeyour decisions should take into account the thought processes surrounding both ethics and etiquette . <p> " To do the right thing begins with thinking rightly , " say authors Robert Solomon and Kristine Hanson in their book , Its Good Business ( 1985 , Antheneum , New York ) .

Although it is good to follow both the Golden Rule and new Platinum Rule* , it is equally important not to sacrifice your own beliefs .

Whatever level of business in which you work---and the larger your company---being involved in your community is the right thing to do . <p> Follow your morals . Morals and concerns with the judgment of the goodness or badness of human action and character are the foundation of ethics , along with considering the well-being of others . German philosopher Immanuel Kant called morals " categorical imperatives . " They are the " unqualified commands " without exception , even for busy executives on the brink of a profitable deal . <p> Think objectively .

" Peter Drucker summarizes business ethics as " being able to look at your face in the mirror in the morning . " <p> Respect other customs , but not at the expense of your own ethics . The hardest ethical decisions are not typically a conflict between ethics and profits , but one between two ethical systems . Sure , " when in Rome ... " is a good guideline in most instances , but when a custom violates your morals , it is best to stick to what you know . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426 
@@83772937 @5272937/ <p> People have been going to the movies since 1897 , yet sadly there is still a need to write about this topic . Feel free to spread this Etiquette Tip far and wide . Perhaps my two cents will make a difference to the movie-going public . <p> What 's the first thing you think I will say about Movie Theater Etiquette ? It is the first thing nearly everyone mentions to me as their biggest pet peeve <p> 1 . You guessed it , Turn off your cell phone . I can not except any excuse for a ringing cell phone at any event OR MEETING ( and that goes for pagers and alarm watches , too ) . Even the most inexpensive phones can be turned to " vibrate " or " meeting mode " with just a couple of steps . Theater managers post signs and present cute on-screen reminders . Everyone just needs to get in the habit . Please . here 's my tip for those rare occasions when you must take a call while at the movies or similar situation : When it vibrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cease the ringing . You immediately whisper , " One moment please . " That 's itnothing else . Do not say " Hello , " as that will prompt your caller to begin talking . After you exit the theater resume the conversation by stating , " Thank you for waitingI was in a movie theater and could n't talk until I left the room . " Some people think text messaging is a remedy for not talking in a theater . These people are wrong . The glare and glow of the cell phone is just as disturbing as the ring and noise of a conversation . Leave the phone alone and just enjoy the show . <p> 2 . Be on time ! The starting time of each film is posted in the newspaper , online , and at the theater . There 's no excuse for entering the theater and disrupting those who were courteous enough to arrive on time . <p> 3 . Be patient in line . No one enjoys an impatient person who constantly appears to be rushing and pushing his or her way through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoving or complaining that will make the line go any faster . <p> 4 . Choose your seat with care . Look around as you find your seat . Once seated , remove your hat or any other item that could block the sightline of those behind you . Especially if you are tall or see a short person behind you , choose your seat with sensitivity . here 's a quick story about a situation that happened to me while attending a late afternoon movie and inspired this months tip . My husband and I entered the theater to find only about a dozen other viewers seated at various locations in the theater . We chose seats in the middle of the theater in the middle of a row with empty seats all around us . Two big guys entered the theater and chose to sit literally in the seats right in front of us . The taller of the two sat right in front of me . I could n't believe it . The theater was practically empty , why did he choose to sit directly in front of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . I tapped the man on his shoulder and asked , " Could you please move a couple of seats either way . You are blocking my view ? " I will not quote his response here , but I will say it was not friendly or favorable . We had to move to other seats .. <p> 5 . Sit once and remain seated . No one likes to be seated beside or behind someone who gets up and leaves their seat several times before or , worse yet , during the movie . Plan ahead . Visit the restroom before taking your seat . Buy all the refreshments you may want and make all the calls you must before the movie begins . If you know you may have to leave during the film , choose a seat near the aisle and , preferably , near the rear of the theatre . <p> 6 . Refrain from ALL unnecessary talking once the film has begun . If you must talk , make it no louder than a whisper : If the person sitting next to you asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the realm of the correct volume . Stop and think : Am I speaking at a volume even the person in front of me can likely hear ? If the answer is yes or even maybe , then you are probably speaking too loudly . Holding side conversations , even in a whisper , can be heard . Make NO side comments . Also , laughing too loudly , especially when no one else is getting the joke , can be terribly annoying . <p> 7 . Always face the back of the theater when entering a row of seats . When entering a row to find a seat or leaving your seat to go toward the aisle , never allow your buttocks to be the face of neighboring people . Because of the way we bend as we sidle between the seats , our rear-end extends farther backward than our knees or chest . If you are facing the rear of the theater , your buttocks may touch the backs of the seats in the row in front and maybe even the back of the heads of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , your rear is in the face of all the people you passnot a very positive appearance . <p> 8 . Check the ratings . Only bring children to movies that are content appropriate . Childrenbeginning about age fourwill enjoy going to the theater to see appropriate movies . Until then , enjoy videos at home or hire a sitter when you want to enjoy a first-run feature . A noisy baby or a bored child who becomes disruptive bothers everyone in the theater . <p> 9 . Be quiet with every movement . Most candy , popcorn , and other food items sold in theaters are served in relatively quiet wrappers . Even so , try not to make excessive noise while eating or drinking . Do n't  scrunch papers or boxes , do n't  rattle or chew on the ice in your drink , do n't  slurp the last of your drink through the straw , and , if you are eating something very crunchy , keep your mouth closed while you chew very gently and quietly . <p> 10 . Stay to the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing the credits at the end of a film . Especially here in the San Francisco Bay Area , where many films are made , the name of a friend or acquaintance may scroll by . If you are a person who does not enjoy viewing the credits or know you may have reason to leave the theater during the film , try to sit in an aisle seat or toward the back of the theater so you can exit with the least amount of disruption . <p> 11 .

Be sensitive to how loudly you may be speaking . Do you notice that people down the hall comment on your conversations ? That might indicate your voice is too loud . Consider closing your office door and lowering your voice whenever speaking in person or on the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum . Be ever mindful that others are nearby and that this is a place of business . Do not use the company telephone , fax , or email , for any inappropriate and personal matters . <p> In some workplaces , privacy is difficult to find . If you overhear a private conversation , practice selective hearing . Avoid the urge to be " helpful " in areas best left to the other person to handle on their own . Your best bet for being treated as a professional at work is to keep all workplace conversations professional . <p> Sharing professional information is wonderful , gossiping is not . Only discuss personnel matters directly with specific individuals , superiors , and management . NOTE : For an informational sheet on " Gossip " please write us at **26;856;TOOLONG and we will send it to you . <p> SCENT <p> Be sensitive to scents and smells surrounding you .

Generally , less is better when it comes to office and cubicle decor . Use discretion when displaying personal items such as family photos and mementos so as not to overdo , clutter , and obstruct your work area . <p> Use shared areas with respect and courtesy . Workplace kitchens can be the biggest source of co-worker tension . If you expect everyone you work with to cleanup after themselves , model that behavior yourself . Wash and return all kitchen items to their proper place , clean spills , and wipe countertops and tables as needed . Help maintain supplies as needed . When leaving food items in a shared refrigerator , mark all items with your name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work week and toss or recycle empty containers . <p> Restrooms run a close second to kitchens as annoyance spots . After use , wipe the countertop and sink of any spilled water or soap . Be sure the toilet is clean for the next user . Notify the proper attendant if supplies are low or out , and of any plumbing problems . <p> Maintain all shared items in " like new " condition and return borrowed supplies . Leave the photocopier in working condition and be sure to take back that borrowed stapler with at least a few staples left inside .

Some call it " umbrella rage " as children and adults alike do battle on crowded streets , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see another person approaching , tip your umbrella away from them the other person to avoid colliding your umbrellas . Be sensitive to how the metal or plastic points sticking out at every fold may poke someone in the body or , worse , in the eye . Rain or shine , utilize just half the width of the sidewalk when walking in a group , so others can easily pass by . Depending on how wide the sidewalk is no more than two or three people should ever walk abreast . <p> Learn the Dance of Umbrellas : For a taller person , when you encounter another person using an umbrella , raise your umbrella up so a shorter person may pass by without colliding with your umbrella . Likewise , if you are a shorter person , lower your umbrella closer to your head . The end result is a well choreographed " dance of umbrellas " down the street , each umbrella being raised or lowered in graceful motion , avoiding all conflicts , collisions , and pokes in the eye . <p> Keep It Closed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before entering a building . Remove any excess water by gently taping the tip of the umbrella in front of the building a couple of times . The first question upon entering should be where you may place the wet umbrella to avoid further dripping . Make use of the carrying case that came with your umbrella , or the disposable plastic bags that many office buildings and stores provide , to cover your wet umbrella while indoors . <p> Park Umbrellas with Care : Be mindful of where you place your umbrella . If no umbrella stand is provided , set your umbrella upright with the tip on the floor beside you . In trains , planes , and automobiles , lay it on the floor near your feet , not on an empty seat where other people may sit on it or the puddle it leaves behind . Keep your umbrella away from walkways where someone might trip over it . <p> Carry Cautiously : It continues to amaze me how oblivious people are about the physical space they occupy . When not in use , always hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do not tuck it under your arm horizontally with the ends sticking out ready to stab someone . <p> Just Enjoy Windy Days : When the wind is so strong that your umbrella is in jeopardy of being turned inside out , simply forget it . Tilting your umbrella into the wind only obstructs your forward vision and , more times than not , does n't  help much , anyway . Rather , brave the elements in a good rain coat with a hood . Try to remember that a little water never hurt anyone ( except , of course , the Wicked Witch of the West ) . <p> BONUS:Prevent Umbrella Loss : Folks at any lost-and-found department will tell you they have hundreds of unclaimed umbrellas in storage . If you forget your umbrella somewhere , you may have a chance of someone returning it if you tape your telephone number and/or email address to the very top of the umbrellas main strut above the handle , where it will least likely get wet and come loose . <p> Although we always need rain , here 's to dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discussing next month . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

@@83772949 @5272949/ <p> Im surprised by how many inquiries Ive received lately from clients and others about how to behave at meetings . More people while in meetings are viewing emails , texting , holding side conversations , and plainly not paying attention . Because of this problem , I am dedicating two newsletters to this topic , starting with how to behave as a participant of a meeting . In Part 2 I 'll cover what to do if you 're the chair or facilitator of a meeting . <p> 1. - - Be prepared . When you receive a request to attend a meeting , know why the meeting is necessary , who called it , who else is attending , and be clear about what results or outcomes are expected . Review the agenda and figure - out what is expected of you and what you should contribute beyond simply attending . In other words , take a proactive , leadership role by always learning exactly what is going to happen at a meeting . Never show up cold . <p> 2. - - Organize your materials . No later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a temporary file or location to organize and set aside all information needed for this meeting . Make sure you include a pad and pen . <p> 3. - - Synchronize your clock . Bookmark and use either the official U.S. time site of is http : //www.time.gov/ or for the world **30;884;TOOLONG as your " official " guide when setting your clock and alarm . Absolutely stop what you are doing at least 15 minutes before the time you need to leave the office to get to the meeting on time . Use this time to gather all the information you need and to visit the restroom to check your appearance . If you are speaking at this meeting , take at least an extra 15 to 30 minutes to review your notes and practice your presentation . <p> 4. - - Be on time . For an out-of-the-office meeting , arrive at the meeting location at least ten minutes ahead of the meeting time . For in-house meetings , get there about five minutes ahead . Use this time to get nicely settled and relaxed . Perhaps visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or get a cup of coffee or water for the meeting . You always want to be relaxed and prepared when the meeting begins , not harried because you just rushed in . <p> 5. - - Seating arrangements : Depending on the level of formality , seating may be designated . If you are unsure , ask the chair where to sit . In the American style , the meeting the chair sits at the end of a long rectangular table , with all participants on either side . The most senior person or guest speaker sits to the right of the chair . At international meetings , the chair typically sits at the center of the table , with participants seated on either the same side ( usually senior staff ) , or opposite the chair ( other guests and participants ) . <p> 6. - - Stay focused on the meeting : Its easy to get distracted , but your job is to stay attentive to the flow of the agenda and discussions . You never know when you may be called upon for your thoughts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note saying , " Let 's talk after the meeting about " Do not succumb to the temptation to check email , take a phone call or text messages . Turn all electronic devices to vibrate or turn them off completely and leave them off . If you and everyone else gives their undivided attention to the meeting , it will result in higher productivity . Maybe you 'll even get out faster because everyone is focused . Do everything in your power to keep your mind occupied , so you wo n't doze off or be tempted to make side comments with the person next to you . <p> 7. - - Be a good team player . Once the chair or group has made a decision on something , get with the program and make that decision turn out positively , even whenand especially when-the decision was contrary to your opinion and overall vote . <p> Never complain afterwards about the decisions made , items discussed , or against specific people at the meeting . Air grievances with the chair , or perhaps with the specific individual who concerns you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level and international meetings , allow more senior level individuals to contribute and speak first , before you and others . <p> - - - - When speaking , do not go on and on . Get to the point and end your comments . <p> - - - - When arriving late , quietly take a seat . Express your apology at the next appropriate break . <p> - - - - Be familiar with the general principles of Roberts Rules of Order . Typically all meetings follow this format . The higher the level of formality , the higher the expectation that all participants be aware of how it works . <p> - - - - - Never interrupt or talk over anyone else . Allow the other person to finish his or her comments before you chime in . Raise your hand to be acknowledged by the chair before speaking , if that is the correct style . Do n't  just jump in , unless you know this is an acceptable practice . <p> - - - - - Address all comments to the chair , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an acceptable practice within that group culture . <p> - - - - - Being a welcomed participant of any meeting requires you to be aware and adaptable to the many nuances , styles , and cultures .

@@83772951 @5272951/ <p> Many dinners , especially around the holiday season , include meals served family-style---where heaping platters of delicious foods are served and shared around the table . These guidelines should help you properly navigate your way through this form of dining : <p> WHEN MAY I BEGIN EATING ? Among close family and friends you may begin eating as soon as everyone has received a little helping of each dish being passed . In a more formal setting , you may want to follow proper etiquette which dictates you wait for the host to begin eating . A good host may encourage everyone to start eating while platters are being passed . If this occurs , feel free to begin . If the family tradition is to offer a blessing before eating , either participate or sit quietly while others do . At larger gatherings , you may want to say grace before the food begins to be passed to avoid everyone having to wait a long time while the food gets cold . If individually you want to say a private blessing , simply lower your head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POINT MAY I ASK FOR SECONDS ? Generally speaking , you should wait to request more food until encouraged by the host . Assuming all food is clearly on display in front of you , simply ask that a specific item on the table be passed to you for seconds . It will be a compliment to the chef that you want more of something . Before serving yourself , be sure to offer some to the dining companion on either side of you . When food is not in front of you , it is best to wait until you are offered more . This could cause your host to be uncomfortable by having to refuse your request because there are no seconds . <p> HOW DO I POLITELY REFUSE SOMETHING BEING PASSED ? If you have food allergies or clearly defined religious or other food restrictions , inform your host prior to the meal , if at all possible . Simply make a brief statement when you accept the invitation or at the time you arrive , " I just wanted you to know I am allergic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishes that contain peanuts . I 'll just pass on those . I 'm sure there will be plenty of other wonderful foods to eat . I just wanted to let you know so you would n't think I was passing on a dish because of any other reason . " Having given notice , your host will not be offended when you pass on that dish . If you are unsure about a particular dish , discretely ask the host how it was prepared and what ingredients were used . Most hosts will gladly disclose the ingredients . Otherwise , if you have no serious food restrictions , do try a small portion of everything being served . You never know , ... try it , you 'll like it ! The bottomline is , neither host nor guest should place an emphasis on the food . Rather , the focus of a family-style meal should be the overall enjoyment of a celebration and an evening in good company . <p> IS IT O.K. TO GRAB THE LAST PIECE OF SOMETHING , ESPECIALLY IF IT IS SITTING RIGHT IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It is always best to offer the use of any item to the dining companions on either side of you before you grab it . You could say something such as , " Jane , Joe , this last piece of turkey looks mighty delicious . Would you enjoy having some of it ? " If yes , share it . When they decline , help yourself . <p> WHEN MAY I LEAVE THE TABLE AT THE END OF THE MEAL ? Generally guests remain at the table for about an hour after the meal has concluded to enjoy a bit of after-dinner conversation . Watch your hosts for clues . Unless you are invited to see the host 's model train display , adults typically do not leave until senior members of the family or the guest of honor leaves . Younger guests may ask to be excused to enjoy their own conversations and activities in another room . <p> DO I HAVE TO WRITE A THANK YOU NOTE ? DUH ! A guest should always write a thank-you note . While your parents will be pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just imagine how impressed your future in-laws will be . Creating a family-style meal for special gatherings and celebrations is a large undertaking . Receiving even a very simple hand-written thank-you note in return is always a gesture most appreciated .

Pressed to arrive at my destination on time , I 'd aggressively push that red light , speed around slower traffic , and elbow my way across the street and into a crowded elevator . I 'd make the meeting on time , but was anxious , aggravated , and too exhausted to take on the task at hand . I realized I preferred to arrive at appointments alive , calm , and ready to be creative . I cleaned up my act and poor transportation habits and happily share these tips for you to do the same . Remember , the road rage you prevent may be your own ! <p> BEFORE YOU LEAVE <p> Be realistic about how much time your trip will take .

Close down your tasks and leave , no matter what . <p> Think about it , had you suddenly realized you were supposed to be someplace , would n't you have dropped everything and left anyway ? What 's the difference ? The difference is by closing down 15 minutes before you need to leave and allowing yourself the proper time to get to your destination , you save yourself anxiety and worry . <p> Organize your belongings .

Wait and do not step off the sidewalk until it is your turn to cross the intersection . In addition to being dangerous , when you wait in the street you block the right-of-way of drivers who want to make turns . By law , if a driver sees a pedestrian on the street , the driver must stop and allow the pedestrian to cross . Even if a pedestrian waives the driver through , if the driver does not stop , he or she is subject to a moving violation . On many high-traffic streets the lights are configured to allow all pedestrians to walk at the same time , separate from the vehicles . Be patient and wait for the proper light for pedestrians to cross the street . <p> Share the sidewalk . When strolling down the street , stay to one side of the space and allow others to pass . If you 're walking with others , some of the group may need to walk behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction . <p> WHEN YOURE DRIVING <p> Please stop at red lights . Running red lights is my biggest rage about drivers on city streets . Unless you are already in the intersection , when you see a yellow light , consider it a red light and stop . Especially when you are more than one car 's length away from the intersection , do not step on the gas pedal thinking you will make it across . Sure you may make it this time , but as time goes on , inch by inch your perception of that car length will become longer and longer , to the point you will find yourself going through red lights more and more often . Ultimately you may cause an accident , hurt someone or get a ticket . Simply do n't do it . Relax . Take a deep breath and allow yourself to do the right thing by stopping . <p> Weaving is for rugs , not traffic . Changing lanes without signaling , making turns from the incorrect lanes , and weaving around slower vehicles without regard to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are for passing . When driving on highways , the far left lane is properly a passing lane . Do not stay in that lane indefinitely ; use it for passing only . Do n't be oblivious to the cars behind you . Go with the flow of traffic . <p> Tailgating is a party , not a driving style . Driving too close to another car is rude . What purpose does this serve ? Tailgating only causes fear to the person in front of you and frustration to you . Please leave at least one car length between you and the car ahead . <p> Limit your hankering to honk . The automobile horn was created to warn other cars in emergency situations . Honking a horn , especially at a crowded intersection , serves no purpose .

A hosted party is one presented by an individual or firm in a private home , office , or event space where you will not be required to contribute anything to attend and while attending . Use these simple guidelines to be an exceptional guest at a hosted party . and find yourself being invited again next time : <p> Always arrive on time . The reasonable arrival time for a party in a private home is within 8 minutes of the appointed time . If the invitation says 6:00 p.m. , arrive between 6:00 and 6:08 . Arrival time is less strict when the invitation clearly states the event is an " open house " within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to arrive no later than within an hour of the ending time . <p> Have the telephone number with you . In case of an emergency delay , call your host to explain where you are and when you think you will arrive . This is vital in the case of formal dinner parties and polite for other events as well . <p> Say hello and good-bye . Upon arriving at a party , be sure to locate the host to extend your greetings and appreciation for being invited . Then find the host again before leaving to say good-bye and to acknowledge the wonderful party . <p> Bring a house gift . It is always a nice gesture to present a small gift of appreciation to the host of a party in a private home . However , do not ask the host to open your gift in front of you or expect it to be used at the event . Let the host set it aside for a more appropriate time . It is not necessary to bring a gift to a hosted party held at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One contribution you should make at a hosted party is to participate . Help make the event a success by introducing yourself to others and engaging in conversation . Be prepared to join in whatever good-natured festivities your host has planned ... even singing ! <p> Eat and drink responsibly . Avoid arriving at a party hungry , stimulated to eat and drink everything in sight ! If you find you have consumed too much alcohol , ask your host to call a taxi or find someone who can drive you home or to a nearby hotel . With good friends , a night in the guestroom may be an option : Drinking and driving is never an option . <p> Never overstay your welcome . Plan to make your exit around the ending time stated on the invitation , or about an hour after the dinner is concluded . Stay longer only if you are sure the host is genuinely encouraging an extension . It is often merely a gracious gesture when your host enthuses , " Oh , do n't leave . Do stay longer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch to showing your appreciation , and ensuring you get invited back , hand write a thank-you note as soon as possible following the event . A thank-you telephone call or e-mail are appropriate only among close personal friends . <p> BONUS TIP : Unless your host specifically requests your assistance with something , do NOT feel compelled to help in the kitchen at parties . Leave all arrangements to your host . Your task is to enjoy the event . Reciprocate by hosting an event in your home next time . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

I 've come to realize both these EIQs ( EI- ) truly go hand-in-hand as top components to the success of any company , organization , and individual . Here are a few thoughts to consider : <p> 1 . Fifty years ago we lived is a world with little diversity . People remained within their own borders to live and work among generations of the same ancestries and heritages . Today , people are traveling to live and work in countries around the world .

@@83772973 @5272973/ <p> There is an art to attending professional conferences . Invariably as the season begins I 'm asked about the etiquette of attending conferences . If you thought it was quite enough to simply pay the fees and show up , think again . <p> Whether you are just getting started or you are a seasoned conference participant , let 's face it , attending a conference requires expending your personal resources " money , time , physical and mental commitment . So , why not make the most of the experience ! <p> BEFORE THE CONFERENCE <p> Mark your calendar to plan ahead . Do yourself a favor , take time to plan ahead and make the most of your investment . Read all information about the conference beforehand . About 30 days out , review any additional conference information sent via email or posted online at the sponsoring organization 's web site. - Make note of the specific workshops you want to attend . Begin planning your wardrobe to match the weather conditions of the host locale , paying close attention to any special requests for attire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal awards banquet . <p> Be prepared with all items needed for the conference : Let 's face it , people attend conferences to network , learn new ideas , get their name and company known , and promote their product or service . One of etiquette 's biggest taboos is to show up at conferences without bringing enough hand-outs . Do whatever is necessary to assure an ample supply of business cards and information you want to distribute during the conference. - In fact , bring double or triple the amount you would normally think to bring ; or arrange to use a local copy center . Better to bring home extras than to disappoint your colleagues by not having enough.Starting about a month in advance , compile a list of all items you will need to begin packing for an out of town conference . Pay attention to the details , including outlining the proper attire for various events . Perhaps there 's a formal night or a themed event , such as a Western night . A good way to make a poor impression is to arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This kind of behavior tells your colleagues you did n't read the literature or care enough to honor the event . Do n't be surprised- if by not dressing appropriately , you will not allowed inside . More about wardrobe planning : - most conference sites keep you apprised of weather conditions for the location to which you will be traveling , and whether there will be any outdoor events for which you should be packing a warm sweater or jacket. - Pay attention to the type of facility you will be visiting , such as the appropriate attire for a big city hotel , versus a golf resort , versus a private club in a vacation locale . Each has it 's own culture when it comes to attire . <p> Be responsive to all requests for information : From the time you register to attend the conference , till the end evaluation form , be sensitive to the needs of the organizers . Show your sense of responsibility by sending complete and accurate paperwork at all times , and by the due date . There is nothing worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby-sit someone to get necessary items . <p> AT THE CONFERENCE <p> Arrive at the conference ahead of time . This is the perfect time to check in early , get your full package of conference materials and relax in your room to read through everything. - NOTE : - This is not a time to penny-pinch on spending for an extra room night . With airline schedules being unreliable for one reason or another , it is always best to arrive hours and even a day ahead . Use this extra time to rejuvenate your strength for the rigorous days ahead . Take a walk around the hotel facility and grounds to become familiar with where various rooms are located and the travel patterns you will need to take to get from one place to another during the conference . Learn how long it will take to walk from one location to another to avoid ever being late to an activity . Once the event gets underway and you 're running to keep up with tight meeting schedules , get-togethers with colleagues and more , you 'll be glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name badge at all times . Because I attend lots of professional meetings , I always carry my own magnetic name badge holder and wear it on my upper right shoulder. - This allows me to achieve the best networking support at all times. - I want people to see my name badge and remember who I am. - As a result , I will not wear a badge using a lanyard around my neck . - Here 's why : it rarely faces forward for someone to easily see , it is positioned halfway down my chest which draws the eye to an area of my body I do n't prefer people staring at ; and when I 'm sitting at a table , it 's totally out of sight. - To me , lanyard style badges are ideal for tradeshows and exhibitions , where badges are more for identification purposes than for real networking . <p> Be on time throughout the conference . From the moment the conference begins , right through to the end be respectful of the overall timeline for the conference ; always stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delayed inbetween sessions . If you want to speak with someone get their room number , cell phone number , or set an appointment to meet later at a certain time and place . Neither the organizers nor the presenters appreciate being ignored or unnecessarily interrupted . <p> Meet and greet everyone with a proper handshake , a smile , and good eye contact : With every day that passes , it continues to amaze me how so-called professional men and women still do not know how to give a firm and proper handshake , do not give proper eye contact , and barely smile when meeting someone . I 'd like to think no one reading this newsletter has an issue with this item . Perhaps you have read my past newsletters on Handshaking Techniques , Eye Contact , and Networking skills . Look them up at **36;1146;TOOLONG . <p> Create a plan for organizing the contacts you make . Take time at the end of each day to make notes about each person you meet . Organize cards and notes in a way it will be easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure about someone , take a moment the next day to say hello to the person again ; clarify whatever you need . <p> Do not sign up for more than one session at the same time . Choose the one best session you want to attend and then find a conference buddy to get you extra hand-outs from the other sessions . <p> Remain silent during all announcements and speeches . Perhaps this is the hottest issue I hear about over and over again " participants being discourteous to the speaker . No matter how difficult it may be to hear the speaker , how boring the person may be , or if the announcement or speech is being spoken in a foreign language you do n't understand , you must remain silent as a courtesy to the speaker. - If you must talk to someone , leave the room . If you must take a cell phone call , leave the room . Please do everyone a favor , the next time this situation happens at your table , quietly and politely ask the person to remain silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , if you are the offender , stop it ! <p> Stay alert throughout the conference . Conferences lasting more than a day can be exhausting . To prevent falling asleep , eat lightly throughout the conference . Drink more water than usual and keep all alcohol consumption to a minimum . Take short walks whenever possible . Wear loose and comfortable clothes and shoes . Most importantly , maintain good posture at all times. - Do n't  slouch in the chair . Take quiet , periodic deep breaths to help the flow of oxygen and blood throughout the body . Pace yourself to get proper rest and sleep . Sneaking a quick 15-minute nap here and there does wonders . <p> Do not make a fuss or be a complainer . No one enjoys hearing complaints or criticisms about how things are being handled during a conference . When a negative situation arises you feel needs to be reported , remain calm , explain the situation in a normal tone of voice , and ask for reasonable , mutually agreeable solutions . Thereafter , keep to yourself whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you complete an evaluation sheet . This is the best time to write down complaints and helpful suggestions for improvement. - Or , at the close of the meeting email or call the organizers to submit your thoughts . <p> AFTER THE CONFERENCE <p> Follow-up with everyone you meet . You just never know who will turn out to be a valuable resource , treasured colleague , or lasting friend . So , why not do the right thing and follow the advice of the best etiquette books , which tell us it 's good manners to follow-up with everyone we meet , and to certainly follow-up with whatever you may have promised . We all know how difficult this task is . Some people use their return flight time to write thank- you notes . It is well known the #1 sign of a true professional is when s/he tackles this chore so just do it ! <p> TIP : When first announcing your plans to attend a conference , tell everyone you are leaving a day earlier than the actual departure date and tell everyone you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookend times to focus on making the most of the experience . Use the day before to finalize last-minute details and prepare . Use the day immediately after to focus on starting your follow-up work " while contacts are still fresh in your mind . <p> Another idea is to actually stay an extra night at the hotel so you can relax and begin your follow-up work uninterrupted ; not to mention resting up . This also could be a good time to arrange meetings with colleagues you met at the conference who , like you , have delayed departure time . Or , just use this extra time to be a tourist and enjoy the sights . <p> Its an amazing paragraph in favor of all the web users ; they will take advantate from it I am sure . 190397 @qwx810397 190429 @qwx810429 
@@83772975 @5272975/ <p> June is the month many Americans hit the road on vacation . In an effort to cut down the number of accidents due to not knowing or understanding road signs , this months tip is dedicated to everyone who drives U.S. highways . <p> On a personal Note : This months tip is also dedicated to my brother Melvyn Seid who passed away on Saturday , 23 May 2009 . He was a man who loved traveling the world and often took his family on fun road trips all around the U.S. in their family van . <p> Road signs and other highway markings are the drivers guide to road safety . Knowing what these signs mean and using them and other rules of the road properly makes life easier for you and more pleasant for all the drivers and pedestrians you encounter . So how you drive is an important part of etiquette . <p> How well do you know road etiquette ? Answer each question after viewing the corresponding image to the right : <p> Question 1 : Youre driving on a freeway , nearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road goes from two lanes to three , four , and then five , and traffic is getting heavy . A large green sign for your exit shows , " North US 57 , Main Street 1 mile " with a small sign on the left reading " EXIT 32 . " What must you do to exit as safely and quickly as possible ? A. Ask passengers to keep a lookout for your off-ramp so you can get into the appropriate lane to exit.B . Stay in the right lane so you are ready to exit.C . Move to the far left lane to be ready to exit.D . Move to the middle lane so you can move to your exit quickly when you see it . <p> Answer : The small exit number sign on top of a larger directional sign is always on the side of the exit . Since the " EXIT 32 " sign is on the top left of the big sign , your exit ramp is on the left . Therefore , " C " is correct . <p> Question 2 : While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXIT 42 " and get off at " EXIT 163 . " In what direction are you driving and how far have you traveled ? A. East , 19 milesB . North , 121 milesC . South , 121 milesD . West , 205 miles . <p> Answer : Almost all Interstate and US highways and some State highways going north and south are named in odd numbers . Those going east and west are named in even numbers . Most states follow federal guidelines and number their exits according to the mile markers . On even-numbered highways they begin in the west and increase as you drive east . Odd-numbered highways begin in the south and increase driving north . <p> Therefore , " B " is the correct answer . Because the number increases , it indicates you are driving north , for 121 miles ( 163 42 = 121 ) . <p> Note : To my knowledge , the State of New York numbers its exits consecutively west to east and south to north without any regard to the mile markers . California historically did not display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are appearing more and more in certain sections of the state . These are the only exceptions . If you know of other exceptions , please let us hear from you . <p> Question 3 : Driving at night on a rural road with no streetlights , your headlights are the only illumination . A sign appears ahead of you , a tall rectangle with alternating black and yellow stripes slanting down to the left . Without looking at the roads edge stripes or anything else , this sign indicates you should immediately:A . Stop ! The road is about to end.B . Drive cautiously around the sign on either side and watch for an obstruction.C . Drive to the left of the sign and continue.D . Drive to the right of the sign and continue . <p> Answer : This sign is an object marker . It warns of an obstruction , such as a bridge abutment or other intrusion into the roadway . The slanted lines always point down toward the lane and direction in which it is safe to avoid the obstruction . Therefore , " C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slanted lines guide you around construction zones and other hazards or obstructions . Always note the direction in which the lines slant down and go around the barrier to that side . <p> Question 4 : You are entering a freeway on the on-ramp , driving in unfamiliar territory . You notice a continuous white line on your left and a solid yellow line on the right . Without hesitation , you should : A. Proceed cautiously onto the highway.B . Cross the line quickly into the next lane.C . Accelerate to highway speed.D . Back up immediately ! <p> Answer : Oops ! Yellow stripes separate traffic traveling in opposite directions or mark the left edge of the highway . If you ever see a yellow line on your right , you are going the wrong way into opposing traffic . White edge lines always define the right edge of the road . In this case you have turned onto an exit ramp . Stop and back down the ramp immediately . Therefore , " D " is correct . <p> All roads conform to this rule . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which you see in the headlights of cars going the wrong way , in case the yellow line is not readily visible at dusk or at night . <p> Question 5 : You are driving on a three-lane highway in lane Number 3 , the far right lane , and you want to pass the slow trucks and cars that are using the lane as well . Cars in the other two lanes are moving faster and passing the slower cars and trucks . You should : A. Carefully move into lane 2 to pass one or more of the slower vehicles . B. Move into lane 1 if the vehicles in the middle and right lane are slower than you and you want to pass.C . Move into the Number 1 lane and stay there to be sure you are never impeded by slower traffic . D. Drive in whatever lane is comfortable , because faster traffic will go around you.E . Always drive in lane 2 when there are three lanes , so you have room to maneuver . <p> Answer : " A , " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you did not choose " C. " This is my biggest pet peeve , when drivers remain in the far left Number 1 lane , no matter what . Driving etiquette says you only use the left lane as a passing lane , except when all lanes are full of traffic . <p> If you want to pass , do so to the left . If you are passing and a faster car comes up behind you , do not continue to block that car . As needed , slow down and move into a lane to your right until the car passes you . In other words , do not hog the fast lane whenever cars are behind you . If you chose " D , " this could be you . <p> Especially at night , if you come upon a slow vehicle and want to pass , do not immediately go around it to the right . Flash your headlights or flick your high beams on and off to let the driver know you want to pass . If the car does n't  move over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move around the car . <p> When changing lanes for any reason , use your turn signals so all the drivers around you know your intention . Surprising other drivers with unannounced lane changes can cause accidents . <p> Question 6 : You are driving on a two-lane winding road either at the speed limit or a little slower , so you can enjoy the scenery . Four cars and a truck are piled up behind you . You should : A. Continue driving . When you get to a road with more lanes or a passing lane , cars can get around you.B . Speed up to the limit or faster so you can leave cars behind.C . When it is safe , pull over into a turnout or wide shoulder to let cars pass , then resume your journey.D . Slow down even more to give the more adventurous drivers a chance to pass you on straighter stretches . of road or when they can see no cars coming the other way . <p> Answer : Its the law ! When four or more cars pile up behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others may wanteven if you are driving at or over the speed limityou must pull into a turn-out or onto a safe shoulder to let them pass . Therefore , " C " is correct . <p> When you see another car behind you on a one-lane road , the courteous thing to do is drive at least as fast as the limit until you reach a place to safely let the other car(s) pass . Causing other drivers to get frustrated or angry because you are holding them up , often causes them to do dangerous things---such as pass you when it is not safe on curves or when cars are coming the other way . Some may try to pass you on the shoulder which is not only unsafe , its also illegal . <p> Question 7 : Youre renting a car and its time to fill it with gas . You realize you have not noticed on which side the gas tank is located . To find out , you should : A. Pull into a gas station and do n't  worry about it . If its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at the dashboard for a gas pump iconC . Have your wife or child hang out a window and lookD . Look at your cars reflection in a store window as you drive by to see it <p> Answer : Choose " B. " If there is an icon of a gas pump , the side on which the hose is shown indicates which side of the car your gas tank is located . This illustration shows the gas tank is on the right . Check it out on your own car . It should be consistent . If not , let us hear what make and model you have . <p> I hope this months tip has been fun for you to check out a little of your EIQ ( Etiquette Intelligence Quotient ) with regards to road sign etiquette .

Now , we move on to how to be the best possible meeting leader . <p> 1. - - - - - Take the lead . Learn how meetings are run . Get familiar with Roberts Rules of Order as the foundation of how all meetings are conducted . How closely you choose to follow it will depend on the level of formality of the meeting . <p> The person who organizes and leads the meeting has full charge over whether the meeting is a success . If that person is you , you must take control and manage every detail , including how the meeting is run , the tone and pace , what topics are discussed , how participants behave , and what outcomes and results occur by the end of the meeting . You are also in charge of follow up . <p> 2. - - - - - - - - Schedule the date and time . As far in advance as possible , alert everyone you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purpose . Ask participants to respond within a few days to confirm their availability . Doing this well in advance gives you the flexibility to choose alternate dates if the majority can not attend . <p> Initially , send an email to everyone you want to attend , listing at least three dates and times . Ask everyone to respond with all the dates and times they are able to attend , and the most popular date and time will be the winner . <p> To avoid annoying extra emails , ask people to respond only to you or to the single designated person , not to the entire group . Or , address the email to yourself and use the " Bcc " box , and then list everyones name in the body of the mail so people will know who is invited . This method guarantees no one will send other emails " To All . " <p> 3. - - - - - - - - Confirm any guest speakers . Part of your job is to coordinate all details with the guest speaker . Confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the date and time , exact address or location , driving directions , the start and end time of the overall meeting , and the exact start and end time for the guest speaker to present . Other helpful information might include parking instructions , background information on the company or organization , and a list of all participants , as appropriate . <p> 4. - - - - - Draft an agenda . Send a draft agenda as soon as possible to gain input and approval . If a person needs more time on the agenda , they can ask you to add it in advance , as running overtime will not be acceptable . <p> Try not to cover too many topics in any one meeting . The " KISSS " method is the best policy : keep it simple , short , and sweet . A brief , one hour or less , targeted meeting will always be more productive than a longer two+ hour meeting where too many items are discussed . <p> About two weeks to a full week in advance , distribute a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the meeting . State clearly which reports certain individuals are expected to make and ask speakers to bring copies of their reports for everyone at the meeting . This way each participant can be fully informed without the speaker having to read every word . Written reports will also help those who were absent catch up . As the facilitator , always ask for an electronic version of the report so you can send it to those who were absent . <p> For optimum productivity , have all reports submitted ahead of time so everyone will be well informed when they attend . Those who must be absent can submit their comments ahead of time , and the time at the meeting can be full spent on discussions . <p> Show specific start and end times for each report , to keep things flowing and not run overtime . For example : <p> When writing the cover memo or email , clearly state the meeting will begin and end on time , and state that everyone is expected to arrive on time . Review the guidelines on conduct you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to please turn off all cell phones , and other electronic devises during the meeting . <p> 5. - - - - - Make your opening remarks . Either have people introduce themselves , or introduce everyone yourself , adding why you have invited these individuals to attend , and from what perspective you think their contributions will be most helpful . <p> State the purpose of the meeting and what results and outcomes you hope to achieve by the end of this meeting . <p> Review the guidelines for proper conduct at the meeting , such as raising hands and sticking to the agenda timeline . Make a final reminder about turning off all cell phones and other electronic devices , so people will give their full and undivided attention to the meeting . Ask if anyone has to leave the meeting early or is expecting an important call . If no one responds , you should have a fully attentive group . <p> Also ask for whether anyone has last minute items to add to the end of the agenda or if anyone has any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Keep the meeting flowing : Throughout the meeting , move the agenda along , calling attention to every page number or agenda item you are about the discuss . Be clear in your introduction to each section as to whether it will be an interactive time or a time to just listen . Your foremost goal is to drive the meeting toward constant results . <p> When you notice certain participants are not contributing , request comments from them by name , such as " John , we have n't heard your views on this , what do you think ? " Do not allow a few individuals to monopolize all discussions . <p> Manage the timing of each item on the agenda , reminding a speaker or the group when they are going on too long or getting off point . <p> Do not rely on a wall clock in the room . Bring your own small portable clock to have in front of you . There 's nothing more distracting than watching someones head constantly looking up at the wall . <p> Stick to the agenda . Establish what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people get off track . <p> Encourage free communications , managed through raised hands and only having one person speak at a time . Build an environment where everyone is encouraged to share points of view and new " out of the box " ideas . Build a T.E.A.M. , " Together Everyone Achieves More " spirit among the group that makes attending meetings fun and productive . There are no dumb ideas and no one should be made to feel as though his or her contributions were not welcomed . <p> Do not let the meeting get out of hand . Disagreements and arguments can be healthy to allow participants to air their opinions . However , make sure all comments are directed to you , the chair , and not at the person on the other side of the argument . If the discussions turn ugly , step in and take back control of the meeting to move on . <p> 7. - - - - - End the meeting on a positive note . Take a time to recap the meeting discussions , reviewing all action items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all due dates . Finally , thank everyone for attending . <p> 8. - - - - - - - - Follow up promptly . Immediately following the meeting , on the same day , send attendees a quick e-mail thank you note for attending the meeting . Keep this message brief and positive . <p> In a separate email , summarize everything that took place at the meeting , and what is expected of each person in the days and weeks ahead . Sending this written recap will serve three purposes : Those who were absent will get caught up ; If no one took minutes , you now have a record of what transpired ; and it will serve as marching orders for individuals who have assignments before the next meeting . Without a to-do list , we all forget things . <p> Send the recap within a week of the meeting , while your notes and mind are still fresh . The longer you wait , the fuzzier your memory may become . Mark your calendar with all due dates and follow-up with individuals to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tags for each participant are a nice touch at meetings where not everyone knows each other . I like having both . When name cards are printed properly in large , bold letters , it helps me learn who is speaking , and name tags help me to identify people during breaks . You can also ask people to pass around the appropriate number of business cards . Participants can place them on the table in front of them in the order in which people are seated . <p> QUESTION : What other items do you have to add to this list that will help make every meeting the most productive ? - We 'd love to hear from you . <p> If you enjoyed this article and want more , do subscribe in the upper right box provided. - Let us know what topics you would enjoy seeing us write about. - Most of all , tell your friends about our blog and services. - Thank you ! <h> 2 Responses to " Business Meeting Etiquette Part 2 : The Facilitator " <p> This is super !

@@83772981 @5272981/ <p> Resolved to make gift giving easier and more meaningful in the coming year ? You can make it so , by initiating a new approach to your ongoing gift-giving practices this month . <p> Wine enthusiasts I know use the term " ABC " meaning " anything but Chardonnay " or " anything but Cabernet " to indicate their broader approach to enjoying the grape . In this same context , here 's my " ABW " approach to gift-giving , meaning " anything but wine . " <p> With just a little forethought you will find countless unique and useful gifts other than wine that you can give for all occasions , both corporate and personal , throughout the year . I find the ABW approach is more fun and less stressful than rushing out to pick up a gift at the last minute , often saves me time and money , and results in a more thoughtful presentation of my true feelings for the receiver . <p> Keep Your Eyes Open : Be on alert for gifts wherever you go . Purchase items when you see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are , the supermarket or pharmacy , a farmers market or estate sale , pay attention to the items on display . Ask yourself : " Is this a good gift for someone ? " " Would this be a gift I would enjoy receiving ? " If the answers are yes , buy it . <p> Shop ahead of time : Stop saying , " I 'll get it when I need it " or " I 'll get it when I can think of a person for whom I can give it . " Believe me ; in this case that kind of thinking does n't  work . When you need the gift , you may not have time to go back to the store , it may no longer be on sale , and it may not even be available . As long as you feel it would be a nice gift for someone , buy it ! <p> Stock up : Periodically use your lunch break to getaway to a nearby store , dial up your favorite online site , or flip through a catalogue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all occasions , including weddings , new babies , housewarmings , and birthdays . See something wonderful ? Buy more than one . For business , be sure to also include thank-you gifts ( for a job well done , the order or business , or a referral ) , please-forgive-me gifts , and congratulation gifts . <p> Make a list : Make a list of all the gifts you need to purchase for the entire year , both business and personal . Keep the list with you for when you see an item you like . While it is great to have a collection of all-occasion gifts on hand , picking out just the right gift for an individual and purpose makes that gift all the more special . <p> Get organized : Establish a box or designated area to store the items you 've purchased . Put a piece of paper on the box where you can easily note the gifts you have stored inside . List the specific people or appropriate occasion that would be a nice fit or person you thought of at the time of purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " picture frame for Jills wedding . " My gift box is in a secret place in my home to keep prying eyes from discovering their summer birthday present that I brilliantly purchased in February . <p> The end result is you will always have an appropriate , well-selected gift that 's ABWanything but winewhenever you need one . Instead of stressing over being caught at the last minute without an appropriate gift , this year expect to hear " Oh , what a thoughtful gift . " " You always know just the right thing to give . " " Its just perfect . How did you know ? " <p> P.S. Please do not mistake me when I talk about ABW . Bottles of wine are a lovely gift , especially to those who enjoy and appreciate it . My point is that some people and companies use wine ( with or without a personalized corporate label ) as their all-occasion generic gift . It is from this context I suggest you use the more creative ABW approach rather than always bringing that bottle of wine to every event . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

In response to what PSOW Director Pamela Eyring says is a backlash to the informal work environment of the past decade more and more employers are seeking etiquette training for employees . From learning the basics such as the proper web-to-web handshake to how to host a business meal , employers are becoming increasingly concerned with how their employees represent their business . " We know this because enrollment is up 25%-50% . On the employee side , our recent survey found that over 87% of graduates report making fewer mistakes after training , so we know the process works , " says Eyring . <p> Attribute the trend to a competitive work environment because of the economy .

The biggest faux pas is snagging your neighbors dinner roll . TIP : The correct place setting is B-M-W : left to right Bread Meal Water . <p> -- Lack of e-etiquette . Using PDAs in meetings is overwhelmingly the #1 complaint . <p> -- Forgetting someones name .

@@83773009 @5273009/ <p> Etiquette maven Judith Martin has been noted to say , " Laws come into effect , when etiquette fails . " Her point was made by the recent passage of laws governing the use of the Internet in marketing and advertising . <p> Business owners , companies , and consumers understand the value and importance of marketing as an integral component to gain visibility and sales for a company , product , or service . In the last few years the rapid boom of the Internet , easy access to broadcast e-mail , and other new technologies in global telecommunications has become an all-too tempting advertising medium . Low-cost use became abuse . Representative Heather Wilson ( R-NM ) stated it well when she said , " Today , it 's a nightmare that threatens to overwhelm people 's legitimate use of the Internet . all the technologies and filters have failed to keep our in-boxes free of junk . " <p> Most companies want to properly use the Internet , telephone , and fax as legitimate methods for their sales and marketing strategy . People have wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do we weed out the good , bad , and ugly in unwanted solicitations ? <p> At a convention in Orlando , Florida , in October 2003 , the three leading advertising trade groups-the Direct Marketing Association , The American Association of Advertising Agencies , and The National Advertisers-agreed to the following guidelines for use of e-mail . <p> E-Mail Advertising Guidelines <p> The subject line of an e-mail must be honest and not misleading . <p> Senders should include a valid return e-mail address and physical address . Firms should also use their company or brand names in their domain address , and throughout the message . <p> The e-mail should identify the sender and the subject at the beginning . <p> All commercial e-mail should provide customers with a clear electronic option to opt out . And it must be easy to use . <p> A company with multiple affiliates should offer notice and opt-out for each separate brand , or those that the consumer is likely to perceive . <p> Firms should not acquire e-mail addresses surreptitiously through robots , spiders , and other automated mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from using the dictionary attacks or other mechanisms for fabrication e-mail addresses without providing notice and choice . <p> Opt-out requests must be honored in a reliable and prompt way . " Remove means remove , " the groups said . <p> E-mail lists should not be shared with third parties unless consumers have been given notice and choice . That restriction includes other brands and subsidiaries within the same parent company . <p> A commercial e-mail should contain the sender 's privacy policy-in the body of the message or via a link . <p> Guidelines Become LawThese e-mail guidelines were then incorporated into Public Law No. 108-197 , the S.877 CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 ( Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act ) , as signed into law by President Bush in December 2003 , and effective on January 1 , 2004 . This Act and all its associated bills are all part of the national effort to stop the proliferation of unwanted e-mails . As reported in the cover story of the January 27 , 2004 issue of DMNews-the Online Newspaper of Record for Director Marketers-Microsoft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years from now , spam will be solved . " Believe me , this is one prediction the world hopes is right . For a Summary , Bill Text , and Current Status of this Act , see http : **39;1284;TOOLONG . <p> Other national services are in place to help both businesses and consumers comply with the guidelines for telemarketing by telephone and fax too . <p> To eliminate unwanted telephone marketing calls : With your active e-mail address , take a few minutes to get yourself on the National Do Not Call Registry , online at http : //donotcall.gov . For consumers without an e-mail address , you may call toll-free to 888-382-1222 ( TTY 866-290-4236 ) . Other information and questions may be found through the Federal Communications Commission , Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau , at LONG ... or toll-free at 888-225-5322 ( TTY 888-835-5322 ) . <p> To view basic facts about telemarketing : a State of California site at http : **34;1325;TOOLONG , offers information on how to be a good telemarketer and to know as a consumer how the law is on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and stay off marketing lists ; how-to protect yourself from being spammed ; and how to know if you are being potentially ripped off by credit card , international investment , and lottery scams . <p> With this knowledge in hand , you may want to take time to adjust your marketing messages and clean-up your database by doing the following : <p> For businesses : <p> Review the items contained in the E-mail Advertising Guidelines and in the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 to verify you are in full compliance with the information you tell and send consumers . Make the necessary adjustments to your web site , e-mail broadcasts , fax announcements , and telephone scripts to properly identify your business and to allow the receiver the choice to be removed from your contact list . <p> Consider contacting your clients and customers , by sending an e-mail , fax , or postcard informing them you are updating your database and want their permission to continue receiving your information . Then be sure to provide easy steps on how they can opt-out , if desired . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the onset of the call and how you got their name and contact information . For example : " I received your information because of your membership in the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce . " <p> Establish a system to keep track of individuals and companies who specifically request to be placed on a " Do Not Call " list-and do not call them again ! <p> Be professional in the manner in which you address and speak to people . When you do n't know someone , business protocol states a proper greeting is not to address the person by their first name . Instead , use primarily " Mr. or Ms Smith " until you are invited to call that person by their first name . Mrs. should only be used when you are sure a woman is married ... often a tell-tale sign the caller is a solicitor . <p> Be prepared with additional marketing and sales literature you can send potential buyers upon request , via e-mail , fax , or postal mail . This is simply good customer service . By denying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sneaky and illusive in their approach and unwillingness to send additional information . For me , a reluctance to send written information is a definite indication of an unprofessional , perhaps shady and lazy , uninterested company . <p> For consumers : <p> For telephone calls , create your own " Do Not Call " sheet listing the exact date and time of the call , the representative 's and company 's name with whom you 've requested not to receive further calls . <p> For e-mails and faxes , keep a separate folder in your computer or file to hold all the remove requests you 've placed ; and again refer to it each time the offense is repeated . <p> Keep the list nearby whenever receiving calls , faxes , and e-mails . Call attention to the companies by specific name , date , and time , repeating your adamant request to be placed on their " Do Not Call " list . Remind them of your right to seek legal action against this company should the calls persist . <p> For a small investment , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " service and equipment . In most situations , where the caller has blocked their number from being viewed , it will automatically block that call from being connected at all . <p> Following the law , following the E-mail Advertising Guidelines , and using professional business practices in all your marketing efforts-being honest , straight-forward , and genuine-will ensure you are performing appropriate marketing efforts rather than sending junk mail and spam destined for the delete box . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

@@83773016 @5273016/ <p> As the etiquette expert for Staples.com , Bnet.com , and SBTV.com , I answer questions from viewers all over the world . I thought I would share a few of the questions and answers for your enjoyment and continued education . There is no significance to the choosing of these questions , beyond having chosen eight of them . <p> 1 . Workplace communicationsQ : My supervisor hired two new employees for my department who speak limited English . As the manager , how can I effectively communicate with them ? A : Personal interest and attention reduces cultural barriers . Learn how to say a few words in your new employees native tongue . Each morning , a handshake and appropriate greeting such as " good morning " will go along way . A few words of courtesy , such as " please " and " thank you " will help develop a respectful working relationship . <p> In many cultures , family is given high priority . To establish rapport , show your interest by inquiring about the persons family members , especially if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid confrontation in front of others . If the persons work habits need improving , discuss them privately . No one enjoys being corrected in public . <p> 2 . Gifts sent with no response Q : My wife sent two gifts to her godchild for her graduation and birthday last month and we 've not heard a word . She 's particularly concerned about gifting in the future . What is the proper response ? A : Thank-you notes are especially important when gifts are sent a long distance . In your situation , if the godchild has email , send a simple message such as , " I 'm just checking to see if you received the two gifts I sent you last month for your graduation and birthday . Please let me know , as I would hate to think they are lost . If so , I need to contact the post office right away to place a trace on them . " <p> In the future , you may want to invest in a new service the U.S. Post Office provides , where you can ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least <p> 3 . Business Correspondence Q : I often receive business letters and emails signed " Mary Smith " or just " Mary . " How do I address the envelope and the salutation when replying ? A : Address the envelope to " Ms. Mary Smith , " or " Mary Smith . " For the salutation , choose either " Dear Ms Smith " or " Dear Mary Smith , " not " Dear Mary . " Overall , a persons name should be preceded by an honorific in all business and social correspondence . <p> Email uses the same conventions . Use the informal " Dear Mary " only after you have built rapport with the person and have met in person . I use both the first and last name in all my business emails . " Dear Mary Smith " is a happy middle-of-the-road solution . <p> 4 . Taxi rides with clients Q : When traveling I often ride in a taxi with my clients . Where is the best seat for my client ? A : The best seat is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true in a limousine . <p> 5 . Entering a restaurant with a woman Q : Does a woman still precede a man when entering a restaurant ? A : Yes and no . While this is still common courtesy in the U.S , the usual practice in Europe is for the man to enter first . His job is to survey the room and to find an appropriate table . Once he finds it , he will turn around to have his female companion enter after him . This practice was established during the days when restaurants and cafes were crowded and sometimes rowdy , and no reservations were taken . <p> 6 . Getting guests to RSVP Q : I am planning a gala where the price per person is costly . In the invitation , I want to include wording to ensure my guests commitment and reduce the chance of no-shows . Can you suggest what to say ? A : Say nothing on the invitation beyond your normal wording of the invitation , plus a firm due date for responses . Then , as acceptances arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stating : <p> how pleased you are they have accepted your invitation <p> how much you look forward to seeing them , especially because you have gone to much effort to ensure a most exceptional gala <p> and finally because you must submit a guaranteed number of meals to the facility/caterers by a certain date , you must have an accurate guest count . To the point , if they must withdraw their acceptance , even if its at the last minute , please do let you know , so you will not have any empty seats for which you will still have to pay . <p> For those who did not respond by the due date , send a separate reminder that states how much you want to hear from them because of the efforts being made for the overall party and the need for a guaranteed number for food service . You can also call people by telephone . Depending on the facility or caterer and how true this statement may be , you can also say how much you regret not being able to accommodate anyone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 7 . Hosting guests at a restaurant Q : My wife and I are hosting a dinner party in a restaurant for two of my top clients and their wives . How shall I seat them and how should they be served ? A : Arrive at the restaurant ahead of your guests to decide exactly who will sit where . It must be noted proper seating arrangements will vary slightly , depending on the exact number of guests being arranged and the configuration of the table . Assuming you are being seated at a round table of six , a guest of honor sits to the right of the host , with your wife on the other side of the table . Inform the wait staff you and your wife are the hosts and who among the guests are your honored guests . Instruct the waiter to serve your guest of honor first and not to remove any plates from the table until everyone has finished each course . <p> 8 . Walking on streets with women Q : Why do men in the U.S. always walk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in Europe , where people are supposed to be even more polite , they do not ? A : In Europe , people put the honored person on their right side , regardless of whether that person is a man or woman . In the U.S. , the practice of men walking on the outside or curbside of the street stems from the days when people would pour their dirty water onto the streets . In later years it was also to protect women from getting splashed upon by passing and swerving automobiles . <p> I hope you have enjoyed this random selection of questions from readers just like you .

@@83773042 @5273042/ <p> August 22nd has been designated " National Punctuation Day " by my good friend Jeff Rubin . In his honor , and to celebrate this important day , I am sharing a few solutions of my own on word and punctuation usage . <p> One goal of Advanced Etiquette is to make people feel comfortable and at ease in social situations . While proper punctuation and word usage may not be directly related to having good manners and etiquette , using language correctly is part of presenting yourself to others with the best image possible . When you say or write something incorrectly , it sends uncomfortable signals to the listener or reader , similar to the screeching sounds of running your fingers across a chalkboardyipps ! Using correct punctuation and words will elevate your stature in both social and business situations . <p> 1 . Its versus Its . " It " is the exception to the possessive rule . Generally you add an apostrophe to indicate ownership . For example , this is Syndis newsletter . " It 's " breaks the rule . Its means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 2 . There versus Their . Which is correct ? ... " Cheryl and Pam walked there dogs " or " Cheryl and Pam walked their dogs . " Choose Door Number 2 . There is a location ( among other meanings ) but their is the pronoun for more than one person . <p> 3 . Further versus Farther.Further means time or quantity , as in , " He wished he could pursue the subject further . " Farther means distance , as in , " He threw the ball farther down the field than expected " and " New York is farther from Denver than Omaha . " English being an ever-changing language , some dictionaries now say these words are interchangeable . I find this unfortunate ; to me these are , and should remain , totally distinct and separate words . <p> 4 . Less and More are not Fewer and Greater.Less and more refer to quantity . For example , " She filled the blue cup more ( or less ) than the red cup . " Fewer and greater refer to number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line , 10 Items or Less . " These signs are incorrect , which irritates me to no end . The signs should read " Express Line : 10 Items or Fewer . " Every time I see this , it makes me think about never returning to that store . Their image as an educated , professional establishment goes straight to the bottom of the list . <p> 5 . Zero or O.Zero is a number . O is a letter . While most people are careful to type the right character , many folks are less careful when talking . In speech , use the word zero to state a number . For example , " the area code for San Jose , California , is four zero eight . " <p> 6 . Stationery versus Stationary . Use your beautiful personalized stationery to write a thank-you note for the business lunch ; use a stationary bike to keep in shape . Stationary means to stay in one place and stationery refers to materials for letter writing . <p> 7 . Compliment versus Complement . Give a compliment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refers to giving praise and the other mean to have something match or " go along " with something else . <p> 8 . Hyphens and Dashes .

They give me another reason to celebrate , reflect , and renew my goals for the coming year . <p> This year , the Jewish New Year called Rosh Hashanah takes place from sunset September 22 through nightfall September 24 , 2006 , marking the beginning of the year 5767 in the Jewish calendar . <p> If you have Jewish friends or relatives , have the good fortune to be invited to a holiday meal , or even if you 're Jewish , here are a few fascinating facts and customs about the holiday to keep in mind : <p> 1 . In Hebrew , Rosh Hashanah means " head of the year " or " first of the year .

The main difference between this New Year 's holiday and others is that it does not come and go in one day . Rosh Hashanah is so important that it is celebrated over 48 hours as one . It is followed by 10 days known as the High Holy Days---a time of penitence and prayer that ends with Yom Kippur , a day of fasting , in October ( more in our October tip ) . <p> 3 . It is customary to refrain from sleeping during the day of Rosh Hashanah . Instead , observers take this time to study the Torah and engage in other spiritually productive activities . It is said that if you are idle , it is as if you are sleeping . The Talmud Yerushalmi states , " If one sleeps at the year 's beginning , his good fortune likewise sleeps . " <p> 4 . During Rosh Hashanah , families gather for a holiday meal .

While there are infinite ways to show appreciation , here are eight ideas to consider : <p> Holiday Cards : This is the most popular way we share our greetings during the holiday season , yet many people send a pre-printed signature card without writing at least a little personal note . No one likes receiving generic cards . Write a small note . <p> Personal Notes : A personal , handwritten note truly shows your love , whether you write it on a holiday greeting card or any piece of paper . The point is that you took the time to write . A personal note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A note can say volumes , all by itself . <p> Gifts and gift cards : Take time to choose a gift you know the person will like . Do n't  wait until the last minute to purchase it under stress . Instead , buy gifts throughout the year , whenever you see something you think a particular person will appreciate . For gift cards , find out which store the person likes best , and buy your card there . NOTE : Be careful when purchasing gift cards this December 2008 . See LONG ... for information on store closings <p> Meals and special events : One of my favorite ways to show appreciation is to invite someone to my home or out to a restaurant for a meal . I also enjoy inviting people to be my guest at special events.Its a great way to spend time together and support an event . The key is sharing time together . <p> Days off : Some companies give their staff the entire week between Christmas and the New Year off . Others give employees their birthday off . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Money : In the Asian culture this is perhaps the most popular way of giving gifts . We give gifts in red envelopes for all occasions . In the western culture , year-end and holiday bonuses are more typical . <p> Trips : Based on achieving company goals each year , one company I know treats the entire staff to a one-week , all expenses paid trip to Hawaii . Although definitely extravagant , perhaps other trips can be something to consider . <p> Telephone calls and personal visits : We all love receiving telephone calls from friends with whom we have n't connected in a while . Reconnect with loved ones , especially the elderly , who may be living alone or in a rest home . <p> Most of all do n't  wait for the holiday season to do any of the above .

Each year I receive dozens of inquiries on wedding etiquette , including horror stories . <p> Here are my top eight tips to always be the perfect wedding guest . <p> Respond to the invitation : The number one complaint I hear is how guests do not bother to RSVP . Respond within a week , or certainly by the due date . Do not assume folks know you are coming just because you mentioned it at a party . Always call the hosts as soon as your situation changes . If you said you could come and ca n't , call them---even at the last minute . In most cases it costs money to cover no-shows , so never let this happen . It is the a complaint I hear all the time . Conversely , If you declined and find you can come , say so immediately---instead of becoming an unexpected guest . For more , see " The Lost Art of RSVPs " . <p> On bringing additional guests : Pay close attention to exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see only your name , it is not appropriate to bring additional family members or guests . No exceptions ! If it includes other names , such as " and family " or " and guest , " list all names on the response card . " And guest " means you may bring one person . Never show up with more guests than originally listed on the invitation and your response . <p> A wedding gift : Send a gift ahead of time or bring it on the day of the wedding . Feel free to ask if gift registries were established to help you choose an appropriate gift . If you do not plan to attend , it is not necessary to give a gift . However , it is considered a nice gesture . Traditionally , you have up to one year to send the gift . Today , I recommend you do it within six months . <p> What to wear : Proper attire never includes blue jeans , casual clothing or sports attire . This is a time to dress up in honor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , such as wearing white ( or red in certain cultures ) . A coat and tie is best for men . Women should wear a day or evening suit or a dress . If the invitation states black-tie or other specific attire , men must wear a tuxedo or dinner jacket . Women 's attire for black-tie events generally include wearing a full-length dress or pants suit , or an outfit that will be appropriate to the time of day and location . <p> Getting to the wedding : Guests provide their own transportation and lodging . You may inquire about nearby hotels , when unfamiliar with the area . Relatives and close friends should not expect to have travel expenses paid . <p> Arriving at the wedding and seating : Arrive 10 to 15 minutes before , or on-time at the least . If the bride is already walking down the aisle , wait outside until the ceremony begins . If you arrive after the ceremony starts , walk to an outside aisle and take a seat quickly and quietly . Traditionally , the bride 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jewish weddings are the opposite .

Here are some of their responses , followed by my own comments . Overall , I believe that when it comes to good behavior , humans and dogs are not that different . You 'll see why in my answers below . <p> Pamela of San Francisco asks : When did it become acceptable for owners to allow pets to urinate on other peoples lawns and gardens ? I asked one owner how she might feel if I poured a cup of urine on her front lawn , and she accused me of being confrontational . <p> Answer : It is never acceptable ! Humans are taught it is not appropriate to defecate on public sidewalks or to urinate on the sides of buildings . Dogs are no exceptions . It is n't anyone elses responsibility to pick up after dogs except owners . They should use Pooper Scoopers and steer their dogs to appropriate places to relieve themselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their parents and owners teach them . Good parenting begins when the dog is a puppy and the human adult is a child . Unless the parent reinforces good behavior at home , the puppy or child will not know how to act in public . Well-mannered dogs and humans are welcome and valued members of our society . <p> Karen of Daly City asks : I was walking my dog Shadow , on leash , at an outdoor music concert . Shadow must have smelled old dog urine directly next to where people were sitting . So he did the doggie thing and marked it , lifting his leg and urinating a tiny bit onto a woman 's knapsack hanging on her back . I was horrified and apologized . The woman was very gracious . What can possibly be done to make amends when a dog inadvertently marks the personal items of another person ? <p> Answer : Humans are not allowed to destroy other peoples lawns , gardens , and personal property . This holds true for dogs as well . You could have offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair amount of money to have the item cleaned or repaired . Urine , especially female urine , can cause terrible dead spots in lawns and gardens and will discolor streets and buildings . Just imagine what it did to her knapsack ! <p> D. Morgan asks : People run their dogs off-leash in our local high school yard , even while school is in session , when children use the field , or when athletic groups play games there . It is not within the school district 's means to enforce their " no dogs " rule . People remove the " No Dogs Allowed " signs shortly after they are erected , or the signs that remain are ignored . Rarely does a dog owner retrieve his dog and leave when asked . Do n't rules and kids come before dogs ? <p> Answer : There will always be pet owners who are unlawful , inconsiderate and think they can get away with bad behavior in the name of their pet . Unfortunately , whoever posted the sign must enforce the rules and laws set forth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also , what would be a polite and effective way to ask dog owners to keep their dogs away from frightened children , regardless of unfounded fears or how well voice-controlled and mildly tempered the dogs are ? I can leave with my own kids if a particular dog bothers them , but when I lead a group activity outdoors , it is impossible to leave and cede the territory . <p> Answer : Try this . When leading group activities , have more than one facilitator . One of you becomes the safety monitor . Have this person approach all pet owners in the area at the onset of the activity to ask for their kind cooperation in keeping dogs on leash and away from the kids area , because some children are afraid of dogs . Perhaps post or hold a big sign on a stick that reads , " Kids at play please keep dogs on leash and away from this area . Thank you . " Always thank people for their cooperation . Its the right thing to do , no matter what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Etiquette is No Different Than Human Etiquette <p> Summer is a season when both humans and pets---especially dogs---enjoy being outdoors . Adults , children , and dogs may do as they please in the privacy of their own homes . But when in public , all are expected to behave in a civil and courteous manner . here 's my own list of pet peeves : <p> Owners who bring dogs as uninvited guests : Humans are taught never to bring an uninvited guest to a party , or to ask if an extra guest is welcome . Unless a dog is officially invited , owners should leave them at home and not even ask if they can bring the dog . <p> Dogs off leash : By law , dogs are to be on a leash when out in public . The only leniency might be when a dog is totally obedient to its owner . This is no different than parents of children . Children are often leashed when very young , until they learn to mind their parents in public and not run off in all directions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel nearby when a baby or person drools . They try not to let their baby slobber on them . Likewise , a dogs parents should keep a towel handy whenever their dog drools or slobbers , especially at someone elses home . <p> Dogs who bark too much or are overly playful : Children and adults who become too loud and rowdy in public places are typically invited to leave the area . Dog parenting requires similar disciplining . Dogs who bark too much and become too playful need owners who call a time out , just as good parents remove children from the play area to calm them down . Both owners and parents repeat the lesson until dogs and children learn how to behave appropriately . <p> Owners who do n't  keep dogs safe . Good parents would never let their children swim in a pool or pond that was n't clean , or wander off into the woods or unknown territory . They would also never keep an infant or dog in the car with a window slightly open while they run into a store for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seatbelts while in a moving vehicle . <p> Inconsiderate travelers . Good parents and dog owners practice voice commands and instructions prior to leaving home . They do n't  let their children or dogs leave their sides , and they curb all yelling and barking . While more hotels are pet friendly today , some adults and children are terribly afraid of animals . Good parents and owners do n't  let their children and dogs get too close to other people , unless invited , and expect them to be well mannered when they do so . <p> Wouldnt it be nice if owners treated their dogs with the same sense of responsibility and discipline as they would their own children ? Perhaps they do n't  understand that well-behaved dogs become the center of attention , just as people compliment well-behaved children and adults . <p> FORWARD THIS NEWSLETTER .

With only a few days notice and knowing this was a live , listener call-in show , I thought long and hard on this subject , more than ever before . <p> I came up with eight observations on where words such as politeness , courtesy , respect , consideration , goodness , civility have gone " along with all other words describing appropriate behavior " and how necessary these are in our daily lives. - All require a little homework . <p> Perhaps you will think some of what I have to written is provocative and you will have thoughts of your own to share .

We are led to believe anything goes , anything is possible , and we are free to be whomever we want . Result : We look out for Number 1 and live in a world of selfishness .

Its history dates back to the Sangam age , from 200 B.C. to 300 A.D. <p> Kolam designs , intricate geometric patterns of dots and lines , are made with rice flour or limestone powder outside Tamilian homes and are said to usher in the Goddess of prosperity , Lakshmi .

Huge stalks of sugarcane decorate the courtyards in rural areas . These are held over the pot in which sweet pongal , a dish of boiled rice and pulses mixed with jaggery and fresh milk , is prepared . The milk is allowed to boil over as a reflection of plenty , meaning that the harvest has been good . <p> The third day , Mattu Pongal , is dedicated to the cattle that have helped to reap the harvest with their labour . The cattle are bathed , their horns brightly painted , turmeric and vermilion are applied to their foreheads and they are garlanded .

@@83773067 @5273067/ <p> Faux pas : from the French , 1676 , a false step , especially a social blunder . <p> While enjoy giving and attending a party as much as the next etiquette expert , over the years I have found a few situations that definitely damper my fun . Most party problems can be avoided with better planning . Here are a few tips to avoid faux pas as both host and guest . To review the other installments of the Party Tips series see July 2004Party Planning The Key to Successand December 2003 Being a Perfect Party Guest . <p> FOR THE HOST:1 . Have ample supplies on hand . To me there is no worse false step than running out of food or drink or seeing party guest left picking at crumbs without a plate , fork , clean glass , or napkin . Avoid this faux pas by carefully planning your supplies for the number of guests you expect and then for a few extra folks arriving . Pace putting out platters of food and extra supplies so that there are plenty of provisions throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can whip together in a jiffy if needed . Eating party leftovers for a few days is a small price to pay for a being an excellent host . If you serve food and beverages you like , you 'll enjoy your efforts long after the partys over . Save your other supplies for your next party ! <p> 2 . Hire service and busing help . Getting extra handswhether paid staff or friendsto monitor food supplies , serve drinks , and take care of clean-up , allows you to enjoy your own party . As a guest I feel bad when hosts are slaving away in the kitchen or constantly rushing in and out replenishing the food table . I attend a party to relax and enjoy my hosts company . Avoid this faux pas by soliciting some help . If you cant afford to hire anyone , consider trading help with an acquaintancehe or she helps at your events and you help at theirs . To me it is a real discourtesy to your guests to be " working " your party at the expense of sharing your time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 3 . Offer a variety of consumables . We now have the opportunity to meet and know people from all over the world , from many ethnicities , from a range of cultures , and with an array of personal preferences . Avoid the faux pas of unhappy guests by creating a welcoming atmosphere for all . Design a balanced food tableunless you are absolutely sure all guests are meat eaters , for instance , always serve a few vegetarian itemsand be sure to have non-alcoholic and diet beverages available at your bar . <p> 4 . Know your guests . We all experience a lapse of memory from time to time . Yet one of the more awkward situations is when a host needs to introduce a guest and cant remember his/her name . As one of the last items on your to-do list the night before , take time to review the entire guest list one by one . Picture their face in your mind . Engage and coordinate with your spouse and co-host the names of any guest you definitely should know and remember . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests some embarrassing moments <p> FOR THE GUEST:1 . Avoid hovering at the buffet . One of the worst things I find at parties is how guests hang around the food table , conversing with other guests , picking at the food , and never leaving the area . Eating should be secondary to visiting people at every party you attend . Avoid this faux pas by not arriving starved and by taking food onto a plate or napkin and stepping away from the buffet to continue conversations . Be sensitive to other guests who want to get at the food . <p> 2 . Try it you might like it . A party of any kind is a great time to taste new foods . I must share a story from a back yard barbeque where one of the items served were pouches of ratatouille . This is a delicious French dish from the region of Provence , typically combined with eggplant , onions , zucchini , bell peppers , tomatoes , garlic , and herbs . In this instance they were put together in small aluminum pouches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table was a man eating these ratatouille one after the other as though he was starved for days . A woman sitting next to him remarked how delicious these pouches were and how she especially liked the eggplant in it . At that point the man interjected , " Eggplant , wheres the eggplant ? " When the woman replied , " Oh , its the little purple items , " the man suddenly stopped eating , put aside his remaining pouches , and said , " Eggplant , I hate eggplant . " He did n't  take another bite the rest of the party . <p> Now , I ask you , does this make any sense to you ? Please email me and let me know what you think . I feel that a party is an excellent place to stow your mental food bias , keep an open mind , and try new foods , I 'm confident that most of the time you will be pleasantly surprised . <p> 3 . Do n't  set drinks down on the artwork . Attending events at museums , galleries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a real treat . Even if there is limited space on which you can set your plate and glass , please do not be tempted to set something on or beside a beautiful art object . You run the risk your items will tip over , spill , and possibly cause irreparable damage . Avoid this faux pas by doing your best to juggle that plate and drink until you find a proper place to set them down . <p> 4 . Clean up after yourself . We are all taught to tidy up after ourselves and to recycle or dispose of used items . Despite that Ive seen dirty plates and cups left underneath coffee tables and chairs , behind art pieces , and hidden in garden plants . Avoid this faux pas and show how well you were raised by disposing of all items appropriately . 190435 @qwx810435 190426 @qwx810426

They all agreed it was a terrible situation happening among not only adults , even youths and teens were equally affected . <p> When I thought about this more deeply , I realized that both parties in these situations lose .

The longer the situation stays unresolved , the more possible that it can develop into loss of friendships and job promotions . Worst of all , the people can become the subject of malicious and exaggerated comments over time . <p> I 'm bringing up this subject as a reminder to us all : We must make every effort to always fulfill our promisessmall and largeand to only promise something when we truly intend to follow through . <p> Beginning this weekend , think about your unfulfilled promises : <p> Make a list of all items you have ever borrowed . Locate them and return them . It does n't matter if you 've had the item for yearsbetter late than never in returning it . <p> Do the same thing for the overdue sending of information , the money once borrowed , and the like .

Forever true in this digital age , the worldin an instantknows all that is good and bad . We see all the highest praises and the greatest criticisms . <p> Actually , I rather like social media when it comes to business practices , as it is helping to build better businesses through comments shared on intolerance of poor behavior and lack of service . For anyone who serves customer and clients , now you see how extra crucial it is that all promises are kept and fulfilled . This is a major pet peeve most customers have of service providers . <p> And moving forward , pledge to never make new promises you know you 're not going to fulfill and keep and fulfill those you do make . <p> Question : - What stories do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fulfilled their promise(s) to you ? - Heres your chance to vent no real names , please. - Just share the story with perhaps fictitious names in the area below . <h> 4 Responses to " Keeping Promises is Good Etiquette " <p> Here are my own stories about this months tip : 1 . Years ago before digital cameras , my boss asked me to pick up photos he had processed at Walgreens . I used my own money to pay about $12 and to this day he has never paid me back . I reminded him a couple of times , including the day I left being his assistant and nothing came . Also , another time I lent him a video which he never returned . I thought we had a great working relationship and he was pleased with my work so the final blow was I asked him for a reference letter which he stated he would be happy to provide three strikes and you are out ! which was and remains most disappointing . 190409 @qwx810409 190410 @qwx810410 190414 @qwx810414 <p> 1 .

I have n't heard from her since . 190408 @qwx810408 <p> Dear Dianne re : item , 2 : My initial take on this is If your former client continues to invite you to share time with her , its because she truly likes you and the lack of referrals in recent times may just be a sign of the times of " no referrals to give " and you are concerning yourself over something that may not exist . 190434 @qwx810434 190397 @qwx810397 190429 @qwx810429 
@@83773072 @5273072/ <p> Wherever you may be in the world summer months typically conjure up thoughts about being at the beach. - To this end , here are a few tips to help you and yours to have a most enjoyable experience at the beach. - <p> 1 . Allow a minimum of five feet between groups . Take time to consider where and how you set up your space . Spot your larger groups as far away from other people as possible . When bringing half your house to the beach " from boom-box to boogie boards to beach chairs " make every effort to consolidate your items in a small area that will not take valuable beach real estate from others . <p> 2 . Let everyone enjoy the view . Part of the pleasure of going to the beach is relishing the water vista . Be sensitive not to place your umbrella and other high items directly in front of other people 's sight line . <p> 3 . Monitor noise levels : Especially in large groups , continually be aware of how loud your party is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax in peace and quiet . While you 'll want to be cordial , give your neighbors their space : some people may not wish to talk to anyone , only enjoying the sun and a good book . <p> 4 . Supervise children : While an expanse of beach is an inviting space for free play , both waves and dunes can be dangerous . Unsupervised children can get lost in the crowd or may annoy your beach neighbors by kicking sand or being disruptive . Instead of depending completely on free play , bring plenty for children to do " and join in the fun " building sand castles , creating art from found objects , searching for the most unusual or beautiful seashell , or reading to them the latest children 's best-seller . <p> 5 . Play responsibly . Both adults and children need to be careful when playing catch not to toss a ball or a Frisbee into someone else 's area . When setting up for badminton , volleyball , or other games , keep the outer boundaries as far away from other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secure all items from blowing away in the wind . When items do blow away , go after them , otherwise , the item becomes litter and will pollute the beach . Keep all your belongings as close to your blanket as possible . <p> 7 . And your language , too . Refrain from using any form of foul language . Conversations should be quiet and controlled . You never know who may find your words offensive . <p> 8 . Be mindful of how you behave in the water . Look out for others in the water before you engage in vigorous splashing , dunking , yelling to friends who are several yards away , and other horseplay . Maintain control of boogie boards and other water toys so that everyone has a fun and safe day in the sun . <p> 9 . Sunbathe with discretion . Topless and nude sunbathing is not customary in the United States . Instead , there are designated beaches " and areas of beaches " where this is allowed .

@@83773076 @5273076/ <p> Summer is a great time to enjoy day hikes . I love hiking and wish I could do more . For years my husband and I have taken annual camping trips that include daily hikes . ( For camping tips , see our June 07 newsletter . <p> Hikes are a great way to relax and enjoy a little solitude , or to share time with loved ones , family , and friends as a group activity . Its a perfect way to expose kids to the beauty of nature outside city life . It can also be a fine business activity . A few years back a potential client invited me to join her for a morning hike , instead of a morning coffee meeting . <p> Wherever you hike , you will invariably encounter other people who are also enjoying the same activity . If you abide by these few simple courtesies , hikes will be pleasant , safe , and stress-free . <p> 1 . Hiking pace . Do n't  try to hike at your partners pace . If your speeds do n't  match and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for a while . Meet up at predetermined points along the way . This way you can hike at your own speed and enjoy the special solitude of hiking aloneand probably see more wildlife . <p> 2 . Hiking with kids : As soon as children can walk well by themselves ( around age 4 or 5 and certainly by 6 years old ) , head out on a short day hike to get a feel for your childs pace , level of interest , and endurance . You will also test your own patience and tolerance , not to mention your ability to carry your kid back to the car when that last half-mile is just a little too far . Younger kids are much less likely to continue and not complain when the going gets tough . Some kids do n't  see the point of suffering , same as adult hikers . When they get tired , hot , wet , or miserable , they simply stop walking . <p> 3 . Enjoy the peace and quiet . Leave your electronic devices ( phones , radios and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen to something , listen to the sounds of the wilderness . Resist the temptation to catch up on your phone calls . <p> Be sensitive to how much noise you make , especially in a group . When you 're outside , sound carries much more than you think . Keep your voice down and do n't  make unnecessary noise . Act as though you are in a library or watching a performance in a theatre . <p> And there 's so much to hear . While there is a distinct lack of noise such as traffic , honking horns , telephones , buzzers , beepers , car alarms , and ( I hope ) blaring music , there is no shortage of sound . Sounds of wind , water , birds , and other animals all add to the " music " of the wild . This is the most common reason people go into the woods , to enjoy the sounds of nature and the relative silence that ensues . <p> 4 . Stick to pre-arranged plans . If you are hiking with a partner or a group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing and when you intend to rejoin the group . If you agreed to hike , picnic , or camp in a certain location , do n't  make a spur-of-the-moment decision to go off on your own . Your group could get worried or even frantic if you disappear . They could even get hurt or worse if they go looking for you in unfamiliar territory or in the dark . <p> 5 . Stay on the trail . Hike on existing trails . They are designed for the high impact of many hikers . Walk single-file so as not to widen it . Wear hiking boots so you can keep on the trail through wet or muddy stretches . Skirting creates additional side trails and unnecessary erosion . Do n't  shortcut the switchbacks . They are designed to minimize erosion and ease the ascent and decent in steep sections of the trail . Cutting these corners causes downhill drainage that can quickly erode a trail . When taking a rest break , move off the trail to a hard , rocky area , a non-vegetated place , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 6 . Share the trail . You have a pace that is natural and comfortable . If people behind you catch up , step aside and let them pass . While this may seem obvious , you 'd be surprised how many hikers choose to speed up instead . The problem is that slower hikers usually cant maintain the faster pace and must slow down , so faster hikers catch up anyway . Repeating this becomes uncomfortable for everyone , so do n't  do it . <p> 7 . If you pack it in , pack it out . Whatever you bring with you , even on a day hike in a local park , take it out or dispose of it in a trash or recycling container provided by the park . Some trash items , such as batteries , are considered toxic waste and must be disposed of properly , not tossed with the regular trash . <p> 8 . Respect the environment and wildlife . Do n't  alter the environment to your liking or bring home souvenirs . Allow the next person to see as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find an arrowhead or deer skull by the trail . Why not leave it there so the next hiker can enjoy the same excitement as you did ? <p> You are in the home of wild animals and birds , so respect their need for undisturbed territory . Disturbing animals can interfere with feeding or breeding behavior . When following an animal for a photo , stay downwind , avoid sudden motions , and do n't  charge or give chase . Resist the temptation to feed them . Leaving seeds for birds or breadcrumbs or nuts for squirrels can upset the natural balance of their food chain . Feeding wild animals can make them dependent on human food , which causes big problems , like bears in Yosemite National Park ripping the doors off cars to get to the people food inside . <p> BONUS : Protect yourself from lightning If a thunderstorm comes upon you while hiking , your instinctive response might be to take cover and get into shelter . But sometimes shelter can be more dangerous than staying outside . Find a place least likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hills , exposed ridges , tall trees , and open fields . <p> Probably the safest shelter is inside the " safety shadow " of a potential lighting target . This means you 're far enough away that you are relatively safe from a direct strike and ground currents , but not so far away as to be a target . If you are near a large tree or other target , stay inside an area where the horizontal distance from the target is about one-half less than the trees height above you . It is best if the tree is 5 to 10 times your height so you place yourself a reasonable distance from the potential strike zone . <p> Wherever you place yourself , put a non-conducting item between you and the ground by crouching on top of your pack or knapsack , a rolled up jacket , or a dry rock . Assume the " lightning position " with your feet close together and your buttocks off the ground . Hug your knees or put your hands on them .

We all know when Mother 's Day and Father 's Day take place ; I think we should also remember World Teacher Day . <p> The origin of this day started on October 5 , 1966 , at a UNESCO conference with the International Labor Organization , where a special recommendation was adopted . It was n't until 1993 , however , that World Teacher Day was established on October 5th to annually honor and recognize teachers around the world . <p> We all have teachers in our life , stemming first from our parents and guardians . Teachers are the least celebrated people throughout the world . Yet , they are most critical to every person 's learning and development through life . Classroom teachers , particularly , devote countless hours to teachings that will eventually build the next generation of knowledgeable , productive citizens . Why not celebrate them ? <p> Here 's an example of what you can do : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seminar a participant shared how he thanked his college tennis coach from over ten years ago , by sending a note of appreciation about all the great lessons he taught and how they are still helping him at every game .

@@83773086 @5273086/ <p> Gift giving should come from the heart , not out of a sense of obligation . Giving a giftwhether money or an object is how we express how we care about someone in a special and extra way . Below I 'll discuss how to navigate the thorny waters of gift giving ; whether to give a personal gift , gift cards , checks or cash ; whom to give gifts to : and whether to send holiday cards . <p> Give a Gift or Cash ? When you take the time and effort to give a nicely wrapped gift especially chosen for someone , its an exceptional delight . It shows you know their likes and preferences . To me , its the ultimate way of thanking someone and showing how much you care about them . No gift card or money can ever express the same emotions . <p> So how do you get to know what to give ? During conversations throughout the year , ask leading questions such as , " Do you like certain kinds of wine ? " " What do you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading ? " " What kind of books ? " These questions will give you the clues you need to select the right gifts . Those who receive such personalized gifts from you will be most surprised to see how you remembered and acted upon the knowledge you learned . <p> When it comes to cash-like gifts , I prefer a check or gift card , such as a Visa/MC card or a store card I know the person will like . When people take the extra step of redeeming the card or cashing a check , they will remember you as the gift-giver . I like it better than just giving cash that might be lumped in with other funds and spent without thought . I want the person to use the funds to purchase something they would not otherwise buy for themselves . <p> Keep in mind that its not about the money , how much money , or the amount spent on a gift . You could give homemade fruitcake , cookies , or jams . Its all about a combination of what you can afford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gift ? <p> One of the biggest dilemmas people face this time of year is whether to tip or give a gift to someone who has provided year-round services , or people at the office . While this list can seem overwhelming , keep in mind that I list everyone you might consider gifting , and not everyone is a requirement : <p> A holiday card with a personalized message is always nice to send . Annual desk or wall calendars are also very common . <p> Depending on budget and the number of corporate gifts you wish to send , there are an infinite number of ideas a company can implement to show someone they care . The key is to give a gift you know the receiver will value and enjoy . If you want help with this , email me for other corporate gift-giving guidelines . <p> A Word About Holiday Cards <p> Even with the advent of email and a desire to go green , I still believe in the power of a holiday card as a gift unto itself , especially to those you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away . When a person receives a holiday card , the value is more highly regarded than in times past . <p> A generic card with only a pre-printed name or company name on it , however , does not make a statement that you care . Personalize it with a handwritten note or letter , and hand address the envelope . Use a regular postage stamp not a metered stamp . <p> Lastly , as much as you may be among those who " ca n't stand " receiving those pages of tiny print typed holiday letters that chronicle a friends entire years activities and other news , it is another way to stay in touch with that person over time . Gather up these letters on a Sunday morning with a warm blanket and a warm cup of tea or coffee ( or maybe a bloody Mary ? ) and enjoy reading them to stay in touch . Friendships are maintained when you stay involved in each others lives , no matter the distance across the globe . <p> An Old-Fashioned Way to Stay in Touch <p> And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday card-sending type , another nice gift to people , whether friends or in business , is to give them a call . With Skype and other free calling methods for anywhere in the world , this is fast becoming the most economical and personal way to stay in touch with family , friends , and business clients and associates . <p> Heres wishing you and yours a great holiday season , wherever you may be and whenever you celebrate it ! <h> 3 Responses to " Holiday Gift-Giving From the Heart " <p> Syndi , I always enjoy your information . However I am not sure I agree on sending physical cards as opposed to virtual . We send links to short animations that 1 ) allow us to personalize based on the relationship , and 2 ) demonstrate our graphical capabilities with a SHORT and enjoyable animation . It pains me as much to get a large stack of holiday greeting cards as it does to see any other kind of waste . I do enjoy special cards from people I am personally involved with on special occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients seems a bit wasteful . <p> Barbara : Thank you for writing . Of course there are always exceptions to every guideline and your personalized animated e-cards sound great . Most people are not as gifted to be able to do this . Waste is not the intention of sending cards by regular mail . This is why I make the point that they must be personalized to be truly meaningful . Its just emails are too easily deleted or lost via spam filters , and forgotten . With paper cards they are often kept over time to read again and again , and remembered . Because valuable resources are being used to send such cardstrees , time , moneythey are generally regarded more highly than an email card especially during a down economy . No matter what , we all ( like children ) enjoy receiving and opening something fun by regular mail . I even get excited when receiving and opening my online purchases . b ) A suggestion for the leftover cards is to give them to an elementary school or non-profit kids program to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paste them into new cards . I have an artistic friend named Dianne who did just that one year and I loved getting back my own cards transformed into another item of beauty . She made tree ornaments out of old holiday cards . The bottom line is there is no absolute correct answer to this . Its all about doing whatever you choose to do with integrity and respect . For me , I 'm back to paper cards this year . I tried email cards for several yearsalbeit uniquely designed and personalizedyet as time revealed several friends kept saying they missed getting our card . Greeting cards sent by regular mail are rarely lost and as I believe , they are a gift unto themselves when personalized and sent from the heart . Corporate holiday cards are fine as long as they are personalized are a small gift of appreciation for the relationship you have together . Hope this helps .

In the last decade the rapid boom of the Internet , easy access to broadcast e-mail , and other new technologies in global telecommunications has become an all-too tempting advertising medium .

Senders should include a valid return e-mail address and physical address . Firms should also use their company or brand names in their domain address , and throughout the message . The e-mail should identify the sender and the subject at the beginning . All commercial e-mail should provide customers with a clear electronic option to opt out . And it must be easy to use . A company with multiple affiliates should offer notice and opt-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to perceive . Firms should not acquire e-mail addresses surreptitiously through robots , spiders , and other automated mechanisms without the consumers consent . Marketers are also prohibited from using the dictionary attacks or other mechanisms for fabrication e-mail addresses without providing notice and choice . Opt-out requests must be honored in a reliable and prompt way . " Remove means remove , " the groups said . <p> E-mail lists should not be shared with third parties unless consumers have been given notice and choice . That restriction includes other brands and subsidiaries within the same parent company . <p> A commercial e-mail should contain the senders privacy policy-in the body of the message or via a link . <p> Guidelines Become LawThese e-mail guidelines were then incorporated into Public Law No. 108-197 , the S.877 CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 ( Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography And Marketing Act ) , as signed into law by President Bush in December 2003 , and effective on January- 1 , 2004 .

Gifts for funerals are guided by the culture of the deceased . In some cultures a donation to the deceased favorite charity is welcomed ; others give flowers ; and others give even money to help with funeral expenses . What is most universally appropriate is a note/card to share in your sorrow over the loss of your friend/relative . When in doubt , you can ask a relative or good friend what would be most appropriate . &gt;By : LONG ... Mon , 30 Jan 2017 15:34:04 LONG ... write-up . I definitely appreciate this website .

I have been to funerals where the best outfits some of the attendees had were jeans and cowboy boots . Who cares what you wear really ? You 're there to pay respects to the dead and support the living left behind . I agree do n't  show up in a bikini but do n't  go broke buying an entirely new outfit that is just silly . Maybe I am less judgmental than most but I think the fact that you show up to any funeral at all means that the person who died meant something to you or their family did . Dress as appropriately as possible but do n't  stress over it . &gt;

I got married ( almost 12 years ago , at age 40 ) , in lieu of wedding gifts we suggested that our wedding guests donate to one of several charities that we designated . Nearly all of our guests had to travel from afar to attend our beachfront wedding ( as did the two of us ) , and as adults my husband and I already had all of the household items ( and more ) than we would ever need .

Ann was so grateful she had declined to attend . <p> Invited to the locally held wedding for this same friend , Ann began to look for a wedding gift . She knew her friend was very " particular " so wanted to oblige her by selecting something from her registry . She was provided the names of three stores . The first two included very large items ( including furniture ) with the lowest priced item around $500 . The third store included china and smaller items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a single mug . That is what the bride received from Ann . Based on subsequent comments and actions by the bride , Ann no longer socializes with her . <p> At Anns own wedding , many friends came from out of town and were housed and fed , at the brides familys expense , for an entire weekend . Ironically , several local couples ( including relatives ) who were very late RSVPing and who attended both the rehearsal dinner and the wedding sit-down dinner ( but no showers ) , sent no gifts at all . Two other local guests who said they were coming , never showed for the 2 dinners ( which had to be paid for ) and never sent gifts . Ann had been very careful to keep her registry extremely modest ( many items cost $5-$10 ) but even so , she was aghast at guest thoughtlessness , especially the no-shows by friends and older relatives who should have known better ! <p> My husband and I have traveled to several destination weddings and consider it our " vacation " expense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meaningful item for the couple whether it is on their registry or not . We try to keep the cost of the gift approximately equal to the cost of the wedding dinner ( and other entertainments ) which we figure to be about $150-$200 per person . We might vary it depending on how well we know the couple or whether they are relatives , but generally , we think we are somewhat generous because we want to give the new couple a good start to their married life . On the other hand , I do n't  believe we have ever been invited to a destination wedding when we were also invited to showers . Our only expenses were the travel , hotels and meals , and a wedding gift .

These graces can be simple and subtle , but their impact on peoples perceptions of us can be dramatic . When one practices simple social graces it also positively affects our own self-esteem , giving us the ability to hold our heads high with self-respect .

These are what we call " Enhanced Moments ; " sadly fewer and farther between as the disease progresses . The principles of etiquette that were deeply ingrained in that generation transcend memory loss . It is beginning to appear to me that my sons generation is scarily close to becoming one that is going to drown in a sea of entitlement .
