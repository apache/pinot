If tenants are aware that the state and contents of the property has been itemised , they are more likely to ensure that the property is left in the same condition in which it was originally let . Inventories are particularly important now that tenancy deposit schemes are in place across the UK as they form critical evidence in cases of disputes . <p> At check-in , the inventory should detail the current state of the property , including descriptions , age and condition of the fixtures , fittings and furnishing . This helps landlords and letting agents compare the state of the property at check-in and at check-out . Make sure the inventory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report the condition or cleanliness of items in the property . It must be clear enough for a third party to understand without them being present . <p> If an inventory is not carried out , or if it was insufficiently detailed , then it may not be clear how the property should be left before departure , which could lead to a deposit dispute . Dealing with a deposit dispute can be stressful and costly for those involved so it 's always preferable to avoid this . According to data published by mydeposits earlier this year in relation to England and Wales , currently only 1% of tenancies require formal dispute resolution , while in 60% of tenancies the landlords and agents return the deposit in full and in 39% a deduction is negotiated with tenants . <p> Make sure that your tenancy agreement deals with specific topics such as who takes responsibility for the garden and its upkeep , and the levels of cleaning required at check out . <p> The NLA recommends that landlords or agents conduct a mid-term and a pre-check out inspection which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Landlords and agents can enlist a reputable inventory company prepare the inventory or they may choose to undertake the inventory themselves . Nowadays inventories often include photographs , digitally date stamped or embedded into the printed inventory . Some landlords also prepare video inventories , with commentaries and close ups of fixtures , fittings and furniture . <p> Preparing for check-in <p> The mydeposits Group has helpfully published an inventory guide which includes a number of useful tips for landlords and agents preparing for check-in . The guide recommends that landlords pay special attention to the following key areas at the start of a tenancy : <p> Furnished properties <p> Make sure you note down the state of the structural integrity of the beds , such as the bedframe and supports as well as both sides of the mattresses . <p> Do all drawers work and are the insides of all drawers and wardrobes clean ? <p> Check to see if any of the property 's furniture is already damaged , stained , torn or chipped . <p> Doors and walls <p> Check doors open , close and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of mould or damp on the walls . <p> Note the condition of skirting boards and door frames . <p> Look out for any marks , stains or damage to shelves , surfaces , ceiling , painted areas or wallpaper . <p> Flooring <p> Look for any stains on carpets and any rucked areas or rips to the flooring or carpets . <p> Check for holes and stains in lino or laminate floors and look for chips or signs of stained grout on tiled floors . <p> Windows <p> Check all windows open and close properly and are damage free . Note any damage or staining to curtains , rails and blinds . <p> Deal with any signs of condensation , damp or mould . <p> Kitchen <p> Check the state of the cupboards and worktops , make sure all white goods work , are clean and clear of mould or damage . <p> Make sure the oven , grill and hobs are clean and in full working order . <p> Bathroom <p> Make sure the taps work and sinks and bathtub drain properly . <p> Check the shower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly and are clean . <p> Ensure the toilet is clean , in good working order and flushes properly . <p> Note any stains or damage to the toilet , sink , bathtub , any mirrors or tiles . <p> Deal with any areas with mould . <p> Outdoors <p> Make sure that drives , gardens and paths are presentable , with no rubbish or unwanted items and that they are damage free . <p> Check that fences and garden walls are not broken or damaged . <p> Inspect any garages or sheds for damage and for clutter that may have to be removed . <p> Check that any side gates are secure . <p> Utilities <p> Make sure that all essentials are in working order , that all the lights work , bulbs are in place , fittings are secure , and plug sockets are fully functioning . <p> Also check that the boiler has been checked by a professional and the radiators are functioning . <p> Tenants will need to know the location of all meters and how to take accurate readings to pay for energy and water consumption .

Where not covered specifically by the CoP , landlord/tenant law will , by implication and by default , be considered part of the CoP . <p> In particular : <p> 3.1.1 Tenants will be treated with appropriate courtesy and respect and will not be deliberately misled . <p> 3.1.2 The landlord will act in a fair , honest and reasonable way in all their dealings with the tenant and will not , as far as is reasonable , disclose personal tenant information to other parties without their consent . <p> 3.1.3 The landlord will acknowledge promptly ( usually within two working days of receipt ) all communications received from the tenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of manager or landlord contact details . <p> 3.1.5 The landlord will abide by the rules of any tenancy deposit scheme of which s/he is a member and accepts that any breach of relevant scheme rules may result in a review of NLA membership . <p> 3.1.6 All disrepair in the property for which the landlord is responsible will be attended to promptly , with minimum disturbance to the tenant . <p> 3.1.7 Wherever possible urgent repairs will be dealt with within 3 working days and less urgent repairs as soon as practicable . <p> 3.1.8 The landlord will respect the tenant 's rights to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of the property and will , emergencies excepted , ensure the tenant is given reasonable notice of at least 24 hours when access to the property is required by the landlord or agent . <p> 3.1.9 The landlord will provide the tenant with accommodation that complies with legal requirements relating to the fitness of accommodation ( including , but not limited to , the provision of furniture , gas and electrical supply and appliances and their service/maintenance and repair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local authority occupancy standards ) . <p> 3.1.10 The landlord will , when requested , provide the tenant with a written statement of their tenancy account within five working days . <p> 3.1.11 Before proceedings are commenced , the tenant will be notified of any breach of the tenancy agreement that is to be used as a basis for legal proceedings against the tenant . <h> Determination of a Tenancy <p> 4.1 Members taking and holding a tenancy deposit , or on whose behalf a letting agent takes and holds a tenancy deposit , will do so in accordance with any legal requirements for the protection of deposits which may be in force at the time .

There has been a requirement in England since 1st October 2014 for agents to join a government approved redress scheme which can investigate complaints and where appropriate , determine financial awards . Any complaint concerning a letting or managing agent should be made to the appropriate Redress Scheme . We would however be interested to hear the outcome of your complaint . <p> 5.1 The objective of the NLA Code of Practice is to promote a professional approach to residential lettings and to improve standards in the sector , not to penalise . If members are found not to have met the standards and expectations of the Code , the NLA will , wherever possible , seek rectification and a commitment from the member to avoid repetition . The NLA will support and encourage members towards improving their practices . <p> 5.2 The Code of Practice is an informal and voluntary process , in that the NLA has no power to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to refuse to comply , it would ultimately call into question their membership . <p> 5.3 Any complaint about an NLA member should in the first instance be notified to the member directly in writing who should be given sufficient opportunity to resolve the matter . <p> 5.4 If this has already been done , and you are not satisfied that it has been dealt with properly , you can make a complaint about an NLA member via the following process : A complaint can be made at any time during the tenancy but no later than 12 months after the occurrence which led to the complaint . <p> 5.4.1 Complete the form entitled Complaint about an NLA member . <p> 5.4.2 You should state in what capacity you are making the complaint . If you have been asked to deal with this matter on behalf of another person , you will need to supply a letter of authority to show their agreement for you to do so . <p> 5.4.3 The form will also ask for confirmation as to which part of the Code of Practice you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the facts of the case and keep it short and to the point . Please do not send in paperwork , the Case handler will look at the facts and contact you should they require more information . <p> 5.4.4 Under a protocol approved by the Board of the NLA , your complaint will be reviewed by a case administrator . The case administrator will ensure that the complaint is relevant , appropriate and presents a possible breach of the Code of Practice . This will include checking that the landlord 's NLA membership was in place at the time of the alleged breach of the Code . <p> 5.5 If the NLA Board becomes aware of a possible breach of the Code of Practice , it can initiate an investigation without the need for a formal complaint . <p> 5.6 If a complaint is considered valid , the NLA will acknowledge receipt of the complaint and advise the complainant that it will be investigated .

All parties involved will be advised of the agreed timeframe . This will normally be within 10 business days of the complaint being recorded . This may be extended at the discretion of the NLA or where there are exceptional or unforeseen circumstances . <p> 5.8 Members are required to respond to the complaint in writing on the complaint response form within the specified time limit . Failure to do so within the required time limit will be treated seriously and will be referred to the Director responsible for complaints . Extended or persistent failure to respond could result in the membership being suspended until the matter has been concluded satisfactorily . <p> 5.9 Once the form and landlord 's response have been received , the relevant paperwork will be passed over to a case handler who will review the case . <p> 5.10 The case handler will attempt to resolve the complaint via mediation between all parties involved .

The remedies may include : <p> 5.13.1 Recommending that the landlord completes development within the NLA relating to the nature of the complaint . <p> 5.13.2 Advising the landlord ( and/or tenant ) in writing of the NLA 's recommendation of good practice to adopt in the future relating to the issues raised in the complaint . <p> 5.13.3 All recommendations will be made following consultation with the director in charge of complaints . <p> 5.13.4 If such recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case within 3 months of the decision to ensure recommendations have been adopted . If it is found that this is not the case the matter will be referred back to the Board . <p> 5.14 If the Board accepts a report that a member has breached the CoP and decides that the breach is of sufficient gravity to warrant exclusion from membership of the NLA , the Director in charge of NLA complaints will write to the member concerned advising them that the Board is ' minded to ' exclude them from membership . In this situation , the following procedure will apply : <p> 5.14.1 Immediate suspension of member benefits <p> 5.14.2 The member will be offered the opportunity to make written representations within 28 days as to why the Board 's decision should not be confirmed . Oral representations will not be accepted . <p> 5.14.3 The Board will take account of any written representations and either confirm or amend its decision . <p> 5.14.4 The Director in charge of NLA complaints will write to the member informing them of the Board 's decision . <p> 5.15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal the Board 's decision . Appeals will be considered by an independent adjudicator . The party submitting an appeal must submit this in writing and agree to : <p> 5.15.1 To accept as final the decision of the independent adjudicator . <p> 5.15.2 To lodge with the NLA an amount to be determined by the NLA to cover costs and disbursements incurred by the NLA . This amount will be returned to the appellant should the adjudicator not uphold the NLA decision . <p> 5.16 The Code can not and does not supersede the normal operation of the law . A complainant retains the right throughout the process to choose to go to law ; in this event , the complaint would be halted , as the courts take precedence over the Code . Similarly , the Code of Practice can not be used to re-open an issue on which the courts have already adjudicated .

With York being the nearest Branch still holding meetings I attended the York ones a couple of times , but naturally it is predominately about York , with York Local Authority representatives giving talks and York Landlord Tenant issues being discussed . Is there any likelihood of Leeds having its own Branch meetings again ? and covering Leeds issues ! <p> Thank you for raising this issue . I manage the NLA reps across the UK , and we try as much as possible to run our meetings where there is the greatest demand , with an eye ( of course ) to the cost .

@@76817272 @5517272/ <h> Primary links 3 Level 67417 @qwx687417 <h> Capital Gains Tax ( CGT ) <h> Capital Gains Tax ( CGT ) is a tax charged on the profits made when an asset is disposed of ' . For landlords this normally means that they face a significant bill whenever they sell part of their portfolio which has appreciated in value . <p> CGT is not payable on the sale of an individual 's main residence , provided that they are entitled to full Private Residence Relief . However sale of any other property , land or interest in land - like rental property - where a gain is made will generally be chargeable . <p> Since 2007 , there have been a number of changes to the way in which CGT is charged , including the removal of many reliefs previously accessible to landlords.The current rate applicable to qualifying gains made on the sale of property is 28 percent , and is payable irrespective of whether a landlord intends to reinvest these gains . <p> This is not the case for other ' businesses ' which may take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon disposal of many business assets , businesses are able to claim roll-over ' relief against CGT provided that the gain is reinvested in the business . <p> For instance , a company may sell land or buildings used for the purpose of their trade and claim tax relief against any profit made on the sale provided that the gain is reinvested in the business . Hence encouraging reinvestment and the development of the company . Such relief also allows a degree of flexibility , allowing businesses to target their resources in the most appropriate manner , as needed . <p> Landlords , when disposing of any part of their portfolio , may not take advantage such roll-over ' relief in respect of residential property by virtue of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 . This means that private-residential landlords are faced with a considerable barrier to disposing of property , which represents their most important assets in connection with their lettings business . This hinders continued investment in their business , reducing the flexibility of the PRS and the ability of landlords to adapt to changing markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover from potentially poor investments and provide housing where it is most needed . <p> It is the NLA 's belief that landlords selling property and reinvesting the funds released should be able to do so without being presented with a significant CGT bill . <p> Private-residential landlords should have access to the same level of roll-over ' relief available to other businesses and CGT should be charged only on gains released from a business as profit . <p> It is also crucial to differentiate between assets held on a long-term basis as an investment or aspect of business and those intended for short-term speculation . HM Treasury must do more to reduce the burden on landlords by introducing a mechanism which reduced a landlord 's exposure to CGT relative to the time which they have owned their property . This could be achieved by the reintroduction of taper relief or the use of a diminishing CGT rate . <h> Comments <p> Totally agree with previous comments on the unfair retrospective implications of this tax . When we purchased our first rental properties , 16 years ago , CGT was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a stroke , a perfectly legal long-term investment which , when purchased , would have been free of CGT on disposal , became subject to tax at 28% of current value . Surely the reintroduction of taper relief is something which NLA should be pursuing much more vigourously , not least because it would encourage longer-term investment in rental properties and ( according to an article in the July 2014 edition of NLA UK Landlord magazine ) also make UK more comparable with France - exemption at 15 years - and Germany - exemption at 10 years - in this respect . The current system does nothing to discourage short term speculation , which is detrimental to providing stable HOMES for private renters . These type of assets are quite different to other financial investments in this respect . <p> Recent comments from the NLA team state that the Chancellor has missed a trick by failing to extend the business asset roll - over tax relief to buy to let landlords and hopefully the NLA will continue to press the Chancellor to amend this . However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lobbying Parliament and the Chancellor to re introduce Taper relief for long term property investors . The removal of Taper relief did not just affect our industry from the date it was removed but it has created punitive RETROSPECTIVE taxation to the many landlords who purchased property 30 or 40 years ago as a long term investment with a view to purchasing pensions with the proceeds from the sale of their properties at retirement age . Their pension pot will now be taxed at 28% which is a huge money grab from the Government against long term investment . I believe that the NLA needs to make a much stronger case for its members against this tax otherwise the Chancellor will succeed in getting away with this injustice . <p> Non U.K. residents are exempt from Capital Gains Tax on the Gains they make from the disposal of properties in the U.K. The same applies to foreign companies owning rental properties in the U.K. <p> This gives an unfair advantage to foreign Landlords . <p> The Government can perhaps finance the CGT Roll- over relief and the CGT inflation indexation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CGT on the capital gains realised in the U.K. After all , the foreign Landlords have to pay CGT on their world wide capital gains to the government of their country . So , whatever CGT they pay in the U.K. , it will be deducted from their global liability . <p> Considering the fact that most of the foreign landlords operate in Central London where the property prices are high , the potential CGT is very high . <p> For example , it does not make any sense for an E. U. resident not to pay the CGT on CGains arising in the U.K. to the U.K. government , but to pay it into his own government . Whereas a UK resident has to pay CGT in the EU country where the gain arose e.g. he pays CGT from the sale of his holiday home in Spain to the spanish government . <p> As a retired HM Inspector of Taxes I could not believe that Gordon Brown got away with removing indexation from the Capital Gains Tax regime . I can not remember a time when there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset valuation that comes simply from inflation . In addition the rental property market now is vastly different from when rules governing Schedule A ( income from property rules ) were formed . Then it was simply seen as unearned income with very little involvement from the landlord . Matters are very different now and a lot of property portfolios are run very much on business lines with little distinction from other businesses . In fact many landlords have invested in property as part of their pension portfolio . Whilst I hope the Chancellor will recognise this I think that in the present economic climate this is unlikely . It is a shame because I think successive governments have , whilst relying on the private rented sector to meet demand , systematically eroded the benefits of being a landlord too such an extent that landlords must be asking themselves if it is worthwhile to continue .

Does the tenant not have to give 1 months notice to quit , or can they just inform the Landlord say 2- 3 days before the End of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the Landlord at least 1 month notice to quit ? <p> I can not find any clause in the NLA tenancy agreement which clarifies this . <p> Does the tenant not have to give written notice to " End " the tenancy contract . <p> I am of the opinion that really they should give at least 1 months notice to quit if they intend to leave on the End of Fixed Term date . Please can someone clarify ? <p> An AST only rolls over into a statutory periodic tenancy if both parties agree . If the landlord does not wish to continue into a periodic tenancy then the landlord must serve two months notice . If the tenant does not wish to continue into a periodic tenancy , the tenant can leave on the last day without having given any notice to the landlord ! It is therefore a good idea to include in the AST a clause stating that the tenant must serve one months notice in writing to end the tenancy at any time ( fixed or periodic ) . If you have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written notice at the end of the fixed term , the tenant is then in breech of the AST . You could therefore be within your rights to claim money from the deposit until the end of the month or until you get a new tenant whatever the soonest . But I would check my interpretation with an NLA legal adviser to be sure . Its always a good idea to touch base with the tenant and remind them to serve notice if they intend to leave , at least then you reduce the risk of a surprise / miss-understanding . <p> I have just been on the Landlords Law site and they mention additional information regarding SPT . If I understood it correctly , renewing a AST gives the landlord an opportunity to increase the rent if he chooses to do so , whereas SPT does not necessarily has this option . Is this true ? <p> A new AST is a new agreement and as such new terms and conditions can be negotiated . The attraction of an SPT is if things go wrong ( such as rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than during the fixed term of an AST . What I do in my AST is accept that the AST can run on as a SPT under the same T&amp;C 's after the fixed term if both parties agree . I also have an annual rent review clause that allows a rent review to take place on each annual anniversary of the first rent payment date of the fixed term . <p> I did a Fixed Term contract for my tenants initially for 6 months and then extended this for a further 12 months . They are as good as gold and I believe they wish to remain long term tenants and so wish to offer them a SPT . Can I simply write to them to offer this with the notice periods for us both ( 2 months from me as landlord , 4 weeks from them as tenants ) as an additional Annexe from the original AST . I also wanted to remind them of potential rent increases so it would n't be a surprise if I need to put anything in place . I have written this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback .

@@76817292 @5517292/ <h> Neighbour Harassment of Tenants <h> Neighbour Harassment of Tenants <p> Ever since I placed a letting board in the front garden I have had issues with the neighbour of my end of terrace property . Initially they caused an obstruction in the shared access to the Tenant 's garage . They have also registered a nuisance ( noise ) complaint to the Council Authority . I also get regular phone calls from them about noise . They use threatening and abusive behaviour ( language / posturing ) against my Tenants and their guests . To date : No noise has been recorded by the Council that could be considered a statutory nuisance . The police have issued a warning to the neighbour with regard to the obstruction , the obstruction has since been moved . The neighbour has been issued an ASBO warning with regard to their behaviour . My concern is that my Tenants are becoming intolerant of the situation , the property is not the home they had hoped for . It is now highly likely that the Tenants will leave at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position regarding loss of rent and damages if I am unable to let the property because of these issues ? <p> It sounds to me that the neighbour has a perceived ( or otherwise ) problem with noise . In my experience neighbour tenant disputes are often a bit ' tit for tat ' . E.g. You make a noise , I make a noise , You block the pavement by leaving your bin out , I block the garage with my car etc etc . If this is n't addressed this can often escalate quite quickly . <p> I 'm not surprised to hear that the council has not recorded noise loud enough to be a statutory nuisance . In my experience the council only has one or two sets of calibrated equipment that have to be shared so the neighbour may not have even had this installed yet . <p> I would suggest that you call the neighbour of your property and arrange a time to visit them ideally when there is noise happening . They would probably have been advised by environmental health to keep a noice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it on the visit . This will achieve a number of things , It will tell your neighbour that you care about them and allow you to see if there is actually an issue with noise as well as the opportunity to understand what the neighbours issue ( if there is one ) really is . Some councils offer a dispute resolution service for neighbour disputes so if you feel you can get both parties to pursue this you might suggest it as an option . <p> If your tenants choose to leave at the end of a tenancy there is n't much you can do . Attempting to recover damages on am expired contract really wo n't be worth the cost of attempting it . In my opinion , issuing a claim on a neighbour is the ' nuclear ' option which would only further antagonise the neighbour ( and it will be your next tenants who get the flack ) <p> Thanks , since the ASBO warning things have quietened down , at least the police have some influence . I have also since heard that the neighbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose if you own a house and more and more Tenants are settling into properties close to you one would have some concerns . Unfortunately the aggressive behaviour of the neighbour does not lend itself to mediation between the parties at this point in time , I have suggested this - I think for now I 'll try and remain a calming influence , difficult though ! <p> 1 . Background : My tenant ( who is actually my daughter ) has been harassed on several occasions by her neighbour . The more recent incidents have been documented . The police have visited the neighbour , but there has been no improvement in his behaviour . <p> On Saturday 8 August the neighbour verbally threatened violence against my daughter . As you may expect , my daughter is scared and very upset by this recent incident . She now feels unable to continue living in her house when subjected to such intimidating , aggressive and threatening behaviour . <p> She has reported this latest incident to the Police . We understand that a police officer will visit her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not confident , that this will lead to the neighbour refraining from such behaviour . <p> 2 . Advice , please : I plan to make a case to the county court to get an anti-harassment Civil Injunction successfully served on the neighbour . Does anyone have a similar experience , and can please offer any tips for achieving my objective - which is to get the anti-social behaviour stopped . Thanks . <p> Hi 44185 , my tenants were advised that is they receive a threat of violence then this would be considered as an emergency and they should call 999 . I would advise that she does the same . The tenant could also approach a solicitor to serve a court injunction ( or at least threaten to serve a court injunction ) . I would certainly talk to a Citizens Advice Bureau solicitor to get their take on this . <p> ( ref : 44185 ) I do wonder what the root cause of all this might be since , unless the neighbour is affected by mental illness which creates a propensity for violence/abuse , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backstory here ? The 999 approach Rob suggests is absolutely the correct move wherever and whenever there is a threat of violence . The police should issue a ' code ' should there be a pattern , which is all your daughter would need to say on the next call to them and which prioritises the emergency call . If your daughter lives alone or is frequently so and ' it ' happens more than once , I would insist on it . It is important the visiting officer does n't categorise this as a Landlord/Tenant ( civil ) type dispute . They should n't do . Make sure they do n't .

@@76817301 @5517301/ <p> I have a question with regard to the best way to proceed with rent arrears . I have a managing agent manages my property . The property was initially let to a working couple with a young child . The tenants have a rent arrears for 16 days . The agent has sent 3 letters to demand for rent . The tenants said that she ( one of the tenants ) has lost her job and is now on housing benefit and the council is doing a check on her at the moment and has not paid her the benefit . This is why her rent is late . The agent phoned the council and they confirmed that she is on the benefit and told him that they have requested some information from her and she has now submitted these . They will now take a look . However , they did not say when they will do it and whether they will continue to pay the housing benefit . <p> My question is <p> If the rent is not paid by Oct 1 , the tenants would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section 8 , gound 8 notice . Given the above situation - ie council did not pay her and she has a young child , ( this is her defence as she blames on council for not paying her ) will the court be sympathetic to her and still give me the mandatory eviction order assuming the rent is not paid until the proceeding of the court case ? Any views on this will be most welcome .

Any advice would be very welcome . Many of you might not know but the tenant has a right to apply to this tribunal to decide an AST rent , which is what has happened to me . Thanks for any advice or information . <p> You do n't say what the tenants ' complaint is . Assuming they are objecting to the amount increased : I do n't have any experience of this tribunal , however , I suspect they operate on the same basis of most and it will be up to you , the landlord , to prove any increase in rent is acceptable .

It 's a good move , firms up your stance and you should get them out one way or the other . Good luck with it all . Regs , Peter <p> Thanks Peter for the support . I will indeed keep you informed as to the outcome of the tribunal 's visit to the property and the subsequent decision . I 'm sure that the older landlords , myself included , will remember the days of the rent tribunal and the rent officer when , having agreed a rent with a new tenant , the tenant was free to immediately appeal the rent which was normally reduced . Then the rent was fixed for the accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tenancy . Having thought it was all in the past it was disappointing to find out about this . Thank heavens for Section 21 . <p> Hi there . I think a section 8 based on 8 weeks arrears has its loopholes . A savvy tenant knows that all they have to do is pay a small amount to get the arrears below an 8 week amount and then the section 8 will no longer be applicable . Just finished a section 21 procedure that went all the way to needing a bailiff in order to get the tenants out . I told the bailiff that it took me 5 months to get from the date of issuing the section 21 to finally having them oust the tenants . The bailiff said that I was lucky and that 5 months was quick compared to other cases he has been dealing with : ( I wish you lots of luck . Do double check that your section 21 's two month notice ends after the date on her AST . It is my understanding that it can not be enforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go periodic once the first 6 month AST comes to an end ) . Also I am hoping that your section 21 has given the tenant 2 months ' notice based on her rental date ? ie the 2 month notice period is not to be calculated from the date of its issue but rather in a way that covers 2 rental dates for your tenant . Unfortunately mistakes are there to teach us lessons . Is there anything you can think of to do differently in the future to not have this happen again ? Do you think you were very thorough in your procedures and yet a rogue tenant got past you as will sometimes be the case ? All the best , <p> Thanks for the advice 133606 . Just recently I was granted possession with a Section 21 thanks to excellent advice given by the NLA . With a different case also a section 8 , also thanks to NLA advice . It 's correct what you mention about the eight weeks not being valid if some arrears are paid when you get to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one must also add sections 10 and 11 , these are discretionary and it will be up to the court if they wish to grant possession . <p> Update . On the 28th the accommodation ( studio flat ) was inspected . Two gentlemen turned up giving their names but not informing as to their qualifications . The inspection was fairly quick , between five and ten minutes . Present , apart from me and the two inspectors , were the tenant ( it 's single occupancy ) and a friend of the tenant . Feeble attempt by tenant to complain about a blind and loose toilet seat ( yes really ! ) brought acknowledgement from the inspectors when I pointed out that it was the first I heard about it and a tenant needs to inform if there are problems , which obliviously she had not . I also saw one of the inspectors smile when I added that I also did not go round checking loose toilet seats ! No questions where asked about any of my costs , services , water rates , council tax , insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interesting to note that in the application made by the tenant , it 's clearly stated that the tribunal can not make a determination unless " the rent payable is significantly higher than the rent which the landlord might reasonably be expected to get in comparison " etc ( other similar properties in the locality ) . I can assure all you landlords reading this that I 've been owner of my properties , 25 studios and 3 flats , for 42 years ( in the family since 1943 ! ) in excellent condition and rents are at the lower end of comparables , I never have voids which proves my rents are correct . Certainly not " significantly higher " , yet still they feel they have the authority to proceed . I 'll just finish saying that the tenant is still in arrears since 30 June ! I shall of course update when I get the tribunal 's decision , about a week from now they tell me . <p> Update . Following on from the inspection on 28th August , I have received the tribunal 's decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the levels of rents charged in the locality " . Hence they are not making a determination and the rent , as fixed by me , stands . For the curiosity of those following this , the tenant has still not paid any rent from 30th June . Tuesday is the expiry of her section 21 notice so Wednesday I will file for possession . Please allow me this consideration . What the tenant has lawfully done is to challenge the rent that she and I had decided in March and that she had signed an agreement accepting . The fact that she is not paying is , of course , irrelevant , although frustrating to say the least . I ask a rhetorical question . Is there anywhere one can go to purchase something , anything , be it a sweet or a Rolls Royce and then go to a tribunal to say that the price agreed is excessive ? This is exactly the scenario here . Thanks to all of those who have supported me and I hope that this may be of some help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . Now with the new leader of Labour just announced , we should all expect the worse and all us evil landlords will pay for our nastiness !

@@76817322 @5517322/ <h> Primary links Second level 67417 @qwx687417 <h> What is fair wear and tear ? <p> Many costly landlord-tenant disputes have arisen as a result of differing interpretations of what is fair wear and tear . Knowing what is reasonable is , of course , critical when it comes to returning a tenant 's deposit . <p> mydeposits , the tenancy deposit protection scheme operator jointly owned by the NLA and Hamilton Fraser Insurance , has created a guide for landlords , offering advice on how to make a fair judgement call at the end of the tenancy period . <p> According to Eddie Hooker , Chief Executive of mydeposits , " Wear and tear is always a hot topic of debate and is very much situation-dependent . We have worked with landlords and our in-house disputes team to compile the guide , which is by no means definitive , but hopefully gives landlords some benchmarks and examples to consider when checking out their tenants . " <h> Nine Guiding Principles <p> Unlike office leases which can require tenants to leave the property as they found it , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and tear . <p> Unfortunately , but perhaps unsurprisingly , there are no precise rules on what is ' reasonably acceptable ' . Is that carpet just well used or irretrievably stained ? What about picture hooks left on the sitting room wall ? Or the cooker that looks as if it has produced a good three meals a day , every day ? <p> The House of Lords defines fair wear and tear as : " Reasonable use of the premises by the Tenant and the ordinary operation of natural forces . " When do natural forces ' become ' extreme heavy use ' or worse ? <p> Tohelp fill the gap left by current legislation , mydeposits offers the following nine pointers to help landlords decide what 's fair and what 's not . Clearly there are financial consequences when it comes to returning all or only part of a tenant 's deposit , so they should be viewed in the context of each particular tenancy . <h> 1 . Length of tenancy <p> The longer the tenancy , the more natural wear and tear will occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deduction , for example in the case of a carpet , include : <p> how much wear does a carpet in your own home show after one , two or three years ? <p> what was its condition in the first place ? Was it brand new or has it already seen a few tenancies come and go ? Take account of all these factors before you decide what is fair . <h> 2 . Number and age of occupiers <p> The more bedrooms and occupants , the higher the wear and tear in all the common parts ( sitting room , passages , stairs , bathrooms and kitchen ) . If some of the occupants are children , factor that in too . Scuffs and scrapes are unavoidable in normal family life . A property occupied by a single person will see far less wear than a family of four , so bear this in mind when it 's time for tenants to check out . <h> 3 . Wear and tear versus actual damage <p> When is deterioration in the property classified as damage rather than normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly damage and would require either replacement or repair by a specialist . Light marks on the carpet might have to be viewed as unavoidable : fist marks in the plaster would not be . Equally , damage such as nail varnish spills on the floor or iron burns that have occurred due to negligence could see the tenant liable for repair . mydeposits advises landlords to consider whether the item has been damaged or worn out through natural use versus sheer negligence when making a judgement call . In a dispute about whether cleaning/repair is necessary versus complete replacement at the end of the tenancy , an adjudicator will examine the Check-in/out report , Statement of condition and any photos/videos in order to make an assessment of the condition of the property in relation to the original condition . <h> 4 . Quality of the accommodation <p> Another consideration is the quality or fabric of the property itself . Many new builds tend not to be quite as robust as older properties or conversions . Walls , partitions and internal painted surfaces tend to be thinner and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of the property . This inevitably means that there is a greater need for redecoration at the end of the tenancy period . <h> 5 . Prevention <p> There are a number of ways in which wear and tear can be kept to a minimum . <p> Firstly , keeping tenants happy so that they choose to extend their tenancies means you will reduce tenant turnover and will not be redecorating/renewing the property as frequently as you would for shorter tenancies . <p> Secondly , if tenants are in for longer periods of time , say two years plus , try to freshen up the property at regular intervals . For example , you could replace the carpet or paint a room . Strategic upgrades or enhancement of the property on a regular basis help to maintain the standard of the property and reduce the need for refurbishment at the end of the tenancy period . Treating the property as an owner-occupier means that you are ultimately minimising the wear and tear and need for redecoration when the tenant moves out . <p> Finally , set your expectations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning and maintenance can keep a property in good condition . Perhaps conduct a regular check every three months or so , particularly early on in the tenancy , to check that everything is in order . <h> 6 . Photo &amp; video evidence <p> Photo and video inventories are a helpful means of recording the condition of the property pre and post the tenancy and should provide a clear record of the property prior to its occupation . Equally , being able to document and provide photographic/video evidence to support a claim against a tenant will help everyone know where they stand . Make sure all photographic and video evidence is clearly dated . <p> You should , for example , try to capture photos/video footage of burn marks/permanent carpet stains , damage to flooring , scratches/damage to woodwork , tears and rips in furniture . Photos and video evidence on their own may not be sufficient , so support this with a comprehensive , detailed inventory . <p> If you are preparing the inventory yourself , rather than using an independent specialist , ensure that the tenant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and signs a copy so that they understand , and have a chance to discuss with you , what deductions you are proposing to take from the deposit . <p> Ultimately , the more evidence you have the better , so keep the inventory , photos , video , receipts and correspondence safe . <h> 7 . Common sense <p> It is important to correctly describe the condition of items when listing them e.g. if something is down as brand new ' it needs supporting bills/receipts to prove this . <h> 8 . The adjudication process <p> Remember that the adjudication process in the event of a dispute , is independent and like a court of law , evidence based . An adjudicator can not ' assume ' and can only make a decision based on the evidence provided to him/her . You can not challenge an adjudication decision unless it is via a court of law . The more evidence you produce and the more transparent you are with the tenant the higher your chance of success if a dispute is brought against you . mydeposits can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not tell you what evidence will be acceptable to the adjudicator and what will not . <h> 9 . Best practice <p> Wear and tear is a topic that is open to interpretation . Ultimately , as a landlord , your aim is firstly to minimise the level of wear and tear in your properties and secondly to ensure that you have covered all bases in the unlikely event of a dispute with your tenant over the return of the deposit . <h> Comments <p> The last tenant burned the work-surface both sides of the cooker . The kitchen was totally refurbished in 2015 . These tenants were in the property August 2014 - 2016 . The burns appeared during their tenancy .

@@76817332 @5517332/ <h> Services 67417 @qwx687417 <h> Our FAQs <h> Can you cover landlords ' contents insurance only ? <p> Yes , you can . If you buy contents cover you will automatically receive Public/Property Owners Liability cover with a limit of -5,000,000 with the Superior Insurance policy or -2,000,000 with the Standard Insurance policy at no extra cost . You might also wish to consider including some cover for Loss of Rent as this is extremely cost effective and can give you added protection in the event of a claim at the property where the tenant is forced to move out for the duration of repairs . <h> Do you cover the rent if the tenant stops paying ? <p> Loss of Rent only covers you as a result of an insured peril . For example , if your property was severely damaged by a flood or fire and your property was deemed to be uninhabitable your tenant could be forced to arrange alternative accommodation . For the duration of repairs until your tenant can move back in , or until the property is reinstated to a habitable condition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sum insured . If you are specifically looking to cover your rental income in the event that the tenant simply stops paying or leaves the premises owing you rent , you should purchase Rent Guarantee and Legal Expenses insurance . The NLA Rent Guarantee policy offers this cover . Details of the cover can be found on **36;350;TOOLONG <h> Is my bathroom or fitted kitchen covered within buildings insurance ? <p> All fixtures and fittings are covered under the building section of our policy . If you are a leaseholder and the freeholder is insuring the building we would suggest that you contact the freeholder to confirm the cover that they have in place for your property . You should also check the terms of your lease to be certain of which items you are liable to insure . Something to bear in mind however is that your freeholder will not have any idea of the improvements that you will have made so the cover that they have in place will only serve to reinstate the property to its ' original standard . If you have replaced your bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pocket . We would usually recommend that if you have fitted your own fixtures and fittings it is worth taking additional cover for these items to ensure that you are fully protected . <h> How long will it take for me to receive my policy documents ? <p> If you take out the policy on line you will have instant access to your entire set of documents " that is your policy schedule , policy wording , cover summary and receipt . If you prefer to buy your cover over the phone documents will still be emailed to you to ensure that you receive these quickly . <h> How do I work out my rebuild value ? <p> Whilst we can advise you on what to insure we are not qualified to give advice on how to calculate your rebuilding cost . There are a number of ways that you can obtain this however , such as <p> Obtain a valuation from a Chartered Surveyor " this is our recommendation as it is the best way to ensure that you have an accurate and up to date valuation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased the property recently with a mortgage you will usually find that the lender has undertaken a Homebuyers report or survey and this will usually contain a recommended rebuild valuation as the lender uses this information to assess the viability of the loan . This is not always as accurate as a Surveyors valuation but is the next best thing and will be accurate enough for an insurer to accept should the worst happen . <p> Finally , the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( RICS ) does provide information on their website to assist property owners in calculating the rebuilding cost for their property . This method of valuation is only as reliable as the calculations that you undertake and can be fairly restrictive as it only caters for certain property types . The calculation is based on the square footage of the property so have your tape measure and calculator handy ! You can visit their website for more details by clicking www.bcis.co.uk <h> Does your landlord policy include legal cover ? <p> Our policy covers some Legal Defence costs as part of the Property Owners Liability cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Legal Expenses insurance to assist you with tenant disputes then you can purchase additional cover from us in the form of the NLA Rent Guarantee policy . <h> If I let my property furnished can I obtain contents cover ? Is there a minimum sum I can insure for ? <p> Yes you can arrange cover for your contents at the premises . Our policy has a minimum sum insured of -5,000 <h> Will my cover continue if the tenants move out ? <p> Yes . Certain terms and conditions will apply dependant on the length of time your property remains vacant . Details of the conditions can be found in our Summary of Cover and our Policy Wording . <h> Is the building sum insured the same as the value of the property ? <p> No , these two figures can be vastly different . For example if you own a house in an area where land values are high , should the unthinkable happen and the house be totally destroyed you would still own the land . A house can usually be rebuilt for a fraction less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebuild values differs greatly dependant on where your property is located so we would refer you to our question and answer on how to work out rebuild values for more information . <h> Can I insure all types of property under the landlord 's insurance scheme ? <p> We can insure houses , maisonettes , flats and apartments . Insuring flats or apartments for Buildings cover can be difficult as it is always more appropriate for the freeholder to insure all of the properties within a block as this makes handling claims far easier . We can provide cover for buildings on flats or apartments if you are legally liable to do so under the terms of your lease . The exception to this is properties based in Scotland where it is common practice for individual leaseholders to insure their own properties . <h> Can I pay my landlords insurance premium monthly by direct debit ? <p> Yes , we can arrange for you to pay your premium over 10 months by direct debit . We arrange this with an external finance provider and an interest charge will apply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply or for more details of the arrangement . <h> Do I have to arrange landlords contents insurance if I let my properties on a part-furnished basis ( e.g. with carpets , curtains/blinds and domestic appliances ) ? <p> No , there is no obligation ( legal or otherwise ) to insure your contents . <h> I let out a leasehold flat and the freeholder arranges buildings cover , do I need to arrange any insurance myself ? <p> Your freeholder 's policy will cover the buildings and will also cover their Liability to you as the leaseholder but this would not protect you should the tenant or a guest injure themselves whilst at your property . We would strongly recommend that you purchase Property Owners Liability Cover as this will then protect you should the tenant try to make a claim for injury . In addition , whilst not as important , we would always recommend that you consider arranging cover for any contents you have at the premises and Loss of Rent . <h> If I let a property fully-furnished , will I have to arrange cover for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to insure your contents at the premises , however under our policy if you do require contents , then the minimum sum insured would be -5,000 <h> What if my let property has had subsidence , or has been underpinned ? <p> We are unable to insure properties which have previously suffered from subsidence or have been underpinned . Our advice is to make contact with the previous insurers for the property as they will usually agree to reinsure the property with no additional requirements <h> What happens if my property is damaged and rendered uninhabitable ? Will my policy pay out for alternative accommodation for the tenant ? <p> Loss of rent is only covered in the event of an insured peril , for example if the premises has had a major fire or flood and your tenants have had to move out due to the premises being uninhabitable then you can claim for loss of rent . If there is no insured peril then unfortunately the policy will not cover this . <p> Alternative accommodation will not normally be paid unless the tenancy agreement expressly states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation . Usually the tenant will source their own alternative accommodation for the period of time that the property remains uninhabitable and the landlord makes a claim for loss of rent <h> My front door was rendered irreparable by police gaining entry , they say it is down to me to repair and they are not liable . Does my insurance cover me for this ? <p> The police are correct . Our landlords policy will only provide cover for costs incurred as a result of a Public Authority gaining access to your property for the purpose of extinguishing a fire . Damage caused by a Public Authority for any other reason is not insured . <h> Do you include cover for a Loss Adjuster to negotiate a claim on my behalf ? <p> A loss adjuster is appointed by your insurers to deal with the claim on their behalf and to negotiate a settlement with you . The Adjusters fees would be met by your insurer . Should you choose to employ the services of a claims assessor or agent then you will be liable for their costs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the advantages and disadvantages of insuring all my properties on one policy or having individual policies per property ? <p> Apart from the ease of administration on your part , the main advantage would be the premium savings that we can offer you . Having a single policy in place which you can add properties to or delete them from makes it far easier to manage , is more cost effective and saves you from having to repeat the same information every time you require a new quote . <h> Why do you want to know my lenders details ? What happens if I change lenders and forget to tell my insurers ? <p> Mortgage lenders will always require their interest to be noted on an insurance policy so that , in the event of a major claim , they can protect themselves from financial loss ( in which case any claims settlement will usually be issued to the lender to clear the outstanding mortgage before any balance of payment is released to you ) . <p> It is also condition of any mortgage or commercial loan that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of the loan . Where a lenders interest is noted on a policy we are duty bound to notify the lenders if a policy is cancelled or sums insured are reduced . <h> This used to be my home , why can I not simply continue on with my existing policy ? <p> Standard household policies are not designed to cover rented property due to the increased exposure to insurers . For example you need Property Owners liability cover to protect you should your tenant or their guest injure themselves at your property . Additionally if you disclose to your home insurance provider that you are no longer occupying the property and that you have let it to tenants they will almost certainly cancel your cover and advise you to arrange more suitable cover . <h> What happens if the tenant is away for a weekend and there is a water leak ? If the tenant been there they would have been able to turn water off but the Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) has said it is an unfair tenancy agreement term to insist that tenants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be away . <p> If a tenant was away for up to 14 days your full policy cover would continue in the normal way . This is usually sufficient to cover most tenant absences ( holidays , business travel etc ) , however , if the tenant was away for a longer period of time , full cover would still continue but certain conditions might apply ( these can be found in our Summary of Cover and Policy Wording which can be downloaded from our website ) . Ultimately the best course of action is to ask your tenant to notify you if they are planning to be away from the property for an extended period of time so that you can ensure that full cover is maintained .

In the first of a new in-depth question and answer series , Richard Price advises on the respective responsibilities of landlords and tenants to prevent pests , and what to do if your property has a pest problem . <h> Q. What are the main pests landlords should be aware of ? <p> A. Richard Price : Pests commonly found in this country include insects such as fleas , bed bugs , cockroaches , ants and wasps , as well as mice , rats , pigeons , foxes , and even squirrels . Mice and rats are probably the most common , although the NLA 's Advice Line has taken calls over the years about most of the above . <h> Q. What are the respective responsibilities of landlords and tenants in relation to pests ? <p> A. RP : As a landlord , you would be expected , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that neither attracts them nor makes it easy for them to occupy the property . The Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 is still in force and you could be served with a statutory notice to eradicate the pests if an infestation at your property is causing a problem for tenants or neighbours . If your property is infested and deemed to be in a verminous condition ' you could also be obliged to take action to remove the risk under Public Health laws . <p> These notices could be served on the tenants if it is deemed to be their responsibility , being caused by their lifestyle or actions , for example <p> by leaving food lying around on surfaces or failing to dispose properly of waste . If the tenant who caused the problem has moved out , the landlord will usually be obliged to eradicate the pests before the next tenant moves in . If the problem only became apparent after new tenants moved in , but it was obvious that it was n't their fault , again , the landlord would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layout and construction meaning that a dwelling can not be readily kept clean and hygienic <p> Access into , and harborage within the dwelling , for pests <p> Inadequate and unhygienic provision for storing and disposal of household waste . If inspectors consider there is sufficient evidence of a problem , they may ask the landlord to rectify it under this legislation . <h> Q. What steps can landlords take to prevent pests infesting their property ? <p> A. RP : Prevention is better than cure , as an infestation can cost landlords dear in terms of callouts from pest control companies and lost rent if the property is uninhabitable for any period of time due to a serious infestation . <p> Practical steps landlords can take to avoid pests include : <p> Making sure the layout of the property makes it easy to keep clean , and prevent build up of dirt and dust that could enable organisms to multiply . <p> Areas intended for the personal washing sanitation or for food storage , preparation and cooking should be capable of being maintained in a hygienic condition . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unprotected holes . Grilles should be used to protect breaches of the walls where these are necessary such as for ventilation . <p> Spaces under floors , roof spaces or service ducting should be effectively sealed off from the living area , although there should be access in case an infestation does occur . <p> There should be suitable provision for storing refuse , both inside and when awaiting collection or disposal outside the property . <h> Q. If an infestation occurs , what should landlords do ? <p> A. RP : Call the local council first , as they often have a pest control section and may deal with the problem for a little or no fee . Failing that , use a reputable company to sort it out . <p> The British Pest Control Association ( www.bpca.org.uk/ ; tel : 01332 294288 ) represents commercial pest control companies and includes a directory of members . <h> Comments <p> Assuming the landlords ' property is in good , well maintained ' hole-less ' condition ; has no antecedent history of ' infestation ' as an ' unfurnished ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes bought second hand ) and within a brief time period a mouse begins to appear ... surely this would support the view that it is the tenant at own costs and not the landlord who is liable for resolving this problem . It may well be that the tenant is in receipt of benefits including LHA ; and in this event the local council should sort it out at the councils ' cost . I do remember having at least two problems concerning LHA tenants having wasps many years ago and if my memory serves me right ; the Wirral council dealt with it without costs being incurred . Indeed ... We as Landlords have , as a matter of goodwill on several occasions had wasps nests removed at our own cost .

If the landlord has a forwarding address , then this always helps the utility supplier . The supplier may also ask you to provide a copy of the tenancy agreement to confirm you were not responsible for the energy at the time of the tenancy . The utility company will always seek to pursue the customer/tenant responsible . <p> Steve Knox , Hallmark : The landlord is only responsible for the usage while the property is empty and their responsibility . The energy provider can not make the landlord liable for bills that the tenant has n't paid . <p> UKL : Do utility companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a history of non-payment of bills ? <p> Steve Knox : No . As this would be a breach of data protection due to the fact that the bills are the responsibility of the tenant unless stated otherwise in the tenancy agreement . <p> UKL : Are there circumstances where landlords could be pursued for tenants ' unpaid bills ? <p> Keith Russell : No . Utility companies can not pursue the landlord if the bill was left unpaid by the tenant and the account is in the name of the tenant . The only exception to this is if the landlord was unable to produce a signed tenancy agreement ( when requested ) covering the period of the bill . <h> Meters <p> UKL : How easy is it nowadays for a utility company to change the meter in a property from a pre-pay card meter to a credit meter ? <p> Keith Russell : The process of changing a meter from a prepayment card meter to a credit meter or credit meter to a prepayment card meter is simple . The question is more about individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving credit to tenants . Would you let your tenants pay in arrears for their rent ? Prepayment meters have historically had a stigma attached to them , driven by myth rather than fact . The truth is that prepayment meters are an excellent choice for tenants and homeowners , and with smart metering and future technologies around the corner , they are about to become more appealing . <p> UKL : What do you advise landlords to do if tenants have changed the meters in the property without the landlord 's approval ? <p> Keith Russell : As the tenant is responsible for the property during the period of their tenancy , the tenant and the utility company do not need to seek the landlord 's approval . If a tenant arranges to install a prepayment meter , they are likely to be doing it for reasons of choice rather than force , which is sensible in the current climate .

In cases of requested or forced meter exchange , no contact will be made with the landlord . <p> UKL : What should landlords do if they believe the meter reader has read the meter incorrectly or read the wrong meter ? <p> Steve Knox : Contact the Energy Provider with the details of the meter and the meter readings and they will ensure that the reads are allocated to the correct meter . <p> Keith Russell : Landlords should take a meter reading and inform the utility company .

This often arises with tenants who cultivate cannabis . <p> Keith Russell : Inform the utility company as soon as it is known . Besides the legal implications , there is always the opportunity for a catastrophe ; injury and in extreme cases death . The utility company will arrange an investigation and establish if there is an illegal supply , taking the appropriate action to ensure the activity is stopped and the supply is safe .

At very least make sure it 's issued before 2 months of the agreement expiry date . Important to note that the judge who agreed possession this morning clarified to the tenant , who thought he 'd found a loophole , that the section 21 notice legally has no ' sell by date ' and could have been issued 2 years ago , 5 years ago etc . Regretably the PCOL website does not give complete clarity of the process so I went to the court this morning with what I suspected was not enough information . Fortunately I was wrong . The process was relatively informal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement and then a copy of the Section 21 notice ( the last one issued in 2012 but not acted on ) and a copy of the rent arrears . Note that the PCOL service can only be used where there are arrears relevant . Having established that all the detail was correct ( make doubly sure everything is correct ! ! ) he then asked the tenant if he accepted notice had been served correctly . Our smart R 'd tenant started to claim extenuating circumstances and was stopped sharply by the judge who stated clearly that the service of notice was correct and no other mitigating circumstances were relevant . So , I went with an updated rent arrears schedule , the original tenancy agreement and a copy of the section 21 notice with its proof of delivery all of which allowed the judge to instruct and I hope to have possession in 28 days time .

Well done on your success today though , doing your homework obviously paid off ! <p> Thanks for your interest Rob . I do n't  expect the tenant to sign the 21 before the AST but at the same time . This also has the advantage that I am able to remind the tenant if necessary that the 21 is already in place and could be activated the day after the end of the tenancy .

I used it once and did n't thoroughly check everything before I signed , and was n't happy with what I signed and was n't able to make a further change . So to avoid this it seems wise to thoroughly check every clause , especially since letting agents may make mistake or may insert or change clauses , e.g. Spark energy . If the landlord requests a change it is wise to check this and also that nothing else has changed . For me its a lot easier to compare two documents that are hard printed than on the screen .

Is what I have done correct . <p> For guidance on completing the Section 21 Notice we would recommend you call the NLA Telephone Advice Line . Different rules apply in England and Wales . You may also need to take into account method of service when calculating date . NLA offer a one day Possession Course where we show you how to fill in and serve all the relevant forms . Alternatively you can use NLA Property Repossession to initiate the process for you . Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates on the above how can we respond . When serving a section 21 notice and giving over the two months required the worry for me is ; tenancy starts on .... say 15th of month Do you then put possession is required after 14th of two months later , or , 15th ? Why can this not be stated simply . The day rent is due or day before ? The wording " after ........ OR , if later " etc ......... is quite confusing . <p> Eek , that 's more than a little unfair , Brexitbiker . NLA responded to Mr Smith 's request for help the following day . I doubt that was in their remit . It 's a members forum so , helpful of them that they did . <p> You neglected to refer to the very first of NLA 's suggestions , which was for Mr Smith to give them a buzz , a service paid for by our subscriptions as you yourself acknowledge .

I do sense a reluctance at their putting things ' in writing ' at times but this may be quite unfounded or more an issue of time constraint . My central point was that in the case above , NLA had first and foremost offered free ( paid for ) advice to Mr Smith . It was unfair not to acknowledge that . The point , between us is well covered and if NLA will consider being more hands on with forum questions in the future , we will have done a good days work between us . <p> ******* <p> Suggestion to NLA : <p> Would you consider a ' Members questions to NLA ' section , with questions selected by staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its month/year of publication ?

( NLA could add an ' update ' to any posting in any event , as a footnote , as things change ) <p> Would respectfully suggest 6 questions in each session and questions for consideration could be emailed to a new , designated address . <p> Or .. <p> ( much easier to handle and certainly in line with stated member issues ) simply choose 6 questions/answers among your staff , based on your own monitoring of the forum and where people are clearly confused .. or arguing ! <p> Clarity in communication is everything .

@@76817387 @5517387/ <h> Taken to court for unprotected Deposit but paid back at end of tenancy <p> I wonder if anyone can help please as i can not find a similar case . All the cases I have found the landlord has kept the deposit or there were disputes . 2 years ago I had a tenant on an assured shorthold tenancy for 6 months . All amicable throughout and even let them move out slightly early . I was ignorant and did n't know about the deposit scheme as I was a new landlord at the time . When they moved out , I gave them back their deposit by bank transfer . After 2 years , they have sent a solicitors letter claiming x3 amount of deposit as compensation otherwise they will issue county court proceedings . Please can someone tell me the likely outcome as it is a real worry and a lot of money . After this has happened I realise that it was my responsibility to know the law about registering the deposit and I made a genuine mistake however a judge will just see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted such tenants the right to sue you for up to 3xdeposit . No point raising issues of fairness , decency , everything else perfect .. ( cf the excellent perfect driver with 30 years unbleamished history done for 42mph in a 30mph limit area , dry day , clear road , no other traffic , nobody hurt , no costs incurred by anyone .. ) <p> Unless they are stupid or using ignorant solicitors they will very likely win . <p> Me , I 'd try to settle for something between 1xdeposit+-1 to 2xdeposit . The letter sounds like they 'd like a nice offer .... <p> I think the government need to advertise the deposit scheme so Landlords are more aware of the law . I have spoken to a few people that own a flat they rent and did n't know about the deposit scheme too . Road signs tell you speed limit so you are aware of the law . Landlords are n't always aware especially if they privately rent and do n't use an agent . <p> It is ignorant and careless of Tribune - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have paid the deposit back and this has been an honest error the CONCEPT of protecting money has happened . Ie if you had a disease ( ie a brain infection , car suddenly did not respond etc. ) and unintentionally your speed went up the judge will NOT accuse you of high speed . Meanwhile to Tribune DO YOU KNOW ALLL the laws ? even the solicitors are markedly subspecialised ! ! ! ! <p> also u may check how long after the tenancy or knowing about the deposit they are allowed to take action . If they have passed the deadline they have no case . In anyway negotiation may help , especially it might be expensive for them to go to court as well ( it is usually for landlords ) <p> Oh boy ! In view of the above steam , Louise , it might be best advice were you to contact NLA via their helpline and so sidestep the ' forum fallout syndrome ' this posting is headed towards as forums , sadly , so often do . For what it 's worth -itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' that a court would decide in favour of the tenant ; the legal requirement in regard to deposits was not met and such cases do n't tend to fail on a ' technicality ' e.g. a paperwork submission error of the tenant . I would , though , think it quite unlikely that -provided you can effectively evidence the deposit return , or it is not disputed- that you would be clobbered for the maximum ' penalty . ' I think Tribune 's suggestion in regard to negotiating with the solicitors -if not directly with the ex-tenant- is absolutely your best response and I would do so sooner rather than later . I wish you well . I am confident that this will not end as dismally as you may fear , even if it were to proceed to a hearing . I also think you can prevent that happening without paying what would be the maximum hit . If they wo n't budge , however , you might as well let it proceed to court , to be frank but balance this against lawyer fees which you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own greedy motive to protract this dispute and this is costing the ex-tenant at this point also . That will become your cost and you must try to avoid or minimise this . Consider a direct approach to them ( in writing/email ) thus circumventing the lawyer and explaining why you are doing so , in any contact you do make . NLA will either confirm or give better advice ! Good luck . <p> the tenant will win - however as repaid in full the judge would be more likely to award 1x deposit ( which he MUST as a minimum ) , rather than x3 as a penalty . There were some ambulance chasers around when the law stated 3x - but now an element of discretion is given to the judge ( 1x - 3x ) more of a risk to go for more , so likely to settle outside . If written offer to settle for 1x was made prior to court action &amp; refused , then presented as evidence , judge could take a dim view of the claimant as not looking for compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released early ? was that all agreed in writing ? If the tenant wants to " re-visit " the end of tenancy , ( which they have a right to do ) , maybe a couter claim for rent to the contracted date would encourage a settlement . <p> Calmness is restored . Good ! My guess is an attempt at such a tenuous counter-claim would just cause their solicitors to celebrate the protraction and additional cost which would be hundreds , of course . Not much of an argument to be had if early release were granted . If it has to go to court ( perhaps it has by now ) best get it over with . What a nuisance solicitors were employed . <p> Sorry i have not been on the forum for a while so did not see all the replies . This matter has been quite stressful . Thanks for all your input . The latest news is the court hearing is still going ahead in a few months . I have made an offer of settlement to the lawyer of x1 deposit amount plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I assume because of greed ! I wonder if they have even showed the offer to the tenant ? <p> KAN - the tenancy ended amicably just over 2 years ago and full deposit paid back then . I even gave them a reference so they could get a place with the housing association . <p> I do understand why the law is in place and I realise now the law was broken but i am hoping the judge will see all my evidence and i am not a ' rogue ' landlord . The rental property is next door to my home in the same building . I have tried to be reasonable in making an offer plus there are a few discrepencies in the claimant 's witness statement - 1 including them misleading the court by lying about the deposit amount . I do n't want to go into too much into detail on here until after the case . Yes i agreed they could leave the tenancy early ( trying to be nice as they wanted social housing ) but it was only verbally and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be nice to make an offer to settle direct to the tenant however i am not legally allowed to contact them ( stated in lawyers letter ) . <p> Very true Martin ! I just want a peaceful life but i 'm beginning to realise that 's not the case being a landlord : / <p> " " " The rental property is next door to my home in the same building .

Even though the paperwork said AST , even though deposit was in scheme . <p> See ( answer as tenant ) LONG ... - so they are " occupiers with basic protection " . i.e. tenants , need a court order to evict them but not AT or AST . <p> Most tenants , many landlords , agents , solicitors do n't seem to understand the point . It all depends on clause 10 of Schedule 1 of HA 1988 . <p> Hello all , Sorry it 's been a long time . After a long and stressful time back and forth with this tenant 's ' solicitor ' , we settled out of court a few days before the court date . This no win no fee ' solicitor ' would not budge but admitted in the end that the tenant had exaggerated the deposit amount ( doubled it ) however they would not drop the case as they had invested too much time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the shortfall ( of what they originally were aiming for = over -4k ) . If i was in better health at the time , I would have been well enough to face court , but it was risky whether the judge would have seen the tenant exaggerated the claim or not and all the lies . It could have gone my way and i may have paid the minimum penalty - or it could have run up to -7k inc all the fees . Settlement was just over -2k so I did n't mind swallowing that ( expensive &amp; silly mistake but lesson learnt ) , especially as this has n't gone into the tenant 's pocket ! they came out with around -400 if they were lucky , but possibly had to pay out the same as me !

If you have furnished properties you will not be able to deduct , as is current practice , 10 per cent of your rental income to account for wear and tear . From April 2016 , the Government is likely to replace this allowance with a new system that enables all landlords of residential property to only deduct costs they actually incur . Will this effect you ? If so may I encourage you to lobby your MP .

It seems to me to be a tax on turnover , and not profit . <p> It seems to me that landlords are under attack at all angles .

Surely it is about more than raising revenue ? Is n't it a sign that the Government do not like this as an income stream ?

The first step is to serve your tenant with a Section 8 Notice " mandatory ground for possession . This is a formal notice giving your tenant warning of your intention to seek possession of the property . This gives the tenant 14 days after which you can commence court proceedings . <p> What are the key steps that you take to regain possession on behalf of your landlord clients who have tenants in arrears ? <p> Tim Briggs , LegalMentor : If the landlord has not served Notices we will do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement in place . We call this stage A. <p> Stage B is the process of bringing the matter to court . Many landlords and letting agents just use accelerated claims , which means they can not recover any arrears . We always advise clients to try to recover arrears with an online claim for possession ( PCOL ) where appropriate . We also draft a proper witness statement setting out the landlord 's evidence for the landlord to check through and approve . We then pay our solicitors to instruct and send well-trained , experienced advocates to court . <p> Stage C is an application for county court bailiffs . Local authorities often advise tenants to stay in the property until eviction to defer the costs of re-housing them . High Court bailiffs are also an option . <p> How long does the process take and what is the likely cost ? <p> Landlord Action : In the worst case scenario , the whole process can take up to five months from serving notice to evicting a tenant . Our all-inclusive fixed costs are just over -1,000 covering court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> LegalMentor : We charge -70 for a Notice , -90 for two Notices ( for example a Section 8 and Section 21 Notice ) . If we serve a Section 8 Notice , we allow three weeks before it expires , at which time the claim can be issued . <p> We then charge -560 for an online possession claim which immediately gives a hearing date and time . We allow four to seven weeks before the day of the hearing ( usually about 5 weeks ) . At the hearing , the court grants possession , so unless the property is empty then allow 14 days for the date for possession . <p> If the tenant still has not left the property after the 14 days , we can apply for an eviction warrant . An eviction date attended by county court bailiffs takes between 3 and 12 weeks . High Court bailiffs can sometimes be quicker . <p> Which costs can landlords hope to recover from the tenant and what is the best way of getting the money back ? <p> Landlord Action : When making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to recover the costs . Depending on what the landlord has spent going to court , this will usually include the amount of the arrears outstanding and any court/solicitors fees . Landlords can also ask for an occupation order , which is basically rent from the date of the hearing to the possession date . We always have an expert landlord and tenant advocate that will represent the landlord at the hearing . <p> If you do obtain a money judgement for rent arrears then there are various ways that this can be enforced such as : <p> Attachment of earnings " an order to a tenant 's employer to pay some of the tenant 's salary to the landlord <p> A third party order " for example , banks that owe the tenant money , pay the money to the landlord instead . <p> The tenant 's finances have to be researched , to help reach a commercial decision on how to proceed . However , it is our experience that most tenants get into arrears because they can not afford to pay the rent . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenant for arrears and often better to simply gain possession and re-let the property . <p> Landlord Action offer a fixed fee structure for rent recovery . <p> What are the key pitfalls that landlords need to be aware of when regaining possession ? <p> LegalMentor : Deposits , firstly . Landlords have to make sure they have provided a copy of all certificates , terms and conditions , leaflets and any other ' prescribed information ' to all tenants , guarantors and any other ' relevant persons ' , including the tenant 's mother or grandmother if they paid some or all of the deposit directly to the landlord . Keep copies of every document you gave , when it was given , to whom , by whom , on what day , at what time . If you do not do this and the tenant becomes difficult , the landlord will either get a claim or counterclaim against them for damages of up to three times the amount of the deposit , or the Section 21 Notice will not be valid so the claim will be struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is very easy for tenants to get an adjournment at a possession hearing on the basis that there is disrepair at the property . Landlords should keep a note of all communication , including deatils of the time , date and content of every phone call , text , email , letter , scribbled note or any other correspondence about repairs , or actual work done , or attempted . If the tenant ignores correspondence , landlords should send an email every week or two asking them to contact you for a time to do the repairs . Whether they reciprocate contact is irrelevant ; landlords have to have tried to carry out their statutory repairing duties , and those emails or letters could save a lot of money later . <p> Has anything changed in the past few years in this area which landlords need to be aware of ? <p> Landlord Action : The laws surrounding deposit protection have had a huge impact on landlords , especially when gaining possession under Section 21 such as in the on-going Superstrike vs Rodrigues case . This highlighted ambiguity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the law by not re-protecting deposits when a fixed term tenancy rolled over into a statutory periodic tenancy , after April 2007 . Our advice is always to return the deposit to the tenant , then serve a Section 21 notice if you want possession of the property . <p> In the last year , we have seen a substantial rise in the number of landlords serving Section 21 notices under accelerated possession proceedings . This allows a landlord to terminate the tenancy at the end of its fixed term and give no reason for eviction . <h> Comments <p> Return deposit to the tenant before issuing a section 21 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? What about repairs , redecorating and dilapidations that can be offset . <p> Much better to issue section 8 , get an onward award for arrears . If the tentant is in arrears the judge will sometimes make a judgement to offset the deposit against arrears . The last thing if you are out of pocket is to return it . 
@@76817408 @5517408/ <p> We would suggest you speak to the Housing Benefit Team at the local authority . Local Housing Allowance is usually paid direct to the claimant . Tenant 's do not have the opportunity to request direct payment to their landlord in the way that they used to under the old Housing Benefit rules . Local authorities can make LHA payments direct to landlords in certain circumstances , usually if the tenant is in arrears or deemed to be vulnerable . Each local authority will have their own policy . A clause such as the one you propose may well be unenforceable as Tribune implies . It may be better to ascertain when the LHA is paid and ask the tenant to pay their rent by standing order . If speaking to the council about a specific claim , you will need to ask your tenant to give the local authority permission to speak to you , as Tribune suggests .

" By doing this I made use of a large space that was essentially not being used and tenants could use the living room as a second bedroom , " says Barry . " Another tip is to take down walls to create a more attractive space . I turned a pokey one-bedroom basement flat into a light and spacious studio by removing walls and excavating to allow in more light . As a one-bed flat it was hard to let and it is now one of the properties we find easiest to let out . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rented out will save you time and money . Unless it is really necessary , bringing in the builders during a tenancy should be avoided as it is bound to interfere with your tenants ' lives , and give rise to complaints if the work takes longer than initially expected ( as it invariably does ) . NLA Property Woman of the Year 2009 Shona Davison advises : <p> " Before you own the property or while you still have a tenant in it paying rent , get organised ! Make a project plan , include every task organised by room , research your prices for buying supplies , and negotiate prices for labour . The best way of saving money is to not waste time while the property is empty as lost rent can be one of the biggest costs . " <h> Refurb basics <p> It 's important to be clear about priorities when embarking on a refurbishment , so that the key elements , such as repairing structural defects , are dealt with and the property becomes marketable . <h> Tax deductions when you refurbish <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax deductible and will either be treated as repairs ( which are deductible from rental income ) or capital expenditure ( which is tax deductible only when you sell the property ) . <p> Repairs . This is a complex area of tax , but generally speaking expenditure will be considered a repair if it generally restores the property to its previous condition , for example replacing an old carpet with a new one , repainting the walls or fixing a damaged roof . <p> Improvements . Any expenditure which improves the property beyond its previous condition will , on the other hand , be treated as capital expenditure . Clear cut cases of capital expenditure are , for example , adding an extension to a property , doing a loft conversion or putting in central heating to a property that did not have any . <p> Acklands Accountants advises that a like for like replacement such as replacing one kitchen for another is treated as a repair , while replacing a carpet for wooden floor could be presented as an improvement , unless the carpet was in such bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might well be seen as a repair . Thus works that are undertaken because the landlord chooses to do them , rather than because they had to be done in order to make the property habitable can be treated as capital improvement . <p> One of the key ways therefore to distinguish between repairs and improvements is to consider whether the property is uninhabitable and not available to let in which case works done would be seen as an improvement rather than a repair . <h> Using tradesmen <p> NLA Recognised Supplier , The Property Owners Directory , underlines the importance of using trusted contractors . It advises landlords to work , wherever possible , with contractors whom friends or colleagues recommend , and ask them for additional references before going ahead . The online landlord directory of recommended tradesmen recommends landlords detail every job required , the materials you want them to use , and getting a firm price for both . This will help minimise the possibility for extras ' being added to your bill as the work progresses . <p> Where relevant , landlords should use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check that they have all the relevant public liability insurance in place . <h> Safety <p> Gas , asbestos and water management are very high priorities to consider when refurbishing . <p> Chris Rawson of NLA Recognised Supplier OHS , a safety solutions consultancy , advises landlords to ensure that a residential property is safe and healthy for occupiers . This includes checking that electricity and gas supplies and the sanitation ( drains , basins , sinks , baths and WCs ) are in working order . The property needs to be free from damp , with adequate heating which ideally means controllable central heating and insulation , with equipment and the fabric of the building in good repair . The property should also be safe from trip and fall hazards and fit for general purpose . <p> You may want to add to your checklist repairing or replacing damaged or rotten floorboards , and changing the locks , and ( where appropriate ) installing exterior lighting and/or an alarm system . Gas , electrics and plumbing Before completing any property purchase , consider commissioning a full fixed wire report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspection so you know what to expect in advance , and these can be good negotiating points if major works are required . If you already own the property it will give you a definitive list of essential works that are required to bring the property up to current regulations . This is the advice of Rhonda Kneller of NLA Recognised Supplier Landlord Response who says " Any responsible landlord wants their tenants and their property to be safe and these comprehensive tests will highlight any safety issues . " <p> She also suggests considering a good quality breakdown cover on your gas , electrics and plumbing so you can plan your budget and ensure you are fully compliant year on year . <h> Digital TV <p> With digital switchover a fact for all households in the UK using televisions from now until 2012 , it will be financially advantageous and generally easier to pre-wire flats if they are going through a full refurbishment so that cables can be concealed in the ducting along with other electrical wiring .

Mark Garner of NLA Recognised Supplier LettingZone advises landlords to " keep it simple , fresh and neutral , allowing tenants to personalise their new home with their own style of furniture . In my experience over the last 15 years of being a landlord I believe tenants appreciate this approach and tend to stay longer . " <h> Insurance considerations <p> Landlords need to be aware that any refurbishment to the property , regardless of how minor the work is , can affect their insurance policy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main problem is the fact that the property is unoccupied , possibly for long periods of time and can therefore be an easy target for opportunist thieves , or worse still , squatters . <p> Hamilton Fraser advises anyone undertaking refurbishment of a property between let 's to firstly contact their insurers . The first question most insurers will ask is what type of work the landlord is intending to undertake , and the second is how long will the work take . Both questions give the insurers an idea of the extra risk involved and whether additional terms such as restricted cover or a higher excess should be applied . Usually if the work is of a purely cosmetic nature a standard landlords policy will automatically extend to cover this period of unoccupancy and minor works for up to 90 days . <p> Landlords ought to bear in mind however that even if the policy automatically covers this , there may be additional terms or conditions applied so it is essential that they check their policy carefully so as not to fall foul of these . It is also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed and the property becomes occupied , and not the insurer 's responsibility to keep chasing the landlord for updates . <p> For landlords having their property refurbished by a third party the above would still apply . However Hamilton Fraser recommends that landlords advise their insurers of the full schedule of works and , more importantly , make sure the builder or contractor undertaking the work has Public Liability cover in place . Apart from protecting members of the public whilst they are undertaking work at your premises landlords should be mindful of the fact that they can not claim from their own property insurance for damage that the contractor does to their property or even a neighbouring property . <p> If undertaking a major refurbishment , such as structural alterations or extensions , the above should apply , but in addition a joint contract insurance ( JCT as it 's more commonly known ) should be arranged between the landlord and the builder or contractor .

The major reason for many cases of F and G ratings is that the software employed to create them is seriously deficient , based on too many false assumptions , and carried out by lazy auditors . <p> Here is an example : <p> I have an 1860 grade 2 listed flat on the top floor of a building , complete with almost all its beautiful period featuresand original timber Windows , which have secondary glazing on the North facing side . In 2011 it had a -40k refurb . Out went the inefficient old gas boiler . In came underfloor and ceiling insulation , after which the attic was boarded out and in addition insulated in the rafters . There is electric underfloor heating throughout with individual thermostats in each room and ceiling fans which are used in reverse in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The cost of running the flat literally HALVED with these changes - it is so warm and cosy , without introducing ridiculous wall insulation which every sensible person knows is the cause of damp and deterioration of the fabric in period buildings , let alone destruction of period features and mouldings . The running costs are far far less than they would be with a gas boiler , all the walls are freed up for furniture ; as bonuses every room has a ceiling fan which provides cool air in summer for just a few pence ; the building remains a healthy , breathing environment , and all the period features remain intact . My German tenants could not believe how cheap and efficient it was to run . <p> Yet it got a grade G rating when it came to EPC ! The software does not recognise any of the clever features of the electric ufh . Moreover the auditor REFUSED to include the underfloor insulation , OR the above ceiling insulation , because he could n't see it ! This is nothing short of imbecilic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North facing Windows , " because it could be opened " and the Windows are timber . <p> The Jobs for Cowboys Green Deal was around at the time , and the " improvements " he was adamant should be made were all GD orientated ...... yes folks ... you 've guessed where that his is going . <p> So Carolyn , please take a more considered , rational and understanding view on the EPC issue . For the various reasons highlighted above EPCs are very very often not just flawed but utter rubbish . <p> I am sorry to read that you found Carolyn 's article in the September/October edition of UKL disagreeable . For clarity , I do n't think the article was meant as a defence of the EPC system or comment on quality of any type of property , and it certainly was n't intended as a criticism of landlords ' behaviour . <p> Moreover the message was intended to highlight deficiencies in successive governments ' attitudes towards landlords and the assumptions they have made about the way in which they invest in their properties to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very much aware of the lack of consistency , and in some cases inadequacy , of the system used to assess energy efficiency in respect of EPCs . This is yet another reason why Carolyn was arguing against the imposition of the deadline linked to EPC ratings . <p> Hi 52805 , Your argument seems to be with the EPC and the EPC process . I paid a very reasonable -40 for an EPC and you must expect that the inspector will only get a proportion of that amount and will have travel expenses etc to cover ; no wonder they want to do a quick job . I too upgraded a property ( corner terrace circa 1900 ) which was showing as an F and after the work it became a C. I made sure I was present when the inspector came and I actually obtained a letter from the builder indicating wall insulation and under floor insulation work that had been done . My inspector helpfully held back the report until he had seen this evidence.I have to say that I would not expect anyone to base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not evidenced at all . Any photographs taken whilst work is done is very helpful and can also be shown as proof to the inspector.I had phoned the EPC company prior to the visit and spoke to an experienced inspector who helpfully told me about evidence so I was prepared . Once I had the EPC report I spoke to the body that monitors EPC providing companies and they were also helpful and helped me to understand the process . The EPC system is not perfect but as with much of current legislation it needs to be accepted for what it is , understood and used to your best advantage . From what you have written I would be tempted to have a new EPC with evidence , photos etc and see if you can at least get it up to higher level , but you need to be realistic with what can be achieved when trying to maintain the character of a very old building . <p> I was amazed to find that my single-glazed flat got a higher EPC rating than the identical flat next door , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same month , and the flats had the same cavity wall insulation , loft insulation , etc . The difference was that I had put low energy light bulbs everywhere - which gets far more points on the EPC than double glazing does ( despite the fact that the tenants will replace them with normal bulbs the first time that they blow ) . The inspector told me that if I had not made him go up to the attic , he would have assumed that it was not insulated because he only writes down what he sees and he is not obliged to make any effort to look . Similarly , he would have assumed that the boiler was n't condensing if I had n't thrust the user manual under his nose with my finger on the word ' condensing ' . And he would have assumed that there was no cavity wall insulation if I had not made him read the certificate . He admitted all those things when I complained about the previous EPC inspector , and told him that I would not pay for a so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave no indication of him having even visited the property . They should be required to make measurements of the temperature and look at the fuel bills , but of course they are only there to make work for the ' Jobs for Cowboys ' brigade . They admit that the fuel saving is far less than the cost . They recommend cavity wall insulation in walls which do not have cavities , and many things in blocks of flats which ca n't be done to one flat individually . Cavity wall insulation , loft insulation and solar panels require every owner in the block to agree and contribute to the payment , including absentee landlords whose tenants do not have their contact details . Which will make the entire block unsaleable and unlettable under the new law . Owners occupiers who are not intending to sell have no incentive to pay far more for ' improvements ' than they will ever see back in fuel savings . So is a seller supposed to pay for the whole block to be done to make their own flat saleable ?

Taylor has had permission to appeal to the Supreme Court refused . This means that if a fixed term contractural Assured Shorthold Tenancy has become statutory periodic , there are now two options when serving a Section 21 Notice . <h> Background <p> Towards the end of 2013 the case of Spencer vs . Taylor created a great deal of debate and disagreement amongst commentators and cast some doubt over the intrepretation of s21 of the Housing Act 1988 . <p> The case came before the Court of Appeal in November last year and considered the validity of a s21 notice used in respect of a tenancy established in 2006 between the tenant ( Miss Taylor ) and her husband ( Mr Spencer ) , having become periodic and possession sought in 2012 ( notice served in 2011 ) . <p> Having already been judged valid by a lower court , this appeal focussed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out by the Housing Act - even though the date specified for possession did not coincide with the last day of the period of the tenancy as common understanding would have it when relying on s21(4) . <p> After reviewing the legislation , Lord Justice Lewison determined that the notice was indeed valid , having met the criteria established in s21 of the Housing Act . <p> Section 21 of the Act states : <p> ( 1 ) Without prejudice to any right of the landlord under an assured shorthold tenancy to recover possession of the dwelling house let on the tenancy in accordance with chapter one above , on or after the coming to an end of an assured shorthold tenancy which was a fixed term tenancy a court shall make an order for the possession of the dwelling house if it is satisfied - <p> ( a ) that the assured shorthold tenancy has come to an end and no further assured tenancy , whether shorthold or not , is for the time being in existence other than an assured shorthold periodic tenancy , whether statutory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the case of joint landlords at least one of them , has given to the tenant not less than two months notice in writing stating that he requires possession of the dwelling house . <p> ( 2 ) A notice under paragraph ( b ) of sub-section ( 1 ) above may be given before or on the day on which the tenancy comes to an end and that sub-section shall have effect notwithstanding that on the coming to an end of the fixed term tenancy a statutory periodic tenancy arises . <p> ( 3 ) Where a court makes an order for possession of a dwelling house virtue of sub-section 1 above , any statutory periodic tenancy which has arisen on the coming to an end of the assured shorthold tenancy shall end without further notice and regardless of the period in accordance with section 5(1A) . <p> ( a ) that the landlord , or in the case of joint landlords at least one of them , has given to the tenant a notice in writing stating that after a date specified in the notice being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not earlier than two months after the date the notice was given , possession of the dwelling house is required by viture of this section , and - <p> ( b ) that the date specified in the notice under paragraph ( a ) above is not earlier than the earliest day on which , apart from Section 5(1) above , the tenancy could be brought to an end by a notice to quit given by the landlord on the same date as the notice under paragraph ( a ) above . <p> LJ Lewison stated that in this case s21(1) ( a ) and ( b ) were satisfied i.e. no tenancy other than a statutory periodic has arisen following the intial Assured Shorthold Tenancy and that a minimum of two months ' notice had been given . <p> The area which had been subject to debate prior to this appeal is whether the notice could be valid as the date given for possession did not coincide with the end of the period as required by 4(a) . Crucially , LJ Lewison determined that use of the word ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landlord may rely on s21(1) prior to the end of the fixed term , but this does not preclude his or her use during a statutory periodic tenancy . As such the date given for possession ( provided it gives at least two months notice ) is irrelevant . <h> Implications of the ruling <p> If a fixed term contractural Assured Shorthold Tenancy has become statutory periodic there are now two options when serving a Section 21 Notice : <p> Option A , the traditional approach : Use a s21(4) ( a ) notice and include a date of expiry . The after date should be the last day of a tenancy period . <p> Option B , as a consequence of Spencer vs . Taylor : There is no need to use a s21(4) ( a ) notice , or have a date of expiry at the end of a period of the tenancy . A s21(1) ( b ) notice providing at least two months ' notice will suffice . <p> In reality this a very recent decision and it will take some time for this ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up by judges . <p> To reduce the risk of a possession application being thrown out because a judge has not picked up on the changes , option A ( the traditional approach ) may be the safest approach . <p> However , in some cases option B ( as a consequence of Spencer vs . Taylor ) may enable a landlord to regain possession two or three weeks earlier than they previously may have been able to . <p> If going for option B and relying on the Spencer vs . Taylor ruling , agents are advised to check with their local County Court to ensure they are aware of the ruling and make sure they make reference to the ruling in their paperwork when applying to the County Court for a Possession Order . <p> Agents should also check that they have an appropriately worded saving clause in the Section 21 Notice . <p> More guidance is available to UKALA members , by calling the NLA Telephone Advice Line . <p> Written and oral advice from the UK Association of Letting Agents ( UKALA ) and or National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no responsiblity whatsoever is accepted by the Association or its Officers for the accurancy of its advice , nor shall the Association be held liable for the consequences or reliance upon such advice .

I recently purchased a flat with tenants in situ and the previous owner has failed to transfer the deposit to me plus my share of the rent on completion . My solicitor has written to the previous owner and the estate agent have tried to contact her but she has not responded at all to date . Any one else had a similar experience or know how to proceed please ? Many thanks ! Regards <p> When did tenant 1st move in ? ? It might not be an AST .. so might not need protecting ( regardless of shiny new signed AST ) . <p> Assuming it is AST , as the new owner/landlord you are now responsible for the deposit , regardless of it being transferred to you or not ( s.3 Landlord and Tenant ( Covenants ) Act 1995 ) , so get it protected NOW ! ! - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3xdeposit penalty is too unpleasant to risk . Your solicitor should continue chasing vendor for cash for deposit &amp; share of rent . <p> Have you served appropriate notices on tenant about who you are , address ? ? If not done soon enough , a criminal offence ( s.3 Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 ) . <p> The tenants have been in a year and their original AST ended recently so will get them to sign the new one with myself today . Apparently their deposit is with DPS and I have registered with them so have my own I 'd . The DPS advised me that once I have the Land Registry details , that 's the only proof of ownership they accept - they can check for the deposit under the previous owner 's details and can chase up why it has not been transferred to me . They never mentioned having to put in the equivalent amount of my own money in the meantime though , if they had I would have done it then . <p> My solicitor already wrote to the tenants advising of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment details to pay their first rent to me ( all done this month ) . The solicitors are also continuing to chase the vendor for me . I must add that the deposit and rent issue were discussed with the estate agent who had agreed in writing to me that they would do all the necessaries to inform their vendor to transfer the deposit to me on completion and inform the tenants of my bank details at least a week prior to the completion date . Obviously none of this was done and they tell me the vendor has not responded to their calls or emails to date . I am not sure what more I could have done to avoid the situation I am in now . Many thanks again . Regards <p> The tenants do not have to sign any new tenancy nor agree to any changes : Their existing periodic one is fine and , indeed , with the 01/10/2015 &amp; right-to-rent changes arguably better for you to leave them on that ( and would mean you could use s21 earlier ) . Your ( conveyancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to want a shiny new tenancy to tie everyone in for another 6/12 months &amp; charge yet more fees . <p> I see . Well I do not have a copy of their original tenancy agreement which was between them and the previous owner for one year which ended this week . Nothing else has changed only the ownership . My solicitor did the conveyancing but they also cover rent division so that is what they are chasing for me since the rent due to me from completion was sent to the previous owner because the tenants had not been advised in time to change over by the estate agent . I am not using an agent to manage it . I 've just used the form on this site . Many thanks . <p> I had most of the paperwork but realised ( too late ) the crucial deposit and tenancy info were missing . Sobering lesson in itself especially since the estate agent were not managing the rental by then although they did at the start of the tenancy . Regards <p> How 's this for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sitting tenants in the future ? I have written it rather than deeply ponder it may delete next time I 'm on . <p> State via your lawyer/conveyancer that purchase depends on early notice to quit being formally requested by sitting tenant and similarly formally granted by landlord/vendor . Last time ( last year ) I was involved in an early release , there was a form relating to this but it no longer seems to be on the NLA website ; perhaps it disappeared with the law changes . Take advice from NLA if the idea holds any appeal . They may well say , ' You 'll be lucky ! ' And so you might ! <p> Your lawyer/conveyancer would need to be copied in to all correspondence in a timely fashion and so , since it would likely be a new one on them , make sure they insist on that as part of your conditional offer to buy . <p> In practice , both or either party may say , ' Mind your own business ! ' Your reply should be , ' I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely be my cue to walk away . Bad vibes often tell all , albeit sometimes as a whisper that we do n't wish to hear ( I must write that down some day . I 'm a poet , do n't you know it ! ) <p> What you do n't want is legal responsibility for some stranger 's incompetent tenancy nor to be lumbered with a tenant you yourself know nothing about worth knowing . This may be an issue of some frequency with sitting tenants . Those of you with experience ... is it ? <p> The tenant would need workable reassurance that you would allow them to stay and not ' do the dirty ' and so , at least show a ' to be signed later ' agreement . Do n't even think of changing your mind after giving them the nod , by the way so get all your checks done before any dialogue between tenant and landlord about termination .. If you do n't want them , insist on early release being properly obtained and granted by the vendor anyway because you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is agreed . <p> I would think it only fair perhaps highly desirable that your lawyer suggests or insists that any such tenant termination should contain the caveat that it depends on subsequent completion , specifically that the landlord sells to you . This may be a moot point since it encompasses the tenant/lawyer relationship when you are trying oh so hard to escape any such entanglement . It is , though , a matter of text in the tenant 's request and in the landlord 's acceptance and so , a third party matter in that regard . I am not a lawyer but this side of midnight , it seems viable as an example of ' duty of care ' towards the tenant 's fate should you pull the sale . <p> Success with this idea would effectively , legally divorce you from liability for a tenancy that , in my view , never should become anything to do with you in the first place . The ' early release ' date would be decided once you have a suggested completion date , probably best the day prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenant stays or goes . Highly risky ! <p> Personally , there is only one thing that appeals to me about the sitting tenant scenario and that is my lazy , greedy analysis that I may not have to ' do ' anything , including advertise , redecorate , change locks , explain how the heating works , tell them when the bin men come . ( Sorry : Refuse Collection Officers ( gendernonspecific ) ) <p> But be mindful of the worst case scenario in everything you do in this game . To be a cynic is to be a realist and to be informed is best of all . <p> I have typed this without deep analysis as I said several chapters ago and this is delaying a glass of well-chilled , barely deserved Sauvignon Blanc . Run it past yourselves and if this sounds fanciful , let me have it both barrels . I try only to cry in private or while driving . <p> At first glance , I can see no great problem but it would need a fair degree of wisdom from all three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent , insightful lawyer type . <p> Just an off the cuff jobber .. ! <p> Peter <p> Ps ' EPS501 ' I would be particularly interested to know whether you think this may have worked for you , including whether you might not have bought as a result of what my miniidea above would probably have dragged up . All the best to you , anyway . Stay strong ! <p> Thank you very much for your responses ! I must point out that I wanted to have sitting tenants that had been checked and shown to have paid their rent etc .. on time for at least a year . These tenants - now my tenants - have all that with proof from the letting agent . From all contact with my tenant since completion , the issues I face point toward the letting agent that ( unfortunately for us ) were also the selling agent . A further weak link was my own solicitor 's inexperience in not receiving documents of vital elements but instead accepted the assurances of the vendor 's solicitor . The tenants themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another story obviously ) which shows the kind of level this letting/estate agent operate on . With hindsight I still would have bought this property with the tenants but insisted on documents from the vendor each and every step of the way between the solicitors with no contact with the agent ! On the deposit front , I am hoping the DPS will be able to assist . I have written proof it was taken by the letting agent and I believe it was an error on their part that the rent was not paid to me in time . So that is where I am at present .

@@76817461 @5517461/ <h> Depositing the bond outside of 30 days problems <p> For the first time last August we took a deposit when renting our property but did not know about placing it into a deposit scheme , so for a while the cheque hung around in a drawer while I went to the USA and then when I found it there weeks later i put it into my bank , one I never use where I knew it would be safe till the tenants needed it back . However the tenants started to become into arrears with their rent and causing all kinds of havoc and hostile behaviour and stopped doing the garden , so having told them 6 weeks prior to doing so that we would be doing some gardening work , we went along to do it and they kicked up a stink and sent for the police and started legal proceedings against us for harrassment . We laughed at this for we had visited only twice in 4 months . Their solicitor apparently told them to take photos of our visits , and we made one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for good measure took an off duty police officer with us , but teh tenants refused us entry and took a photograph of us and the police officer as we sat in our car . Well to cut a long story short we issued a section 21 on December 24th one to each tenant signed on the contract , 4 of them , and it was due to expire on the last day of their contract namely Feb 22nd . They told their solicitor they would leave before this date , and he told our solicitor , but we were dubious . Come Feb 22nd and they sent word through their solicitor that they would not be leaving as the section 21 was invalid due to 2 reasons , one we had not deposited the bond within the legal requirement of 30 days and 2 we had not returned the bond before issuing the section 21 . Therefore our accelerated order for possession at the court fell through , we ended up paying their legal costs and they are still in our house without a contract now . The council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says because we did not make up a new contract the tenacy becomes periodic and because we accept -50 a week less than the rent due ( from the council ) we are in fact allowing the tenants to live there at -200 a month than we first asked for on the contract . they owe about -2500 now . There was a period when they and the council did not pay for 8 weeks so we issued a section 8 but the tenants paid a little off to bring it within the 8 weeks so the section 8 was invalid . They will not allow us near the house or they ring the police for harrassment take photos and tell their solicitor so we are forced to keep away . It is doing our head in . The council wo n't rehome them for they are in rent arrears . They want us now to pay them 3 times the -650 bond that we have now returned to them . They have accepted its return but say unless we cough up -2000 they are staying put . How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay them the penalty before we can issue another section 21 . <p> Wendy , if you did not state what date you were going to visit to do the garden and if the tenants did not reply accepting your visit then you have no right to enter the property ( this includes the grounds ) . If you ignored the tenants and still entered the property this would have been a forced entry and trespass , arrestable offences . Repeated incidents , loitering ( even with your local and probably uninformed bobby ) is harassment . If you have not placed the deposit into a government approved deposit scheme then I am afraid you have again broken the law . The consequence is you will loose all rights to possession . And judging by what you have said - your tenants know this ! You could also be fined up to -3000 . You need to seek legal advice from a property solicitor asap , maybe first call the NLA help line . I think your best bet , and probably your only solution , would be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlords : if you are going to manage your own properties you must do your homework first ! Sorry - no good news/easy solution here ! Please keep us informed as to how you get on - good luck . <p> Thank you . The tenants have now accepted the deposit back from the DPS and have quoted their ' quiet enjoyment ' rights of the property . This is annoying as their 6 month contract expired on Feb 22nd . How can they just remain there when it was for 6 months only ? This we do not understand . <p> Their solicitor has been in touch stating that we must pay -300 of his clients fees as ordered by the judge on April 14th and that the sum is grossly overdue but we have not had anything in writing about this until he wrote to us today giving us 14 days to pay . <p> However he did not make any statement regarding the penalty attached to the deposit . <p> He did say that we were not to enter the garden however without the tenants stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to stay a maximum of 6 months are still at the property and can order us around ? It is unfair . <p> Hi Wendy , I am answering this after responding to your other post . Once the six months has completed the tenancy will automatically roll over onto a Statutory Periodic Tenancy , assuming both parties do n't object . No additional agreements are required . If the landlord does not want this then you must serve notice as set out in the AST to terminate the tenancy at the end of the fixed term . I am assuming this was not served by you . With regard to the -300 , if it has been ordered by the judge then you or your solicitor should have received this order from the court . Do you have a solicitor acting on your behalf - most will give a free hour of consultation . <p> Hi Rob , We issued a section 21 by hand to each tenant on December 24th . It stated that the date they should leave was Feb 22nd which was the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' if you want us out you are going to have to drag us out ' and they have not left . <p> We did have a solicitor who was useless and it ended up going to court and the tenants solicitor asking us to repay the emergency legal aid fund that his clients had been forced to take out . He asked the judge for -1200 but the judge said we had to pay only -300 . At this very same time we sacked our solicitor so although he told us the outcome of the court hearing and about the -300 we did not get anything in writing and we have assumed that the court would write to us about it . Now today I have recieved a demand for it from the tenants solicitor to pay within 14 days or to incur costs as he says the payment is grossly overdue . I replied to him stating we knew about it but had no idea who we were to pay it to and had been waiting for a letter about it . <p> We do not really see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though since the whole issue began because the tenants would not pay their rent or allow us to inspect the house or even to leave when asked to . It suddenly all became about the bond not being paid into the DPS within 30 days . <p> Its like banging our head on the wall . Will no one listen to us ? These people stopped paying their rent and became really nasty which was why we sought legal help ( they make untrue accusations and ten weeks ago my husband was arrested because they said he had been round and assaulted them when he had not - thankfully the police believed him due to the circumstances surrounding that day but it could well have been worse and they may not have ) these tenants are really awful but seem like butter would n't melt . They totally sucked us in by how nice they were to begin with but within 3 weeks of being at the house their rent was late until it stopped altogether for 8 weeks until the council started paying a little of it straight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from here . We spent all our savings on a rubbish solicior and got nowhere . If the landlords insurance legal team will help that will be great but if they do n't then we simply can not afford another solicitor , so feel absolutely stuck . <p> I appreciate your help . It feels like someone is listening to us at long last , even if I don ; t like everything that you say , I accept that what you say is likely the way of it - re paying penalties for the bond business . Thank you . Wendy . <p> Yes we served notice on December 24th to expire on Feb 22nd the day the contract ended . But the tenants went to their solicitor and told him to tell our solicitor ' if they want us out they are going to have to drag us out .

Buildings are the most important asset for landlords of privately rented properties to insure , and serious damage to the buildings can put considerable strain on any landlord 's finances . <p> Most buildings insurance typically covers perils such as fire and explosions ; storms and weather damage ; flood damage ; subsidence and structural failures ; and burst or leaking pipes and other water apparatus . <p> This insurance also usually covers damage to permanent fixtures , both inside and outside the property , such as kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However leaseholders of flats in buildings that are covered by a freeholder 's insurance policy need to check their policy carefully to ensure that they are aware of how much cover the policy provides for them . <p> In most cases , freeholders are interested primarily in getting protection for the main structure of the building . Their insurance policies are not likely to include those fixtures , fittings and decorations which are the responsibility of the leaseholder such as kitchens , bathrooms and floor coverings , nor legal liability for injury or damage to the tenant or any other person lawfully invited onto the property . <p> It is also important to note that the freeholder will not insure the cost of providing alternative accommodation to the tenant or loss of rent , which the landlord will have to cope with should the property be made uninhabitable , even if the event which caused it is insured by their policy . <p> Contents <p> Increasingly privately-rented premises are being let furnished and it is therefore important that the landlord , who will have to replace damaged items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For landlords who own the building , e.g. a converted house or purpose built block of flats , the policy should also cover furnishings in the common parts of the premises . <p> It is always a good idea for a landlord to ensure that their tenants make arrangements to purchase their own insurance . This will protect their personal contents as the landlords policy will not extend to cover these items , or the tenants legal liability should they cause damage to a neighbouring property or cause injury to a Third Party . <p> Property Owners Public Liability <p> Whilst insuring the Buildings and Contents will protect a landlord financially , probably the greatest exposure from a legal point of view is Property Owners Public Liability Insurance . Landlords of leasehold properties often mistakenly believe that the freeholder 's liability cover will extend to protect them but this is not the case . <p> As most landlords will be aware , their legal duty of care to their tenants is becoming more onerous and litigation against landlords is bound to increase as the economy suffers . Whilst many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that they meet these obligations , accidents can and do unfortunately happen . <p> Without this cover in place a landlord could be left financially ruined , should a tenant be seriously injured ( or worse ) as a result of an incident at the property for which it was alleged that the landlord was liable . <p> Rent protection <p> The issue of the ability of tenants to pay their rent takes us onto an insurance policy that , in these difficult economic conditions , has become increasingly popular with landlords . <p> Rent protection insurance can ensure that landlords do not lose out on thousands of pounds of lost income when a tenant loses their job or their income suddenly reduces . Subject to certain conditions being met , the policy will pay the rent owed as a result of a tenant 's failure to pay the rent in full and on the due date shown in the tenancy agreement . <p> NLA Rent Guarantee Insurance covers up to -2,500 per month for unpaid rental income ( up to a maximum of -15,000 or six months ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Customs ( HMRC ) routinely check a proportion of tax returns to make sure they are correct .

All separate meters , totally independent . <p> My thoughts are , paying for their gas use , in a fair way to us both - and that way I can introduce some constant fabric heat that would also radiate up through the rest of the building . <p> It 's certainly a tricky issue , I can see why it would be cheaper in the long run for you to pay for a little extra heating rather than dealing with condensation .

Can anyone suggest anything else or is it really a question of constant background heating ? <p> Give them a bottle of Dettol Mould and Mildew Remover ( DETTOL Complete Clean Mold and Mildew Remover All Purpose Cleaner for deep clean http : **35;650;TOOLONG ) - it is awesome and keeps mould ( when used regularly and in conjunction with ventilation ) at bay . I think it 's the most effective item on the market and buy one for new tenants as part of the move in. @74256 Sorry to hear you 're having so many problems was recommending a Positive Input Ventilation system for the flat - have you got a humidity sensor ?

Can you tell I have been reading up on the topic for the flat ? <p> Also consider automatic door closers - I use them on my multilets on the kitchen and lounge - they reduce noise for those returning late from disturbing other members of the house and keep moisture contained - encouraging in the case of the kitchen the window to be opened or the extractor switched on . <p> Extractor fans should be installed in ALL kitchens and bathrooms and the bathroom one should have a PIR(movement) sensor or a humidistat as on bright days the pull cord is not used so the extractor does n't kick in . With a PIR movement in the room wakes the fan or humidity from a shower or bath wakes the humidistat one .

Buildings need to be at a moderate temperature , humidity kept low - lids on saucepans , bathrooms vented for short periods after steamy baths and showers ( extractor fans or opening windows ) extra spin on washing before hanging up . <p> Elementary ! I tell the tenant . If you breath , cook , wash , and dry clothes in any property , - dampness , moisture and wet will be locked in the home and it will naturally lead to condensation against any colder wall , window , ceiling or fitting .

@@76817473 @5517473/ <p> Indeed , housing benefit is like an amazing salary , actually , far , far better than a salary , because with a salary you actually work for it and pay tax on it . I corresponded with Lord Freud about the non-payment of rent by my tenant , now evicted for non-payment of rent . In mitigation , his tax-payer funded lawyer said he had volunteered to pay housing benefit - I saw none of it . He did n't even bother to show up in court . It has taken me over 130 hours to paint and clean my house . I have also had to pay for approximately 80 hours work from gardeners and a painter and other services . I agree , there is a grave disparity between the tenant and the landlord . My tenant parked his Porsche on my front lawn , whilst claiming housing benefit . I spent my bank holiday cleaning the tenants filth . The damages deposit certainly does not cover my costs . One of the children had scratched " It is not fair " into one window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your predicament , and found myself in this situation all too often until 2011 . About two thirds of our porfolio is let to tenants receiving one form of housing benefit or another . We had multiple issues with tenants costing tens of thousands of pounds . About exactly a year ago , I started to write a Property Operations Manual which included , amongst other things , standards of performance for us ( as owners ) , for agents , for property condition and for tenants . It has been an intensive struggle to bring all aspects of these standards into conformance in about one year 's time , but it has certainly paid handsome dividends . We have a couple of " on watch " tenants still in occupation , but by establishing agency standards of vetting , and tenant standards by evidence , there has been a remarkable transformation in both arrears reduction AND cost of maintenance during and after tenancies . It may be just a stroke of pure luck , but I doubt it . I remember going through the pain of keeping a property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard finally turned up . That tenant has been a model tenant for the last six months with no arrears and no damage . Though I am sure we will experience rogue tenants again in the future , I am satisfied that by applying common business principles of standards , policies , processes and procedures to our lettings business , the net profitability and longevity of our lettings business will improve dramatically . Regards , Gerry <p> Hi there . I read with interest the comments above , having suffered financially at the hands of benefit tenants ' who have vacated properties owing the local councils gifted two months rent and then incurred further costs in damages and the inevitable void period while remarketing . I find that this is an incredibly frustrating subject . It is my understanding that the idea of paying LHA direct to the tenant was to empower them ' and give them a sense of responsibility in dealing with their own financial affairs . When this fails to happen however , the tenant then seems to be completely absolved of any responsibility whatsoever . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due diligence is obviously called for when looking for new tenants . Unscrupulous tenants however who make a career out of cheating the system will always find a way to cheat , bringing untold misery often to landlords who are far from being wealthy and who see property as their pension , having long since lost any other realistic pension at the hands of other flawed governmental policy . The bottom line is that policy needs to change . The landlord needs protection from the rogue tenant through criminal and not civil law . We open our doors and invite all in after carrying out due diligence . Even so , we still have to run the gauntlet with a new tenant which is just wrong . We need to have the backing of the law and the police should things go wrong ! If this were the case , things would go wrong far less frequently ! As private landlords , when things go wrong we have to fight individually often at considerable expense . We need a lot more weight behind us , we need to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sometimes deliberately set out to obtain property for free , who cause further what can only be described as criminal ' damage and just vanish . The police are the vehicle for this , or , dept collectors need to be given some new teeth and civil law reviewed . It is only by landlords sticking together and pushing for a change in the law that will bear any fruit . What does everyone else think ? After reading this , it would be really good if other landlords could say if they agree with needing a change in the law . It is no good us all having our own separate gripes about what is essentially the same problem ; we all need to stick together in order for anyone to listen and hopefully for some meaningful legislation to be brought in to protect us landlords , the majority of which are far from being wealthy ! ! <p> I have let a " luxury " apartment , bought initially for our retirement , to a young lady for many years accepting her payments at about half the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and cried and pleaded desperately to stay beyond the first six months and said all her relatives were dead , she was completely destitute as the father of the baby did not pay maintenance and she could not get any help from the State as she did not yet have " indefinite leave to remain " , although she was working full-time as condition of her immigration status , and she could not get a council flat . I was at wit 's end how to pay the mortgage without the rent but felt I was still better off than she was , poor soul , as my retired husband could go back to work to fund the mortgage payments until our tenant was able to get her British passport and , following that her child benefit and housing benefit etc and hopefully a council flat . The tenant promised that a soon as she got to that stage , she would make up for the rent she had not been able to pay . After a few years , she admitted that she had now received her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for all the fees involved and still could not pay the full rent . When she had obtained her British passport , I hoped it was now pay-back time and my husband could finally retire as the rent should be enough to pay most of the mortgage interest . However , the tenant cut her working days to four days instead of five ( explaining this was still full-time ) so she could not pay more than half the rent . She also started taking holidays abroad a couple of times a year to see her relatives , who all now were alive and well ! Now , after almost ten years , she is still paying a much reduced rent because she is paying for her holidays for the sake of her child , and who could begrudge a poor fatherless child holidays on the beach ? I suspected she was getting housing benefit which she was not passing on but dared not ask as this was confidential and I could have been jailed for harassment . My husband kept working . The other day she called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news and which did I want to hear first . I said the good news . The good news was that she had at last been made redundant ! I wondered what on earth the bad news could be then : perhaps her child had an accident or she was diagnosed with cancer ? The bad news was that I would no longer have her as a tenant because now that she was unemployed as a single mother she could move to a much better place , with all new furniture , as everything would be paid for by the State so it did not matter what the rent would be and " why should I be expected to work when I am a single mother ? " . Quite . She can move to South Kensington or Hampstead or Poole , find a lovely flat with all new furnishings and have no worries with the costs of rents , mortgages , heating , rail fares , or only seeing her child at weekends because of long working hours needed to pay for it all . Where did it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were not for the " accidental " or " buy-to-let " landlords ? Why , if you are not working , can you still choose where to live at our expense when in fact it does not matter where you live if you are not working , so why not somewhere cheaper than Poole or Islington where working people , taxpayers , can not afford to live ? Now I shall hopefully soon get the apartment back albeit in a slum state , in need of complete refurbishment and refurnishing , and of course she could only afford a very small deposit all those years ago , and no doubt there will be the utility bills left for me to pay out of my pension . I can think of much better deserving charities than lettings to scroungers so this flat will not be let again , it will be my second home and I will be better off and have a stress free life . <p> Gerry Pridham , I would be most interested to learn of what is in your operations manual , if that is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean ups after tenants arrears and a local authority not being too cooperative . It is also the case that as landlords , we also have to take some responsibility to run our affairs professionally . On this basis , I think a manual like yours would be very useful to any of us who would like to operate more professionally . Even headings , as suggested above <p> I 'm not sure what Gerry does but I am amazed that some Landlords and even Agents do n't have good contracts and vigorous vetting processes and procedures in place . I personally do n't let to those on benefits , I use the NLA reference check process and I also use Tenant I 'd and Landlord Reference Data bases . I also interview prospective tenants and guarantors . They ( guarantors and tenants ) have to provided pay slips , NI number , proof of current address and photo I 'd ( if you do this , make sure you are registered with ICO for data protection and make sure the AST agreement specifically states that information may be shared with third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall into arrears etc ) . If they are reluctant its simple - they do n't move in .. <p> I tapped into this discussion because I lost several thousand pounds in 2012 through Housing Benefit tenants not passing on their payments to me . I really thought the coalition government would reverse this ludicrous Labour Government policy of payment to tenants . Unfortunately Grant Shapps , who seemed pretty sensible on housing matters , has already moved to another post . <p> My understanding is that Housing Associations do n't suffer this problem because they are allowed to agree direct payment of Housing Benefit with their tenants . So where does ' empowerment ' feature there ? It looks like a pretty clear double standard . Incidentally , one might have thought that ' empowering ' the tenant would mean allowing them to decide how they wanted their rent paid , as opposed to allowing them to meditate on whether rent is more important than , say , ' buying birthday presents ' ( and I quote from experience ) . <p> Next up is the Universal Benefit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't afford because they have n't thought through how their benfit budget will be allocated between many competing financial demands . Then they 'll default . The whole local market may be thrown out of kilter by unrealistic thinking on the part of tenants . I already have tenants hit by the reduction of Housing Benefit to under-35s telling me they 'll simply ' make up the difference ' for a one-bedroom flat from ( this is Hastings by the way ) -65 to -90 . So that 's -25 a week , nearly half their total Jobseeker 's Allowance . And pigs may fly . <p> I 'm very disappointed at how litle progress has been made to address the issue of how Housing Benefit is paid . I have n't met a sigle employee at the Housing Benefit office in Hastings who does n't think the policy is deeply flawed . Even the staff think it 's all gone pear-shaped . <p> In the old days when direct payment could be mutually agreed , I did n't have a single case of a tenant not wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with babies in pushchairs walking round Hastings with -500 in their bags moving money from their bank to mine ( that 's if the boyfriend has n't got hold of it first ) . <p> I have had many types of tenants an can tell you I have lost thousands in unpaid rent an damages from housing benefit/LHA tenants , I deal with many via letting agents due to properties not being local to me an am really fed up with them not paying my rent , the councils 8wks+ arrears , the damage done by LHA tenants , the uncooperative councils and the huge amount of time/effort/cost dealing with this segment creates . What can the NLA do to help us Landlords ? Maybe I should create a group where we can share ideas ? The private tenants ( working ) are almost non-existent in some areas .

( I go and come back some other time . ) <p> Similarly , for statutory periodic tenancies ( ' rolling ' tenancies , where no further AST is offered and so the terms of the original tenancy agreement often continues unchanged ) I would perhaps also suggest at least considering doing the same i.e throw another complete copy of PI their way at the very beginning of any new six month period * ( so , beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from your scheme 's website just before needed and they will have the most up to date information .

In the meantime , you are trying to close the door to a court claim . <p> On the face of it , my issuing of Section 21 's midterm and the printing up another contract every six months is arguably unecessarily bureacratic in itself . Those that think so , may be right . It 's a lot of printer use ( complete duplication almost ) every six months , when , were it a ' periodic , ' it would just run on without further comment or fuss . This is a valid point per se . I accept most people for sure do n't issue Section 21 's unless they want the bods out . <p> The reasons I have so far continued with this somewhat bespoke strategy -I thought hard about following the ' rolling tenancy ' route and I may yet try it- are that : <p> 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are issued simultaneous with a new contract ; it is , then , neither intimidating nor confrontational ; it does mean that if you fall out from that point , formal notice is already served , complete with signatures . I call that a result in the wings . On signing the new AST , the S21 becomes null and void . <p> 2 . At this visit , I carry out an inspection . The association between condition of property and my visit with the offer of a new contract ( as yet unsigned ) seems timely and poignant . <p> 3 . It allows an extra visit to the property when , perhaps , something is troubling you . I never expect and only once have I allowed an AST to be signed same day as issue ( includes renewals ) since , in my view it is unprofessional , potentially unfair and rather risky business practice not to allow them time to study the thing in their own time . We are not double glazing sales reps after all . Do keep in mind what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A return visit to discuss with a view to signing is worth the investment of time , I find and most certainly if you are local . Almost without doubt , it makes for continuing good relations and a free cup of tea . <p> 4 . I do not want to get caught out . I think we all know the law was originally billed as heavily in favour of the tenant . No change there , then while dear Sarah Teather tries to put further unreasonable , untenable proposals on the law table in regard to socalled ' retaliatory evictions . ' Well done Sarah . We all carry out thousands of retaliatory evictions every year . We like the peace that property voids afford ( it would be unkind to suggest she was always destined to be a better conference comedienne than a politician . ) <p> And if you accept DSS tenants , you need to fully acknowledge that your tenant will have free ( and often aggressively powerful ) legal advise at their disposal , aka the council ( just one reason why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide berth . ) <p> I am a landlord of 7 years but not a professional advisor .

I have n't delivered late but it 's ridiculous that landlords have to worry so much about it . <p> I have a further suggestion . When downloading the DPC to print , the mydposits scheme also downloads the prescribed information , so two pages . I write at the top of each page , Page one of two and page two of two . This avoids the tenant saying they got the DPC but not the info as , obviously , having signed receipt of page one means they saw there were two pages . In any case , on the DPC it states there are four sections and section three , on page two , is the info . So again , you sign one means you 've read it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small claims for unpaid rent and my tenant is counterclaiming for the same reason as the author of this , that is that I did not give prescribed info , which of course I did and the proof will be as I have indicated above .

I have asked them twice , and they ignored me on both occasions . <p> Could depend on what you mean by application form . I would suggest any general information collected prior to a particular property being selected should not be passed without permission of the applicant . If however " your " property has been selected and references are taken by " your agent " ( i.e. acting for you ) then yes you are entitled to see them as you are the principal - but best practice that the agent explains that you will be given them . In any event , not a good sign that the agent has n't replied to you ! <p> My property was selected and I subsequently did the referencing on prospective tenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the tenant as possible before making a selection . It seems that the only thing that landlords can do is make it a precondition that the letting agent provides everything they know about a ( prospective ) tenant . Enforcing that would be a further issue . <p> Agree . Given that the hapless letting agency appears to be ignoring you intimates trouble from them in the future . I would disinstruct while the going is good ; they are ignorant . It would likely get worse from there and what more evidence does one need ? How lucky to get it early on , I say ! They can threaten all they like . Communication is a basic premise of a contract and they have n't met it . They " ll learn . Actually , they wo n't . <p> If I may answer by example .. <p> Where a landlord wants to have sight of all details that get seen by the referencing agency e.g. salary advice , work contract , passport details/scans etc. , they should make this clear from the outset and BEFORE deciding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise they just wo n't do it or will in due course ' forget ' to copy you in . <p> Letting agencies ( including those that reply ) are , in my experience , incompetent generally and what they do n't know , they guess or lie . Been there , Had it . Take a look at haart.co.uk on trustpilot , for example , should any out there need a little more proof . Incompetence and ' sneak ' is endemic and will so remain until the ' individuals ' within are body-by-body regulated . <p> As an entity , letting agencies are curiously protective about the ' stuff ' that gets sent to referencing agencies , often stating it is not possible by virtue of ' client confidentiality ' or -if they 've ever heard of it- Data Protection Act ( DPA ) On this matter they exhibit a brief frenetic burst of energy , sadly quite misplaced through ignorance of the ' actual . ' <p> I can only guess agencies get all flappy about showing referencing submissions to those that really need to know -either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or .. er .. just ignore the intelligence behind the question , as in your case- because of the brief elation their misguided sense of self-importance brings . We have secret info and well .. you 're just a landlord . Yawn . <p> Rather than tediously quoting Hansard and white papers .. I 'll simplify ..... that excuse from them is rubbish ! <p> It is you , the property owner and whose signature will be on the tenancy agreement ( AST ) as landlord that needs to see all the ' evidence ' to support an application ( unless you are happy with just the referencing report ; your call , absolutely but please do n't assume it will be done efficiently ) . <p> A decent referencing application form , such as that used by FCC Paragon , will advise on it that the landlord may see ' some or all ' paperwork submissions . The applicant signs that they agree . <p> This facilitates their knowledge and consent , which you do require .. by signature . <p> My guess is landlords rarely bother if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cute little report that comes back with the little tick that says ' Approved ! .

And there was the reassuring tick .. " Approved. ! " How lovely .... Ching ching ! ! The tenant applicant had , however , told me at first opportunity that he had an unsatisfied CCJ . He showed me the paperwork . It showed it was due for removal in a few months . He also evidenced -at my request- that he had similarly immediately advised the agent by email . ( William H Brown , a large group that goes under different regional names . ) <p> No mention on the credit report . AND no mention at any time to me via the branch manager .

And get his/her email confirmation to my terms , ( which I send for them to reply to in order that I choose the wording ) and not some side kick employed to generalise . <p> 1 . You must explain from the outset if you wish to see all paperwork for yourself rather than just the resulting ' report . ' If they wo n't confirm in writing , it is not a problem to you but .. walk away . <p> 2 . Applicant must be aware and sign that they are in agreement .

You can use their service privately i.e. should you nor be using an agent at all . Now there 's the better idea ! <p> 3 . If you intend to keep a copy of the referencing report ( by any means , so including electronically as in an email ) you will need to comply with DPA by registering with ICO ( Information Controllers Office ) as dealing with data relating to property management . ICO is the UK government department that holds the data gatherers register . It is not scary to register and nor is it intrusive . <p> You do not need to register year on year - because this time next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If you simply glance at a reference/credit report in an agent 's office and the agent retains , registration to ICO is not actually necessary . ( ICO told me that just two months ago but make your own checks . ) Name , current address , tenant contact details etc as on a standard AST are not considered personal data that requires registration as a ' data controller . ' With respect , my stock advice to landlords and property owners abroad with UK travellers as guests is to register anyway . It helps minimise argument and contention . The paperwork a landlord generates is all designed to avoid grief . See it that way . Is currently -35 per year to register and so the legitimate among us can take 20% off that .. if you do n't mind the wait while HMRC catch up . <p> Give ICO a business/correspondence address if you are unhappy about your home address being on public record . You can call them to amend over the phone but be quick ; it tends to roll out within 3 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , however . <p> ICO will also take your home address for correspondence between you ; this is fine . They are fully grown up about privacy , including yours and will not reveal that glibly ( like British gas ) or unintentionally ( like British Gas ) or without warning . ( You get the idea . ) <p> Thank you very much for the the replies . My thinking is that the landlord takes the risk and should have all information on prospective tenants . The letting agent is just that an agent that provides service to the landlord , for a significant fee . Currently I 'm abroad , and do n't know of any alternative , but to use a letting agent . <p> Over the years i have learnt to take more control and now do the tenant reference checks myself using the NLA . So at least I should have some reliable information on the tenant . <p> On the issue of letting agent taking advantage , this happened to me previously , i.e. overcharging for property maintenance , such as 200 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal complaint against them and told the director if it continued I would switch agents . Now I always use my own contractor and there has been no reoccurrence for the last two years . So I agree that a robust approach works .

We consider this to be overly intrusive and of no direct benefit to tenants or landlords . <p> " The private-rented sector is already heavily regulated and many recent changes have yet to settle down . Any further regulation , therefore , has to be very carefully considered . In the current economic climate , the last thing good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is introduced it needs to focus totally on pushing up standards and rooting out rogue landlords . We will be looking for assurances that a register would be properly resourced and be of direct and immediate benefit to landlords and tenants . <p> " Any changes must not be seen as the ' thin end of the edge ' in terms of further , burdensome regulation . Reform must be workable for landlords and not damage the private-rented sector . The challenge now for Government should be to focus on incentives and encouragement . " <p> Other proposals include : <p> All tenancies should take the form of written agreements . <p> Increasing the threshold for access to assured shorthold tenancies ( AST ) and the associated legislative framework from -25,000 to -100,000 of aggregated annual rent . <p> Full mandatory regulation of letting and management agents by an independent body . <p> Encouragement of institutional investment in the sector by creating opportunities to invest on a large scale and for the long term . This would include the introduction of a long-term funding model for new private rented housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaggregated understanding of the sector in terms of improving the evidence base upon which decisions are made . <p> Encouragement to landlord organisations to make support and training services more widely available to enable better understanding of what is involved in " truly professional private rented sector housing management .

Consideration should also be given to whether a national accreditation scheme should be established . <p> Increasing protection for tenants whose landlord defaults on a mortgage . <p> Notes to Editors:Representing landlords from all over the UK , the National Landlords Association ( NLA ) is the leading organisation for private-residential landlords .

@@76817555 @5517555/ 67417 @qwx687417 <h> 2012 " The year of the Landlord <p> The Government 's new housing strategy in England is a timely reminder of the importance of housing in national life and the relationship housing has with the economy . The role of the private-rented sector is recognised as key to housing growth which , in turn , is a critical factor for this country 's economic growth . <p> The NLA welcomes the importance the Government attaches to the pivotal role played by the sector , and welcomes the non-regulatory approach to encourage improvement and growth . With demand for rental housing likely to increase , and with nearly fifty thousand households in England alone living in temporary accommodation , the NLA believes there needs to be flexible options for the private-rented sector and , equally importantly , incentives to increase the stock of well-managed , rental accommodation . <p> There is a clear role for the NLA to play to support the evolution of the sector into the UK 's second largest tenure . In fact , we see the framework established by the new housing strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop our own strategy for increasing professionalism in the sector , and at the same time re-double our efforts to bring about a unified voice for the private-rented sector . <p> For these reasons the NLA agrees with many of the objectives of the Government 's strategy in England , which chimes with our belief that a non-regulatory approach will help to secure the private-rented sector as a strong , flexible and desirable tenure of choice . <p> To this end , one of the NLA 's major objectives is to raise standards . We will continue to do this by raising the importance of initiatives such as NLA Accreditation . I was pleased to hear that there are now nearly 1,000 landlords accredited through our scheme , 32 local authorities who use NLA Accreditation as their sole scheme , and 5 others who recognise NLA Accreditation . That said , it should be mentioned that NLA members who for perfectly valid reasons decide not to follow the accreditation route have access to a wide range of other tools provided by the NLA to support their efforts to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NLA Online Library , our Focus e-newsletter and this publication spring to mind , and , of course , always double-check problem areas with the NLA Advice Line . Well-informed landlords will help improve the professionalism of our sector . <p> As part of this picture , our drive to increase contacts with members continues to gather pace , with twelve new NLA branches opening in recent months across the country , from Dundee to Southgate . There is at least one NLA landlord meeting almost every working day somewhere in the UK . These meetings provide excellent opportunities for local landlords to network and find out about trends and latest developments in their local areas , and at the national level . <p> The close relationship we last year entered into with the UK Association of Letting Agents ( UKALA ) as part of a mutually beneficial business agreement will continue to develop through a range of benefits and services so that we can create common standards and we speak with one voice . Another area where the NLA can help make significant improvements to the nation 's housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government 's Green Deal scheme to improve energy efficiency in rental properties . This was the subject of a presentation at our very successful National Conference last year ( see page 25-29 for more details ) . I encourage landlords to give serious consideration to taking advantage of the scheme to improve their properties when products become available this year . While the cost of these improvements will be a key factor , I believe that the Green Deal is innovative and presents an excellent opportunity for landlords to improve the energy efficiency of their properties ; it will also help tenants save on their bills and do their bit for the environment . <p> As a priority in the coming year we will continue to strive to work constructively with local authorities , however difficult that may be in some situations . Regrettably , there are local authorities that appear to believe that the blanket use of Article 4 directions ( to restrict planning for shared housing ) and blanket licensing is some sort of magic bullet for the private-rented sector . The reality is different . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , determined effort " based on clear analysis and , dare I say it , commitment of resources " over a prolonged period to drive rogues from the sector and achieve the results that everyone wishes to see . There is no single , regulatory solution and I am pleased to note that this is also the Government 's view . I keep on saying " but it bears repetition - that landlords need to be seen by government as the solution , not the problem . <p> I will round off by mentioning ongoing work at the European level . As we start the year , the NLA is working through our membership of the UIPI to minimise the impact of the EU mortgage directive which threatens to remove the distinction between buy-to-let and domestic mortgages . The UIPI is also exerting considerable influence on the hugely important Energy Efficiency Directive . For more information , see page 41
