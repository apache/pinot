@@59076146 @8076146/ <p> You guys , F6 does NOT mean a code in unpatchable . It is a codetype to help defeat dma , and will have a better chance of not getting patched . If we look at an F6 'd code , you will see why . <p> F6000001 800080FF <p> Ill just use a first line example . The F6000001 is just a way of telling the code executer that its in F6 code form , the 800080FF means to search between 8000-80FF . This does not mean a code is unpatchable . <p> There has also been people saying C2 and C0 codetypes are unpatchable . Why , I say to myself ? All they are is writing to one address and changing ASM instructions ; nothing to do with a patch . <p> There is NO way of making a code completely unpatchable . Now , stop saying they are unpatchable before I break your face . <p> stud <p> 01-22-2012 , 10:26 AM <p> So when Bully says his codes are unpatchable they really are n't ? 171057 @qwx581057 <p> 01-22-2012 , 10:26 AM <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them seem more desirable amongst the noobs . Out of all people , he should know that just because a code is F6 'd does n't mean it is unpatchable . <p> Austin . <p> 01-22-2012 , 10:28 AM <p> Yes , no code can be unpatchable . Its not possible . We ca n't control have far the addresses switch when there is an update . Plus , if the codes do get patched he can change the F6 ever so slightly , so everyone thinks its the same code , therefore a reason he does n't want his codes posted directly on a site . <p> Austin . <p> 01-22-2012 , 12:11 PM <p> How so are they less likely , clay ? I 've never heard that ; but if you look at it : C2888888 hhhdxhdxh <p> Would n't 88888888 be the address , and hhhdbbbbhbsz be the instructions ? hmm <p> Austin . <p> 01-22-2012 , 12:51 PM <p> But could n't any address be turned into an asm address , due to the fact that all addresses have instructions ? <p> mynameisjosh <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lol <p> Austin . <p> 01-22-2012 , 02:34 PM <p> I see ... this is kind of off topic , but what do people think about defeating dma with F6 ? Is it possible , or is it only possible in certain-no cases , due to the fact that you might not find values that do n't move ? Its always made me wonder . <p> Baktiar <p> 01-22-2012 , 02:51 PM <p> Another issue that arises is " region-free codes " <p> In most other games in which Ntsc-u ( contains only english ) and Pal ( multi-5 contains 5 different languages ) , the address for anything ' ammo , health , power ' are different . <p> F6 is used alot in those games so the code maker does n't have to make two versions of his code and his " work " is n't stolen <p> However , In Call Of Duty series on wii is released by different language ( ie. a German version of the game , along with a English ( pal &amp; ntsc-u ) , Italian , French , Spanish and etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ntsc English versions is completely the same . Which makes it completely unnecessary to make F6 codes for region combatability <p> However , other localised regions have quite a bit of differences ( for example German/italian/Dutch version of the game in which game address continually change due to the game hud/dispaly showing little-no blood on screen ) <p> And codes made specifically from the English version will not work on other localised versions unless it has a strong F6 format ( not C2/C0 ) <p> not sure if you understood my gibberish : ) <p> Austin . <p> 01-22-2012 , 03:01 PM <p> Good thoughts , baktair . However , seeing as the wii scene is shifted heavily onto call of duty here ; we do n't have to worry about regions , as you said . I just enjoy destroying rumors circulating at the time , kind of like when direct ram writes were said to be un-makeable due to a patch .

Wont someone think of the adults ! <p> You may not believe that an 11-year-old schoolboy or schoolgirl could design a Trojan horse that is able to steal the account login information of your favorite online game , but we see these cases on a daily basis These childish Trojans have several common characteristics . First of all , most of them are written using . NET framework ( Visual Basic , C# ) which is easy to learn for beginners and is easy to deploy you can download Microsoft Visual Studio Express edition for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can download pirated full versions of Borland Delphi for rapid ( malware ) application development <p> One 11 year-old unleashed these trojans in Team Fortress , claims the report . <p> One demonstration of this type of attack is where we detected malware written by an 11-year-old boy from Canada , who played Team Fortress with his friends and got his new iPhone a few days before <p> These crazy kids the most terrifying part is the motivation . There 's no real financial benefit here , they do it simply because they can . <p> What is the motivation for this behavior ? Most probably these child script writers are not doing it for financial gain , but more likely for a thrill . Essentially , young geeks seek to outsmart their friends and win the games or show off their computer skills . Source 1 : LONG ...

@@59076179 @8076179/ 171056 @qwx581056 <h> Xcode 4 : Creating and Changing a UISwitch . <p> In this tutorial we 'll be walking through creating a UISwitch , like shown below : <p> We 'll be using the On/Off switch . The one we will have is slightly different , because the switches in iOS 5 were given a more rounded look , but they will accomplish the same thing . So do n't worry if you have an older version of Xcode , you can still follow along . <p> Start by opening Xcode , starting a new Single View or View based project , and naming it SwitchTutorial , or something simple . <p> Go ahead and open the . h and let 's start adding the code . <p> First add a bracket after @interface ViewController , like this . <p> Now we 're going to add IBOutlet 's for the switch , the label , and the button . We 'll add these view elements ( switch , label , button ) later . <p> size=1color=greyXcode will most likely insert the last two brackets for you , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot , but , with a lot of things , it 's actually very simple . The first line declares that we are naming our IBAction theSwitch . The second line declares an if statement is being used . The third line determines what the text of the label says , depending upon the state of the button . The last two hide the no button and keep the yes button shown . <p> All together , this says " If the button is set to On , display the text " Switch is on , this is Button 1 . " Also , hide the text from button 2 . <p> Got it ? <p> Your . m should now look like this . <p> Next we 'll be adding an else statement between the last two brackets . See the image below if you do n't understand what i mean . <p> Rather than only type in the code that you are adding , i 'm going to be adding this code , plus the code you added in the last step . So just add in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just like the first if statement , but the values are reversed , basically . <p> All together , the two statements say " If the button is set to On , display the text " Switch is on , this is Button 1 " and hide the text from button 2 . Otherwise , Display " Switch is off , this is Button 2 " and hide the text from button 1 . <p> Your . m should now look like this : <p> Now we are done with the coding , and we can move to our . storyboard file . <p> Start by going over to the Objects library , the column on the right , and finding a simple Switch . <p> We 're also going to need a label . Drag the label onto your view , and change it 's text to say " Switch is on , this is Button 1 . " <p> Your . storyboard should look like this : <p> Next we 'll need two round rect. buttons , named Button 1 and Button 2 . <p> Your . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click on the ViewController , the right orange and white box right below the view . Check the above images if you ca n't find it . <p> Once you click on it , your entire view should be highlighted blue . Once it is , go over to the right column , and click on the Connections Inspector , the last tab . <p> Under the Connections Inspector the second tab is Outlets . Drag the button1 outlet to button1 and the button2 outlet to button2 . <p> Next drag the label outlet to our " Switch is on " label , and the switchButton outlet to our switch.F <p> Finally , we go down to Received Actions , the last tab under the Connections Inspector , and drag it to the switch . Now , we ca n't just select " Touch Up Inside " like we would for a normal button , or a text field . We have to choose Value Changed . <p> One more thing to do . Select Button 2 , and open it in the Attributes Inspector . It 's the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the left of the Connections Inspector . <p> Under the subheading Drawing , is a checkbox with Hidden beside it . Check it . <p> There , now button 2 will be hidden until you flip the switch . Now you can save it , and run it .

Also , making the auto detect code filter out color codes was a bitch , it took me a few tries , but it is about as " noob proof " as it can get now . <p> Yep , that 's how mine worked . It just was n't in C0 . I do n't think you needed to make it filter out color codes though ... the in game names remove the color codes . ( I have n't played wii in a while , idk if there 's some in game color name code ) <p> The in game names do remove color codes , that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to that do n't change which also do n't contain colors of the original name . Hence the reason I had to filter the colors out . It works with name togglers too , that is pretty cool you must admit . Another interesting thing is that if you run the no migrate codes without a mastercode they simple lose there " no migrate " trait , then they will always work for player slot 0 without causing a freeze .

Although this may seem like a lot , for a new , almost revolutionary augmented reality device , I consider it a reasonable price , especially as they are not even out of development yet . <p> Other lucky developers , only selected , will hopefully get a chance to experience Project Glass before the consumer release , at the event Google is going to hold in San Francisco and New York , on January 28th-29th and February 1st-2nd respectively . <p> Google Glass , is the first project Google publicised from their secret X-Labs , and they are augmented reality , in the form of glasses on your face . They are just like the glasses you would wear in everyday life , except there is no lens and there is only a top rim . <p> Google Glass runs on Android , and is used with voice commands and facial movement , such as looking up to see your notification bar . You can reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , find other glasses users locations , listen to music , watch videos , and share to Google+ , as well as hanging out . ( The feature Google+ users will know about ) You can see a video that Google have made , demonstrating all the features in just under two minutes . <p> LONG ... <p> The search engine giant has released plans to hold a " glass foundry " , which features two days of the developers getting a good look at the glasses themselves , as well as obviously trying them out for themselves . The first day includes mainly learning about the glasses and a chance to use them , the second including demonstrations and exploration of the Mirror API which gives you the option of exchanging data with other people through the glasses . At the end of the day there will also be a chance for hopeful developers to show off what they have been working on , in front of a celebrity judging panel . <p> But not to worry , the consumer release is n't too far away , either late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developers do their stuff and I 'm sure you 'll have a pair in no time . <p> This looks amazing .

But , the gods had grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdued or killed . <p> So , now I am going to put the text I am covering in a spoiler and then write the summed up version below . <p> " In the beginning there was only chaos .

From Love came Light and Day .

" We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birth of a few of the gods . " In the beginning there was only chaos " , now this is an awkward way to start a story . Is it not ? I ca n't really tell you exactly what it means . Let 's assume this , based off of what we know . The next sentence " out of the void " is used . What 's the definition for void ? Let 's take a look shall we ? According to definition 2 on this page LONG ... void means " containing nothing " . So in nothing was chaos ? If we assume the void in some way is a living creature just like the other gods , an extended period of time within a space containing absolutely nothing can be harmful . Take Castaway for example , Chuck Noland ( played by Tom Hanks ) got stranded on an island with no one . Only himself , he created a friend with a volleyball just to keep himself from going crazy . Now put that in place for the " void " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment for the statement " In the beginning there was only chaos " . <p> " Then out of the void appeared Erebus , the unknowable place where death dwells , and Night . All else was empty , silent , endless , darkness . Then somehow Love was born bringing a start of order . From Love came Light and Day . Once there was Light and Day , Gaea , the earth appeared . " This is the next part we will cover . It 's also hard for me to explain this . So , let 's list all the people/names mentioned here . <p> Erebus/Night Love Light/Day Gaia ( Gaea is not the right spelling for it ) <p> Let 's start at the top of the list . Erebus - " the place where death resides " . Erebus is basically the sign for darkness and death . Love - Do I even need to explain ? Light/Day - If there is darkness , there must be light . Gaia - Gaia is made to represent the Earth , or you can call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next part ! " Then Erebus slept with Night , who gave birth to Ether , the heavenly light , and to Day the earthly light . Then Night alone produced Doom , Fate , Death , Sleep , Dreams , Nemesis , and others that come to man out of darkness " . So basically this ... Erebus + Night = Ether &amp; Day . Does that explain it enough ? Ether is called " the heavenly light " and Day is " the Earthly light " . Night , we 'll assume for the sake of understanding this story , is asexual . Out of Night came Doom , Fate , Death , Sleep , Dreams , and Nemesis . All of those are self-explanatory . <p> Next part is where it gets kind of weird . " Meanwhile Gaea alone gave birth to Uranus , the heavens . Uranus became Gaea 's mate covering her on all sides . Together they produced the three Cyclopes , the three Hecatoncheires , and twelve Titans " Gaia is also asexual , for the sake of understanding this story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uranus , her son , became her partner . Gaia + Uranus = 3 Cyclopes , 3 Hecatonchieres , &amp; 12 titans . <p> Now that we 've covered that whole section . We 'll go paragraph/sentence by paragraph/sentence now . " However , Uranus was a bad father and husband . He hated the Hecatoncheires . He imprisoned them by pushing them into the hidden places of the earth , Gaea 's womb . This angered Gaea and she ploted against Uranus . She made a flint sickle and tried to get her children to attack Uranus . All were too afraid except , the youngest Titan , Cronus " Okay , obviously there were some serious family problems here . Basically Uranus hated the 3 Hecatoncheires his wife/mother gave him . He hid them from everyone . Gaia did n't like that , she plotted to kill him . She made a weapon and asked her children to attack their father/brother . Only Cronus , the youngest of the 12 titans , had the guts to do it . <p> " Gaea and Cronus set up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cronus grabed his father and castrated him , with the stone sickle , throwing the severed genitales into the ocean . The fate of Uranus is not clear . He either died , withdrew from the earth , or exiled himself to Italy . As he departed he promised that Cronus and the Titans would be punished . From his spilt blood came the Giants , the Ash Tree Nymphs , and the Erinnyes . From the sea foam where his genitales fell came Aphrodite " . Here 's there run down of the plot and attack . Cronus cut of Uranus ' balls one night while he , Uranus , was laying with his wife/mother Gaia . Like planned . Cronus threw the balls into the ocean . Where Uranus ended up is not clear . Here are the 3 theories . <p> He died He left the Eerth He exiled himself to Italy <p> As he left , he swore Cronus and the other Titans would be punished . From the blood Uranus had spilled all over came the Guants , the Ash Tree Nymphs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balls of Uranus , came Aphrodite . <p> " Cronus became the next ruler .

He grew into a handsome youth on Crete . He consulted Metis on how to defeat Cronus . She prepaired a drink for Cronus design to make him vomit up the other children . Rhea convinced Cronus to accept his son and Zeus was allowed to return to Mount Olympus as Cronus 's cupbearer . This gave Zeus the opertunity to slip Cronus the specially prepaired drink . This worked as planned and the other five children were vomitted up . Being gods they were unharmed . They were thankful to Zeus and made him their leader " .

Well SkyUI Is . <p> " SkyUI is a mod that aims to improve Skyrim 's User Interface by making it easier to use with mouse and keyboard , less wasteful of screen space and nicer to look at . We do all that while keeping true to the style of the original UI , so new and old components are integrated seamlessly . " <p> This is what Skyrim 's UI Looks like without the Mod . <p> Now with the Mod SkyUI This is how it looks . <p> It just sorts everything and adds little images next to the items to represent idem so if it 's a sword it will be shown as a sword image . Anyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trust me after you 've installed this mod , you wo n't want to go back to the old UI . <p> Some Sid-Notes before you install this you 're gon na need http : //skse.silverlock.org/ This is SKSE If you need more information on SKSE Just look at this video , http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=xTGnQIiNVqA So yeah basically that 's it if you want the Mod itself go to the Steam Workshop , Just type in SkyUI And Subscribe , re-lunch Skyrim and it should be downloaded then , and then just load up game a notification should pop up saying about SkyUI Wo n't work normally because you 're not running the game in SkyUI , So just exit to desktop and Load game though SKSE , And you 'll be good to go !

A bot lobby is a lobby that is a lobby filled with the bots(3ARCS) and is in a public setting so that it is easier to rank up by just killing the bots which are at an easier setting then regular people . <p> You : Back out until you are at the main multiplayer menu . Click on LAN PARTY and hover over CREATE GAME Press TRIANGLE and then hover over your friend you are about to join . Press SQUARE and a second later spam the X button . If you get to this part : Just wait and do n't do anything , the game is searching for a bot lobby to join into , then you can wait and play and rank up !

Click on SYSTEM LINK and hover over CREATE GAME Press Y and then hover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X and a second later spam the A button . If you get to this part : Just wait and do n't do anything , the game is searching for a bot lobby to join into , then you can wait and play and rank up ! <p> If this did n't help then watch the spoiler below which is the same thing but a video tutorial . <p> Please do realize that is a boost lobby , and mostly likely by now is patched . But there is a flip side since there are other ways to boost publicly to rank up fast . <p> Nah this has n't been patched and it sometimes does n't get you to a good lobby , or the lobby has a fuck ton of people in it that you can barely get kills . Others do n't know how to host one , and occasionally if there is more then 6 people , there will be called a " flip " which changes it from the custom games lobby to a public match , this still does help with ranking up though and help KDRs.

@@59076288 @8076288/ <p> This was inspired by Mr. Ownership and PvtRyan . Even though it 's pretty simple , I think it 's really cool . I hooked up the Wii 's Nunchuk controller to my Arduino and programmed it so you can switch between lighting up different LEDs or controlling a servo motor dependent on the tilt of the controller . The LEDs are controlled by the x-axis tilt and the servo is controlled by the y-axis orientation . I think it 's really neat even though it 's not super practical or anything . <p> http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zM04OFjHRhU <p> To do this , I hooked up the Nunchuk 's positive voltage pin to 3.3 volts and it 's ground to ground of course . And with the library I 'm using , I connected the clock to A5 and data to A4 . Then I connected the servo to digital pin 3 , and then the LEDs to digital pins 4-10 . <p> LONG ... <p> http : **25;4424;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;4451;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;4478;TOOLONG <p> http : **25;4505;TOOLONG <p> *Note* I know I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really did n't feel like it . lol <p> Here 's the Nunchuk 's library that I used : LONG ... <p> In the code , there 's a 5 second " calibration " delay in the beginning so you could adjust the servo 's head to the position of half way through it 's rotation if necessary . After that you would tilt the controller sideways to control the LEDs or you could switch to controlling the servo by pressing Z and moving the controller up and down . <p> PvtRyan <p> 03-31-2014 , 01:13 AM <p> good job there chum , you just inspired me to make some stuff in my shop class c : keep up the good work ! <p> look up fritzing. it helps make nice schematics even with Arduino . <p> Diabz <p> 03-31-2014 , 02:23 AM <p> LONG ... : ) : ( : ) : ( : ) : ( ) <p> Vintage <p> 03-31-2014 , 11:59 AM <p> That would be really sweet if you did that to your christmas lights on your house .

@@59076300 @8076300/ 171056 @qwx581056 <h> TUTLost <p> Let 's start from Illustrator . Create a new document and write " lost " using a bold sans serif font . Mine is Myriad Pro ( Default ) , but you can experiment with a different one ( I suggest you to try with a very bold font like Mod ) . <p> Step 2 <p> We have to duplicate the text " lost " many times horizontally and vertically ; a trick for you : go to **44;4601;TOOLONG , enter 20 copies and move the text horizontally for 46pt . <p> Step 3 <p> At this point we need to duplicate the entire line of text vertically . Before applying again the Transform filter , we need to expand the text . So go to Object&gt;Expand Appearance . Then switch to the Transform effect and this time move it vertically ( -16pt ) . Finally go to Object&gt;Expand Appearance to expand the text again after the second transformation . <p> Step 4 <p> Write again the word " lost , " this time increase the font size ( around 200pt ) . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Step 5 <p> Now we need to remove the the word " lost " ( great ) from the repeating grid of small " lost " words . To do this , start selecting the grid of words and go to Object&gt;Compound Path&gt;Make , then select both the grid and the large LOST word and press the Minus Front button from the pathfinder window . <p> Step 6 <p> We are ready to give depth to the grid . Firstly switch the grid color from Black to White , then go to **33;4647;TOOLONG and enter the following values : <p> Step 7 <p> Let 's switch to Photoshop . Create a new document . Mine is 1920+1200 px at 72 pixels/inch of resolution since it is destined to be a wallpaper . From Illustrator copy the 3d text ( ctrl+C ) and paste it in Photoshop ( ctrl+V ) as a smart object . <p> Step 8 <p> Select the background layer , grab the Paint bucket tool ( G ) and fill it with black . <p> Now we have to modify the colors of the 3d text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layer&gt;Gradient map and add a gradient going from #0f0e0f to #727272 <p> Since we want to affect only the 3d text with this adjustment layer , add a clipping mask by holding down alt and clicking between the adjustment layer and the 3d text one ( a little arrow will appear near the gradient map layer into the layers window ) . <p> Step 9 <p> To darken the edges of the composition , create a new layer , grab a large soft ( hardness 0% ) brush and paint over them . <p> Step 10 <p> The text is too clean in my opinion . To dirty it , we can use one of our resources : download our scratched metallic textures , choose the item you prefer from the pack , then paste it into the Photoshop canvas and desaturate it by pressing shift+ctrl+U . <p> Set the layer blending mode to overlay and reduce opacity to 40% . <p> Step 11 <p> The center of the composition is too dark . To lighten it create a new group and set the blending mode to overlay . Create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white brush and click over the center : <p> Step 12 <p> I do n't  like this black/white color combination . So , to add more color , let 's create another gradient map adjustment layer and place it on top of all the other layers . Add a gradient going from blue ( #002874 ) to yellow ( #f9e600 ) and set the layer to overlay with opacity 35% . <p> Step 13 <p> The tutorial could stop here , the result looks cool in my opinion . Someone suggested me to add the photo of an island to the background to enrich the scene . Nice idea ! Download this photo of an island and place the image between the 3d text and the background layer . Press ctrl+T to activate the free transform tool and re-size the photo . <p> Step 14 <p> With the eraser tool ( or a layer mask if you prefer ) , eliminate the exuberant part of the island photo : <p> Step 15 <p> The last touch is to remove the textures effect from the island photo . Select the textures layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers window ) , and add a layer mask by pressing the apposite button in the layers window . In this way we will retain only the area of the texture that covers the 3d text . Finito !

@@59076302 @8076302/ 171056 @qwx581056 <h> Parrot Security OS ( Like Kali linux on a speed hype ) <p> Parrot Security is an operating system based on Debian GNU/Linux mixed with Frozenbox OS and Kali linux in order to provide the best penetration and security testing experience <p> Parrot Security is an operating system for IT security and penetration testing developed by the Frozenbox Dev Team . It is a GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian and mixed with Kali . <p> Parrot uses Kali repositories in order to take latest updats for almost all the tools , but it also has its own dedicated repository where all the custom packets are kept . This is why this distro is not just a simple Kali " mod " but entire new concept which relies on Kalis tool repositories . As such , it introduces a lot of new features and different developing choices . <p> Parrot uses MATE as a Desktop Environment . Lightweight and powerful interface is derived from famous Gnome 2 , and thanks to FrozenBox highly customizable with captivating icons , ad-hoc themes and wallpapers . System look is proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frozenbox Network , who are closely following the development of this project . <p> Originally Posted by http : **33;4682;TOOLONG <p> Various interface changes make the whole system much fast , light and responsive , almost as much as Backbox with its xfce ( another lighter interface ) . The system is in fact specd to run even on a machine with 180MB of RAM and work correctly without the video card support . <p> As Lorenzo Faletra ( EclipseSpark ) , the founder of the project , says , the system is inspired by Kali , but it aims to " fix " all of its weakness and use all of its strong features . So , for example , we can find entire menu structure from Kali intact , respecting pentest layout standard on which so many of the users are now accustom to . <p> Originally Posted by http : **33;4717;TOOLONG <p> The tool set is pretty much the same , although the Parrot team did made some cuts . Most of the cuts are made with the intention to make the live system light enough so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not everyone needs to develop applications for the Android straight from a live CD , hack radio frequencies other than WiFi and blue-tooth etc , distro was cut to a reasonable size it should perform better on weak systems . Of course , all tools can be installed latter if they are needed . <p> Originally Posted by http : **33;4752;TOOLONG <p> This is the reasoning behind the lightening term which distro creators use . They are basing their opinion on the people who work in the world of pen-testing and who were able to give useful feedback about distro development . If you really miss all the tools that Kali provide you can install all of them in one run . Just pull a parrot-tools-full meta-package . This is also doable for full installation ( " home edition " ) which will also install tools like libreoffice , rhythmbox , shotwell , openshot .. and you can use the system for everyday tasks . <p> Originally Posted by http : **33;4787;TOOLONG <p> Parrot Security OS is a distro designed for people who love programming . It comes with interpreters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right click on your desktop or on a file manager window , you can access a handy drop down menu which allows instant creation of files with custom extension divided by category . You can create html , css , javascript , php , ruby , perl , python , falcon files and many others on the fly . <p> Frozenbox network has forged good relations with the " pirate crew " a gang of time wasting pirates drinking rum on the bridge of their ship . The name Parrot , is inspired by a parrot a captains shoulder inevitable element in all the cartoons about pirates . <p> We hope that you will appreciate this distro which still has yet to see its final developing stage . Fist tests proved it to be stable and perfectly-working as well as elegant , lightweight and powerful <p> Damn , not even generic support ? What card is it ? I 'll see if someone I know has unofficially fixed this . Surely someone has written some sort of generic support for it . You are using a chromebook right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? I 'll see if someone I know has unofficially fixed this . Surely someone has written some sort of generic support for it . You are using a chromebook right ? <p> He stated a while ago he was using one . And with linux you ca n't officially get a ton of things due to gpl agreements . But , tons of users have unofficial support for most of those things . That 's all I was getting at . Also once you get rid of some of the google things chromebooks are actually pretty good . Maybe not for gaming but for things like scripting and programming they do just fine . And @ sky : I am on this operating system currently and it 's ok . Seems to be running pretty great off a 16 gig usb . And my wireless card also is n't supported for linux either but a generic version seems to work just fine for me . I only am trying to help , I think someone like sky could use this os to it 's full potential .

And most of the time i truly was surprised when a zombie came flying out of a cupboard . And the graphics were above average , it is on par with most of today fps games graphic wise . so the overall ambiance and look of the game get a 9/10 <p> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst part of the game , THE CONTROLS . OMG they are so ridged when moving , idk if it was my sensitivity , but moving in general felt unnatural . And i 'm not blaming the wiiu controller for this one , i believe that more work could have been put into this aspect of the game . controls get a 4/10 <p> Now onto the most important part of the game , the game-play . The survival aspect is strong in this game , especially for me since i have n't made it longer than 30 minutes . You have very little pistol ammo in the beginning , and you are left to use your cricket racket which gets extremely annoying by the third zombie . It literly takes 4 hits to get the average zombie down . And the police zombies are a whole different story . The fact that you truly have to scavenge for items and ammo is a plus , but the limited melee items ( at least in the demo ) are a boring downside. so game-play gets a 7/10 <p> All in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wii u 's capability 's but is not something you play on hours at end which is why to a core gamer this is a 6/10 <p> I personally love ZombiU , it 's one of my favorite Wii U games . Beat it 4 times already . The only things I do n't like about it is the lack of melee weapon customization , you can have 3 different skins and that 's it , and the melee killing gets a little repetitive , with the same strikes and finishing move . I did n't see any problem with the controls , but that 's just me , but much like any other game , the controls take some time to get used to .

Copy the folder documents and overwrite the folder in Asphalt 7 . ( Put it in : **41;5278;TOOLONG ) <p> A few common problems : 1 . Game does n't save progress ? Sadly , the game does n't save any progress but luckily all cars are unlocked so there is n't much to worry about 2 . Game language is in Spanish ? Sorry for that the original uploader is Spanish and therefore the text is Spanish . However you can fix this by going to the Settings panel and choose Idiomos ( language ) and choose the language the fits you . Thpugh this is a temporary fix and you ' ' ll have to do this everytime you reboot

@@59076367 @8076367/ 171056 @qwx581056 <p> There is a large influx of poketubers doing a walk through of pokemon emerald that is called " Randomizer Nuzlocke " and its completely fan made . Anyways i 'll post the rules for the nuzlocke below , but this is mainly to show you how to randomize your pokemon encounters , and almost everything else in the game . First , as most of you know , you need to go to coolrom.com and get the visual boy advance emulator , and also the pokemon emerald rom . Now i suggest making several copies of the rom itself so you can retain a normal rom , and a randomized one . Then once you have these , you will have to go to here LONG ... and download version 2.2 . Now , if you would like an in depth explanation of what each randomization does , click on the details link on that page and it will tell you what each specific option does . You WILL NEED and updated java , but that is it . the program is a . jar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , find the rom you want to randomize and open it , click all the specifications that you want , then press save rom and you are ready to play your new randomized rom ! I will now post the nuzlocke rules if you are interested in playing this game mode , it is more of a challenge game type . <p> when a pokemon dies you do n't  have to release it , just make a " killed " box in your pc with all the pokemon that died so you can go back and see what pokemon you have had . Here are some optional rules you can choose too apply . <p> -Modifying the " first encounter only " rule for the Safari Zone , sometimes allowing one encounter for each area , or until they catch one PokTmon in the entire area , and vice versa. -Banning the use of PokT Marts. -Disallow fleeing . -Setting a level limit based on the next Gym Leader's/Champion 's highest leveled PokTmon . Any team members that surpass that limit before taking on the Gym Leader or Elite Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PokTmon obtained must be either given to the player or hatched from an egg . -Banning use of the day care to breed or level up PokTmon. -Many other rules exist ; challengers adjust their personal rules according to their own preferences . In order to be considered a true Nuzlocke Challenge , however , the core rules must be in place . So use the core rules , then if you want even more of a challenge set some more ground rules and see if you can do it . Things can get hard sometimes and you also get some shitty pokemon at times too , but it is really fun .

They 've also focused on coding centered around iOS . Today , we will be moving away from that and creating a Cocoa application , a calculator for Mac OS X. <p> Start by opening Xcode and selecting New Project . Select Application under Mac OS X , and then the first option , Cocoa Application . <p> These screen should be familiar to you by now , but just in case , next you want to select the name . You can call it whatever you want , i 'm using Simple Calculator . <p> Choose where you want to save it , and then we can jump right in . Start by going to the . xib in the left column .

Start by going to the right column and bringing up the Object Library . If you do n't know how to do this , it 's explained in my HelloYou tutorial . <p> In the Object Library find Window , and drag it onto the gridded view . <p> Next you want to add a button , three text fields , and two labels . Change one of the labels to a " + " and one to a " = " and the button to " Calculate " and arrange them like so , <p> Next right click on the first text field , the one to the left of the addition sign , and drag to the second one , the one to the right of the addition sign . Release the mouse button and select nextKeyView . <p> Next , do the same thing , but right click the text field to the right of the addition sign , and drag to the left . Once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press Tab to switch between the two text fields . <p> Next select the third text field , the one to the right of the equals sign . Browse over to the Attributes Inspector , in the right column . It 's the fourth one over from the top . Once in the Attributes inspector , with the text field still selected , look for Behavior . Change the Behavior from Editable to Selectable . <p> Then select the button that says Calculate and look at it 's tab in the Attributes Inspector . Find the Key Equivalent slot ; it should be blank . Click on it , and press Enter or Return . It should go from this : <p> To this : <p> This just tells Xcode that pressing the Return key on your keyboard simulates pressing that button . <p> Next we 're going to go to the Object Library again , search for Object , and drag the Object , the blue cube , over to the left sidebar , beside your window . <p> In case you do n't understand , drag this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column . Open the Identity Inspector , the third tab , and change the first field , the Class field .

If you remember from the previous tutorials , an IBAction is any action you want it to be , depending on how you define it in the . m . In the . h , you simply put the name of the action . <p> Start by adding this : <p> Code : <p> -(IBAction)Calculate : ( i 'd ) sender ; <p> This just tells Xcode that we are going to have an action called Calculate . <p> Now your . h should look like this : <p> Next we 'll be looking at the . m file . <p> Before we start , if your . m has anything between @implementation and @end , delete it so that it looks like this : <p> We start by declaring what our IBAction is , Calculate , which we mentioned in the . h . Then we say what it does . We set the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then we set the variable answer equal to whatever result is . <p> Your . m should now look like this : <p> Next go up to the menu , select Product &gt; Build and your build should succeed . <p> Now open your . xib again . <p> Remember that Object we created earlier , the blue box on the bottom of the left column ? Right click and drag that to the first , second , and third text fields , and select their respective parameter . Select numOne for the first box , numTwo for the second , and answer for the third . <p> Next right click the Calculate button , and drag it to the SimpleController , the blue box we created . If it wo n't let you select the SimpleController when you 're dragging it , check your code , you did something wrong . <p> Once you drag it , a box will pop up with the option , Calculate . Select it . <p> Now go to Product &gt; Build , and then you 're done . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex one . <p> Here 's a final image of mine working . Thanks for reading , and if you have any questions , problems , concerns , post them below . <p> This is all me , pictures , words , everything . I learned Objective-C through some books i read back when i started , and working hands on with the language . If you want to learn , you can check out the Developer section of Apple 's site , or read some guides online . I 've got one posted on here as well , somewhere .

One thing not a lot of people are talking about though are accessories . <p> While accessories may not be required to have fun with your new PS4 they will make your life a little easier and in some cases bring a whole new option to the table for what you can do with your next-gen system . So here is a list of 5 accessories you 're going to want to have to take your system to the next level when you finally get your hands on it . <p> 1 . Nykos Next Generation Charge Base <p> Nyko is a leader in 3rd Party accessories so it should be no surprise that Nyko will be launching some accessories for the PS4 . Nykos next generation charging base will allow you to rapidly charge 2 DualShock 4 controllers simultaneously . <p> It also features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection to the DualShock 4 . Luckily the PS4 allows controllers to charge even while the system is off so you can charge while you sleep . <p> You are going to want this because when you get that shiny new PS4 you know you wo n't want to stop playing for even 5 minutes to recharge those controllers . <p> 2 . Nyko Smart Clip <p> With this next generation of consoles , the second screen looks like its going to become more and more common . With games like Battlefield 4 , WatchDogs and the Division all utilizing the second screen or companion apps , the Nyko Smart clip will be a must have accessories . <p> The Smart Clip let 's you connect your phone to your controller to make using the second screen or companion apps much easier . <p> You are going to want this because its going to make looking at your mini map in Battlefield 4 much simpler and since it seems that most games will be using companion apps you will definitely get enough use out of it . <p> 3 . The Playstation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , having it will bring your experience with the PS4 to a new level . Since each DualShock 4 controller has a light bar in the top of it now , the PlayStation Camera will be useful to you even if you do n't  buy in to the whole motion controlled gaming thing . <p> The PlayStation Camera will be able to detect who is holding what controller and the system will change the placement of your screen to match where you are in the room . <p> The Playstation Camera is 720P and features a 4 channel microphone array for facial recognition and voice controls . You are going to want the Playstation Camera to get the full experience of what the PS4 is capable of . <p> 4 . Sony Pulse Elite Edition Headset <p> The Sony Pulse Elite Edition Headset is by far one of the best headsets available for the PS3 and has been confirmed to work with the PS4 . <p> The Pulse Elite Headset uses a USB dongle with RF to transfer audio wirelessly to the headset . The Elite edition Headset comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancellation . The Elite Edition also features Bass Impact technology that vibrates the ear cups of the headset for that added feeling of tension when things are blowing up all around you . <p> The Elite Edition can also be connected to anything with a 3.5 mm headphone jack or wirelessly through the USB dongles 3.5 mm jack and a 3.5 mm cable . If all that has n't  impressed you yet there 's also the Pulse Headset app that you can download from the Playstation Store to get custom audio settings built specificity for the Pulse Elite Headset . <p> Games like The Last Of Us and Bioshock Infinite have already taken advantage of the custom audio settings and I expect many more games to follow . You are going to want the Sony Pulse Elite Edition Headset because for $149.99 you get an amazing headset that will give you unmatched audio quality for your PS3 and PS4 . <p> 5 . PS Vita <p> The PS Vita is n't technically an accessory but in conjunction with the PS4 it will be used as one . The PS Vita will connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The PS Vita will use Remote Play to allow you to play your PS4 games over WiFi . While the PSP claimed to be able to do that it was always disappointing . The PS Vita however was built in conjunction with the PS4 and should have no such problems . <p> Since Sony has made it mandatory for all PS4 games to be playable on the PS Vita ( except if they use the PlayStation Camera ) you will literally have your game collection at your fingertips . You are going to want the PS Vita because not only was it specifically built to interact with your PS4 but the PS Vita itself is a portable console with plenty of great games and more to come . <p> So what accessories will you be getting with your PS4 ? What accessories would you like to see ? Let us know in the comments section below .

Also , blocks that you are currently destroying turn quite dark in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being worked on . <p> About This mod adds shaders to Minecraft in a post-process manner that simulate different effects that occur in the real-world in how light reacts with objects and with the human eye . This mod also adds dynamic movement to flora and fire . <p> Note : This mod was configured with a high-spec system in mind . If you run vanilla Minecraft with max view distance and fancy settings at around 100+ fps and most modern games at med-high to high settings , then this mod should run fine for you . Read further down in the Tweaks section for how to get better performance out of this mod . <p> Installation This mod requires OptiFine 1.2.3 . Smooth version yields me the best fps . <p> 1 . Download and install OptiFine 1.2.3 ( preferably on a clean Minecraft.jar , if you 've got a modded one already you can give it a shot but no guarantees this mod will work with an already modded Minecraft ) . <p> 2 . DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( Windows ) or DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( everyone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like on your Desktop ) . Open the folder , and run " INSTALLER.exe " ( or nitrous.jar if you 're not on Windows ) . Click " Install Mods " , wait for the mod to finish patching Minecraft.jar . ( To anyone with the " **27;5587;TOOLONG : a ( .. ) is not found in adt " error , just right-click on the " 1.0.0 line " in the Installer and disable it . ) Once it 's done , you should be all set ! Run Minecraft and enjoy unbelievable shaders ! But keep reading , for there are some tweaks you must make to your video settings to create the best experience ! http : //j.gs/j0U ( windows ) http : //j.gs/j0Y ( everyone else ) <p> 2 . DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( Windows ) or DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( everyone else ) and extract the folder inside the archive anywhere ( like on your Desktop ) . Open the folder , and run " INSTALLER.exe " ( or nitrous.jar if you 're not on Windows ) . Click " Install Mods " , wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the " **27;5616;TOOLONG : a ( .. ) is not found in adt " error , just right-click on the " 1.0.0 line " in the Installer and disable it . ) Once it 's done , you should be all set ! Run Minecraft and enjoy unbelievable shaders ! But keep reading , for there are some tweaks you must make to your video settings to create the best experience ! <p> 3 . Go to " Options ... " and make sure that your FOV is set to Normal ( all the way to the left ) . Go back to Video Settings and then click on Performance , and enable Smooth FPS . This setting will reduce input lag at the cost of fps , some may want this enabled . For better performance , turn graphics to Fast , and then re-enable specific features that you want to be Fancy in the Details section ( like trees and grass edges ) . This gave me about a 7 fps boost even though most things look exactly the same . For some more performance tweaks ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and here . Also , a very important tip is to adjust your screen resolution so that minecraft runs at a lower resolution . This will improve your performance a lot . <p> Read the additional shader configs section below for a lite version if you have more performance issues ! <p> Thanks to Brinko054 for this video tutorial if you need some more help with the install ! <p> Troubleshooting If you are encountering issues with this mod , there are a number of things that you can do to ensure that things are running smoothly for you . <p> Firstly , I know it 's a pain , but update your graphics drivers . I do n't think I need to explain why this is a good idea <p> Some people have reported that if they run the installer twice , the mod begins to work , where when they had only run it once it did n't work . Also , if you 're running Windows 7 or Vista make SURE you run with INSTALLER.exe and that you confirm administrative privileges to the installer ( or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely ) . <p> A list of compatible mods is available on daxnitro 's wiki linked to at the top of this post . Check there if you want to use other mods with this mod . <p> If these things fail , go to daxnitro 's GLSL Shaders thread ( also linked above ) and install his version and see if it gives you the same issues ( should be the same installation process ) . If the mod installs correctly and you see some shaders , you can then directly overwrite daxnitro 's shaders with my settings/shaders by delving into the . zip for my mod . Sonic Ether 's Unbelievable Shaders **39;5645;TOOLONG . Everything should be in there in . fsh and . vsh files . Drop these into Minecraft.jarShaders and overwrite the shaders that are there . <p> Make sure that you do n't have any Anti-Aliasing or Anisotropic Filtering , or anything like that , forced in your driver settings . <p> If all else fails and you 've drank this post up dry , head over to daxnitro 's thread and check his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines through terrain Updated graphics drivers will probably fix this . If not , your gpu is probably too old to compute some of the commands that are in these shaders . <p> Only DOF shader visible Overwrite the shaders in minecraft.jar/Shaders with the ones provided in the . zip located in ... . **40;5686;TOOLONG This should put my shaders into your minecraft.jar ( something the installer for some reason may have failed to do ) . <p> Void of blue ( all blue screen ) This seems to happen on all Intel gpu 's . Unless Intel comes out with new drivers , this is unsolvable . <p> Once the mod is properly installed , you can edit and replace any of the shaders that the game runs in Minecraft.jar/Shaders . Composite.fsh is where the real-time shadows are written and all of the other post-processing effects are written in final.fsh . I recommend editing these files with a program like Notepad++ if you want to make any changes to them . <p> For better performance , you can make any of these adjustments to these shaders . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a jumbled mess , I recommend Notepad++ or Word Pad ) and change /* SHADOWRES:2048 */ to /* SHADOWRES:1024 */ . More information is at the top of composite.fsh <p> 2 . Open composite.fsh and disable SSAO by adding " // " to the beginning every line that starts with #define SSAO at the top of the file . <p> 3 . Simply run Minecraft at a lower resolution if you want to keep SSAO but are suffering bad performance from it . <p> 4 . Disable smooth lighting in Minecraft video settings . There have been reports of large fps improvement when smooth lighting is disabled . <p> To adjust motion blur amount , open final.fsh and edit " #define MOTIONBLURAMOUNT 2.5 " . Some people may prefer less motion blur . To disable motion blur , add " // " to the beginning of all lines that start with " #define MOTIONBLUR ... " <p> You can also enable some disabled shaders if you 'd wish , although they 're not configured to look proper with the settings I have created so you 'll have to tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hard work in making this visual experience possible !

@@59076456 @8076456/ 171056 @qwx581056 <p> How do I raise my skills ? Unlike many other MMORPGs released at this time , you climb the discipline skills by using your skills . For instance , to gain blaster skill , you must use a blaster in combat . To become a better Medic , you must heal people who have been hurt . You get XP ( for lack of a better word ) towards a skill when it is used , and when you have obtained enough of the required xp , you can train at the next level of that skill . There is no general XP , so you can not use a blaster to kill a creature and then put that XP towards cooking . Crafters have a special way of gaining xp towards their skills . They do gain some XP when you create an item , and then they gain it again when somebody else uses an item they 've made . So if a Chef baked a dozen pies , they would get some xp towards their skills , and then even more if somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another character ( who has the skill ) or NPC train you . NPCs charge for this service , so your best bet would be to find another player with the skill you want to learn . Each character has a set number of ' skill points ' they can use at once . Each skill costs a certain amount of skill points . You may train in as many skills as you wish , as long as you have enough free skill points , and the prerequisites , to purchase them . <p> Can I change my Profession if I do n't like it ? Yes . A player can ' untrain ' the skill points they 've spent on skills and disciplines at any time , and then explore new skills with them . However , you will lose all of the XP you gained towards those skills , and you will not be able to get it back if you change your mind . <p> What are the Professions ?

I did this because I am stealing their wiiu . So to start off , it looked like a pretty decent game . I plugged everything in , turned it on , and handed controllers to kids . We had to go to the store so they shut it off . When we got back they wanted to play it again , so my wife told them ok . ( I was at the office ) They loaded it up and went through the beginning screen , and started to play . After 1-2 minutes of game play , the wii froze . So they pulled the power and reset the wii . They loaded it up again this time it froze before making it to the game type selection screen . They reset over and over still same result . So when I got home I decided I would look into it . ( keep in mind when the game was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I already had 4.3u ) So I did some google research and found that just about everyone was having the same problem . So me being the kinda guy I am . I reloaded the old nand files back on the wii , and brought that update screen back. ( keep in mind I had 1300 blocks of space ) I captured the update and broke it down . Basically the wii gets a special update for skylanders swapforce . You must have 1500 blocks available save space after the game has its own save block to run this game . So , I move save data to sd card . Then I got mad , nintendo wii games are only supposed to take 395 max space to run . So I got on activisions site and was chatting with tech support . ( the reason black ops 2 and maps for black ops 1 werent on wii was because of max file space for game was 395 ) I asked about the update my wii took and they told me it was just creating a save block . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wii 's update , to which I got . " uh , uh , how did you get that information ? " My response " Because I am God I know all " His response " lol , unofficially since Nintendo 's wiiu is not turning out so well . Nintendo Is playing with memory updates to see if other games can be made to play on the standard wii platform , " My response was " Like what games ? " their response " Chat session has ended " So who knows what is going on ...... But if you want skylander swap force to run , you must clear at least 1500 blocks of space after your first gamesave of swapforce . I Cleared all save games to sd besides the ones that would n't transfer . ( I think I have 1650 blocks of space after clearing ) Sorry so long , but anybody that buys this game and does n't clear the space will freeze every time you load the game . <p> Skylanders is a horrible game .

I makes it look more " real " and gives a vintage look . <p> LONG ... <p> Mod Made by : daxnitro <p> Back up minecraft.jar before installing this mod . If your graphics card does n't support GLSL shaders , this mod wo n't work ! Also , a few ATI cards do n't seem to be working correctly ( if you 're not using Catalyst 11.1 or higher it very likely wo n't work ) . <p> Dynamic Shadows <p> Using this mod you can enable dynamic sun/moon shadows . If you use one of the shadow shaders and see chunks rapidly appearing and disappearing in the distance , install Optifine then reinstall this mod . <p> Before the update for Minecraft 1.1.0 , the shadow map used a perspective projection . Now , by default it uses an orthogonal projection . For backwards compatibility , including the SHADOWFOV configurable in a shader will force the shadow map to use a perspective projection . If you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this line is not present ( and optionally replace it with an appropriate SHADOWHPL configurable ) . <p> Download for 1.2.3 : ( Updated March 10 ) <p> If you 've installed a previous copy of this mod , download a fresh copy of minecraft.jar ( by forcing an update or deleting the file named " version " ) or restore a backup minecraft.jar before installing this update . <p> You can download previous versions of this mod or view change logs at the repository . To install them , download the installer at the URL above , then go to File -&gt; Import and select the . n2 file . <p> You can find information on texture packs , shaders , and mod/hardware compatibility on the wiki . <p> Known Issues : The default DoF may incorrectly apply a subtle blur to the sun/moon . A blur is incorrectly applied to Endermen with the DoF shaders . The included shadow shaders incorrectly apply shading to the player 's hand . Some people install the mod and ca n't see any textures . I do n't really know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Optifine before installing this mod fixes the problem . If you 'd like to help , go to the Wiki and put your graphics card and driver version in the hardware compatibility section . Todo : <p> A few community members have been making modifications to the mod as well as mods that supplement its functionality ( It 's open source and I encourage people to do so . ) . If you do this , you can do what you want with it and distribute it how you want , but I highly recommend putting it on the wiki for everyone to download . <p> Quote The one major rule Do not distribute anything I 've made . This includes the client and the server software for the game . This also includes modified versions of anything I 've made . If you do n't like patchers , sorry but I wo n't be distributing modified class files , and no amount of qq is going to change my mind . <p> I will always distribute this mod in the form of a patcher . I will never distribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patcher anyways , because if it were n't , it would n't work with a lot of other cool mods . <p> Contact : <p> Feel free to send me an email at daxnitro at gmail if you have any problems , suggestions , or complaints . If you have any good shaders or bump maps , post them on the wiki ! <p> You can also reach me as @daxnitro on Twitter ! Follow me for information regarding updates . <p> If you have issues with getting this mod to work , make sure you have read this entire post and performed the installation directions correctly . Then refer to the thread of the mod that this mod is based on that I posted a link to above . Also make sure to read daxnitro 's wiki . Only post questions if you 've done all of these things , please . <p> Follow me on Tumblr and watch me derp around on a website I 've never used as I try to keep you guys informed on latest updates and development progress !

These include ; flickering shadows , sun shining through into caves , abrupt day/night transitions , and crazy FOV changes at sundown ( lasts for a few seconds ) . Also , blocks that you are currently destroying turn quite dark in some texture packs . <p> All of these issues are being worked on . <p> About This mod adds shaders to Minecraft in a post-process manner that simulate different effects that occur in the real-world in how light reacts with objects and with the human eye . This mod also adds dynamic movement to flora and fire . <p> Note : This mod was configured with a high-spec system in mind . If you run vanilla Minecraft with max view distance and fancy settings at around 100+ fps and most modern games at med-high to high settings , then this mod should run fine for you . Read further down in the Tweaks section for how to get better performance out of this mod . <p> Installation This mod requires OptiFine 1.2.3 . Smooth version yields me the best fps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferably on a clean Minecraft.jar , if you 've got a modded one already you can give it a shot but no guarantees this mod will work with an already modded Minecraft ) . <p> 2 . DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( Windows ) or DOWNLOAD 1.2.3 v06 ( everyone else ) and extract the folder inside the archive anywhere ( like on your Desktop ) . Open the folder , and run " INSTALLER.exe " ( or nitrous.jar if you 're not on Windows ) . Click " Install Mods " , wait for the mod to finish patching Minecraft.jar . ( To anyone with the " **27;5796;TOOLONG : a ( .. ) is not found in adt " error , just right-click on the " 1.0.0 line " in the Installer and disable it . ) Once it 's done , you should be all set !

This setting will reduce input lag at the cost of fps , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphics to Fast , and then re-enable specific features that you want to be Fancy in the Details section ( like trees and grass edges ) . This gave me about a 7 fps boost even though most things look exactly the same . For some more performance tweaks ( thanks to the great community ! ! ) see here and here . Also , a very important tip is to adjust your screen resolution so that minecraft runs at a lower resolution . This will improve your performance a lot . <p> Read the additional shader configs section below for a lite version if you have more performance issues ! <p> Thanks to Brinko054 for this video tutorial if you need some more help with the install ! <p> Troubleshooting If you are encountering issues with this mod , there are a number of things that you can do to ensure that things are running smoothly for you . <p> Firstly , I know it 's a pain , but update your graphics drivers . I do n't think I need to explain why this is a good idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installer twice , the mod begins to work , where when they had only run it once it did n't work . Also , if you 're running Windows 7 or Vista make SURE you run with INSTALLER.exe and that you confirm administrative privileges to the installer ( or better yet , go to the Control Panel and disable UAC entirely ) . <p> A list of compatible mods is available on daxnitro 's wiki linked to at the top of this post . Check there if you want to use other mods with this mod . <p> If these things fail , go to daxnitro 's GLSL Shaders thread ( also linked above ) and install his version and see if it gives you the same issues ( should be the same installation process ) . If the mod installs correctly and you see some shaders , you can then directly overwrite daxnitro 's shaders with my settings/shaders by delving into the . zip for my mod . Sonic Ether 's Unbelievable Shaders **39;5854;TOOLONG . Everything should be in there in . fsh and . vsh files . Drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Make sure that you do n't have any Anti-Aliasing or Anisotropic Filtering , or anything like that , forced in your driver settings . <p> If all else fails and you 've drank this post up dry , head over to daxnitro 's thread and check his first post . <p> Commonly Encountered Problems : <p> Dark shadow lines through terrain Updated graphics drivers will probably fix this . If not , your gpu is probably too old to compute some of the commands that are in these shaders . <p> Only DOF shader visible Overwrite the shaders in minecraft.jar/Shaders with the ones provided in the . zip located in ... . **40;5895;TOOLONG This should put my shaders into your minecraft.jar ( something the installer for some reason may have failed to do ) . <p> Void of blue ( all blue screen ) This seems to happen on all Intel gpu 's . Unless Intel comes out with new drivers , this is unsolvable . <p> Once the mod is properly installed , you can edit and replace any of the shaders that the game runs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all of the other post-processing effects are written in final.fsh . I recommend editing these files with a program like Notepad++ if you want to make any changes to them . <p> For better performance , you can make any of these adjustments to these shaders . <p> 1 . Open composite.fsh in a text editor ( Notepad makes it a jumbled mess , I recommend Notepad++ or Word Pad ) and change /* SHADOWRES:2048 */ to /* SHADOWRES:1024 */ . More information is at the top of composite.fsh <p> 2 . Open composite.fsh and disable SSAO by adding " // " to the beginning every line that starts with #define SSAO at the top of the file . <p> 3 . Simply run Minecraft at a lower resolution if you want to keep SSAO but are suffering bad performance from it . <p> 4 . Disable smooth lighting in Minecraft video settings . There have been reports of large fps improvement when smooth lighting is disabled . <p> To adjust motion blur amount , open final.fsh and edit " #define MOTIONBLURAMOUNT 2.5 " . Some people may prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // " to the beginning of all lines that start with " #define MOTIONBLUR ... " <p> You can also enable some disabled shaders if you 'd wish , although they 're not configured to look proper with the settings I have created so you 'll have to tweak them yourself . <p> Special thanks again to daxnitro for his hard work in making this visual experience possible !

@@59076483 @8076483/ <p> Unity is an integrated authoring tool for creating 3D video games or other interactive content such as architectural visualizations 2 or real-time 3D animations . Unity 's development environment runs on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X , and the games it produces can be run on Windows , Mac , Xbox 360 , PlayStation 3 , Wii , 3 iPad , iPhone , 4 as well as the Android platform . It can also produce browser games that use the Unity web player plugin , supported on Mac and Windows but not Linux . The web player is also used for deployment as Mac widgets . Unity also has the ability to export games to Adobe 's Stage 3D functionality in Flash , but certain features that the web player supports are not useable due to limitations in Flash . Unity consists of both an editor5 for developing/designing content and a game engine6 for executing the final product . Unity is similar to Director , Blender game engine , Virtools , Torque Game Builder , and Gamestudio , which also use an integrated graphical environment as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal 2010 Technology Innovation Award in the software category. 7 In 2009 , Unity Technologies was named one of Gamasutra 's " Top 5 Game Companies of 2009 " 8 for Unity .

ShaderLab language for using shaders , supporting both declarative " programming " of the fixed-function pipeline and shader programs written in Cg or GLSL. 17 A shader can include multiple variants and a declarative fallback specification , allowing Unity to detect the best variant for the current video card and if none are compatible , fall back to an alternative shader that may sacrifice features for broader compatibility .

Built-in Pathfinding. 23 editVersion control with Unity <p> The Unity Asset Server was a version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now superseded by the version control system in Unity 3.5 . Import settings and other metadata are stored and versioned while updates , commits , and graphical version comparisons are performed inside the Unity Editor . A shortfall with Unity 's built-in version control is its lack of support for branching , tagging , or any DVCS features found in modern systems such as Git or Mercurial . Unity have recently made it possible to use alternative version control software , so larger , more complex projects can be managed using branches or decentralized workflows. 25 editLicensing <p> There are two main licenses : Unity and Unity Pro , 26 with the Pro version being available for a price and the non Pro version being free . The Pro version has additional features , such as render-to-texture , occlusion culling , global lighting and post-processing effects . The Free version , on the other hand , displays a splash screen ( in standalone games ) and a watermark ( in web games ) that can not be customized or disabled . Both Unity and Unity Pro include the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via forum , wiki , and future updates in the same major version ( i.e. buying Unity Pro 3.0 gets all future Unity Pro 3. x updates for free ) . Unity for iOS and Unity for Android are add-ons to an existing Unity purchase. 4 A Unity Pro licenses is required to purchase an iOS Pro or Android Pro licenses . The regular Android and iOS licenses can be used with the free version of Unity . Source code , PS3 , Xbox 360 , and Wii licenses are negotiated on a case by case basis. 27 Educational licenses are provided by Studica with the stipulation that it is for purchase and use by schools , purely for education. 28 editFuture platforms <p> editLinux There have been several indications a Linux port is in the works .

@@59076492 @8076492/ 171056 @qwx581056 <p> With smudges , I think you should add more flow . And with smudging , you have to have different shades of a color .

But here are some examples , <p> The flow is towards his guns . Top right You see how his body is wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His whole body is shifted to the right , So that would be your flow <p> Again , the body is shifted to the right ( or at least his upper body ) So that would be your flow . <p> Here is an example of a render with little flow <p> Yeah the render is hq , but it has little flow . You can always do outwards flow but it 's easier to work with render 's that have good flow . But I 'm not saying that you ca n't use render with little flow , You can still make it work . <p> 2- Depth . Depth , depth , depth ... Um . Depth is how much detail your signature has ? If you signature lacks depth is looks flat . If you signature has a lot of depth it pops ? For example look at this- You can see the render really stand out . You can also see different effects . You can see that the render stands out against the background but you can also see some c4ds on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers " , a background , render , and some c4ds mixed in You getting me ? It 's not just 1 flat image . 3D My signature is n't the best of examples but you kinda get it *Pro tip Easy way to add depth to your signature is to apply the image ( Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E ) Then go to Filter&gt;Blur&gt;Blur or **26;5937;TOOLONG Blur ( Set this low , 0.1-1 ) Then erase the render/focal and bam , depth . <p> 3- RULE OF THIRDS ! !

@@59076525 @8076525/ <p> Keystroke logging ( often called keylogging ) is the action of tracking ( or logging ) the keys struck on a keyboard , typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored . There are numerous keylogging methods , ranging from hardware and software-based approaches to electromagnetic and acoustic analysis . <p> Remote access software keyloggers These are local software keyloggers with an added feature that allows access to the locally recorded data from a remote location . Remote communication may be achieved using one of these methods : -Data is uploaded to a website , database or an FTP server . -Data is periodically emailed to a pre-defined email address . -Data is wirelessly transmitted by means of an attached hardware system . The software enables a remote login to the local machine from the Internet or the local network , for data logs stored on the target machine to be accessed . <p> Related features Software Keyloggers may be augmented with features that capture user information without relying on keyboard key presses as the sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anything that has been copied to the clipboard can be captured by the program . <p> -Screen logging . Screenshots are taken in order to capture graphics-based information . Applications with screen logging abilities may take screenshots of the whole screen , just one application or even just around the mouse cursor . They may take these screenshots periodically or in response to user behaviours ( for example , when a user has clicked the mouse ) . A practical application used by some keyloggers with this screen logging ability is to take small screenshots around where a mouse has just clicked ; these defeat web-based keyboards ( for example , the web-based screen keyboards that are often used by banks ) and any web-based on-screen keyboard without screenshot protection . <p> -Programmatically capturing the text in a control . The Microsoft Windows API allows programs to request the text ' value ' in some controls . This means that some passwords may be captured , even if they are hidden behind password masks ( usually asterisks ) . 3 <p> -The recording of every program/folder/window opened including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screenshot of each . <p> Use Email Option * then clarify your STMP server which the nromal one gmail , , * Do n't change the port if you do n't know what your doing ! * After put in YOUR email , Then your Password Then your email again .

Instead of the traditional " Writing Code " Scratch uses code blocks ( like if , forever , on start etc. ) that you drag and drop into your program/game . It 's kinda like a interactive coding language . You can create your own characters or objects , called sprites that you can draw or import , there are special functions for these objects , like " move 10 steps " or " say Blalala " . Using scratch you can create a lot of stuff , mostly people create games , but you can also create something like a calculator .

The most obvious is that , at certain points in a race , vehicles can alternate between car , boat and plane modes . The car mode handles similarly to the previous game , in which players can earn boost by drifting around corners or performing tricks whilst in the air . Boat mode features true boating physics , requiring players to consider their vehicle 's turbulence . They may also be affected by waves made in the water , some of which can be used to leap into the air and perform stunts . Plane mode , the fastest of the three forms , gives players the freedom to move both vertically and horizontally .

@@59076649 @8076649/ <p> A deactivator is basicaly two activators one activating the value you want and the other activating the default value for the code function .

Speed hack I will use is 054CCC48 XXXXXXXX . <p> Say I will make the sprint speed 3 times as fast as normal . I convert 3 to floating points which will be 40400000 in hex and replace the X 's with the hex . <p> Now add a second activator which in this case will be the deactivator I will set it as A+Home on wiimote. 28200FA0 00008000 054CCC48 40400000 E0000000 80008000 28200FA0 00008800 <p> Then copy the actual code and place it under the second activator. 28200FA0 00008000 054CCC48 40400000 E0000000 80008000 28200FA0 00008800 054CCC48 XXXXXXXX <p> Replace the X 's ( the second half of the code function ) with the default value .

You can change the position using the zero 's at the end , the X , and the Y. <p> So that covers the button when nothing is happening , but now let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the button . <p> So , it 's basically the same thing , except this time the case is different . <p> Code : <p> Case MouseState.Over <p> Then below Case MoustState.Over , add what you want the button to look like when it 's being hovered over . <p> Tip : You can just C+P from the Case MouseState.None and change a few things and it will look nice . <p> Okay , so now let 's move on to when the button is clicked . <p> Code : <p> Case MouseState.Down <p> It 's the same as the others , except it only appears when it 's clicked .

It is mostly pertaining around Tupacs death and how it relate to the many beliefs of those who believe in the Illuminati , the information shown below does not portray my own beliefs nor is it intended to offend others , it is only shown to bring about discussion on the subject . <p> The Illuminati ( plural of Latin illuminatus , " enlightened " ) is a name given to several groups , both real ( historical ) and fictitious . Historically the name refers to the Bavarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1776 . In more modern contexts the name refers to a purported conspiratorial organization which is alleged to mastermind events and control world affairs through governments and corporations to establish a New World Order . In this context the Illuminati are usually represented as a modern version or continuation of the Bavarian Illuminati . Now how can this " organization " relate to the music industry ? Well world affairs are run by the government , and the governments decisions are mostly influenced on the peoples opinions , and the peoples opinions are influenced by the media ( Television , Radio , Internet ) therefore the music we listen to affects our outlooks on life . <p> Now I could go on and on about all the " Evidence " to support these beliefs but I am going to center in on some certain details about the Tupacs conspiracy . Anyone who has read into the topic has read about the witnesses testimony 's and how they conflict with the polices reports . <p> One specific interview being the one below pay attention to who is being interviewed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the intro this is Paige Hemmis who was a star on House makeover . If you look closely you will see that she is holding a camcorder , if the conspiracy behind the music industry are true this would be a prime example of evidence . Now many of you may be wondering " What the hell is Tony talking about ? " Well i 'm talking about bribery . If The entertainment industry IS run by the " Illuminati " they would want to cover up any mistakes they made in covering up the murder for whatever reason or another . And what 's the best way other than giving some one the chance to be famous in order to keep their mouth shut ? There is also the fact that she mentions him being lifted by a helicopter , when the police report stated that Tupac was taken to the hospital by ambulance . <p> Comment with your opinions on the murder of Tupac and the Illuminati , also this is my first thread in the enlightenment section so i 'm sorry if i had any mistakes <p> I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They wan na bury me alive , who can I trust " . And many other songs relating to his " death " . He also took his name as Makaveli which is similar to Niccolo Macchiaveli an author who wrote about faking his own death . I can really go on all day about this particular subject . <p> 0 <p> Originally Posted by Originality <p> If I gave you a dollar everyday for the amount of fucks I give daily , then you would be broke <p> I 've read this and have gone over this countless time . Thie Illuminati is everywhere believe it or not . <p> And just because someone talks about death and refers to death a lot does n't mean he 's alive volcom . <p> I agree with this , a ton of theories have been made specifically from his lyrics , but other good theories have been made that are more believable . I do think some of his lyrics are pretty interesting though .
