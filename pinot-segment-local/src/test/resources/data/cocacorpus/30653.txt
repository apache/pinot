@@40218706 @218706/ <h> The Story of DOCSIS : Made for Today 's Businesses <p> As the digital world continues to expand , so does the demand to connect , whether that 's to devices or each other . For cable providers , DOCSIS technology has become a solution that not only meets the demands of businesses today but is built for the requirements we know tomorrow will bring . <p> What is DOCSIS ? <p> DOCSIS is the acronym for Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification . Businesses receive their broadband connection via cable modems . Its a technology investment that takes connectivity well beyond what phone companies have been traditionally providing businesses . And while DOCSIS may seem like a foreign term in the business world , its important to understand the technology behind the broadband path you choose for your business . Different iterations and standards of DOCSIS have been configured as the technology evolves ; DOCSIS 3.1 is the latest on the horizon , where the speed capability able to be achieved will be revolutionary to what businesses have been used to from cable providers . <p> DOCSIS Speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 38 Mbps <p> 9 Mbps <p> 2.0 <p> 38 Mbps <p> 27 Mbps <p> 3.0 <p> 152 Mbps <p> 108 Mbps <p> 3.1 <p> 10,000 Mbps <p> 1,000 Mbps <p> For small to medium sized businesses , when looking at DOCSIS vs . DSL technology , there are important differences to point out . DSL transmits data but is based on technology developed for voice , while high-speed internet delivered by cable companies was specifically developed to transmit data . And the key areas where the differences are evident include the following : Speed . DOCSIS speeds have not only been able to deliver the 50 Mbps benchmark of DSL but have gone far beyond it . And with DOCSIS 3.1 , Gigabit speeds will be the standard of capacity . Distance . By running a data connection over that which carries a voice call , does not fare as well . If businesses are located more than a few miles from the phone companys central office , performance will start to degrade . So while the technology is good for calling a client it may not work so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consistency . The truest indicator of this factor is when internet traffic is at its peak and the stress on the network is at its highest . The FCC frequently tests this by way of speeds advertised and speeds delivered . In a 2015 study , the FCC noted " some DSL broadband ISPs actual download speed falls substantially short of their advertised download speed ; the gap between their consistent download speed and advertised download speed is even greater . " Availability . The distance limitations of DSL mean that for a large percentage of a phone companys footprint , the service will not be available , especially so in rural areas . Since high-speed cable Internet does n't  degrade over distance , and runs over the same infrastructure that brings cable TV to both densely and sparsely populated areas , it is available to a far wider customer base ; especially through the investment Mediacom Business has made in its rural 22-state footprint . <p> How DOCSIS and Gigabit Work Together <p> Few internet providers outside of Mediacom Business can deliver the high-capacity speeds of Gigabit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in rural areas . The network infrastructure Mediacom Business has made in these areas was a proprietary investment having the foresight of where technology could take businesses . And now with DOCSIS , cable providers are on the cusp of offering these same speeds quickly and easily , with a nearly 100x increase in the average data rate . The current version of DOCSIS is 25% more efficient than earlier versions . This makes DOCSIS a good fit for businesses who need the ability to host clear video streaming , video conferencing , VoIP and other business applications without delays and drops . <p> For our customers in rural communities , not only does this technology provide businesses with access to high speed internet , but it also means that they are able to connect faster and easier , as DOCSIS 3.1 over HFC hopes to go upwards of 100 Gbps in the future . Plus it allows these businesses to compete on a national or global level because they have the broadband needed to create a competitive edge . <h> About Us 45223 @qwx455223 
@@40218707 @218707/ <h> Author Topic : How to get out of a 2 year contract ? ? ? Very angry customer ( Read 13422 times ) <p> Has anyone had any luck with getting out of a 2 year contract ? ? I am being moved for work , and the town I am moving to is not serviced to mediacom . As a result , mediacom wants me to pay them $180 to break my contract . However , when I signed up for the contract , I specifically asked whether or not moving would be a break in my contract and I was told that if I moved to an area not serviced by them , then tat would not be considered breaking my contract . Now , I am very irritated and pissed off because I am moving and they are telling me that I will need to pay the early termination fee . I do n't see how this is right ... how am I responsible for paying the early termination fee when it is THEIR fault that they are not providing service to the area I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a move out of our service area does constitute a break in contract and an early termination fee- unless this is classified as a military move . At this time , I do show the total early termination fee would be $180 , though an offer was made to reduce this by half when you spoke with a supervisor . We can provide this here as well , though we can certainly pull the original sales call to determine a full waiver of this charge . If it was confirmed that moving out of the service area does not generate a termination fee we will work to fully remove it . <p> I would like the phone call pulled and sent to me for viewing , so I can listen to the conversation that occurred . Because , as I said , no where in this conversation was in mentioned that moving would be a break in the contract . <p> We are unable to have these calls pulled and sent out due to employee security , but I will certainly have this reviewed . Early Termination Fees are all-inclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighting out-of-area moves , but if this was specifically brought up and confirmed then we will certainly move to waive this fee . <p> A copy of the subscriber agreement can be found here : LONG ... and in the back of every physical copy of the " Pause " magazine , beginning on page 60 . Because our contracts are verbal and can differ slightly depending on the services rendered , length of the contract , and other terms there are no physical copies that can be provided . Further information that is covered can also be found in the Terms of Service and Acceptable Use Policies : <p> We were able to review the original sales call placed last October when services were ordered . At that time , there was no mention of moving and the possibility of a waived ETF . The verbal contract was agreed to in full , so this ETF does stand . I do show that the supervisor you spoke with on the phone offered to reduce this by half , and we can certainly see to it that this is honored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blindsided by ETFs . It 's standard practice in telecom not to waive them when a customer moves . The closest I 've seen to an exception is in wireless , where if you move to a place where you 're roaming all the time , it costs the operator so much that it 's more than happy to let you go without an ETF . <p> Every time I 've renewed a contract with a cable provider , I 've always first considered whether I might have to move before the contract ends .

@@40218718 @218718/ <p> Mediacom is moving to an all-digital network and will no longer offer any channels in an analog format . By converting all of your analog channels to digital , Mediacom can more efficiently use its network to enhance existing services and offer new products in the future . <p> As a result , TVs not connected to a Mediacom digital device or TVs without a built-in digital tuner , will need a Mediacom digital adapter to continue to receive all of your channels . Once you make the switch to digital , you will enjoy improved picture quality and have access to more channels than you receive today with the analog line-up . <p> What is the difference between the Broadcast Digital Transition and this new all-digital conversion ? <p> The Broadcast Digital Transition was a government mandate that stated effective June 12 , 2009 , all analog broadcast TV signals ( i.e. ABC , NBC , CBS , PBS , Univision , etc. ) must be broadcast in digital .

@@40218745 @218745/ <p> Good afternoon , We are seeing a very large amount of broadcast traffic on the WAN interface of our router . Most of this traffic seems to be ARP requests for computers on other disjointed subnets from our own such as 50. x.x.x/24 108. x.x.x/24 10. x.x.x.x/24 etc . We are seeing over 7000 ARP requests a minute ( 50-70 Kbit/s ) and this seems to be causing problems for the Modem and the router . Some of the problems we are seeing is our default gateway being bumped off the ARP table of our router or the modem is not able to process checking and updating its ARP table 7000 times a minute . When this happens we see intermittent packet loss on our end anywhere from 1-20% . We are using business grade Cisco equipment for our router and it does not appear that we are over running the CPU or the memory on the device . This office uses VOIP phones and other internet based devices which has been causing them to drop phone calls and loose internet connection . The traffic appears to originate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is running ProxyArp on this device , so I 'm not sure if these requests are really originating from the CMTS or from other devices . I have a wireshark capture of the traffic that we are seeing and i can provide this on request . <p> What options would Mediacom be able to provide us with to filter these ARP broadcasts out before they reach the modem ? <p> The packet loss has been an ongoing issue for at least the last year and a half , they have replaced the modem multiple times and looked at or fixed the lines multiple times for signal issues .

@@40218770 @218770/ <p> Just looking at the power your modem is receiving you have noise or a possible faulty splitter somewhere along your connection . Your Power levels should not range from +0.4dBmV all the way to -4.4dBmV . Are you running through a splitter between the modem and the wall or direct to the outlet ? <p> If possible , attempt to bypass the coupler and see if the readings are any better/worse . If it completely removed the -4 ranges then a new one may be needed . If little to no improvement is seen we may need a technician out to check the line and improve the signal coming in . <p> I have n't changed anything yet , but it seems to be working fine today ( power levels are ranging from 7.6 to 10 , though I 'm still seeing millions of uncorrectable errors ) .

( Read 340 times ) <p> A month ago I was called to let me know that Mediacom would be " upgrading " my rental modem to the latest Docsis 3.1 modem that you guys have for the 1gb customers . <p> The sequence of events for getting the installation has been : -Schedule an install on a Friday which means I have to take off work a couple hours early. -Get a call saying that installing the new modem at that point in time will actually make my internet somehow worse , so we need to reschedule. -Reschedule install time for the following Saturday ( 8 days later ) and do not get an install time , just get the 8am to 8pm estimation. -Nobody shows up despite being around all day . No call . Nothing. -call you guys to reschedule for this upcoming Saturday and am informed that a ) I ca n't schedule an installation on a Saturday ( which is why nobody showed up this Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without my knowledge or any notification c ) I can not schedule a time so I have to be ready to leave work all day d ) I ca n't do the installation of a modem my self as it " requires a technician " <p> So what I would like to know is : -What is the benefit of this new modem ? This seems like a lot of hassle for something I did n't know I needed. -What is so complicated about this modem that means I can not install it myself ? -Why ca n't I schedule an actual installation time rather than being " on-call " all day ? <p> You can install yourself as it was proven with a tech that said I do n't need to be there to install a modem . It 's done just like any other through wallgardern . They must want there install fee . My signals were a little off so he came and fixed them but did not need access to my house . <p> I am very sorry to hear about all of the issues you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You certainly should not have gone through all of these issues . It appears as though the techs do not have access to the local warehouse on the weekends to get the necessary equipment , such as the Docsis 3.1 modem . You definitely sould have been notified . This new modem is able to bond up to 32 downstream channels , which makes the 1 Gig service possible . Your current modem is running on 16 downstream channels . Also , I am seeing a bit of an elevated downstream signal going into your modem . A tech is needed , for the installation of this 1 Gig service , to make sure these signal issues are resolved . Unfortunately , the 1 gig service is tech-install only , in case equipment , lines , or connectors need to be updated to handle the new and faster speed . <p> I would like to see if I can get them out there sooner ( within a smaller time-frame ) for you . Are there any times or days that would not work for you between now and 4/21 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , if you are more comfortable with that . <p> Honestly , 4/21 is the best day for me . The only thing that I would like would be away to actually know what time of day so I can plan around it rather than being on-call the entire day . It sounded like that was possible when I first scheduled an installation . Is that not an option now ? <p> I noticed you said bonding 32 channels ( including OFDM ) is what makes 1gig possible but mine still only bonds 16 the others are not locked or anything and I have 1gig . You sure it 's not the ofdm channel ? <p> Hello , joewom ! Looking at your modem , you are currently bonded to 16 channels , and the OFDM profile is fine . This means that something on-site is most likely causing the loss of the additional 16 channels , such as a trap or MoCA filter . I am making note of this on your currently scheduled job for the technician.

@@40218777 @218777/ <p> ive been using Netflix for a very long time . And I 've been a Mediacom customer since 2013 . <p> The data cap limits that exsist really are a formality against abuse of people who would be downloading illegal movies , torrents of programs etc.The reason I say that is because it 's really hard to breach the cap limits unless you are doing exactly what I just said which is illegal anyway and Mediacom will turn you over if they catch you as they should . People who complain of it are more than likely suspect of those who are doing illegal things with the connection and are the causes of people getting poor downloads and streaming becuase they hog the connections . I 'm sure MEdiacom will chime in and totally agree . It 's also people abusing using a residential package and doing business on it and should be moved to a business plan instead . <p> So if you see or read someone complaining about Mediacoms cap limits be very cautious on that as it 's only a formality against abuse and its extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I hog but legally and still the cap limit I have no complaint its still plenty for me who games , downloads through STEAM and has 3 peopple all streaming in my house and watching constantly . In fact if Mediacom were to analyze my connection , which I do n't mind , it would give them a good idea of where to set the cap limits as this is a household of 4 , online gaming through STEAM , and everyone streaming constantly . I would n't mind if they modelled it after my connection anyway to get accuracy . But even at that Im finding it EXTREMELY HARD to breach the caps . <p> Now with that said since Mediacom has adjusted those limits due to the likes of Netflix over time as HD streaming does take morebandwidth . It used tobe a miniscule 250GB per month but they did increase it to 350 a year ago . I still feel they need to move that to 400GB due to 4K streaming . And as of an announcement this year Mediacom did have the poorest rates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last . Now , I do n't know if they have resolved that but in the public announcement Mediacom stated that as of October2015 they would be employing a direct link to Netflix to improve that . All I can tell you is as of today I 'm getting pristine pictures where as before I was getting lots of stuttering , drops , and the conneciton was poor . So without knowing much I 'd say that Mediacom 's link to netflix appears to be active as my video quality improved as well as the dropouts and disconnect seem to be gone . And that was noticed over the past month so something is going on postively . I hope they chime in to my reply and confirm it . <p> I found over the past two years its best to have the 1 Terrabyte plan with thee 100Mbps download speed.Not only do you get fast internet speeds , but it resolves any issues of the video streaming from chopping or stopping.Netflix will also detect your speed and auto omptimize it giving you a pristine beautiful HD image which doies consume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my house with two others and i 'm almost at the 1TB limit . The plan just below this I think is a 350GB limit.I feel you 'd come close to it at time and possibly not breach it . <p> Although you 'd be ok wiht the plan that 's 20Mbps download and a 350 GB cap limit I do n't think you 'll be satisfied with streaming unlessyou go the Prime Plis plan of 50Mbps download . <p> In any case if I were you , and I use the streaming and downloading ALOT duie to my gaming on STEAM , Netflix , Hulu etcand 3 others in my house I use the Utra Plus 150Mbps plan with 2TB lmit . Its overkill also but I love seeing pages flip like a book and everything downloads lightening fast . No wasting time at all . <p> For you be a single person I 'd go to the 50Mbps plan which is the Prime Plus with the 350Mbps You will find it 's enough . But , if your downloading large things Go to Ultra.I have STEAM an online gaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto patch automatically and download.My library is excess of one thousand games I bought over 10 years and with atuto patching its consuming 200GB alone.Wiht streaming with 3 people in my house HD its consuming 600GB so I 'm almost at the 1TB limit . Whichi is rather amazing . <p> So go with Prime PLus 50Mbps download which is plenty with the 350GB cap limit is my recommendation to you for watching Netflix and would be enough for online game play with moderatte TV watching included . FOr heavy use watching in excess of 6 hours per day and gaming go with Ultra 100Mbps download and 1TB cap limit . But I have a feeling since you are saying it 's just you on the connection Prime PLus 50Mbps will be just fine along with that 350GB cap limit . Do not go with the basic 20Mbps 250GB cap limit plan . The download rate is just not going not going to be good when it comes to the Netflix HD streaming . If you were to do anything else at all it 's going to get a muddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Plus I 've muddles iwth these plans alot . Basic is just not real good . <p> I also recommend people buy their own cable modems . Get the ARRIS Surfboard Docsis 3.0 Model SB6141 . YOu can get it Amazonfor 70 bucks OVer a years time it pays for itself and that modem supports up to 350Mbps download rates . MORE THAN ENOUGH tocover you for the future . <p> Hey DeanSB2014 , thank you for reaching out to us through the forums . Lakesideguy pretty much hit the nail on the head with his explanation ! You are currently subscribed to the Prime Plus package which has 350GB of data . Like lakesideguy explained , with you being the only one streaming in the home you should n't run into any issues going over you cap , but that also depends on what else you are using your internet for as well .

Speeds go down to anywhere between .5/.1 to 5/5 . This is happening to everyone in our neighborhood , and we 've had multiple techs out ( over the past few months ) to look at both our house and the neighborhood 's primary node , but nothing has ever come from it . Phone support is useless because if a basic modem/router reset does n't fix it ( which of course does not , and it 's all that 's ever suggested ) , the customer service agent just wants to send another tech out in a minimum of 2 weeks ( which has yet to be helpful ) . I 'm fairly confident it 's simply a failure in your underwhelming ( to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network . With that in mind , I expect to be credited for every day we 've had unacceptable speeds and internet performance , or flat out no internet at all . I can provide logs of speed tests for essentially every day in October so far , as well as intermittent ones from September , all of which clearly display crippling service issues . Here 's a screenshot from today so you can see what I 'm talking about : http : **25;215;TOOLONG <p> This is all IMMENSELY frustrating , especially for individuals who work from home ( there are a few in our neighborhood ) . To this point nobody at Mediacom has had an answer as to the problem or the solution , and I ca n't recall the last time I 've had to deal with such miserable service from any ISP . <p> Bump . We have a technician coming out on the 19th , but I have no faith that will fix anything , considering no past visit has . When the issue arises , our download and upload speeds crash tremendously , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persist , and once again at night like I claimed earlier . The clear pattern in our service failing suggests Mediacom simply does n't have the bandwidth to support everyone on their network ( most likely due to no fiber backbone ) , as speeds for myself and neighbors crash at peak usage times . If so , that is an unfixable issue on your end until your have fiber ( many years ) and I would expect to be credited for every hour of every day we do n't have internet , as you simply can not provide the speeds we are paying for . The only other option is the entry node to our neighborhood is somehow failing , but we 've had technicians out to look at in the past , and it clearly has n't resolved anything . <p> Good morning wtoodsherman , thanks for posting . Looking at your connection , this does n't seem to be area based . Current your downstream SNR is sitting below 30 , bouncing as low as 15 . Your downstream RX power is out of range as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RX power is 0 and the area average for SNR is 37 . I also pulled the signals from the modem of a close by neighbor , and that modem has a RX power of 0.5 and an SNR of 36 . That would indicate that this problem is localized to your location . All other signals are in range , and area utilization does n't go over 45% . I am showing you have a tech set up as you stated , and this is something he should be equipped to fix . Previous to this , I am not seeing we 've had a completed trouble call on your account since June . I am showing that was reported on 10/11 , so we would be happy to apply credit from 10/12 until the fix date when the tech is out .

@@40218787 @218787/ <p> MediacomCraig : I do see an appointment has been scheduled for that date/time . <p> Thanks , Craig <p> stephcon : Ok , thank you . It does n't show up in my app so I wanted to make sure . <p> MediacomCraig : No problem . <p> Thanks , Craig <p> stephcon : I am in shock . I ca n't believe the way in which Mediacom conducts it 's business ! You will see that on October 5 , I commented on here to get help having my Mediacom cable tv ( TiVo ) service disconnected . MediacomSean said that somebody from the Retention department would contact me , but nobody ever did . MediacomAllie then said that somebody for the Customer Loyalty department would contact me , but they never did . I called the Customer Loyalty department phone number myself and set up to have the TiVos removed from my house . The agent advised me that if I would agree to have a " plain old cable box " installed then my bill would be lower than it would be with internet alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began offering three weeks ago . I said , " sure . " I should have known better , and that 's obvious now . The same contractor ( actually , the trainee who accompanied &amp; helped the main contractor ) who installed my TiVos wrong showed up at my door yesterday . Funny , because I specifically stated that I needed an actual Mediacom tech to come out for the job , due to my previous experiences with the contractors in my area . Anyway , this contractor did not call before coming , and arrived 20 minutes early , when I was not home . My husband asked him to come back after I was home ( I was on my way home , to be there during the actual scheduled appointment time . ) He told my husband that he did n't know what he was there for because the notes for his job were not clear . My husband asked why he did n't call before he came and he said that he did n't have the information to do so . He left and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can imagine , or at least get an idea on exactly how mad I was at this point . This entire experience with Mediacom has been a literal NIGHTMARE . On my way home to meet the tech , I called the Customer Loyalty department phone number that MediacomAllie provided . I told the agent that I was extremely frustrated , that the same contractor who jacked up the job in the first place showed up and said he did n't even know what he was supposed to do . She said , " I 'm not sure how he ca n't know what he 's supposed to do , because his instructions are right in front of me and they are very clear . It says to ' put on trap to local channels only and replace all TiVo equipment with one HD DCT . ' " I asked her to email me the instructions for the contractor , which she did . I asked her if he would have the right equipment for my install and she said that he would . I let her know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sort of shocked to hear because with Mediacom you do n't hear apologies very often . <p> Come on , people , this situation is seriously UNBELIEVABLE . It is so outrageous . I feel like I 'm in the twilight zone here ! <p> I got home and a little while later , the contractor called me ( I guess he was able to find my phone number ) and said that he was on his way . When he got here , I took him outside and showed him the lines that his trainer cut and left hanging all over my yard and my neighbor 's yard . He was pretty well taken aback that his boss had cut the lines . He said that he would trim them so that they would no longer be lying around in my yard , which he did . I then explained to him exactly why he was here . I told him that I did n't want the TiVos anymore , that all I wanted was the internet , but that the Customer Loyalty agent told me that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my internet , then it would be cheaper than my internet alone . I asked him if he had the correct cable box for the job . He said he did have a DTA box in his truck . I asked if that was the same as an HD DCT box which is what the Customer Loyalty rep had said was to be installed . He said it was the same thing . He went into the house and unhooked the TiVo box in the living room and began installing a tiny box approximately the same size as my internet modem . He called to activate it and hung up his phone after talking to somebody . He then asked me what channels I was supposed to get , because they told him he had the wrong box . He said that his notes and the notes that customer service had were completely different- I 'm still not sure how that 's possible , because the Customer Loyalty agent told me that he has the exact same instructions as what she read to me and emailed me . I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus free Showtime , Starz , Encore and on-demand . That is what the Customer Loyalty agent told me came with the bundle . He then said that he had the wrong box , and that he would have to go get a different one out of his truck . RIDICULOUS . He went out to his truck and came back inside with a nasty old cable box that smelled like cigarette smoke and had sticky gunk all over it . He said , " the good news is we 've had problems with these boxes all day . I was just on a job where I changed out three of these boxes and still left with it not working . " and laughed . He called to have the box activated and was on hold for over 20 minutes before getting an agent on the phone to help him . As it turned out , there was indeed a problem ( the same problem he had before , at another customer 's house ) with the box that he installed here at my house . The phone agent could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The box would not pull up and display the correct lineup . He showed me that the channels listed were not the channels I was supposed to get . I live in the Kansas City area , and I was getting channels for Columbia , Missouri . None of the channel numbers are right , and there are channels that I 'm not even supposed to receive . He said that he really hated to leave a job unfinished , but there was nothing he could do . He left and told me to call him tomorrow and let him know if the lineup ever " fixed itself . " <p> Here I am today . I checked the cable tv and I am still getting Columbia 's channels and channels that I 'm not supposed to get . Nothing is right . I have unhooked all of the tv equipment that he installed and I want to take it to my local office to turn in . I do not want Mediacom cable tv service at all . I CAN NOT HANDLE THIS ANYMORE . My life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crap . The contractor left a humongous cable box , along with the little one that he installed in error . My guess is that I 'm now being charged for both of them ? PLEASE , PLEASE correct this for me . Help me , please . I have learned my lesson and will not ever try to have Mediacom cable tv again . Directv is coming on Sunday to hook my satellite back up , free of charge , since the Mediacom contractor cut all of the Directv lines to run the Mediacom service through . THAT 'S what I call customer service . <p> P.S.The " area management team " never contacted me as MediacomAllie told me on this forum that they would . You have not provided me with any updates on that matter , but I guess they 're no longer needed since the contractor cut the rest of the telephone lines down for me . <p> rygiric88 : i feel your pain . somehow the communication from agents/reps to the techs is non-existent . it makes it kind of difficult to get anything done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , do n't ya think ? go read any of my posts if you want to see another disaster . you start hoping and praying that what they are telling you is correct and then you find out its all nonsense most of the time . hopefully your issue gets resolved shortly . <p> p.s. you should let me know in a week or two how Directv is for you , i 'm seriously considering a change as well if Mediacom ca n't get their act together ... 
@@40218788 @218788/ <p> You can not stream content when you are off of your network unless you are using an android device . If using iOS , you can download content onto your devices and watch the downloaded content while off your network . If you would like more in depth information , you can check this link on the Tivo website here : https : **26;276;TOOLONG <p> Mediacom Allie . Are you saying that you can steam content when you are OFF your home network using an android device ? For example , if I 'm sitting in a hotel and on my LTE network are you saying I can stream shows from my TIVO DVR to my phone ? If so , please let me know how I do that as when I try to pick a show when off my network and watch it is shows greyed out options for watch on my phone and watch on my TV . <p> It has been my understanding that Mediacom has disable all capabilities to STREAM content when off my home network . Has something changed on that ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home network unless you have previously saved the show to the device . On your home network , in my understanding , you should be able to download shows to the device and then watch them off network . Have you tried to do that previously ? <p> Thanks Chris . That confirms what I understood that Mediacom is still blocking the use of streaming off the home network . I do n't think I 've ever heard an explanation from Mediacom as to why they are blocking this feature . Can you provide some clarity of why and if that could change in the future ? <p> Regarding downloading a show to a device and watching it later , I have done that but found that it takes a very long time to download movies , etc so it is not a very good solution . Having the ability to stream on demand is a much more useful method so I hope Mediacom stops blocking that feature . <p> I ( and I 'm sure MANY others ) would appreciate any comments you can provide on this topic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a Mediacom-imposed block , but rather a limitation of the device or issues with licensing with manufacturers , etc . From the Stream site FAQs : https : **26;304;TOOLONG , live and recorded programming can not be streamed via 4G LTE on iOS devices . Are you having trouble with this same function on Android devices ? If so , I will certainly look into this further . It is my understanding the Stream is sold as it would be from TiVo , but discounted through Mediacom , and no features of this device are tweaked or controlled . <p> Thanks for getting back . I am using an Android based smartphone and have the Tivo app installed and everything runs perfectly when I 'm at home on the network including streaming to my android phone . However , when I 'm away from home on another wifi or on my Verizon network LTE signal , I can load up the app , see my recorded shows just as if I was at home but when I select " watch " in the application it shows that both options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV " are greyed out or not selectable . <p> Anytime I go to setup steaming in the app it only shows " set up in-home steaming " as the only option . So I assume this is because it is being blocked as I know you can setup " out-of-home " streaming on non-Mediacom Tivo systems . In fact , when I try to setup streaming when out-of-home I get an error message that says there was a problem and " ... make sure you have set up out-of-home streaming ... " so I assume that is an option I 'm blocked from setting up ? <p> Also , on the TIVO web sight you referred me to states " Stream live and recorded TV to your iOS or Android devices from anywhere " so that functionality is built into the Tivo stream device I have but it does not appear to be enabled by someone . <p> Is there anything I should be doing differently to try and setup my ANDROID phone to stream when away from home ? <p> Thanks for that information ! While the Stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's fully functional original state , I wonder if that may be a NETWORK-based function that is turned down or disabled . The error you receive regarding out-of-home streaming seems to indicate as much . I 'll run some inquiries up the chain to see what I can find out ! There may be contract terms between us and TiVo that require certain features to be disabled , etc . Once we receive more feedback , we 'll touch base here ! <p> Hey there , Kevin , you 're actually correct on all fronts ! The MyTV App is designed for our non-Tivo standalone DVRs , so this wo n't work with the TiVo systems . The TiVo app itself or TiVo Desktop Plus ( sold separatly ) are good for all of this . The app can view and scheduled recordings , etc. , and you should be able to view live content and recordings from your iOS devices while on your home network . I 'm not 100% certain on an answer for #2 , and I 've actually pushed a few inquiries to a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to seeing your post . I 'll definitely touch base once we hear more about that : LONG ... <p> This topic is exactly why I sought this board . It 's frustrating that Mediacom advertises that we can watch recorded shows anywhere using the android app ( although does n't make it obvious that we need to purchase a TiVo Stream - and purchase it from Mediacom ) , then that turns out not to be the case . The " setup out of home " streaming option is not selectable . Is this unique to the Mediacom provided TiVo Stream ? Will it eventually be fixed ? <p> Researching further , it appears as though this is not a Mediacom-imposed block , but rather a limitation of the device or issues with licensing with manufacturers , etc . From the Stream site FAQs : https : **26;332;TOOLONG , live and recorded programming can not be streamed via 4G LTE on iOS devices . <p> Hello siersrd1 , <p> I believe this portion of the thread answers your question however I may be misunderstanding it in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me know . <p> Thanks for doing some more digging into this topic Drew and Justin . I really appreciate your help and I 'm sure there are many folks interested in what you find out about why out-of-home streaming is not allowed with the TIVO stream on Mediacom and if this will change in the future . <p> I confirmed last night that when I 'm on my home network and select the setup stream function within the Tivo app on my mobile device it does n't even show the option to activate " out-of-home " streaming . This confirms that this functionality is being blocked or turned off by someone . I tried it both from my Android phone and Ipad with the same results . I know I can download shows to my IOS device but I 'm specifically interested in the streaming functionality . Streaming works perfectly when I 'm on my home network . <p> I 'm trying to decide if it make sense for me to cancel the Mediacom TIVO service and just buy my own Tivo boxes which would allow for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offering that feature in the near future I may hold off on doing that . <p> Thanks again for all your help and we look forward to hearing more about what you find out . <p> I do n't know if Mediacom and TiVo worked their magic whilst I slept or if it was a set of unique circumstances , but EVERYTHING for me works as of this morning after a little AM cup-of-joe in front of the kitchen TV hiccup ... <p> My situation may be a bit different than others , but a little background ... thanks to the Mods here on the forums , Mediacom merged my new units onto my existing TiVo online account . I had an existing Stream device and a few OTA TiVos with service already established . <p> This morning I could n't watch content from the main MCom dvr--I could list the recorded shows , but that was it . So I checked the network diagnostics and everything was fine . But when I checked the MAK I noticed that it did not have the same key as the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which is the quickest way to update your TiVo service/account information ) and I could now watch the show in the kitchen . <p> That made me think to see if anything had changed now for the TiVo app because my existing Stream device was set up to use my existing MAK--which now was on all my Mediacom devices ... and sure enough , when I launched the TiVo app it immediately prompted me to set up the Stream device for my new Mediacom TiVo ! ! ! <p> I can now Watch Now from Mediacom--AS ADVERTISED ! <p> Again , there was probably a lot of behind the scenes changes going on , but if you have had your existing Stream device on another account , it has to be on the same account as your Mediacom units with the same MAK . <p> No flags were changed during the account update ( they are all a , a , a , a , etc. ) so I do n't think it was anything else for me than that . <p> Justin , Thanks for responding . Sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searched through all the FAQ 's , installation instructions , etc . I can find without being able to find an answer for my problem . <p> I have setup my Mediacom provided Stream to work within my house just fine . I have android devices , so according to all the advertisements I 've seen , I should be able to stream ( whether over 4G LTE or wifi ) both recorded and live ( or near-live ) to these android devices anywhere I can receive a signal to get on the internet . I understand that I must set up out-of-home streaming first . But , the option to select out-of-home streaming is not available in my streaming setup on any of my android devices . I have a whole-home TiVo , so I do n't need to stream to devices within my house . So , why did I spend $70 to get something that does n't do what it was advertised that it would do ? <p> I apologize , I should have elaborated more . TiVo desktop will give you the option to download recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not offer or support TiVo desktop , and can be purchased directly from TiVo . We do not have any plans at this time for streaming off network with the TiVo stream . <p> TiVo Stream is great for customers that want to use it with TiVo desktop to take recordings on the go or take your tablet with you in your home or yard to stream recordings . Please link me to the Mediacom advertisement , and I would be happy to look into it . -Tommy 
@@40218790 @218790/ <p> I switched to Mediacom a few months ago from AT&amp;T and am looking for the feature of the listing of phone calls . Uverse , with At&amp;t , had a channel that showed all the phone calls that were received . They also had auto blocking of robocalls , so I never had that issue . Now with Mediacom , I get 4-8 robocalls a day and its aggravating , some coming as early as 7:30 . Does Mediacom not have a way to block the robocalls in their phone system ? ? ? Does Mediacom not have anywhere we can go to see a list of the latest phone numbers that have called ? ? ? Does Mediacom have anywhere we can go to block phone numbers ? ? ? I have all three services with Mediacom at present , but this phone issue is putting all three of those in jeopardy ! Did n't  have the issue with Uverse . Hope to get some answers here . Thanks.Bobby <p> Hello Bobby , Thank you for posting in the forums . You can access all of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number that is provided on your account statement . Please let me know if you have any problem logging in or using the features . Thanks- Sean <p> Not sure why everything has to have a different password , but I can log into the phone settings . It asks for my phone number and password and the tech that set up my service made the password my phone number . So when I put the phone number in and then put the phone number in as password , it tells me I have put in incorrect password . <p> It has me locked out after 3 tries , why is everything with mediacom so complicated . I hate not being able to pick up a phone and asking a live person these questions . If I had known all these pitfalls ( not blocking robocalls , inability to talk to live person , and spending too much time to get a few answers ) I would probably have not changed my service to Mediacom. <h> cyberpunk1161 <p> Im having the same issue too . Ca n't log in to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were incorrect . I 'm using my phone # and the pin on my bill . Is that wrong ? I tried using my account # and it said was too long . <p> Hello cyberpunk1161 . I have made sure the default password is set on your log in to the phone settings site . The number you will need to use is your ten digit Mediacom phone number ( no dashes , parenthesis , or spaces ) and the default password is the four digit pin printed on your monthly statement below the payment due date .

Okay then .. Then I called from my cell to the landline and used * when Miss Voicemail picked up . She said it needed to be set up from the landline itself . So maybe I do n't have voicemail ... ?

If it 's not included but we 're for some reason paying extra for it now , can it be removed ? We have an answering machine and have no need for this service , and did n't sign up for it . We certainly do n't want to pay for this feature , we barely use the landline as it is . <p> Also , can I listen to this message that 's waiting there before it gets removed ? Or would I be charged for that ? <p> Thanks for contacting us here ! Looking at the account I do see that the voicemail services are included with the promotional offer you 're on . We can disable this feature though if you 'd like to use your own answering machine though . Would you like us to disable it from our end ?

IF you 're still having issues setting this up just let us know and we'l be happy to assist any way that we can ! <p> I want to check the messages it contains first , then I will have you disable it . However , I can not get onto it from the landline . Here 's what it tells me verbatim when I call myself as described above : <p> " We 're sorry the person you are calling is not currently accepting calls from you . We 're sorry the person you are calling is not currently accepting calls from you . " <p> Hello Etechgeek24 . To access the message that is stored in your voicemail go to https : **26;420;TOOLONG Enter in you phone number and the password . The password is the PIN number located on your statement . You will find the message located in the category " messages &amp; calls " . You can listen to and delete the message from there .

My mom told me to block our own number from calling us because she read somewhere that if your own number calls you it 's a scammer or something . I had forgotten about it long ago , and that would explain the error message ... <p> I 'm glad to hear that you were able to figure this out . We did have our Tier 2 department push new firmware to the modem as well . You may need to do a factory reset , but once it comes back online , you should be good to go .

I 've got Family Cable with Starz , the Sports Pack , and Internet from you guys . Are there any specials running for HBO for current customers . Also , if I replace Starz with HBO instead , how would that affect pricing ? <p> Hello ! The HBO package typically runs at $18.95 and includes the live programming package , OnDemand content , and access to HBO GO .

Be sure to keep us posted here ! <p> It looks like after the cable comes into the house it goes first to a 2-way splitter . From the 2-way splitter , one cable goes directly to the cable modem , whereas the other goes to a 4-way splitter for TVs .

Do n't know if it 's a better splitter than the one that 's been in use , which is an SVI SV-2G Digital Splitter . <p> Based on your signal improvement since 11am that 2 way splitter is definitely a problem , if not the sole problem . Your Downstream RX signal for example went from around -2.5dB prior to 11am to +4.5dB after 11am . <p> That is a much larger drop with the knowledge that a normal working splitter is rated to add approx. -3.5dB , so you should be sitting at roughly +1.0dB with a properly working splitter when your signal is at +4.5dB from the outlet .

We are either looking at a break somewhere along the cable line that may be allowing interference or a signal issue is occurring again from the splitter(s) . Best suggestion at this point is to have a tech out just to check and replace any outside connections as needed . You may be able to manipulate your in-home splitter a bit to maybe get it working , but if the problem is outside the most you could do would be a temporary fix .

I 've been having TONS of issues over the last week with random sites not working , can not access certain things , etc . With some deeper diving today I noticed the MTU thing . I 've been able to temporarily work around this by changing that interface to manual on my UTM . However , that 's not going to work because soon my DHCP lease will need to be renewed with you guys . <p> Hi xGunslingerx , thanks for posting . I 'd be happy to escalate this to look into the problem . I need a bit of background information to make sure I escalate this properly to avoid a delay in our Tier 2 and engineering teams needing more info . When did you first notice this starting ? Currently we are showing we are using the default , industry standard MTU sizes . What sites can you not reach ? Can you provide some pings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected directly into the computer ? Get me that information and I 'll be happy to forward this up for you . <p> First noticed this issue about two weeks ago . It was always random stuff . Could n't load certain images on sites , videos would n't play . CSGO could n't connect , etc . It was n't until after I started to dive in and saw that MTU for the WAN interface on the UTM was auto-setting to 576 based on DHCP info that I really was able to single it out as the cause . When I force the UTM to 1500 , or honestly probably anything above 1280 it will do fine . From what I can tell the UTM is pulling it 's info from DHCP from you . <p> We have tested this on the network and are currently unable to recreate the problem . When you bypass the firewall and plug directly into the switch , does the problem continue ? If this does continue , then we can send a test gateway out to see if the problem still happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending an MTU of 576 via DHCP . However , this is a known issue with the latest version of the UTM . There is a fix posted on the Sophos UTM community forum that will tell DHCP to ignore that setting . Here is the fix - LONG ... <p> bumdass , thanks for pointing that thread out . I was hoping MC would change their server settings to the correct values . I had to renew my IP 3 times in 24 hours , so I got tired of waiting . I SSH 'd into the UTM and made the changes to the default.conf file today to remove the " interface-mtu " flag . So far it does seem to be working . <p> @MediacomRobert - the issue is that I believe the default for DHCP is to provide an MTU of 576 , which is an old holdover . It should be providing 1500 as the MTU . Most CPE will ignore that setting and use their own default . The product OP was talking about is not ignoring that setting right now ( recent change ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fix provided just tells that product to ignore the DHCP setting provided . <p> The short story is that the product OP was using should probably be ignoring the MTU setting provided by the ISP for ethernet-based connections but is n't . <p> Thank you for the update xGunslingerx and for the added info bumdass . If that was an effective workaround we may not need to use a test gateway as MediacomRobert offered unless you would like to see if another modem can work without requiring to change those settings . Unfortunately we have limited control over most 3rd party equipment , so it may very well act in ways that are not typical of the majority of the devices on our network in some cases . <p> If you begin to have issues or need any further assistance just let us know . <p> If our Tier-2 department needs any further information or examples , they will certainly reach out to you . In the meantime , you can always change the MTU size if you have your own personal router . Thanks !

The modems we provide can handle 20Mbps down and 2Mbps up , and if the ultra service is available in your area ( only in limited areas for the time being ) you can use DOCSIS 3.0 to reach up to 50Mbps down and 5Mbps up . If you need help getting service set up or have questions about speeds or prices please let me know and I can give you any info you need . <p> Thanks Chris . " G " is fine . Only 20Mbps available around here I think , and 12 would be pretty welcome to someone used to 1.5 dsl ( me ) - if it really achieves it . Some friends in the area say it gets close most times . <p> What is the " small monthly fee " for the wireless modem/router and how many ethernet ports does it have ? <p> I have a local phone # to call and get set up . I wo n't bother you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The best router the home is Netgear WNDR3700 with dd-wrt firmware . It cost around $150 but with the dd-wrt firmware you get the features of a router that would cost thousands of dollars . Some of the noteable features are Dual Band Wireless , Gigabit ports , usb port ( With DD-WRT firmware you can do anything with this ) , and here is a link of just some of the stuff you can do with DD-WRT firmware LONG ...

@@40218826 @218826/ <p> bsorenson : Thanks to MediacomJustin for getting me access to my email . It is a little unnerving to see 2% of data used already for the first day in the new billing cycle and that 's with only a little Roku streaming . I understand that this is about making users accountable for how much data they are using but we , the customers , are being squeezed on one side by cable TV channels continually raising their subscriber fees and now on the other side by rather restrictive data cap for online access . If only the powers that be at Mediacom would rethink the size of the data caps there would be much less pushback from customers . A more reasonable and less frightening cap would be about double what the current limits are being set at . I do n't want to deal with the meltdown from a four year-old when , towards the end of the month , I have to tell her that she ca n't sit down and stream PBS Kids on Roku because daddy has to save that little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> MediacomJustin : You 're welcome . If you would like we can check on promotions for you for a higher tier of internet that would result in a larger data allowance per month . 2% usage per day is not bad though , if you were to use the same daily you would only end up at 60% of your allowance per month . Which gives you some room to work with if you do have some days where more data is used than others . <p> gmeekin : After viewing my data usage for the past 3 months , i have to draw serious attention to the fact that i feel like mediacom is unfairly limiting and restricting " average " use for customers . Like many have already stated and i will state for myself , i have a house hold of 5 people , 2 adults and 3 kids who watch netflix on their ipads , tv or computer . 3 computers who run world of warcraft regularly and a house hold who is uploading pics and vids onto facebook . This all takes place normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other game playing and such . I also run STEAM , a gaming client for which i purchase programs and games , all of which can have 8+ gig of installation files to download . Now , in light of all that i must strongly voice my opinion here , that MEDIACOM is very out of touch with the average customer . I am not buying this crap that the limitation is only affecting 3% of the customer base , especially considering netflix , plus other online streaming is becoming the norm . Being what i will consider a pretty average household consumer and average amount of use , i feel like 350 gig is really pushing the boundary . 500 gig is NOT an unreasonable request for an average house hold . <p> MediacomDallas : Thanks for your feedback . Most customers only use about 14 GB per month , which is well below our allowances . In reality , only 3% of our users exceed our usage allowances . If you are a heavy user of internet service , it is recommended to upgrade to Prime Plus or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have a rep get in touch with you to go over the available options . <p> bsorenson : Enough with trying to upsell us to a higher tier/higher priced package as a " solution " to the unnecessary data caps ! The internet service which Mediacom provides is a gravy train for the company and capping data amounts is borderline oppressive making this nothing more than a blatant money grab . With the ever-rising costs of the television packages something has to give -- trying to get loyal customers to spend even more is typical business but how about being reasonable and instead dealing with the few who are billed as " abusing " their internet service instead of punishing and capping all users ?

At that rate there is no way I would make it 17 days . Something is not right here and I seem to get the same " might as well be a robot " response when I call and ask about it . Things that I do online : play video games , pc and xbox one ( time to time not as often as pc ) , watch twitch.tv streamers , and my kids use netflix . Pretty standard use of internet , yet here I am with 17 days left and at 78% when all my past months have been just fine .

We can definitely offer some suggestions to see if what may be causing your data usage to be so high . Have you looked at what devices are connected to your network and ensured that only authorized devices are able to connect ? Also you can look at the back ground processes of all devices connecting to the network to see if there are programs running that you do not know about . <p> Sorry that was a bit that I forgot to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is on there is authorized . As for background processes I can go through those now , but I do believe that is taken care of also . <p> I did verify with our alternate monitoring system that this amount of data was used . I wanted to make sure we ruled out the possibility of the usage meter maybe falsely reporting the numbers . Both systems are reporting the same usage and are independent of the other . If no rogue devices are connected to your network then the next best step would be to start disconnecting a device at a time from your network and monitoring the usage to see if the usage lowers or not and track down what device is using the data . <p> My guess is that Twitch is the biggest user of the bandwidth ? I do n't want to get into how much of a crock this cap is but I will throw it out there that I wish you guys would rework it . I am going to go without twitch the rest of my 17 days and see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be great , I still do n't believe that I used 270+ gb in 15 days . I have a lot of friends we all game just as much and use the same internet speeds and they never have an issue , I think that this is being measured wrong or something is wrong with my connection or something . I am talking with everyone that I play with say they download and download a lot and never have a problem ( in this area 20mile radius ) even a guy who works at charter and he 's never heard of a problem of going over the 350gb cap , let alone their 250gb cap .

@@40218852 @218852/ <p> To sum up what I am going to document below . For one year now , my internet connection has been slowing down . I averaged 15mb down and 2-4mb up before November 2009 . Since that time my connection speed has slowed to 2.99mb down and .48mb up . <p> I first noticed that in November 2009 that my latency while playing World of Warcraft jumped from 200ms to 400ms . Where I never had disconnects I now received disconnects . It was n't the World of Warcraft service because my ventrilo server went from a typical 34 ping to 120 or worse the disconnects coincided with my WoW disconnects . <p> My first thought was that I had a bad router . I replaced my Linksys WRT54G router with a Linksys WRT610N . I am running 3 computers on my network . 2 wired and 1 wireless . 2 mainly internet browsing and World of Warcraft , 1 internet browsing and skype . I replaced my router and hooked it up . I did n't see any further decline in my service ( mind you my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010 the problem continued to happen but the disconnects were more frequent . Where I was never getting disconnect during the middle of the day , I would encounter lag spikes on the order of 1-2 per hour , and a disconnect every hour or so . During peak times I would notice disconnects as often as every 10minutes . With latencies in the 900ms to 5k ms . My connection to my ventrilo server would disconnect me accordingly and display pings in excess of 15k . <p> I thought maybe my cable modem was bad . So I went out and bought a Motorola Surfboard Xtreme Docsis 3.0 compatible cable modem . I got it registered to my account . I immediately saw a return to my normal speeds pre-Nov 2009 . It was short lived , the problems with slow speed and disconnects returned in about a week . I began testing my internet connection by running simultaneous continous pings to set IP address on my LAN 192.168.1 . XXX snd to a random website ( most often www.google.com ) Pings to my other computer on my LAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pings to google would about every 2 minutes return destination unreachable . This coincided with my disconnects from World of Warcraft and or the lag spikes . I began to investigate what might be causing this . The first thing I came across was network congestion . So I taught myself how to install customer firmware on my router ( DD-WRT ) to help use its more advanced features for QoS and port forwarding . I set every computer on my LAN with a specific IP address and forwarded the appropriate ports for Skype which I set in its settings for a set port to 1 computer . And world of warcraft to my machine ( obviously I want the best connection ) . While this reduced my disconnects my speed was still low . I decided that yet again my router may be bad . So I purchased a 2nd Linksys WRT54G . <p> With this router I got even poor performance then my WRT610N . I put DD-WRT on the 2nd WRT54G which did n't help . So I figured maybe I had a bad network card ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering similar connection issues ) I replaced my network card with a Gigabit ethernet . I ran a direct line into port 1 on my router with the DD-WRT firmware I specified my MAC address as the one with Priority and I also specified a netmask for my World of Warcraft servers IP address and set it to exempt so that the traffic from my WoW server was given a full utilization of 100mb basically to consume my entire connection . I turned QoS on for skype and set the skype quality of service to 90% of my download and 90% of my upload with skpye on bulk status ( 15% up and 100% down ) . This made my disconnects less frequent , but my latency was still in the 1k range consistently even during non peak times . <p> By this time , I have already bought 2 WRT54G routers , 1 WRT610N router , 1 Surfboard Xtreme cable modem , 1 new PC ( I lied about the network card , I used it as an excuse to upgrade to a Windows 7 machine from Vista so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer attached to it . ) Also installed 2 new wireless cards in the wireless PC Netgears WNT311 ( I think that 's the model ) and a Linksys version . So I have spent roughly $800 of my own money to fix what I thought might be my equipment . ( Not to mention the monthly bill for Mediacom to maintain this poor service ) So that puts it from Nov 2009 to June 2010 I have spent about $1900 . <p> Finally in June 2010 I called mediacom to find out what was happening . They sent a service person out to my house . He said my spliter was old and was causing noise . He replaced the splitter and left ( no idea why you need to schedule a 4 hour window for me to sit in my house when you take 5 minutes to not listen to my troubles and simply say it was splitter ) . Obviously the split did NOTHING ! ! ! ! ! ! I am sure he had a valid reason for why he thought it might . But he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if my problem persisted . <p> Now a lot of you may ask why I did n't immediately call back and complain ... Well fortunately for Mediacom I have a job . A job that keeps me on the road 3 weeks a month . ( I am a district manager for a retail chain of stores and I oversee stores from CT to Iowa ) So when I got back and the problem was still happening , I did call back . They sent another technician out . This technician said , I have down signal noise . He replaced the drop line from my house to the box in my backyard . ( This line took about 6 weeks to get buried . I was polite enough to call back to remind them they had n't buried it and that I was tired of having to duck around it while mowing ) . During this time again I was on the road . I called back because the problem still was not fixed . <p> This went back and forth until Sept 2010 when I began calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue got resolved . I had several more technicians visit my house and maintenance teams to review the outside line situation . In September the problem got even worse . From Nov 09 to Sept 10 I was consistently getting results from Speedtest.net of 11mb down and 1-2mb up . Decent speeds by my latency was still high . I switched servers to a less populated server ( yes I updated my netmask for that server ) latency was the same as the other server even though I went from a physical server located Chicago to one located in AZ somewhere ) My disconnects got worse . I could n't play world of warcraft without lag spikes every 30secs . Disconnects every few minutes . <p> More technicians where sent . By this time it was October and FINALLY someone decided to elevate my ticket ( I found out later that basically means they have a tech come out and say stuff he thought I might not understand and rightly so I did n't understand most of it , but some I did and he was trying to confuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen . ) He could n't find anything wrong with my connection other then RF leak in my back yard so he said he replace the line from the box in my backyard to the " head " I think he called it . I was like AWESOME I am gon na have my old internet back ..... W R O N G ! It did NOTHING . So I called to complain again . This time that technicians boss ( supposedly ) was called to handle the issue . Here is how he handled it ( Ring Ring ... goes to my voicemail ... Mr XXXXXX I understand you are having connection and speed issues with your internet . We see you have a Motorola cable modem , we do n't support Docsis 3.0 ( which is true , though Docsis 3.0 is backwards compatible with the Mediacom Docsis 2.1 network ) You will have to reinstall the modem that we provided to you . Click ! So I did exactly that . I installed the modem as I still had it , I never turned it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured I would turn it in if and when I decided to cancel my service ( I know like who would want to leave mediacom ? ! ? .... Me now ! ) I installed that modem got it registered . <p> Low and behold my disconnect issues from World of warcraft went away ... Success ! ! ! NOT REALY ! ! My latency was still 1k to 2k ms I just did n't disconnect any more . During non peak times I would get 200-300ms . My I noticed my speed was DRASTICALLY reduced . Remember in Sept 2010 with the high latency and frequent disconnects and my Surfboard modem managed a consistant 11mb down and 1mb up ( which coincided with my 12/1mb service ) So I called back the technician who so expertly told me that I had the wrong cable modem ... Installed and working ( more or less ) for 9 months and told him I installed my old one again and that my service got worse .... To my surprise I never received a follow up phone call . This is now into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them know my service was worse then ever . Consistently testing ( speedtest.net at the Denver , Chicago , St Louis and Kansas City servers ) a maximum speed of 4.9mb down and .66 mb up to an average of 2.99down and .48mb up . <p> So now this is middle October 2010 and they tell me that my maintainence ticket is still open and that they will elevate it again to a supervisor who will contact me within 24hours . I never receive a call . I call back , I get told I still have an open ticket to the maintanence team and my ticket will be elevated and someone will be out within 24 hours to fix it . No one shows up . I call back . I get told its an outside of my house issue and therefore there is no need for me to wait at my house and someone will be out within 48 hours to fix the issue . This has taken me up to October 28th . Still no resolution . I called on Nov1 and got told yet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nov 3rd when it was n't better , got told open ticket repair in 24hours . Nov 4th no improvement . Called again got told open ticket will be out tomorrow to repair . <p> So basically 1 year to the month later I have the worst internet I have ever had . I have had to call dozens of times . Spend many days away from work to sit in my house waiting for technicians who sometimes never came . ( When I called to complain about that , they dismiss it as , there was no need for you to be there it was an outside line issue ....

Since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .9 I can understand how this may be overwhelming my connection at times , but when I am the only person on my upload is 200kbps which is a tiny portion of my upload and I still notice a high latency .

Polling the modem on our end , I am showing that the downstream rx signal is falling out of range , which will cause the problems you have been running into with your internet and Tivo service . Since the splitter is connecting both the modem and Tivo , instead of bypassing this and retesting the connection , our best option would be setting up a trouble call and having a tech out to take a look at this . You can replace the splitter to see if this resolves the problem as well . These can be picked up for free at the local office , or you can get one at any store that carries hardware such as Home Depot or Walmart .

I did notice that the main box in my backyard for the area is n't closed up like it should be so I do n't know if that exposure could be a problem .

For the most part it was around 4-5ms , but when the connection drop or hiccuped or whatever you want to call it , the ping jumped up between 100-200 for about 1 or 2 times .

If we can get an earlier date , we will gladly let you know . <p> It seems to me this issue is directly related to mediacoms cabling activity overnight Jul 21 . Service for multiple customers was out early the next morning before construction began . <p> Thus I feel Mediacom should fix the issue they caused immediately . Not 5-6 days later . <p> With all due respect , this level of service , while typical for the cable industry , is pathetic . A company with a true sense of service would have someone out here fixing the problem that they caused right away . You guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - ( <p> We will do all we can to get someone out earlier , and if we can accommodate that we will definitely let you know .

Apparently the signal in the new run is weak . He put an amplifier in my line and all is well again . He did warn that once the construction is complete the signal may be " too strong " and will require another visit . <p> It would be nice if Mediacom would test these things , you know , right after they did cable moves instead of just assuming all is well and calling the job done . I know , crazy request . But one can dream ....

Are you telling me there are more installation costs ? That does n't seem right , either that or when I payed him I was actually paying for the internet speeds at that time ? But that still would n't be right because on my previous statement I was still charged 44.95 for internet . <p> Last question then . I did have credits correct ? And they were used ? It should have been around $90 if I remember correctly due to all the running around we had to do with trying to figure out exactly what was wrong with trying to get the install . <p> I remember making a call about a $6 statement leftover from these credits , but ca n't seem to find this statement .

The first appointment the contractor had came down and told me that we were quite far from the signal and it probably would n't be the greatest .

I/My Family have been watching and subscribing to the channel ever since it was offered . The idea of HBOGo is brilliant , however , IT NEVER WORKS . I am not talking about logging in , I can do that every time no problem , ( Not allowing us to stay logged in is kind of a pain ) . I am not talking about finding shows or movies or anything to watch . I am specifically talking about the video quality of EVERY show/movie I have tried to watch . Normally I do n't mind if something goes from 1080p ( HD ) to 480p ( DVD ) quality , I understand that with many people trying to watch the same thing at once it can slowing things down . <p> What absolutely drives me crazy is when the quality goes so far below anything acceptable ( below VHS quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very dark blur over the entire screen ) . Normally if something like this happens ( Which I have never seen on any other website/app ) I would pause and let the video buffer until the video is loaded properly and I was able to watch uninterrupted by such low quality . But with HBOGo I am unable to do that . There is nothing ... absolutely nothing I can do to adjust the video quality . I have checked my internet speeds and they read higher than average , ( 24mb/s download , and 5mb/s upload according to http : //www.speedtest.net/ ) . After spending many frustrating days and nights trying to make this better I think I have found a solution along with a the root of the problem . <p> The biggest problem I have found is that you seem to still be using Flash as your video player . Flash is dead , and the loads of forums that complain about HBOGo 's video quality should be enough proof . But if not , Flash also lacks adaptive bitrate streaming , instead they use their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quality while in the middle of watching something . With Adaptive Bitrate Streaming and the use of an encoder , there is little to no buffer time and most importantly , video quality stays the same throughout the entire show/movie/video you are watching . Adaptive Bitrate Streaming also works with a multitude codecs , Flash does n't . ( I believe flash really only works with itself , I could be wrong . ) Microsoft Silverlight is a good example of Adaptive Bitrate Streaming . <p> I am begging you to please adapt this streaming process , It is the only thing holding you guys back . <p> Thank you , Chris <p> Last Edit : December 20 , 2012 , 01:04:27 PM by MediacomDallas + <p> Logged <h> MediacomBill <p> Thank you Chris for sharing your ideas about HBOGO .

If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been contacted with the appropriate compensation themoon ill see you in court . <p> Hello Bradriggs , thank you for reaching out to us through the forums . I am sorry to hear about the ongoing issues you have been experiencing with your service , and we will be more than happy to help you with this . Looking over your modem , all signal levels are currently well within the healthy range , and I show you are bonding to all available upstream and downstream channels in your area . When testing the speeds , are you doing so through a wireless or wired connection to the modem ? If wireless , can you directly connect a PC via ethernet to the modem and run a test at http : **29;546;TOOLONG , then link us the results on here ? I also show that you are scheduled to have a technician come out on 8/22 as well . We will monitor this work order from our end and follow up with you on here once we show that it has been completed . Be sure to keep us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you to get this corrected . 
@@40218882 @218882/ <p> I recently terminated my cable TV service with Mediacom due to a myriad of poor customer service examples over the last 20 years . I am keeping Mediacom ? s high speed internet because it is the only service available . After I cancelled the service on 7/11/11 , Mediacom said they had to schedule a service call so they can disconnect my cable service . The appointment was for 7/13/11 , and we were told the work would be at the outside box . The technician never showed and rescheduled to cal to 7/20/11 . The technician never showed and rescheduled it to 7/27/11. we were told several times that we did not have to be home for this service call . Today we received a bill with the entire package of cable and internet . We called and were told that credit can not be given until the technician comes out and disconnect the cable tv . <p> This is just another example of incompetence and deceptive business practices . As long as the technician reschedules the appointment we will have to pay the $150 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service . <p> HERE IS YOUR WARNING ! If the technician doesn ? t show this time , I WILL FIND YOUR CEO ? s ADDRESS and try to rectify your deceptive business practices from the top down ! Also , I will file a complaint with the FCC regarding you deceptive business practices . THESE ARE NOT THREATS ? ? ? THEY ARE FACTS ! <p> I apologize for the tech not showing . I would be more than willing to resolve this matter for you . I can verify when the tech was originally scheduled and credit the account for the services if it was not disconnected properly and on time . I apologize if the person on the phone was confused about this . We have a system where we key stop bill dates 7 days after the disconnect is scheduled , so when a disconnect gets moved back ( we roll trouble calls and installs before disconnects ) the customer is n't charged for service they requested disconnected . It is possible this was n't keyed in properly and would be more than willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to DM me your telephone# or account# I can look into this now . <p> Since this involves making changes to an account , I will either need you to provide the phone# or account# on the account or let me have a rep call you whenever is convenient for you to verify the account . <p> I ca n't guarantee the disconnect will be worked . Service calls and installs are rolled prior to disconnects . This will also not reduce the bill for the days it should have been disconnected for you . I can resolve this in a matter of seconds , I just need to verify the account to make sure we are on the same page and make sure the amounts are what it should . If you could PM me this information , I will do this now . <p> Okay , you are more than welcome to email me your phone# to **30;577;TOOLONG and I can have someone call you now or I can PM you a telephone# you can reach me on . If you do n't want to do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-866-321-1667 and I can note on the account what needs to be done , or you can ask for me directly . I would love to help in any way possible I just need to verify the account . <p> I will wait until Wednesday night to talk to Mediacom , if he does n't show . So I know you can make a note on the service order . I live in LeRoy IL , and my house number is 107 . That should be enough info along with the email tied to my log on i 'd to verify my address .

@@40218884 @218884/ <p> What is happening is , my internet will be fine , but as soon as I start to play video games , watch YouTube videos , watch streams on Twitch , or do any other kind of bandwidth-intensive activity , my internet speed starts to plummet . Back in August , the quality of the internet would just slowly decrease over time , but right now it feels like it goes from max speed ( about 20-25 Mbps/down ) to 1 Mbps/down in a matter of seconds . I 'll be watching streams , playing games , and everything is fine . But then all of a sudden , the stream stops , and my games disconnect me . This only started happening sometime last week . <p> To fix this , I power-cycle the modem , and all is well for another day . Then the next day , the same thing happens . I come home from work , start up the gaming/streams for a couple hours , and my internet just crashes down to 1 Mbps/down and starts kicking me off of stuff and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also experience heavy packet loss when this happens , about 7-8% of packets are dropped when trying to ping something like Google . <p> I tried to do some troubleshooting from my end on this issue . What Mediacom had me do last time was unplug my splitter and hook the modem directly to the wall , so I did that last night , but it did not make a difference because it happened again tonight about an hour ago . <p> Rather than power-cycling the modem to fix this issue again tonight , I 'm going to leave it like it is in hopes you all can take a look at it from your end and see what the issue is . <p> As a side note : In my troubleshooting , I have found that when my internet starts acting up , the modem reports that one of the channels has completely lost its power level and signal to noise ratio . I 've taken screenshots over the last 3 nights of when it happened : <p> All other channels seem to be reporting normal power levels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I should try next or let me know what you all see on your end .

Thank you ! <p> Hello jr07 , thank you for reaching out to us on here about the internet issues you have been experiencing . We will gladly help you with this . Looking over your modem , I am seeing an issue with the downstream snr and rx spiking out of the acceptable limit . This is more than likely the cause of the issues you have been experiencing on your end . Since you have already bypassed your splitter and are still seeing issues , we will want to have a technician out on site to get this repaired for you . Would you like me to get this scheduled ? <p> Thanks for the speedy reply , Allie ! Getting a technician scheduled to come out would be great . If you could make it happen , an appointment for this weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unavailable , I understand . It 's difficult for me to take off work unless the technician can call me and give me 10 minutes notice before arriving at my house . If no techs are available this weekend , I can do any day next week with the exception of Tuesday the 26th and Saturday the 30th , as I will be out of town those days . Edit : Sorry , I forgot to mention my available times . Any time from 7:00am - 1:00pm , or from 5:00pm - 8:00pm . <p> In the meantime , do you mind if I keep power-cycling my modem to get me by until then ? <p> You 're very welcome ! You can definitely continue to power cycle on your end . You might also want to see if moving the modem to another coaxial outlet helps as well . I will send you a PM with the soonest time frames we have available . <p> Is a technician still scheduled to come out and see me tomorrow between 10am - 12pm ? I just want to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those auto-dialer calls . Thanks ! <p> The Mediacom tech came over to my house today at 10:00am . I am posting the result of what happened in the event that it might help other users on this forum . <p> After showing him the screenshots that I had taken of my connection dropping , which included speed tests and modem stats , he wanted to see what channel my modem was running on . He connected to my wifi using his cell phone to check , and only stated that it was strange because I was " not the only one on that channel . " He did n't explain what this meant , so I 'm not sure if this is relevant to my case . He told me he was going to call tier 2 tech support to see what they saw on their end , but he changed his mind and ended up not calling them . Again , I 'm not sure if he realized something else was wrong and this was no longer relevant , but I 'm just reporting what I heard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrel that was connected to the cable that ran through my wall . He asked me how old it was and I told him I was n't sure , because it 's been there ever since I moved in over 6 years ago . He removed the barrel and shook it , and it made a little clicking sound when he shook it . He told me it was n't supposed to do that and that might be why my connection was randomly dropping down . He also noticed that my splitter , which was currently unhooked and set off to the side , was gold . He said that gold splitters do n't work well with Mediacom 's equipment , so he went out to his truck to get a replacement barrel and splitter . <p> He replaced the barrel and splitter at the wall connection . We ran some speed tests and they came back fine , but I will have to watch it over the next few days to make sure my connection does n't drop the speed down to 1 Mbps/down again . He said if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnecting the splitter again , even though it 's Mediacom 's splitter , because the type of cable that is ran through my house does n't work as well with splitters , as opposed to the newer cabling that is ran through newer houses . While he was out at my house , we also checked the coaxial barrel in the other room that I sometimes connect my modem to . We found that it also clicked when it was shaken , meaning it needed to be replaced , so he put a new barrel on that line as well . <p> The final thing the tech talked to me about was the cabling that was in my house . He said it was an older style cabling that Mediacom has gone away from - they have a newer type of cabling that is more reliable and they 've been using it in new installations . He said if my issues continue to persist with and without the splitter , then the next form of action would be to talk to my landlord about fishing the old cabling out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newer cable into the house . Hopefully it does n't come down to this , because I have a feeling my landlord might deny that request and switch internet providers . <p> In conclusion , here is what was done at my house today : - Coaxial barrel replacements in living room and bedroom . ( Reason : The old ones clicked when they were shaken , which they should not do , indicating they are somewhat faulty. ) - My golden splitter was replaced with a Mediacom splitter . ( Reason : Gold splitters are not 100% reliable with Mediacom 's service. ) - Mediacom tech checked my modem 's channel , but only commented on how strange it was . He did not follow up with what this meant or if there was any cause for concern . <p> My next troubleshooting steps , should the issue come back : <p> - Unhook Mediacom 's splitter and connect the modem directly to the line in the wall . <p> If the issue still persists after that : <p> - I need to consult with my landlord to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new cabling . I have a feeling he will deny this request and instead switch internet providers , which I hope this is not the case , because I do like Mediacom . <p> I will monitor my connection over the next two weeks and report back here on my results , whether they 're bad or good . That way everyone will know what the resolution was and can hopefully learn from the experience if they are having a similar issue . <p> Hello jr07 ; thanks for sending this update ! Please do let us know if further troubleshooting is needed . Likely what the tech was referring to was the Wi-Fi channel setting in your router , there may be a high number of networks in the area using the same channel . You may be able to log in to the router and run a wireless survey to see how many networks in the area are on the same channel . If there are a lot , changing the channel setting could help reduce interference . <p> Royal , would what you said about the wireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected wirelessly ? <p> I 've had problems twice since the tech came out to look at my connection , both times were with the new splitter he gave me to put on the line . The next step , according to him , would be to get my landlord to hire a contractor to remove all the old wiring in the walls , and have Mediacom come in and run the new wiring . Is this really my only other option ? <p> I 'm actually still experiencing the issue right this moment and will wait to reboot my modem , so you guys can take a look at it . I 'm getting about 1Mbps/down on Speedtest . My upload speeds seem to be unaffected . Here 's what my modem says right now : <p> The wireless signal would n't effect your PC since it 's not wireless , no . I did look over the historical levels on the modem and I 'm still seeing the downstream levels are intermittently spiking out of range along with the downstream errors . These spikes appear to be intermittent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results from a hard or wireless PC ? Also , to ensure the signal issues get resolved I 'd recommend having another technician out . We can also escalate this to your area management team so we can ensure the appropriate steps are taken to achieve a resolution . Just let me know if you 'd like me to schedule this appointment for you ! <p> The speed tests were ran from my computer , which is hard-wired into my router , and the router is hard-wired into the modem . The modem is hooked into a 2-way splitter ( the same splitter that the Mediacom tech replaced when he was here a few weeks ago ) . That splitter connects the modem and my TV into the wall . <p> When the splitter is removed and my modem is directly connected to the wall , things seem to be fine ( I say ' seem to be ' because I have n't done enough thorough testing with this method ) . But then it leaves the problem of me not being able to have the TV in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split the connection off like I used to do in years past . <p> The reason I 'm telling you all of this is because I feel like if another technician comes out to look at this , they might blame it on the splitter/cabling in the walls and say that I ca n't have a splitter connected in my house unless the house is re-cabled , which is what the last technician said . I guess I just want some reassurance that the next technician who comes out will be able to fix the signals WITH the splitter being connected . And again , I have n't done enough testing without the splitter to know if that method is even completely fixed . So maybe I should take some more time to test this before a technician comes out , so when they do , I can tell them that it does n't matter whether there 's a splitter or not . <p> I just finished disconnecting the splitter and reconnecting the modem directly to the wall . What do you see on your end now ? Maybe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up this way ? My speed tests are back to normal ( 22/Mbps down ) and here is what my modem says now : <p> Thanks for that information ! Even with the splitter bypassed the downstream levels are too low . Typically we want the downstream levels between +7 and -7 . Downstream levels outside of that range could cause resets and errors which can lead to slow speeds . Since that 's the case I 'm thinking there could definitely be an issue with the wiring . I 'm unable to guarantee that form my end though since I 'm at the location but outdated cabling can definitely cause problems , especially if it 's damaged . Would you like to hold off on the technician for now and speak to our landlord about this or would you like to get this scheduled ? <p> So there 's no other alternatives to fix this , the cabling HAS to be replaced for the issue to be fixed ? If so , yes , I will need to speak to my landlord . However , I 'm 95% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quite like Mediacom , despite the issues I 've been having , so I really hope there 's something else that can be done for a fix instead of re-cabling the house . Let me know if there 's anything else we can try . If not , I 'll discuss this with my landlord and see what he decides . Thank you ! <p> If the technician saw an issue with the internal wiring then I would assume that 's going to cause some problems . I can schedule for another technician to come out and ensure there is n't anything on the outside of the home that may have been missed from the first visit . There would n't be a charge for this visit either .

This honestly peeved me off as I used to enjoy your old system and the increased speeds you provided over my other providers . However even with your increased speeds I went with the lower speed internet . Why ? Because I refuse to support a company that uses this form of data capping ... Why would you want to stifle the amount of data used by your customers ? you would think you would want people to use your service more and increase its popularity . Isnt controlling the speed at which said data is sent and received enough control ? Agh .. it 's just so frustrating to see you guys go down such an annoying path . Internet in the us is expensive enough as it is without worrying about the shenanigans of data caps ... <p> Why not go back to the plan that many of your customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happy customers . <p> Thank you for reaching out to us about this . We do offer levels of service that have different usage allowances , but we certainly do n't implement data caps . A data usage allowance differs from a cap because a residential subscriber can continue to use more data during a billing cycle without violating the terms of service . We are more than happy to work with customers that consistently exceed their usage allowance to find a better plan . We offer affordable options to increase the usage allowance which also increases the speed , and we typically waive the first overage charge in order for us to work with the customer to see what we can do to prevent it from happening in the future . We appreciate your input , and we will forward this to management for consideration . <p> To me a data limit is essentially a way to get more money . I know they say that a very small percentage of users exceed that limit , but that 's mainly because they are now paying more for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then why would there be a need to limit someones usage at all ? The lower packages with the 300 or less data allowance are only for the older customers who are only using the service for email or browsing news sites . Any person that uses their net for Netflix , Youtube , TwitchTV , music/video downloads and the like , they are forced into the higher packages just so they wo n't go over their usage allowance . It 's a very shady and unethical way to get more money from the customers . For me , I am at the highest package available in my area . Not because I need the advertised speeds ( which I have n't gotten close to for 7 months now , ) but because we do n't have cable anymore as we cancelled our Mediacom cable service . My 2 year old son watches all his cartoons via Netflix . Any package lower than the highest and we would go over the data limit every month . I know this because it has happened in the past , which forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant overage charges each month . I , along with pretty much anybody that you would ask , agree that data limits are very bad for customers . An easy way to think about it is that data limits have no benefit whatsoever to the customer , they can only hurt the customer . However , data limits will never hurt the company that implements them , it will only benefit them . That about sums it up . <p> I do not frequent these forums but I saw this thread and thought I would add to it : I 'm sure they 've spent a significant amount of money investing in the speculative limits , the legal work , the technical tracking , and the clerical in order to add data overage charges into contracts . It 's been implemented for a while , and is unlikely to change . Although , where I live no other ISP has implementation such a thing , and I am seriously considering switching and pulling the plug on cable anyway . Is n't that what these companies are afraid of ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other services anyone wants ? <p> That said , I find I very much dislike overage charges on the whole . Imagine if some people were only allowed to watch an average of 20 minutes of television every day , and every 10 minutes beyond this they were charged extra ? Why does it make sense to limit one and not the other ? The television service is " buffet " style , why not the internet , as that is the way it has been ? Heck , even my Tivo provided by Mediacom uses the internet to download the guide , access my Netflix account , etc . <p> I work from home fairly frequently and have many internet connected devices ( 20 ) with lots of software , all of which needs to stay frequently updated . This means I do tend to ride fairly close to the overage limit for my current plan . I dislike that an overage charge is one more thing I need to worry about/check on . The billing statement is often confusing enough , changing frequently enough so that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I really hope they become an internet pipeline . Then maybe these cable companies could start being enticed to increase their internet speeds by putting up fiber optic lines . Even now people REALLY want fast internet .

This is all the fault of disconnected " pun intended " bosses who simply do n't listen to what their customers want.Also did n't  the government funding a national fiber internet plan .

@@40218897 @218897/ <h> Business Internet Questions <h> 1 . Do I need a static IP address ? <p> Customers who plan to run a server ( email or otherwise ) , will need to look at utilizing at least ( 1 ) static IP option . The only way to run reverse DNS is through a static IP address . This device will need to be visible to the modem and will not work behind a router or firewall. <h> 2 . Does Mediacom Business have static IP addresses available to business customers ? <h> 3 . What do I need to know about setting up Mediacom Businesses ' static IP service ? <p> The customer is responsible for any equipment beyond the cable modem . Mediacom Business does not setup or configure customer routers or firewalls &amp; support currently stops at the cable modem . It may be a good idea to have a member of your IT department or technical support on site the day of the install . Customers with multiple static IP addresses will share the provisioned bandwidth . The total available bandwidth will not exceed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the account . <h> 4 . Why does Mediacom Business MAC bind their addressees ? <p> Due to the nature of the cable network , Mediacom Business chooses to validate permanent IP addresses on the cable network with the CPE mac address of the connected equipment . This provides another layer of security to help prevent against malicious attacks including denial of service , IP theft and other threats to Mediacom Business ' networks . <h> 5 . Is there a difference between residential and business service from Mediacom ? <p> Yes . While both residential and Business Internet operate over the same reliable digital network , Mediacom Business Internet is designed for meeting the broadband capacity and features relative to business needs . <h> 6 . Will my installation take long ? <p> Mediacom Business Internet can install and provision services much faster than our competition and with little or no downtime since we control all network elements . <h> 7 . Does Mediacom guarantee the Mediacom Business Internet speed ? <p> At Mediacom Business , our customers and our integrity are vital to our success . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not guarantee that situations beyond our control may interfere with your connection speed . <p> All you need to do is contact your local Mediacom Business Account Executive . Upgrades can be made very quickly . <h> 9 . Is my Mediacom Business Internet connection shared ? <p> There is no such thing as a dedicated connection , as claimed by some providers . Since all connections are shared , providing a high-speed Internet experience depends on your service provider 's network capacity , scalability and overall architecture .

Our Hybrid Fiber Coax network ( HFC ) is highly scalable , enabling expansion of available bandwidth to meet increasing business demands without costly equipment or network upgrades. <h> 12 . How does Mediacom Business technology differ from the technology that my local telephone company uses to offer DSL service ? <p> DSL technology is delivered over copper , twisted-pair wiring used for telephone service that was installed decades ago for low-speed , low-capacity voice communications ; in contrast Mediacom Business ' state-of-the-art broadband network was designed to deliver powerful , two-way interactive services . By meeting the stringent standards of Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification ( DOCSIS ) , Mediacom Business HFC specifications provide user data privacy across the cable network by encrypting and authenticating data traffic flow to and from the cable modem and the Mediacom Business ' HFC network . Our cable modem services are highly reliable because the architecture provides multiple paths to each of Mediacom Business ' nodes serving 1,000 or fewer customers . As such , the self-healing distribution offers the customer a continuous , secure connection to the Internet. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Internet Message Access Protocol ) is a newer and modern alternative to the POP3 protocol . Unlike POP3 , the IMAP allows the user to work with their messages in both online and offline modes . The IMAP-capable email client programs retrieve the messages ' headers from the server and can store local copies of the messages in a local ( temporary ) cache . All the messages are left on the server until the user deletes them . This mechanism allows multiple email clients to access a single mailbox and is often used for corporate/business e-mails , e.g. , sales@company-domain.com . <h> Business Phone Questions <h> 1 .

We can not cancel or make changes to accounts based on online contact , but if you call in to 1-866-452-4747 you can set a specific date for the disconnection to take place . I can also arrange to have someone call you directly to get things started . Once that is set up , you can return eth modem with its power cord to the local office , we can have a tech come by and pick it up , or I can send prepaid shipping materials to get the modem shipped back to the warehouse . Just let me know if you 'd like me to arrange a phone call or send the return shipping , and I will get on it right away ! <p> We usually request the call to cancel be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disconnected due to scheduling a technician to come out and turn off the services at the tap . If you call in on April 7th , you can request that the disconnect be scheduled for the 14th.

The box never came . <p> I downgraded my internet service to what was supposed to be the basic service back in May which I was under the impression was 12-15 mbps . Got my bill today and I 'm being charged for Prime Plus . Have been ever since I downgraded my service . <p> I call in , the woman on the phone is absolutely zero help . I wanted to discuss my plan and why I was still being charged close to $80 every month for basic internet service . It took her close to 3 tries to finally answer that Prime Plus HSI on my bill correlated to the Prime Plus internet speed of 30 D/L . Awesome , thanks for understanding my pretty simply phrased English question of " What is Prime Plus HSI , and why is it on my bill ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I wanted to speak with a supervisor . I told her I wanted to speak with somebody that could answer my questions as I felt I had already reached the depth of her understanding . I then got to sit on hold for 5 minutes , at least I think it was hold . There was no sound coming from the phone at all . She comes back , tells me her supervisor is ready to take my call , transfers me , and I sit on hold for another 2 minutes . Makes sense . <p> Supervisor " Mark " answers . He shows that I requested to be dropped to the Prime Plus several months ago . Not sure how that mix up occurred when " basic plan " in my head means nothing special .

I cancelled my service almost 3 months ago , you never sent a box , and YOU 'RE going to charge ME ? Great customer relationship building , really . I 'm dumbfounded with " Mark " at this point . <p> Next up we get into pricing for Prime internet speeds . Website says it 's 19.99 for a current customer with $10 added on after the first year . American math says that 's $29.99 . " Mark " says that 's 49.99 . I do n't care what it is , but your site does n't reflect " Mark 's " math and should probably be changed to be accurate when I fill out my address correctly and inform the website that I 'm a current subscriber .

Charging $100 for your terrible technicians to come install a cable box incorrectly , try to steal the HDMI cable that comes with it , or tell me that the modem " gets faster the more you use it " is a sure way to lose a customer . <p> Thanks again for the phenomenal service , I try to steer every person I meet away from your service as I ca n't stand the indecency with which your customers are treated .

The $19.95/month price is for customers looking to add that line of service that do n't already subscribe to a internet package . As explained in the Terms &amp; Restrictions . You will not be charged for the equipment unless it 's not returned . If you would like I can send out a UPS box .

Few household have only one set anymore and you ca n't even buy a standard definition television . Even if a new television 's digital tuner CAN get some Family Cable channels in standard definition , why would anyone want to risk damaging their new LCD sets by displaying a mostly standard definition picture ?

I called , set up an appointment , got it up an running . However it was only running at 75 down/10 up . Half of what I was told I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a maintenance tech to work on the outside . I was told if it was n't fixed in 48 hours to call back .

I 'm sorry to hear you 're having trouble with your service ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last week with a T3 timeout , one of the instances included 5 timeout in an hour on the 10th . Usually , timeouts are caused by a signal-to-noise ratio issue , but that is not shown in your modem and signal history . The upstream transmit is currently a bit high and shows some spikes , maintaining high for periods of time in the history . Have you been able to try a hard reset of the modem or check for splitters on the coax cable line to the modem ? <p> Thanks for that information . Do you know if the coaxial cable from the modem is leading to a splitter , amplifier , or surge protector ? If so would you be able to temporarily bypass them ? When following the coaxial cable could you also check for any damages to the cable and ensure the connections are securely fastened ? Be sure to keep us posted here ! <p> All of the basic stuff has been checked numerous times . Look at the notes on the account , you 'll see this . You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same issue in the past 2 years . <p> This is n't my first attempt at resolving this issue . Need something more than the basic ' has this been done here ' , obviously . It 's all been done , it 's all been tried , and it appears to work for a few months , then just stops working . <p> Hello twhiting9276 and thank you for following up with us on our Forums . I am seeing some intermittent signal issues in the last week that affect your Upstream SNR , Up Tx , Downstream CCER , Down SNR , and Down Rx . Since all of the basic troubleshooting has been done , and there are no splitters , amplifiers , or surge protectors to bypass , and if you have tried a new coax cable between the wall and the modem , I would recommend scheduling a technician to look into these issues . Also , I started a " voice session " that monitors your signals much more frequently so we have a higher chance of catching intermittent signal issues . This test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to wait until the voice session is over to schedule a technician , that would be fine . Alternatively , we would be more than happy to schedule a technician for you before the session expires . Please let us know if you would like to schedule a technician to look at these intermittent signal issues .

@@40218927 @218927/ <p> For the last few months ( Honestly since around last August ) . I have been having some serious issues with connection quality ( I have the 20Mbit service ) . <p> First of all , our connection consistently under performs . I realize that I am located in a city , and there are issues with crowding of the lines , but if you can not provide a certain service level consistently , you should n't offer it as a product . Generally our speeds are around 11-14Mbit , which is what I got usually before I upgraded to the 20Mbit service . <p> The second problem is a sneaky one that every Mediacom representative I have talked to denies exists . When doing anything online that requires a connection lasting more than 2-3 minutes , the connection is reset , and I am unable to continue whatever it is I am doing ( Connection is reset , I do not loose connection to the internet , but whatever specific task I am doing stops ) . For instance , if I try to watch a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , and then cease downloading . When I get to the unbuffered portion I am forced to refresh the page , and jog to the part where it stopped . Netflix also presents issues . When watching a movie , I am forced to get up and refresh the page every 5 minutes or so ( So around 20 times over the course of a movie ) . And the third glaring instance has come up recently , as I am currently in Europe and have tried to use Skype to video conference with my family at home . Over about three minutes , the connection quality will continuously degrade until the call drops completely ( Video , and voice communication only calls as well ) . I know it is not my connection here as I have tested the calls and experienced the same problems from several locations , and when I do Skype calls to colleagues on other types of connections in the same city I live in , but not using Mediacom services , the calls are fine ( Actually far better quality , on supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network snooping to see if there are reset packets being sent , or to test packet loss during these issues , but have been unsuccessful in finding a reason . The only thing I can think of is that Mediacom is using some sort of QoS System that is snipping connections . <p> Other services that this problem effects:FTP Connections ( Uploads of large websites , or files are impossible on my home connection due to the connections dropping ) Videogame updates ( Anything served by Torrent protocols specifically ( IE World of Warcraft , League of Legends , etc ) ) Online Multi Player ( Every few minutes in League of Legends there are huge latency spikes followed by a few seconds of dropped connection , and then connection comes back ) . <p> This is quite a ridiculous problem , and I have not had issues on any other service provider I have had service with in the past . The problem is serious enough that I have considered moving to the next town over to have the option of getting Verizon FIOS , and not having to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technicians at my house on multiple occasions over the last few months , and they all claim there are no issues with my connection . When I call in to phone support , they parrot the usual " No problems reported in your area " , and try to set me up for a support visit weeks in the future . <p> Hopefully one of your fine service people can get to the bottom of my problem . I 'm tired of not being able to work from home , watch Netflix , or otherwise utilize the fast internet connection I pay so dearly for . <p> I 've checked my own equipment , gone through several modems , routers , NIC cards , and replaced wiring in several rooms of my house , so the issue is certainly not on my end . The sky-wire from my house to the poll has been replaced on four occasions , several " signal boosters " have also been supposedly as well , though all techs claim there is no signal degradation . I wonder if there is a problem with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Burst of high bandwidth slowly throttled down ) and whatever handles the throttling is not correctly handling the connection , hence the loss . I have had no issues on Comcast internet connections with their equivalent technology . <p> I am in Europe for another week , and then I will be home again to provide any hardware specific information that is needed . But I will be able to provide account information immediately . <p> I apologize for the issues with the service . I can assure you there is no connection snipping going on for your connection . I use the service at home with Netflix , Hulu and many others and have not had any kind of similar issue , so I do n't think that will be your problem . It does sound to be an issue with signal/bandwidth or packet interference that we can test . I can take a look over your connection if you would like to send me your telephone# or account# , but without you being at home it limits what we can test ( we will need to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line , along with some others ) , but if you can send me your telephone# or account# I will check everything from here . <p> Message 2:Hey there , just an update to this . I am back in the US , and have a bit of free time this next week if you guys need me to test things . <p> Let me know what you need me to do . The problem still seems to be happening ( YouTube , Netflix , Ventrillo , Skype ) I 'm about to start a game here in a few minutes , so I 'll see if it 's happening there as well . <p> Message 2:To confirm , gaming is effectively out of the question . Was able to play for about five minutes , and then connection was severed in such a way as to render me unable to reconnect to the game , dispite having full internet connectivity . I had to completely shutdown the game , and relaunch to reconnect , at which point it had been about five minutes from the last disconnect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three times to try to rejoin my game . <p> So to recap : The highspeed internet connection that I pay your company to provide me is effectively unusable for any of the things I care about : Video streaming , gaming , or communication . <p> This problem needs to be rectified immediately , or I will be seeking another provider . <p> Logged <h> MediacomTom <p> Now that you are are able to troubleshoot we can continue . Your modem has no problems showing on this side . I am showing a solid signal and zero utilization issues for the area . Your modem has a large amount of data throughput for the month , so if you are using a router and have any P2P services running on a PC it may be throttling your other connections through the same router . <p> Please bypass your Belkin router and test if the connection is the same . <p> I obviously have n't been using P2P this month , and the only other roommate that knows how to use P2P , said he has n't been either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P2P protocols though for updates , and gameplay , but game-data could n't be considered a " large amount " of data throughput . The other roommates use YouTube , and music streaming ( Pandora ) quite a bit though , so maybe that accounts for the large amount . We currently have 6 people living in the same house , so I suppose I would expect us to be using above the average amount of data throughput . <p> Alright we are directly connected to the modem , we 're going to play around with it and see what happens . The Belkin we are using was purchased last October . <p> We have some logs of some ping tests my roommate has been doing , would you like us to send those ? Looks like about every 800 seconds or so the connection drops .

I made several adjustment on my side including switching to PCM audio and even switched to HDMI audio instead of Toslink but I 'm still seeing a issue . <p> The audio is just a little slow , mouths move and then you hear the voice(s) . <p> I 'm seeing right now on 796 StarzHD and also 201 Dest ( Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel 671 H2HD and it 's off too including recording of the same channel from prior this month . <p> I know that there can be some issues like this while the digital transition is underway ; however , we 're bringing this to the headend technicians so this can be looked into more closely . I 've sent across a series of signals that will reset the connection and attempt to sync everything up , but if this a more widespread issue from the headend itself , then this may do little good . Let me know if you see this improve this morning at all , due to this syncing signal . <p> The audio sync is just slightly off , the first time I noticed it the worse was with my surround sound system which involved decoding the Dolby digital , as I had just replaced the re I ever with a new one I was beating my head against the wall , there can be some millisecond delay in dolby decoding which is why higher end decoder include a hdmi input to slightly buffer the video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher end AV system can adjust the audio sync which works but the problem with that it 's not a standard adjustment for all channels , some require a 20th ms adjustment while others require less , it 's not a easy procedure to adjust this everything a channel is changed as typically the adjustment is only has to be changed once . <p> It was only after dealing with my surround sound system did I then go back and realize that just standard audio over hdmi had a issue too so the next step I 'm going to use component audio to see if if that better with no audio processing on my side . <p> Sounds good , while we check some things on our end you can check some things there and see if you find anything else out . One thing you did mention was using an audio system . Have you tried completely bypassing this yet to see if you still see the audio sync problems with a direct connection ? <p> It is Monday morning 7:05EST and the problem continues , at least on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals and checked the headend , what else can be done ? Is it possible that I just need a new HD box from Mediacom ? <p> From here , that may be the best idea . We can also have a technician on-site to investigate further , and he can swap out the equipment if necessary . This can also be done at your local office if there is one nearby .

If I press a button 10 times it might respond once . All three remotes behave this way with the main Tivo box , and all three remotes work flawlessly with the Mini . It does n't matter if I 'm literally aiming the remote at the sensor from six feet away ... same problem . <p> So I called Mediacom service and told them in great detail what my problem was . The rep did some tests , had me do a couple of things , and said I neeeed to talk to " the TiVo group . " I was put on hold , and disconnected after probably 5 minutes . So I started the process all over , and this time I requested that the original rep remained on the line until I was connected , which he did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TiVo group " rep , who subsequently told me that it was a problem with the receiver . He set up an appointment for a week later to have the box swapped out . I missed about 2 hours of work for this process . <p> The day of the appointment I took off work two hours early to meet the tech . He called me at about 5:00 to say he was on the way , and asked me what sort of problems I was having . I was like wtf , is n't that on the work order ? I spent two hours going through this . So I told him the whole story , and he said " Well , I do n't have a box with me . What do you want me to do ? " I said , " I do n't know buddy . You 're Mediacom , not me . I just want my remote to work . " So he said he 'd come on and take a look at it . He got to the house and did a bunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plainly that he did n't know anything about Tivo , that it was a problem with the box , and he 'd check on it tomorrow . <p> The next morning he called me back at 8:00 am and said he had a box , and asked if I wanted to meet him . I said sure , and left the office to go back home . He got there and swapped the box out , and it started doing an update . And it updated , and updated , and updated . Finally , around noon he said he just had to go to some of his other jobs and he 'd check back that afternoon . Around 1:00 the thing finally started working . I tested it a little bit and it seemed to be fine . I figured out myself how to get the Mini reconnected . Everything was good , I thought . So I started trying to reset my shows to record , and the box is slam full of somebody else 's stuff . Every show on BET was on there . And ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same position I started off in , except now all my recordings were gone and replaced with Big Fredia . <p> So , I started over . This time i specifically requested that they send a knowledgable technician , with a A NEW Tivo box . <p> The appointment day arrived , I once again took off work , and once again the tech ( a different one ) called me and asked me what the problem was . OMG you have got to be joking . I told him what was going on , and he said he did n't have a box with him , and he did n't know anything about Tivo but he 'd take a look at it . Whatever . <p> The tech shows up , tries the remotes , and calls somebody on the phone and told them about it . After he hung up , he moved the box about and inch so it was right on the edge of the shelf . Then he asked me where I usually say when I was watching tv and I showed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking his arm out to on side and down below the arm of the chair so it was level with the box . Then he said " See it 's got to be pointed right at the sensor , and it helps if it 's at the same level . " He was able to work the remote consistency by doing this , and by waiting about 10 seconds between each command . <p> So I said , " So basically what you 're saying is I have to contort myself and directly aim the remote at the sensor , and wait 10 seconds in between pushing the buttons ? " He said , " Yep . I have this box at home and it 's the same way . I pretty much watch the same channels all the time so I do n't really use the guide . " I said , " So the problem is not the remote or the sensor , it 's just that the box is this incredibly slow ? " He said , " Yep . These TiVo boxes are reaaaaally slow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awesome . Thanks for your time . " And that 's it . The solution to the problem is apparently " deal with it . " And it only took about a month and probably two full days out of work to come up with the answer . <p> Hello , mpmoshell , thanks for contacting us here . I apologize for the difficulties you have been having with the TiVo box ! It sounds like there may be something interfering with the remote signals in the room . Do you know if the remote is programmed for your television ? If so , do you notice a delay in the signal response when the remote is used on the TV ? If you think it is a problem with the second box , we may still need to try another box . But , there are some suggestions from TiVo that we can try before we schedule that . First would be to check for any other remotes in the room that may be sending an IR signal to interfere . We 'll want to make sure these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to try a reset of the remote control address by holding the TiVo and Pause buttons down together for 5 seconds , until the red or amber light comes on on the remote , then hit zero ( 0 ) . If there is no improvemnet with this , TiVo suggests turning off the backlight function of your TV if it is enabled . Also , we could try resetting the IR receiver on the TiVo by flashing a bright light at it for a couple of seconds . If you could try these and then let us know here if anything has been resolved , that would be great ! <p> The remote is programmed for the TV . It operates the TV with no problem or delay . <p> All other remotes are inside a drawer . <p> I did the remote reset as you suggested , with no improvement . <p> Turned off the TV backlight , no improvement . <p> Flashed a bright light at the sensor for at least two seconds , no improvement . <p> I should probably also mention that the amber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button , but the green light on the box does not come on every time . The box responds when the green light does come on . <p> It is basically impossible to use the reverse/forward functions on the Dvr with any kind of precision because of the remote lag , and I can not manually enter a channel selection because it times out before I can get 3 digits entered . <p> Ok , mpmoshell , I am posting here a link to the steps given by TiVo for a remote that works on other devices but not the TiVo box . Let 's give this a try , if you could , please , and let me know what happens . <p> Thank you for the update . Is the Tivo box in an entertainment center and that could have anything obstructing the sensor ? Also , if you have the remote directly in front of the sensor and try to use it , do you still have the lag that way ? <p> The box is on a shelf of an entertainment center . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel of the box is even with the front edge of the shelf . This was professionally arranged by the last Mediacom tech who came . <p> The box seems to work fine if I am pointing the remote directly into the sensor from a distance of 0 " -18 " . If I get any further than 18 " away or if there is any angle at all I start to have problems . <p> In case it matters , I have tried at least 5 or 6 different sets of batteries in the remote , and even went out and bought some with a newer date on them . I can use this same remote with the mini and it works fine regardless of the direction I 'm pointing the remote or the distance from the box . <p> Thank you for the update . Unless there is some interference in the room or the sensor may need to be cleaned off , the only alternative we can is replacing the equipment again . Let me know if you want me to schedule an appointment . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mentioned earlier , all the other remotes in the room are inside a drawer . <p> This is the third time that A Mediacom representative has indicated that my main Tivo box probably needs to be replaced . <p> The first time , the tech showed up without a new box . I had to take off work again the following day so he could come back and swap my box out for an old box that had not been refurbished and had the same problem as my original box . <p> The second time , the tech showed up without a new box , moved my box an inch closer to the front of the shelf , and told me that 's just how it was and I pretty much just had to deal with it . <p> If you can guarantee me that the tech you send would be comptetent with Tivo equipment and would actually bring a new box and remote with him , I would love to schedule an appointment . If you are not in a position to make that promise , then thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointless internet rant on my part . <p> To be clear , I appreciate your help and this is not directed at you personally . This has just been a bit frustrating . <p> Hello again , mpmoshell . Thanks for getting back to us ! I have scheduled an appointment for you noting that we need a new TiVO XG1 , a new TiVo remote , as well as a technician familiar with TiVo . It is scheduled for the next available appointment which is out a bit , but I am requesting the dispatch move up the appointment should something sooner open up . I will PM with the current appointment and to verify the phone number the technician should call as he 's headed your way as well as the dispatch to call should we get the appointment moved up . <p> I do have one more little jewel to add to my story , though . I just found out that Mediacom has CHARGED ME $29.00 for these service calls on which they did nothing to correct my problem . This just keeps getting better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next . <p> Moved the main box into the the bedroom and moved the Mini into the living room , and everything is working perfect now .

@@40218945 @218945/ <p> MediacomDrew : The ability for bridge mode is dependent upon firmware and provisioning . For residential tiers , bridge mode is hard coded as disabled within the unit 's firmware . A good swap for the DPC3825 so you can use your own modem would be a Cisco DPC3000 . This will offer the DOCSIS 3.0 capability that you are looking for , without the wireless gateway and built-in firewall getting in the way . This is a stand-alone modem . If you 'd like , we can set up an appointment to have a tech swap this out for you . Alternatively , this may be able to be swapped at the office . I would n't be able to do this today- as it is Sunday- but we can check the availability of DOCSIS 3.0 modems tomorrow when they open . <p> tyriker : I wo n't be needing to swap out my modem . I found a way to do what I was trying to do . <p> MediacomJames : Great ! Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to get my DPC3825 into bridge mode ( to be a straight pass-through device , and not act as a router . ) Most people will have no need or desire to do this , and if you 're not comfortable managing and securing your own network , you should not do any of this . It is very likely customer support will not provide any help in this endeavor , and you may leave your home network vulnerable to attack . With that being said , proceed at your own risk . <p> First , you have to do a factory reset on the device ( use a pen and depress the reset button for 10 seconds ... the device will reboot ) . This will reset the device to CISCO 's default firmware . You can find CISCO 's manual for the device here : LONG ... , as it describes the non-Mediacom admin screens of the device . The IP Address will be reset to 192.168.0.1 . If you connect directly to the device , you should be able to browse to the IP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to connect wirelessly , the SSID was reset to the last 6 characters of the devices MAC Address , and the PSK is the S/N value of the device . You can find this information on the sticker on the bottom of the physical device . <p> Second , you need to use the CISCO admin screens to put the device into bridge mode ( instead of " Router Mode " ) . However , the UI to achieve this does n't actually exist in CISCO 's admin screens . But you can still HTTP POST the proper data to the device and put it into bridge mode . See LONG ... for more info . <p> Essentially , you need to go to the " Administration " screen and the " Management " tab . The &lt;form&gt; element on this page can accept a value for " workingmode " . A value of 0 is for router mode , and a value of 1 is for bridge mode . All you have to do is POST this value to this form and the device will accept it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... screen after submitting the value . <p> You can submit/post this value to the form in any number of ways . The simple way I did it was by using the Dev Tools within the Google Chrome browser . Open the dev tools , drill down into the &lt;form&gt; element , edit the HTML and simply add an &lt;input&gt; tag with the proper name and value . Then within the page click the " Save Settings " button . This will submit/post your inserted name/value to the form . <p> After rebooting to bridge mode , you 're on your own as to what you do next . But here 's some things to know : <p> * If you are hard-wired to the DCP3825 ( ethernet ) , your computer is now publicly exposed to the internet . This is dangerous if you are not properly protected . * The DCP3825 does not automatically turn off the wireless side when in bridge mode . I did n't experiment much here as I simply disabled the wireless after switching to bridge mode . * The IP Address of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side only ) . I believe much of the network services ( DHCP , etc. ) are turned off when router functionality is disabled . If you connect to the device wirelessly , you may need to give yourself a static IP Address in the 192.168.100.0/24 range in order to communicate with it . <p> One nice potential side effect of me doing this is my connection is measurably faster . Before , I consistently tested at 9 Mbps on http : //speedtest.net/ . After switching to bridge mode and using my own router , firewall , etc . I regularly test at 27 Mbps . However , there are many variables at play here , and just switching the DCP3825 to bridge mode may not be the reason behind this apparent increase in network speed . <p> MediacomDallas : That is not a method we officially support though but I 'm glad it got the job done for you .

Is Mediacom going to allow some of their Digital Plus channels to make their way to Basic/Family Cable ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even though Versus and the History Channel are part of the digital plus package , their HD counter parts are part of the HD family cable package that you receive since you subscribe to family cable . The Outdoor HD Channel is part of the HD digital plus package , so I am not sure why you are getting that channel at the moment .

I did not see the answer in this thread , and was not sure if he had sent you a PM with the information . <p> amyers : Now that does n't make any sense , but hey-- I 'm not going to complain because I 'm getting more for free channels .

I checked on the other channels that you listed and Fuse and ESPNU are both part of the HD digital plus package , and ESPNEWS is part of the HD digital plus and HD digital sports pack meaning that if you subscribe to either one of those packages you should be able to receive that channel . In regards to the other channels , Disney , Hallmark and ABC family , I have not received any recent updates . <p> amyers : But you 're already providing us with channels that are apart of the Digital Plus package for free ?

@@40218959 @218959/ <h> Author Topic : considering in dropping services bill is getting out of control ( Read 6402 times ) <p> So I have been with Mediacom for well over 5 years now . For the longest time it was just with internet because our apartment building offered cable TV though mediacom . <p> Well the past year I have had a very hard time keeping up with my bill . I have been considering dropping phone service because we just do not use it and starz/encore on demand to help lower my bill . As it is I am just bearly keeping up on my bill and usually paying a month behind . I believe my bills have been somewhere around $150 per month and that is just way too much . <p> I was wondering if there is a way to get my bill to around or below $75 a month . <p> Well depending on the costs it all depends . I am intrested in getting the Kids and Variety pack . If removing phone to get that extra pack would get me under or near $75.00 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that . Also we do not seem to use Starz and Encore enough to want to keep that service . <p> After looking over some different packages and offers , it looks like we can rearrange services to include internet and digital cable- keeping the digital box- for $99.00/mo . Kids &amp; Variety is a digital tier , so it would require the use of a digital box . Starz/Encore would continue to be included , but this is part of the digital package and would offer no savings if removed . I know that this is still above the target goal , but even at this given range , there would still be an estimated net savings of about $80/mo . <p> Ok . Does that go up in price after so long ? Also what speed internet is that ? I just want to make sure it is the same as we have right now . Also what price would the kids and variety pack go upto after the promo goes off ? <p> Last Edit : August 29 , 2012 , 07:53:46 PM by jaker1976 + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first year and 109.00 for the second . Once the promotional period expires , the services will be the non-discounted rate for each . The speed of the internet is 12 Mbps DL and 1Mbps UL . <p> The problem here is I did ask and state that I would like to keep the current services I have now except for the phone service . We do not use it and a -$20.00 off my bill for having VIP . I thought the whole point of having VIP was to have cheaper service because of paying for all three of your services . $155.00 per month is not cheap . When the service was $98.00 per month that was a decent price . <p> So in the end if I am going to LOSE services that I am currently getting , then what is the point for getting rid of the phone service ? Heck when I signed up I was to get DVR service free for 2 or 6 months or something and I never even got it . Heck I had to drive to Ames to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our house only set us up with basic service even though we had the VIP service with Starz and Encore ON Demand . <p> So it looks like I am stuck between a rock and a hard spot . To lower my bill I have to lose my current services I like and take a kick in the Butt on our internet speeds yet I will still be pretty much paying the same cost that I am not minus the phone price . <p> This is pretty disappointing . <p> Logged 45222 @qwx455222 <p> I am currently showing that you have all three services , thus you have the VIP ( Voice , Internet , Phone ) Service , which gives you the speed boost . I understand you are wanting a lower rate than what you are currently getting , and the offer we have given you gives you what you asked for , as you said you were thinking about dropping the phone service . If there were any other offers we had for you , we definitely would give them to you , but as of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are asking for . <p> Ok so I have been looking over services and there is no where I see you guys offer any 12MB internet ! What I do see you offer isUp to 3Mbps down up to 512 Kbps uploadUp to 15 Mbps down Up to 1 Mbps uploadUp to 20-30 Mbps download Up to 2 Mbps uploadUp to 50 Mbps download Up to 5 Mbps upload <p> So where in there is anything to do with 12Mbps ? This is right off your website and if you happen to offer 12Mbps service why is that NOT listed on your website ? I am starting to get sick and tired of being lied to by your company . I was told on the phone when I tried to call in and see what services were offered that someone would call me back . I never got a call back and it has been 2 weeks . I have you telling me for around $99 for the first year and $109 for the second year and who the hell knows after the promotion is up since you seem not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that you do not even offer the VIP pack anymore ! You have your either " internet+phone package " or yo have your " Internet+Family TV " with the option of adding phone . <p> So please quit lying about that you do not offer what I am asking for . Just because I am an old customer and have been one for the past 6 years.So what I want to know is what does it take to drop this service you no longer offer as a package anymore ( talking about the VIP ) and to pick up the PERFORMANCEpak ? So what I want to know is : How much is this package . I get to see only the starting price for new customers of 89.99/month . So now please tell me you are going to keep screwing with a customer you have had for over 5 years and tell me that you do not offer these types of services to the customers that you already have ! I mean is it you only want to offer good deals to people that are new so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I do not want excuses or BS i want results or I will be happy to move onto a new service provider and looking at your twitter tweets you have a lot of people that are doing the same thing . It its time you give your current customers service and quit lying to our faces ! I am paying more for services and for older services then what your current offers are to NEW CUSTOMERS ! At least when I was on Qwest they would upgrade your service with NO EXTRA FEES if new services were provided for the same price as the old package I was getting . I do not want lower services then what you are currently offering NEW CUSTOMERS ! I WANT THE SAME SERVICES YOU ARE OFFERING NEW CUSTOMERS ! <p> So now let 's talk . If you can not do this then I guess you need to let me know so I can drop your services and start calling Dish Network or something . I will go to some other service provider that actually wants my service then a company that wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 99.00 for the first year and 109.00 for the second . Once the promotional period expires , the services will be the non-discounted rate for each . The speed of the internet is 12 Mbps DL and 1Mbps UL . " <p> So you are saying since our last convo the last part of August everything changed ? I do not think so ! I have had 15Mbps ever since got got service at our house 2 years ago . My speed has always come over when I test it at around 15mbps-20mbps and has alreays been between 1Mbps-1.5Mbps Up . I signed up with the service of VIP with 15Mbps , 2 months of Free DVR ( That I never got access for because my local service guy never even brought me a digital reciver I had to drive to Ames to pick on up ! and you can see that I called in back in July of 2010 because I was not able to get HD channels on my TV . Never got the free DVR service ) However your new current packages are : <p> Monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers get awesome services for decent prices yet you want to ram it up where the sun does not shine on your old customers ? Have you ever heard it is easier to keep old customers then get new ones So keep the customers you have happy ? I have been lied to way too many times now ! You say you seen my service was upgraded from 12/1 to 15/1 yet you told me the reason I HAD the 15/1 was because VIP gave me a speed boost ! I hate being lied to I hate it very much ! So what is it ? Did I have 12/1 and was upgraded to 15/1 or is it that you offered 12/1 and VIP got a 3Mbps speed boost ? What is it ? <p> Also I want to add Tim , I am not looking for the pricing but I want the same services as new customers would get ! If this PERFORMANCEpak is a lower price then what I am paying now for VIP then I should be able to change to that package since you no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speeds for the same price I am paying for now have gone up ! I am paying the same price for 15Mbps then someone new coming off the street is paying for 20-30Mbps ! I also have no DVR service and they get free DVR service . <p> Do you see where I am going here ? You are screwing the pants off your current customers and giving all these nice services to your new customers . You should treat EVERY single customer like it is a new customer or do not do it at all . <p> Logged 45222 @qwx455222 <p> I assure you I am not trying to mislead you in any way . Your modem is currently provisioned for 18 Mbps DL and 1.2 Mbps UL ( up from the 15/1 you previously had ) . The pricing you see on the website is for new customers . We can look to see what offers we currently have for existing customers , but as I previously stated , you are not eligible for the new customer pricing . <p> Any of our new offers that new or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowances you referenced here and will also have the new Speed packages . The new data allowances started 8/1/12 . <p> How come I am not notified that my services have been upgraded ? I never knew that my speeds were upgraded , yet the services I have should be equaled to the PERFORMANCEpak . So what do you have for current customers that is like PERFORMANCEpak ? I have all the services of PERFORMANCEpak except for the internet speeds and the DVR services . Yet if I wanted to get them with my current services they would be considered upgrades and cost me more money . That is the kind of BS crap I am trying to get though to you ! I bet without the promotion on that package it will still be less then $175.00 a month that I am paying now . <p> So what I would like to see is : Prime Plus Internet + Prime TV on only 1 TV , since I have to pay for your other converters cause I only have 1 TV that can support HD channels , DVR services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to this . Also why will you not say what the price of this service would be without the promotional prices ? I am NOT looking for the new customer pricing . I want the same services because I feel I am already paying more then what someone new would be paying AFTER their promo runs out and I HAVE less and slower services !

The even more curious will discover you need a TiVo Stream to do that . If you 're still curious ( because the idea of streaming anywhere is COOL ) , you 'll find that Mediacom wants you to buy your Stream from them .

I believe you can only download shows that are recorded and saved on your main TiVo box . The problem with out-of-home streaming is with our agreement with TiVo , we 're working on that currently and hope to have everything enabled soon ! I know there are a couple of things TiVo has not quite gotten done with the Android version of the app , but I 'm not sure exactly what ... <p> First - the Tivo unit and the streamer are capable of out of home streaming , but due to Mediacom 's contract with Tivo that feature is disabled.Second - technically , the Mediacom websites are physically accurate because they never actually state that on an Android downloading works ... or that they support out of home streaming . They state that you can have access to things remotely ... but due to the limitations imposed on Android for downloading shows because of copywrite laws ... it is what it is . I guess buy an iOS device if you want to download @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage ... so copwrite is n't as concerning . <p> What this means .... <p> a ) iOS devices supports streaming and downloading . Android devices support streaming only and no downloading. b ) if you own a Android device - you can only stream in your house and you can not download shows for offline or away from home use . No out of network support at this time.c ) If you have a Android and are running the Tivo App 3.0 or above ... you should be able to stream shows on your DVR or stream live content from the program guide while connected to the same local network your main Tivo unit is hooked up to . How this works is that the app initiates the Tivo DVR to record the show on the hard drive and then communicates with the Stream to stream the show to your device.d ) From the app - " Watch " will prompt you to watch on iPhone/Android or TV . In order for this to work ... while on your home network you need to setup streaming first . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out contract and technical bugs with Tivo . The other features in the app allow you to schedule recordings etc . That 's what " Get Show " really is doing ... allowing you to setup OnePass or one time recordings . <p> I 've had to figure all this out basically on my own . Unfortunately , what the Tivo devices are capable of doing stand alone without a cable company involved are different than what you get when the cable company is involved ... but when they add streaming out of network ... that should all resolve itself and work as designed and advertised via the Tivo websites . <p> PS - their marketing and statements are a bit fuzzy as far as what you do and do n't get .... <p> I think honestly the employees at Mediacom do n't actually know what is and is n't really being deployed compared to the Tivo site . I had a few say that the Tivo Stream would work out of home , but it turns out that 's not true . <p> So ... we 'll see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You could always go with a Dish provider , buy a Tivo unit stand alone outside the cable company or purchase a SlingBox to get the features you want . <p> First - the Tivo unit and the streamer are capable of out of home streaming , but due to Mediacom 's contract with Tivo that feature is disabled.Second - technically , the Mediacom websites are physically accurate because they never actually state that on an Android downloading works ... or that they support out of home streaming . <p> " " Be in control with the all-powerful TiVo app Easily stream or download shows to your mobile device using the TiVo app !

Our new digital age has provided us the means to better communicate with others and has created more efficient productivity . <p> Businesses rely on technology to reach both customers and partners , enabling employees to work both in-house and remotely , and allowing for usage of next-level business applications to run faster and do more . But while many urban communities have access to all levels of internet speeds , some rural ones may not have the same luxury . <p> Municipalities and Broadband <p> Municipalities , urban administrative divisions of self-governing jurisdictions , are usually located on the outskirts of larger populations . These municipalities , because of their locations , may not be able to access the level of broadband that drives growth and progress . Lack of reliable internet access can be detrimental to attracting businesses , and residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flourish . Generations Y &amp; Z expect to be connected , they grew up on the internet so in an effort to help recruit businesses , cities need to attract and retain young professionals for the community to grow . Broadband is a key way to appeal to younger generations who want these high capacity speeds and are used to daily integration with technology . <p> Data from the National Broadband Map show that rural areas do have access to broadband , however their speeds have been shown to be 30 times slower than the national average . 75% of rural areas have access to connections of at least 10 Mbps versus 98% of those in urban areas , while only 61% of rural areas have access to 25 Mbps speeds compared to 94% of urban areas . <p> In terms of internet providers that are available , only a small percentage of rural areas have access to at least three providers versus the diversity of the urban population . <p> Helping Towns All Over the Country to Become Fiber Cities <p> How can rural areas advance the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide them with the same access to high-speed internet , with the same speeds or better in order to be more agile , productive , and efficient . Broadband access makes the world a much smaller place , leveling the playing field for competition because it eliminates geographic boundaries . That 's why Mediacom Business has made the investment in the rural communities that we serve to bring the same level of internet access that one would expect in the largest of metropolitan areas . Our fiber-optic broadband infrastructure capable of internet speeds of 10 Gigabit and beyond is the same technology found in New York , Chicago or Los Angeles . And with our most recent announcement that Mediacoms broader plan is to invest $1 billion over the next 3 years to , among other projects , upgrade and expand its national broadband network this means our broadband network will be further deep rooted into our rural communities that span 22 states . <p> This commitment to our communities has had a positive economic impact , especially in key verticals like healthcare , education and finance . As these community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it enables residents to stay local and consume local versus traveling hours to a larger city . Within the state of Iowa , our fiber optic network leverages Gigabit+ level broadband to 323 communities , making Iowa the first Gigabit state in the nation . Our rural communities and municipalities now have the access to high-speed broadband that they may not have had with other providers who were not willing to make the investment . <p> Providing municipalities with this level of high-speed internet transforms businesses and their communities into progressive hubs of economic developments . The City of Grimes in Iowa , one of the fastest growing areas in the Des Moines Metro , understands how essential fiber-optic broadband is to any developing community . They strive to work with Mediacom Business and like providers to put the infrastructure in place to drive growth into the community . Businesses want to be in communities where the quality of life is high so they can attract quality employees .

@@40218991 @218991/ <p> In theory , I 'd like to have feedback and discussion with my fellow Mediacom customers . However , it looks to me like this is set up primarily as a support forum , so I will frame my questions primarily as questions to Mediacom , but hopefully if my fellow customers have anything useful to add , they can do so . <p> For several years , Mediacom sales reps have called me , and Mediacom has spent money sending mailings to me at my home , trying to sell me on business internet and on phones ( whether residential or business ) . I am open to both aspects , but I generally respond that I am absolutely not going to sacrifice call reliability .... that the reason I pay more for a landline over using my cell phone is that my landline compared to a cell phone has dramatically fewer dropped calls ( much higher number of 9 's of reliability ) and has very good call quality . So , if Mediacom suggests that I might want to give their phone service a try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How often do calls get dropped ? How often are there total outages ? How often do calls not get dropped but suffer from intermittent quality problems ? Is a Mediacom telephone line considered safe to commit to as a primary phone line , to the point where 911 services work properly and in an emergency ? What about power outages ? <p> I am usually reassured by a Mediacom sales person that call quality and reliability is very good , but in the end , what does this reassurance mean ? Around 2006 , I tried a couple of VOIP services on a kind of expendable phone number ( not risking my landline number ) through my Mediacom internet connection and in the end the only change I made was to get rid of my internet in favor of DSL because I realized that the low consistency of quality on the calls was primarily attributable to the inconsistency of the Mediacom internet service . I spent several years on DSL , came back to Mediacom internet and then , after awhile , the quality issues seemed largely ironed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I basically keep several questions in mind to ask them : in a town-wide power outage , will the phone still work ? They start talking to me about having UPS on my modem or selling me a modem with battery backup built in , or some such , but I do n't think this is relevant and I have always had battery backup on all my computer systems . The point is that , where I live , the Mediacom internet signal does not appear to operate properly during a town-wide power outage , *but the landline plain old telephone service and DSL does in fact continue to operate* . The answer I got from one person is that Mediacom has not been willing to spend the money to provide power to all of its nodes ( or whatever they 're called ) and so the net effect is that during a town-wide power outage , I do not have internet from Mediacom ( these days , in that situation , I get it from my cell phone hot spot feature ) . I do n't know if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one question . <p> The other thing I remind myself of is how utterly miserable ( Kafka-esque ) the experience has been for me , dealing with the system of customer service , during times when I did have internet outages . I gradually learned to post the outage to this forum ( via my cell phone hotspot ) , and to try to avoid spending much time on it beyond that . Note that I do n't have any issue with the customer service lower-level personnel ... they are just following orders . I have a complaint with the system under which they operate . <p> Anyway , over time , the clear outright outages have been reduced . It is not possible for me to know exactly if there are minor intermittent intra-day micro-outages or slow-downs , though I reckon if I got VOIP telephone , I 'd find out soon enough . I am just saying overall here that , if I did really make any sort of commitment to a Mediacom phone , and save a lot of money , I can just imagine my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted by a Mediacom issue , and I have to try to get service . <p> To be honest , I ca n't really imagine giving up my landline , but I can see maybe trying to give the Mediacom system a secondary kind of trial , and building up an idea from there of where things are . <p> I mentioned also they try to sell me business internet and phone service . My question is - is business service more reliable than residential ( is it different hardware or connection ) ? Or are they just asking me to pay a lot more money for them to come out and repair things immediately instead of making me go through the Kafka-esque support request system ? <p> Sorry for the long questions , but I guess I just thought I 'd write it out . While I can think of some negatives , I also am keeping in mind that there are things not to like about plain old telephone service such as the very high ( increasingly non-competitive ) prices for some things , and the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contacting us here ! We 're more than happy to go over the questions you have for us here . Since our phone service , as your aware , is VOIP as long as the signal is great going to your modem you should notice little to no dropped calls or voice distortion . We generally run planned maintenance from 12am to 6am . This may happen a few times a month as we 're working towards upgrading the area and fixing any problems that may arise . If there are any power outages the phone service will not work as the modems we provide do not have a battery backup and will drop offline . Feel free to post here if you have any more questions regarding the phone service ! <p> Thanks for contacting us here ! We 're more than happy to go over the questions you have for us here .

We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may happen a few times a month as we 're working towards upgrading the area and fixing any problems that may arise . <p> Hi Craig , are you saying that your phone system may not work for six hours at a time , several times per month ( ? ? ! ! ) Does mediacom consider that low level of reliability to be competitive with landline telephone service ? What if I have a call that I need to carry out at that time ( such as if I am speaking to someone overseas ? or if I just happen to be a night owl ? ) <p> If there are any power outages the phone service will not work as the modems we provide do not have a battery backup and will drop offline . Feel free to post here if you have any more questions regarding the phone service ! Thanks , Craig <p> I have to say , I 'm not sure why this is so hard to understand my question here . If we count in the sales people who have called me , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to get my point through so it is understood . Maybe a few of the sales people have understood . Anyway , I will repeat : <p> There is , as far as I can tell , no relevance to saying that the modems lack battery backup . It is painfully trivial to provide battery backup for a modem or other network or computer equipment . I 've been doing it at my house for more than a decade and , by doing this , have been able to keep my internet going during all power outages during those years when I had DSL . When I switched to cable for internet , I was no longer able to get my internet to function during an outage . Why is that ? Again - it had nothing to do with any question about UPS backup for any modems . I already provide that myself . That is done . That is not a factor in this issue . <p> Good morning jlsoaz , thanks for getting back to us . Usually in a power outage , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out for an area it will cause a service outage even with an UPS because equipment outside the home does not have power . Our phone service , all of our services in fact , are not considered utilities at this time and in the event of a power or other interruption , we are the last allowed to come in and make repairs . <p> I think this is the info your looking for , if you can live with the fact that when and if your internet goes down you can rely on your cell as backup . Since you already have said you do n't like to rely on your cell as your backup stick to the true landline you currently use.Nothing is more reliable .

@@40218998 @218998/ <p> Good morning , since our last outage , things had been running pretty smooth , until this week . Since the outage , my bonded ds power has been right on target , -1/0/+1 . Starting Mon this started creeping up to 3/4 . Yesterday it went up to 8 . Last night I was unable to stream netflix or vudu , kept buffering so I tried running some tests . Most failed as the downstream would start , but then cut out and never finish . The upstream was fine . Tests 1 min apart would have drastically diff results . I also ran ping tests , one would return a b rating , the next a min later an f rating with high packet loss and jitter . I tried to get here to post last night but could not get enough bw to load the site . <p> I checked with several other remote workers on the same line as me and all are experiencing the raised power levels , and cutouts . Note that this is not causing the modem to reset , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am . Can you please check the card and see why our power levels , which used to be perfect , have spiked so high on the ds channels ? We are also seeing slow video on on demand and some hd channels as well . This again is being seen by others on the line that comes off the Y hwy main ( all our lines after that are buried ) . The cutouts continue today as I am running my normal remote desktop session and there is significant delay , voip is cutting out as well . Thanks <p> Thanks for letting us know about this . I checked over the signal history of your modem and I do see a definite increase in the downstream power levels recently . However , I am not seeing the same trend happening to other modems immediately nearby though . Also , while the power levels are a bit higher than before , they are still within the upper range of what is considered acceptable . <p> That being said , you 're still experiencing service issues that we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is occurring from this end . To get this resolved , we would need to get a tech out to check over our equipment and connections at the house to start narrowing this down . Can I get that scheduled for you ? <p> It seems to be intermittent , like now the power is down to 5,5,4,4 , but it started the day at 7,6,5,5 and has been bouncing around those all morning , Hd/on demand is fine now , but last night when the power spiked to 8 it was delayed . Is there any troubleshooting I can do on my end ? I have a splitter I can add behind the modem to drop the power if needed , and have cable on hand to replace line if needed . ( Now 6,5,4,4 ) . Snr has been steady , and upstream is n't moving much either . Now 6,6,5,5 . <p> With my luck , it would be perfect when the tech arrived , and drop speeds right after ... <p> A splitter will bring the power levels down at least 3-4 dB . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to make sure nothing looks out of the ordinary there . When splitters fail or connections corrode out , you 'll typically see significant drops in the signal levels , not an increase . There may be something loose out there though . I would also try connecting the modem to another cable outlet temporarily if it 's possible . Intermittent issues are always the toughest ( most fun ) to track down . <p> Thanks , I added the new splitter behind the modem and now ds is at 3,3,2,1 . Closer to optimal there . The upstream increased too , went from 45 to 49 .... any concern there ? Obviously it is adjusting for the added cable/splitter ( 6 ft was the smallet segment I had , will shortening that help or is 49 a good spot for it ) ? <p> You 're welcome ! An upstream of 49 would be acceptable however signal levels usually rise/fall slightly . I 've checked your current signal levels and everything is reporting in range . I 'll make a ticket on this side to check signal history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results , we may need to dispatch a tech to further investigate . Would this be acceptable ? How is everything running now ? <p> Thanks Michael , I ended up removing the splitter this am , could you run the check another 24hrs please ? I had streaming issues last night with frequent buffering , although the modem signals showed good and no resets . I want to see how it does today going back to the original setup before the ds power spike . What would normally cause a ds power increase of 7-8 db without impacting snr or upstream power levels ( that all stayed the same when the power spiked ) . Is there something that can drop the ds power without increasing the upstream like a splitter does ? Might be related , the power company is upgrading/replacing lines out on the main line ( runs above ground b4 entering our area ) . The spike occured the day after the scheduled power cut to move over to the newly strung lines . Nothing in our area has changed and everything is below ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediacom boxes feed off those lines , have a feeling it might be related . <p> Sure , we 'll keep a monitor on the modem for another 24 hours . Currently , things look great . I can see the changes in levels when the splitter was removed , and everything is sitting within optimal range at this time . There can be several issues affecting downstream power beyond the splitter , including issues at the tap or outside on the drop . If things continue to spike , we can go from there . 
@@40218999 @218999/ <h> Author Topic : AMC HD audio sync issue ( Read 1328 times ) <p> For a while now ( week or more ) , AMC HD is out of sync between audio and video . It is slight but very noticeable . It happens on all of my mediacom equipment , but I did n't think to check it on my other TiVo ( non-mediacom ) until just now and I am not home . Can you have someone check on it and see if it is a problem larger than just me ? This is on TVs that are directly hooked to the TiVo with no receiver and a TV with a receiver in the chain . The delay is the same . Thanks ! <p> Hello bumdass . I am sorry to hear of your service issue with the AMC HD channel . I have send signals to the main TiVo box . Please retest in 15 to 20 minutes . Once back up and still issue , try to channel up and channel back down . Thanks <p> I will check it out when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TiVo last night ( not Mediacom issued ) and she said it seemed fine . So it is just the Mediacom boxes . Hopefully that will clear it up . I will follow-up once checked . <p> I will have to check again tonight . I looked at the personal TiVo myself this morning , but it was some infomercial . Not the best source material to verify sync . I will look tonight . The Mediacom TiVos were still running out of sync . The audio is slightly behind the video . And I have only noticed it on that channel . <p> I verified . All of my TiVos have this issue still . Best I can tell it is just AMC HD . It has been going on for a while now . We recorded a lot of the horror movies last month and all of them I have watched have exhibited this issue . <p> Thank you for the update ! I have submitted a single channel issue ticket to an analyst . They will look into this further and resolve the issue or contact you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello and thank you for following up with us on our forums . After checking into this , we are finding that the channel is working clearly at the head end , which means the next step would be to schedule a technician . If you would like us to schedule this for you , please send a personal message to me , or any other moderator , with some times and days that would work for you , as well as the best telephone number a technician can call prior to arrival . I apologize for the inconvenience this has caused . <p> Thank you for replying , bumdass . This could be caused by a signal at the main splitter going into your house . The issue could be caused down the road , as well . We first need to have a technician to check everything from your TV and work backwards , since the head-end feed is working properly . I will send you a PM with the available time/day . <p> I was n't really complaining , I just do n't know enough about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could add delay to the audio portion of a digital signal but not impact the video . I 'm not seeing any blocking or flashing or tiling . Other than that one channel ( that I have noticed ) I have n't noticed any issues . I 'll look for the details and let you know if I can not make it work . Thanks ! <p> The tech came out Tuesday and indicated what I suspected . It is a broadcast feed problem . Watching The Walking Dead on demand , audio and video are synced fine . Watching it live , the tech could see them out of sync . <p> Thanks for that information ! I went ahead and reached out to your area management team to see what more information we can provide . Once we acquire any more information we 'll be sure to follow up with you here !

@@40219015 @219015/ <h> Author Topic : Clear Access ( Read 6673 times ) <p> First of all I am posting this here because mediacom insists you MUST use their BULL**** Clear Access portal to manage your router , I am here to tell you they are wrong and disclose the way simple workaround they will not tell you . <p> I feel if we are PAYING them for service it is OUR RIGHT to manage our router with the HITRON firmware in which they will insist is disabled . Uh WRONG , Its just a redirect flag they place on the DEFAULT management page , FIrmware is still there and still quite functional , ANY IT tech knows this as do they . <p> The REASON they want you to use Clear Access is so THEY can monitor your bandwidth in such a way as to detect if you are using " suspect " amounts of bandwidth and see exactly what you are using tt on . I.E Torrent files and the like . Well that is none of their god damn business so all you need do ( atleast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) is this . <p> simply go to http : //192.168.0.1/login.html and use the supplied credentials on the bottom of the router as normal ( typicly cusadmin is the user and password is the password until you change it ) this bypasses that redirect flag they place on 192.168.0.1 so you will NOT be redirected to clear access . <p> I also suggest IMMEDIATELY disabling remote access unless you truly need their assistance . <p> The reason this works is because that ip calls the login page for the router specificly , if they OVERWRITE IT , Clear access would not work either as it is basicly just a redirect and clear access MUST use this for the redirect to work properly . <p> WE WILL NOT BE FORCED TO USE THAT BULL**** CLEAR ACCESS PORTAL . <p> " Hardware configuration utilities are unable to be reached due to Clear Access custom firmware flashed to all of our models . If you need your Clear Access login information , however , please send me a PM with your account number or phone number and I can reset this info and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying to all of you , they just do n't  want YOU in control of the router. they do n't  flash a damn thing . If they did , they would brick the router the moment it was flashed . <p> and to Mediacom , Delete this post all you want , I will repost it every 5 minutes if i have to . YOU will NOT force us to use that absolute crap clear access . MEDIACOM BEWARE , there are those of us that know exactly how such things work as we have ALSO set up simalar management systems and we will let the truth be known . <p> Thanks for posting on the Mediacom Support Forums ! The Clear Access page is not used for monitoring bandwidth usage . That 's measured using a two different bandwidth monitors . We also do n't see where the usage is coming from . All we see is the amount of data uploaded and downloaded . You can definitely bypass the Clear Access page by disconnecting the coaxial cable on the back of the modem and then logging into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUI for the modem/router . Now any changes that you make there may not be saved though since Clear Access pushes the information saved on it 's server to the modem . The Clear Access page is geared more to customers that either do n't have the knowledge to manage their network or either just do n't want to manage their network . If you 'd like full administrative privileges over your router you can definitely purchase your own and also save $3.95 a month on the home networking fee . <p> Those settings should remain the same as the Clear Access page does not push that information onto the modem/router . Now if you change the wireless settings and reset the modem once the Clear Access server communicated with the modem the wireless settings would change to whatever is saved in Clear Access . <p> why not just get rid of it all together , most people arnt going to fiddle with router firmware unless they know what they are doing or need to open ports for an xbox or the like . and those of us that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that garbage . <p> OR at very least , offer us the option by telling us this but also warn people certian changes may be overwritten by clear access , then people CAN make changes not effected by clear access such as changing ip classes , dmz , access to firewall settings . That would be a better way of doing that . Basic end users use clear access but also disclose " advanced settings " can be accessed in this way for advanced users . Problem solved . <p> Hello AthlonJedi , thanks for getting back to us . We do have the Clear Access system set up for the avaerage user that does not have 30 years of experience in LAN and WAN networking . It is usually better to keep thing as simple as possible for the layman user . Generally , more experienced customers choose to install a personal router through which they can have unlimited access to all settings and protocols .

I hope things continue steadily for you and we are here should you need anything else ! <p> do i really need to post screen shots to prove you guys are incorrect ? the settings i am talking about are NOT my modem WAN ip , That will ofcourse be reset by clear access , and accully YOUR dhcp servers unless it is a static ip however the wan ip , wan gateway , and wan dns servers are the only settings that would revert as they are dhcp assigned . the lan side is unaffected by it . <p> also , I should NOT be forced to go buy a router if i want access to router firmware , that 's BULLCRAP ! <p> using my workaround gives access to the router itself , and anyone that knows what they are doing is n't going to change WAN settings anyway . <p> look , I understand it may be company policy to deny this is true , and i understand the need for simplicity for some users , HOWEVER , that does NOT warrant forceing EVERYONE to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mo extra for something i do n't  accully need . Yes disconnecting the router from the cable line also works . but just be truthful , ask the customer if they have any experince with routers , if yes , let them access the router with out clear access , and this is how it can be done . <p> otherwise , there is no access to things like the firewall settings , lan ip addressing , DMZ access which btw i have one system on now , ect . That is what pisses people like me off . <p> and NO , Clear access does NOT change anything but the WAN settings , I have reset the router numourous times , even had clear access disabled at one point by calling in , and the router works just fine with out it . <p> AthlonJedi , no one is trying to lie or deny anything I assure you . Our ClearAccess software does have a local GUI clickthrough that can be enabled that will store settings that are saved internally into the router that are not managed by ClearAccess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with the routers we give out we require the ClearAccess firmware to be enabled . I am not sure I follow where we are being dishonest , and I would love to look closer if there is anything anyone here we have misspoken on or any misinformation given . We do n't intend to lie to any of our customers and we will do all we can to be transparent . If there is anything I can clarify please let me know . <p> where is this clickthrough ? and what does it give access to ? all i saw was port forwarding . and i do n't  care if its required , i 'm not using it ... period . i bet if i reflash the firmware , clear access will go away completly and the router will function normally . <p> " today , we received a copyright letter from Mediacom ....

@@40219019 @219019/ <p> No one can deny that over the past quarter-century , the Internet has changed the way we conduct business . For those located in the largest Metro areas like New York , Chicago or Los Angeles , its a given that high-speed , reliable broadband service will be available . In fact , they expect it . <p> As you know , broadband is a critical component to the success of any business . Its what has made the world a much smaller place by way of competition allowing businesses to not only reach nationally , but globally for that matter . Fiber-optic solutions for data and voice are providing the pathway to push big data , connect multiple locations and enable users to access information simultaneously no matter where they are . Its simply the fastest technology available to date . Gigabit is such a buzz word right now essentially it means the speed by which billions of bits of data are delivered over a fiber optic network . Its a superfast connection , transmitting data at the speed of light . <p> So where does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ? Well , Mediacom has invested more than $1 billion over the past four years to operate , expand , and upgrade its robust broadband infrastructure that serves businesses in some 1,500 communities across 22 states . <p> We live in a technology driven world . People want and need to be connected no matter where they are just look at the explosion of social media . How many devices do you have surrounding you right now ? It extends to the business community as well , schools utilizing distance learning where students in rural America can learn a new language from a teacher in Germany . Hospitals are conducting telemedicine and a patient can get first rate care in their home town without having to drive 2 + hours to the nearest university hospital . Businesses are talking about the " Cloud " to create efficiencies and go paperless . here 's the catch ... to use those applications or advanced technology platforms , you need a broadband highway to get there . The technology is fascinating but without a strong broadband connection the applications are useless . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive economic development broadband via fiber should be right at the top . Any developing community probably has come to that same conclusion . The City of Grimes , IA is one of those forward thinking communities . Their conversation with providers has been to give them as much fiber as possible , Grimes wants to work in order to put the infrastructure in place that will help drive growth in the community and the customer base of the provider . They know that managing and monitoring a network of that stature is no small feat any city can build fiber , that 's the easy part . But by working together , Grimes feels we all win at the end of the day . See more in our Real Customer Stories Series : City of Grimes , Iowa at LONG ... <p> Through Gigabit+ Fiber Solutions from Mediacom Business , the days of your business being defined by its physical location are gone . Having this type of high capacity broadband access allows businesses to thrive in todays climate but easily positions them for the scalability needed for future demands . <h> About Us 45223 @qwx455223

More areas in Minnesota and surrounding locations are planned to see these tiers available by the end of this week as well . Stay updated by checking your service area by state and county here : LONG ... Until further notice , both Internet 500 and 1 Gig require leased DOCSIS 3.1 equipment and are n't compatible with bundled phone , TiVo , or Home Networking services . The Technicolor TC4400- as of today- is currently the only DOCSIS 3.1 device certified for use on our network and is leased at $10 monthly . This is projected to change later this year as more robust and fully-featured DOCSIS 3.1 equipment becomes available .

Leased equipment is still $10 monthly , though a purchased device will see this waived . Regardless of leased or purchased equipment , a technical installation is still required . This is to ensure proper configuration , activation , and that all service is running to spec . Home Networking , TiVo , and phone service status has not changed and is not as of yet compatible with these service tiers . This is still projected to change later this year as additional equipment is made available and certified . <p> Did Albany GA quietly get it or was I lied to and about to wast my time and the service techs as I have an appointment tomorrow .

In addition to the state of IA , 1Gig has also rolled out to parts of Alabama , Georgia , Illinois , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota , and Wisconsin . We will continue to post fully serviced locations as they are announced . To our knowledge TiVo and Phone are still not compatible with our services that rely on Docsis 3.1 , but we will look into this and post a correction if this has changed or if an ETA is available for the Q2 modem solutions . <p> As I posted in another Incan confirm the Arris SB8200 works with 1gig in Albany GA as I even self installed it today . I am not getting full gig service but was told they are working on a feeder line . But my TiVo and MOCA are unaffected and working as they did before . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment yet for it . <p> Thank you for your input on the matter . We are still unable to support TiVo or phone with 1Gig until we have the equipment that supports those features available . If you wish to try a custom configuration yourself to try and get it to work together then you are more than welcome to , but our support will be limited to the wiring and network configuration that we currently require for it to work properly .

Can you check your router and your devices to see what usage is being processed ? <p> I did run an update on the router firmware recently which failed . I finally got it restored last night but looking at the connected devices does n't show anything suspicious that I can see . I 've disconnected one pc that my wife said has been acting odd lately in case it is the root of this . I disconnected it about 2 or 3 hours ago . Other than that , I ca n't think of anything different in our internet usage over the past few days . <p> Thank you for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure that anyone who is n't authorized wo n't be able to gain access afterwards . Also , can you run any virus scans on the devices in the home to make sure there is n't a viruses on the computers and not using any bandwidth in the background . <p> Yes , I 'll change the pw and run virus &amp; malware scans on all devices ( that I can ) . I 'll report back . <p> I did just remember that one of the computers ( a Dell ) was upgraded to Win10 and part of the recovery disk system required a large download ( probably the image file for a Windows 10 install ) . That and a large game download my son did last night or the night before could have eaten a large amount of data .

I disconnected essentially everything but the modem &amp; router last night before I went to bed and this morning the usage meter has moved another 10 or 15 GB . How is that possible ? <p> I 'm also wondering how this came about . Nothing seemed amiss until I woke up yesterday and went online where I received a header on the first web page I went to that said I had exceeded 70% of my usage with 21 days remaining in my cycle .

I installed one a month and a half ago and access through a web browser and multiple smart devices ( iphones &amp; tablets ) . Over the holidays we had it open ( viewing ) a lot to monitor our driveway for guests . <p> Yes , that would most likely be the cause . If you are viewing an IP camera , it is passing data from the camera the same as streaming a movie from Netflix would . Most IP cameras will tell you the amount of data that passes through per second depending on what quality setting you have it at while viewing . That would give a good breakdown of where your usage is coming from . Since the jump came during the holidays and that is the only change made , my guess is that is where the extra data is coming from . <p> Since you do not have our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what passes through your modem .

I need to figure out a way to monitor what Mediacom says I 'm using against my network . If that Usage Meter is fairly current , I can watch it as I introduce all my devices back onto my network and watch for any abnormal data use . If it 's not terribly up-to-date , it 's not really going to help me . <p> I 've installed Glasswire to monitor what is being used and I can say that it did n't register the 30 GB that were apparently used between Sunday morning and Monday morning ... at least I not that I can see in the graph or log of data usage . <p> My two main suspects are the IP Camera and Carbonite ( online backup ) . I 've disabled both for now and will monitor my usage levels ... just need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on the Mediacom web page usage meter . <p> Hello Augy , under the graph on the usage meter it states that the report may not have the real time measurement of usage due to certain delays in the aggregation of the usage data . The meter is an estimation of usage on the account , but it 's normally correct . I 'd say that you can use the usage meter as a gauge where you are on the monthly limit and see if there 's any irregularities on your end . <p> Ok , this is driving me crazy . I pretty much shut down everything and my usage settles down so I just start to think I have a handle on it and then we have a 30 GB spike today . My kids played some online Xbox games for maybe an hour or two . What is making me nuts is that I have a monitor installed now ( since last week ) and it 's showing I 've used 5 GB in the entire week and less than 1 GB today yet the Mediacom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Frustrating and I feel like I have no control over this .... argh . <p> I know that the meter itself , for its part , may see usage updates delayed by up to 24 hours . Typically , though , it updates regularly through the day and will post the last updated time below the meter . Pulling additional data from the headend end itself , I do see a spike in dowstream usage yesterday from about 2p to about 7p , with the highest usage in the 4p hour . Within this timeframe , usage varied between 19 and 36 Mbps . I 'm unable to identify what , specifically , may have been using data , but this was certainly the highest usage trend throughout the day . <p> Finally figured this out and it turns out I was n't crazy ! I had Mediacom Xtream service installed this morning and the tech noticed there were 2 ' active ' modems on my account . After some research , he figured out that another Mediacom customer 's service was attached to my account and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my data usage went through the roof about a month ago . I 've been fighting this for a few weeks now , basically unplugged and upended my entire network and kicked my kids offline ...

Mediacom billing and tech support said I can be assured I wo n't get billed for this ... I 'm a little skeptical but hope this is finally resolved and behind me . I 'll bet my kids will be , too : - ) <p> Hello Augy , I have checked your current data usage through the usage meter and I am seeing data usage on one modem only from 12/22 to 1/15 for the modem with the mac address of a47a.a47b.b9c9 which is your purchase modem .

If so , we can definitely ship one out to you , and in the meantime you should be able to use any of the other Tivo remotes on that box as well . Be sure to keep us posted ! <p> The tivo and tivo mini 's are all activated thru the tivo website . I did that shortly after the tech who installed it left .

Reviewing your modem , I found that there is signal error in the connection , and it is not updating/communicating with the control panel . This may be why your devices are reporting this error . Often this can be resolved by resetting the modem . Remove the coax cable and power from the modem for one minute . Re-connect the coax then power . It will take 2-4 minutes for the modem to restart . Test the connection . Ultimately it may require a technician to resolve this signal issue . I have scheduled a service appointment for you on January 11th . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for the response . There seems to have been a problem with the modem/router since it was installed . The Tech who installed it was working with Tech Support , and they were not able to communicate with the modem/router to set up the initial settings , and left saying there was a bigger issue that was preventing them being able to see my modem/router . It took about 4 days and multiple resets by me for it to update , and give me the Modem Control Panel option ( previously it would take me to OEM router/modem page ) . <p> You are welcome Foolish501 . The signal error needs to be corrected , and the modem communicating , before additional troubleshooting is completed . I expect it will resolve the issue . We will follow up with you after the appointment . Let me know if you have any other issues . -Sean

@@40219036 @219036/ <h> Author Topic : Getting Nowhere ( Read 241 times ) <p> This is a long post , but I 'm getting no luck going through phone service , online support , or even my local office . <p> I 'll begin by saying that I 've been a Mediacom Internet customer for a long while now and have n't had any real problems outside of the occasional drop in service . It usually comes back up pretty quick , so no gripe there . Also , I 'm at work ( since contacting mediacom after I get off of work is nearly impossible ) so I do n't have my notes with me now , but will do my best from memory ( and then add notes to the post later on ) . <p> On Feb 12th we saw a commercial on TV telling us that we could upgrade to 1 gig internet in our area and so we decided that we 'd upgrade our internet ( which was at 50 mbps ) . So I called on the 12th and spoke with Ashley , who told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my area but that I could upgrade to 200 mpbs for just an additional 20 dollars a month ( which is consistent with the television ads I see ) . That would have brought my total bill up to about 80 dollars a month . Knowing that Ashley suggested that we throw in cable and phone too as it would only be a total of 130 a month . I specifically asked if they could upgrade our internet on that day , or if I would have to wait until the cable installer arrived . Ashley had me check my modem type and after confirmation of the model number told me that my internet could be upgraded to 200 mbps over the phone because my modem was compatible , but that she was unable to do it and would have to transfer me to another dept . I was alright with that , so we scheduled the technician to come out that weekend to install cable and phone and then Ashley transferred me to another dept . I waited about ten minutes on hold and someone answered , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I called back and got someone else on the internet side . Unfortunately I failed to write down there name at the time . He informed me that I could n't upgrade my internet over the phone because I needed a new modem , despite what Ashley had told me only moments earlier . I was upset , but not so upset that I was n't willing to continue . So that person told me to just wait until the installer arrived and that he would be able to get it going . <p> So fast forward to that weekend . The installer shows up , installs cable and phone , and a new giant modem . We check the speed and it only comes up to 70 mbps . At this time he tells me that 's normal and getting 80% of the signal still counts . I told him I had ordered 200 mbps and as such 70 mbps was n't anywhere near 80% . He radio 'd base and confirmed that I was supposed to have 200 mbps . He then checked the lines in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple times to figure out what was going on . Then he assured me that I would have to call the internet dept after he left because they would have to boost the signal in order for me to get 200 mbps . He said the problem was n't on my side , but on the provider side . So he left and I called ( I have the persons name in my notes and will add later ) . The rep there told me that they could n't just boost the signal and that I would have to set up a service appointment . Of course the only times they would send a service tech during the week was hours that I was at work . I 'm furious at this point . I 'm obviously not taking off time at work because Mediacom ca n't provide what they advertise or what I 'm paying for . So after talking with a manager , I schedule another service tech to come out that weekend . The manager graciously tells me that they wo n't charge me for the internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixes it . <p> Fast forward to that weekend . Luke ( I think , I 'll check notes tonight ) is the new installer that they 've sent . He laments the fact that the previous tech did n't know what he was doing and then begins to reinstall everything . Changing a splitter , working on the cable bundle in the wall and checking the line outside . After a couple hours he tells me that he 's got a clear signal outside , but it 's degrading somewhere in the building . So he 's not able to resolve it , but he 's going to call a service tech ( that wo n't be able to make it until tuesday ) and then that should take care of it . He promises that he 'll call me to follow up to make sure the repair went okay and that I 'm getting the internet speeds I signed up for . Tuesday comes and goes and there 's no change in my internet speed and no call from Luke . So I wait another week and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service tech , and I never heard anything from Luke , or any of the managers I 've talked to . Every time I interact with Mediacom I 'm consistently lied to and misled . I got a bill the other day for just about 200.00 and my internet speeds are still at 70 mbps . Beyond that there does n't seem to be any interest in rectifying my problems at all . Every time I call and ask for a manager I 'm told that they 're unavailable and that they 'll have to call me back , which they do n't do or they do at hours that I 'm unavailable even after telling them what hours I 'm available . <p> I 've contacted the Better Business Bureau in Iowa about what my options are . I 've kept all my materials and notes and as such they 're suggesting that I contact an attorney . I thought before I did that , I 'd reach out one final time to see if Mediacom is interested at all in maintaining my business . As it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get my internet speed up to 200 mbps and would rather just go back to the pathetic internet I had for 60 bucks a month because there 's no other cable internet providers in my area . We 're undecided if we 're going to keep the television/phone components because we were told everything would be 130 a month , and our first bill is almost 200.00 . <p> I 've sent a letter to John Cosica ( I think that 's the spelling ) relaying pretty much the same thing that I 'm saying here , but have n't heard anything back and that was a week ago . <p> Is there anybody at Mediacom that cares about this or have I just been scammed ? <p> We are sorry to hear of the poor experience and speeds you have had and would be happy to assist you with these issues in order to find a satisfactory resolution . If you could please PM myself or another active moderator with your phone# , account# or service address we can begin to look into this and make this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us an attempt at correcting this matter . 
@@40219037 @219037/ <h> Mediacom Business in the News <h> top stories about our business <p> Internet provider Mediacom is preparing to install fiber optic internet access for more than 100 businesses in the Ames downtown district this spring . <p> Tom Larsen , Mediacom senior vice president for government and public relations , said the project would reach 62 buildings and 162 businesses downtown . The company is offering the fiber hookups free of charge , he said . <p> The approximate range of the project is Sixth Street and Lincoln Way as the north and south border , with Grand Avenue and Duff Avenue as the east and west borders . <p> The project is part of a three-year , $1 billion investment by Mediacom to improve its services in business districts . Larsen said business owners can get up to 10 gigabits of upload and download speeds under top-tier plans . <p> " It 's bringing more fiber deeper into the cities , " Larsen said .

They can provide internet access with up to hundreds of megabits of upload and download speeds , more than what cable providers can provide with telephone or cable lines . <p> Mediacom is preparing to request construction permits from the city and will begin contacting business and building owners next week . <p> If a business owner refuses to grant Mediacom right of entry for construction , Larsen said the company will build around it . He also said Mediacom will still install fiber free of charge if the building owner changes their mind later . <p> The investment comes after preliminary discussions by the Ames Chamber of Commerce and the city electric department to potentially give Ames-based internet provider ICS a chance to provide fiber to the downtown district using the city 's power vaults . <p> John Hall , business development director at the Chamber , said the move by Mediacom is a win for the district , as current and potential downtown business owners had voiced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while . <p> The Chamber views fiber optic internet as a recruiting tool to tech companies that want easy access to amenities such as coffee shops , restaurants and other services . The idea has been echoed by the Iowa State University Research Park in partnering with Ames Racquet and Fitness and McFarland Clinic to bring a gym and a clinic respectively to the city 's south side . <p> Downtown has the amenities , but not the internet speeds those companies want , and Hall said it 's preventing tech company expansion into the area . <p> " We know of interest from companies who want to be down here , but internet is a barrier that makes that impossible for them to do , " he said . <p> Larsen said construction has been delayed due to poor weather and for planning purposes as the company would need to bore through concrete to install fiber to buildings . He expects construction to begin sometime this spring and finish sometime in the summer . <h> About Us 45223 @qwx455223

You can find the details of the usage allowances per speed tier here : http : **38;992;TOOLONG . This means usage is calculated for each billing period . The data customers send and receive each month will contribute to monthly data usage . Greater usage will result in additional charges of $10 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 50 additional Gigabytes used . For example , if usage on a 250 GB data allowance exceeds the allowance by 51 Gigabytes ( 301 GB ) , an additional charge of $20 will result .

To set a Mediacom email address up you can go here : http : **37;1065;TOOLONG . <p> I have reviewed the usage on your account over the past three months , and the usage was 260 , 188 , and 263 , with the current month at 358 GB with 9 days remaining . I do understand your frustration with the implementation of the data allowances , but only about 3% of our customers exceed their allowance on a regular basis .

@@40219040 @219040/ <h> Industry Insights : Education " Bandwidth Evening the Learning Curve <p> As technology continues to expand and grow , the lines of traditional learning evolve into the digital transformation . New methods for educators to collaborate and communicate , while students discover new ways in which to learn are being created and recreated over time . Online courses , also known as eLearning or virtual classrooms have changed the way students learn . Students of all ages and backgrounds are able to learn and interact with professors and fellow students outside their own campus . <p> Whether teachers are trying to access online curriculum , streaming education live cameras from YouTube or students are simply using the internetall can put a strain on the school network . The evolution in learning and teaching , coupled with the rise of mobile devices , leaves many education facilities across the country scrambling for ways to not only embrace new technologies , but support them , and stay ahead of the curve . Online testing requirements must sustain every student online at the same time . That is a heavy amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Broadband use does n't  stop with students , but is an imperative tool for administration too . Centralization and privacy of student records is critical , along with the ability to access that data from any area in the school district at any given time .

I refused and did not accept anything ( verbal or signed ) . I paid/pay full price every month since the day I first signed up . <p> Hopefully Mike can check my usage . I want to verify it against my wireless router . Everything in my house goes through it and from what I can tell , it is very accurate . I 'm a nut about everything that goes in/out . <p> I think most cable companies have put some sort of cap in place , in the past year . No cable company has said outright it was to keep cable TV customers from leaving for cheaper alternatives online ( streaming ) , but I think basic logic shows this would be the biggest reason why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective to buy only internet and stream everything ( due to caps ) . <p> Most of the companies that have no interest in TV you do n't see these caps with . Such as DSL providers and WISP ( Wireless Internet through Non Cellular ) . <p> I understand the cable companies are only protecting their interests and as any business owner , it sort of makes sense . Business is business . Customers have the right to walk away ( depending on contracts and such ) and choose another service . The only problem though , a lot of folks do not have other options for internet . Usually there is only one cable company in any given area . DSL is n't always available due to distance and Wireless Providers have high expenses to get large antennas up . I 'm lucky enough that i have 2 other options ( Wireless Internet and DSL ) . I would say a lot of others do not . I do n't think it is very fair . <p> You know what I would love to see ? And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan of having Government oversee things ... <p> But just like electric companies and phone companies , force cable companies to allow transmission over their lines . This would allow other cable companies to offer their services to everyone else . Perhaps competition would be a little better . Then 1 cable provider who has a whole area to themselves , ca n't do what ever it is they want . A smaller cable provider could ' use their lines ' ( fees would apply but would have to be minimal based on what the government allows ) and take away that cable provider 's customers . OR the cable provider in that area will have to be a little better about pricing/options ( or risk loosing customers ) . <p> Who knows what is going to happen ... this is just business and one company ruling over an entire ' area ' with other options being unavailable .

My son came over today so he can be here tomorrow to be here for the appointment . He has had Mediacom Internet before where he lives and has told me that my setup may be wrong . I did a room rearange in the room where the modem is 2 weeks ago which resulted in unhooking and hooking the cables back up . My son was here that last time we had issues after we switched service to just internet from Phone and TV and my son remembers the technician saying we were too hot do to downgrading service which resulted in a " coupler " I think that 's what it 's called . It 's opposite of a splitter its suppose to degrade the signal . Anyways the way I have it hooked up is in the In part of the " coupler " is where the cable comes out of the wall and the Out part of the " coupler " is where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or should it be the opposite ? Also could you check my signal to noise ratio on my box now and see what it shows ? Is it hot ? To fill you in on what was happening was the modem kept rebooting itself and was not wanting to stay online and the speeds were slower than normal . However for the last couple days things seem to be fine and I was told when I made the appointment last week that if the problem lay on my end I would be charged for the service call and I was wanting to avoid a charge if at all possible . Also we have had a bunch of snow here and just had a snow storm the night after the problems which may of resulted in a city wide issue not my modem specifically . Your help would be appreciated in regards to my situation in hopes that maybe the issue is solved or can be solved without the tech and a charge . Would you please help . <p> ThanksBetty <p> BettyD : Also a side note when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are on Mediacom Prime at 15 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload but about a week ago I changed my speed to Mediacom Ultra . Why is n't showing up in the usage report however my speeds are that of Mediacom Ultra . <p> MediacomTim : Hello BettyD and thank you for contacting us here about the issues . I was able to verify when you stated that you had a tech visit . I also looked over the modem , and currently all signal levels are reporting within range . The issue very well could be a splitter , or coupler . The tech will be able to verify this when he comes out . <p> I have also checked the account and can see that your Usage Tracker is showing Prime service . We will make sure this issue is addressed and the correct service level is updated on there . <p> BettyD : Thanks for your reply back and the information you have provided me . Just out of curiosity while I was waiting I switched the " coupler " around the other way and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I switched it back the other way and then it was just fine . I also googled about a " couple " and I found a diagram of how to hook one up and the way I had it and have it now is right . If it 's okay I think I will cancel my appointment but before I do could you maybe explain why the modem would reboot itself and also when unplugged and plugged back in the DS and US light on modem would both blink ? Could weather of been a cause of my issue ? Because if everything shows it okay now ( from your test ) that 's the way it has always been since the last change when they put the thing on so then I assume I am good because it was fixed correctly then . My best guess would be weather or a city wide issue because of it or maybe even a Mediacom national issue if there was an outage of some kind . Also can you tell me how long it will take for the Mediacom Usage Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Betty <p> MediacomTim : There are a variety of things that cause disrupt service as our service runs through the cable lines . Extreme weather changes can and do make the line expand and contract , which will affect TV , Internet and phone . <p> If you are n't having any issues after looking this up and verifying it is correct , then we can go ahead and cancel it from here . <p> Also the meter can take 24-48 hours after we submit the ticket to be updated .

But can I have too many devices for my modem and router to handle ? I am currently on Prime Plus and it is running GREAT by the way ! ! : - ) I have done a complete reboot of everything I own.My problem is after a few minutes my Netgear wndr4300 router keeps dropping all my wireless devices . Then I rebootthe router again and it finds just some of the devices but not all . But again what it does find it only stays for a short time and then it 's gone . <p> I want to upgrade my internet to Ultra and get a new router but I need to find out if I can have ultra at my location.Tried to search online but no luck . <p> Hello , good question ! In the past , many models have seen wireless limitations of about 16 devices or so , along with 4 wired ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than this , however . Numbers can be different depending on the hardware , so it would be important to consult your device documentation for more information . Regardless of the devices connection , you will of course impact overall performance as the number increases . Because all devices share your one internet connection ( currently at Prime Plus 50 Mbps ) , then you should assume that this is split between all those devices . It wo n't be an even split , of course , depending on the functions , applications , and current usage of the device . Even so , though , with devices dropping the wireless completely and not just taking a speed hit , etc. , that could indicate a capacity issue with the router . <p> In your area , all speeds up to Ultra Plus are available , so upgrade opportunities are possible ! <p> That 's what I am thinking too . I am trying to run 15 to 16 devices and I have had this Netgear wndr4300 for about 3 years now ( I think ) . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way around . <p> So who do I email , or call to upgrade to Ultra ? Also will I be using the same modem or will it involve getting a different one ? <p> The modem that you have now is DOCSIS 3.0-compliant , so you wo n't need to switch things up there . We 're unable to process upgrades resulting in billable changes here on the forums , but if you 'd like I can have an agent contact you to get this rolling . We can also be reached any time at 866-452-4747 . From there , the ugprade will take a few minutes and can be done completely remote . By the time you hang up the phone , the modem should be provisioned for the new speeds . Just let us know ! <p> Wow ! How painless was that ! ! I did everything I needed to do in Chat . I went with Ultra Plus and got it all done and flying in less than 15 minutes.Great customer service today . Now for a new router . Got my eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to hear !

As of now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for locations , unfortunately . Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns . <p> I am very glad that this upgrade happened , 1 gbit/sec sounds really awesome , and happy that Google brought competition and we are seeing it all happen in all markets . <p> Here are some of my suggestions : <p> 1 . I think that Internet should be Unlimited like it is in whole world done , please guys sell Speed of Access . We all have streaming devices at home , xbox , smart tv , whole family of people wanting to use it all at same time , some people downloading games through steam ( GTA5 itself weighs 60GB ) , Windows 10 like crazy likes updates and it is not even possible turn off , Android is all about updates , bunch of demos on Playstation and Xbox networks , also Windows and Xbox insiders get stuff from Internet often , important and helpful tips on YouTube . Would be very awesome to have it all Unlimited . <p> 2 . Which technology will be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiber as soon as possible , I know that you try to use existing wire structure as long as possible coming into people 's houses , but days of copper are over , signal in copper atenuates , future is fiber . Use the best wire for each task , send Internet to house through fiber , tv send to house through coaxial cable and phone send through rj11 . In such way everything will be stable because coaxial is actually more suited for transmitting tv signals either analog or digital . <p> 4 . I know that 1gbit/sec is awesome but I think that in order to make system ahead of everybody and to make sure that there are no delays at all and enough bandwidth for everybody , I think that it is possible to think about 10gbit/sec . It could be direct fiber to everybody or shared NGEPON 2 . <p> 5 . We all know that companies with telephone legacy or the ones with TV legacy ( cable ) afraid to get rid of legacy , afraid to think innovative , but we all know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is , should be there one fiber for all triple play services or each service should have its own dedicated fiber in order to be really stable service ? Also companies with telephone legacy should not use telephone legacy based GPON but instead switch to GEPON which is based on Ethernet and we all know that Ethernet is base of Internet.I would be very happy if companies would get rid of its telephone and cable legacy and would start think that they have Internet legacy and would treat Internet the most important . <p> Hello LinuxFun , thank you contacting us via Mediacom Forums ! We are very glad to hear that you appreciate the recent the strides that we have made with keeping up with current DOCSIS technology with our upgrade to 1Gig service .

Apparently last month I went over my allowance starting back on the 19th of Feb .

As it stands right now my bill is $183.53 --- on a fixed income of less than $850 . By their billing guides I would have used 250 GB of my normal allowance plus an additional 600 GB which equals to 850 GB ? Is this POSSIBLE ? I will be calling Mediacom ASAP . Since I ? ve been on a fixed income since last Spring I ? ve dropped my cellular service and have to use friends/ family phones to make calls but I thought I start here until I can call or go to their offices . <p> Because usage is a combined total of upload and download traffic , it is possible to reach this number with regular high usage .

If your going to charge me $2.65 a month to PAY FOR OTHER PEOPLES ENTERTAINMENT , then i 'm most likely going to cancel my TV service completely and just have internet service . <p> From what i have heard from other customers here in town this surcharge is not going over to well ... But hey , its good for Dish and DirecTV to get new customers i guess ! <p> They could and should have said , " No , thanks . " Time to test the theory that sports really is that important to most consumers . Now that cable ops have more broadband than video customers , they 've crossed the line where they have more leverage with programmers . <p> I do n't give two cents for sports ... When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its on the radio i change stations , when its a local game i do n't go ... Period .. Just not into sports , never have been never will . <p> Directv has a regional sports charge as well . I 'm sure Dish is not far behind . You should really blame Disney/Espn ... Mediacom had no control over where to put it . <p> Yes , if you have a package with sports channels , but they have packages without sports channels and no surcharge . The problem is with Mediacom is if you get Family Cable , which is the lowest package you can get other than basic cable , which i can get the same channels off antenna anyway , your stuck with sports channels you never watch .

The SNR is important because if there is too much noise on the cable , the data can not be decoded correctly , even with downstream power levels within acceptable limits .

As the SNR decreases below 30 dB , performance will steadily decrease , and errors will increase . The cable modem might stop working properly if the SNR drops below 23.5 dB . <p> Downstream Received Power : the DOCSIS specification requires cable modems to function correctly with downstream power levels in the range -15 dBmV to +15 dBmV : power readings at or close to those extremes are likely to be unacceptable . However , when connected to a real-life CATV network , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Accordingly , cable ISPs will specify an even narrower target range when commissioning their network : this target range will differ according to ISP . <p> If a cable modem reports a downstream receive power of exactly 0.0 dB , this means that measurement of downstream power is disabled , and no information is available . In this case , you will need to judge downstream quality by SNR alone . <p> Upstream Transmit Power : the cable modem 's Upstream Transmit Power ( or return power ) is set by commands from the UBR so that the UBR hears the same signal level from all cable modems on that upstream channel . Because of different cable losses for each cable modem in the area , each cable modem will tend to settle onto a different upstream transmit power level . The better the return path is , the lower the upstream transmit power will be . <p> The upstream transmit power will lie within the range +8 to +58 dBmV , with many ISPs specifying a target commissioning level below +55 dBmV . Values in the forties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transmit any more powerfully than +58 dBmV . One can not tell how far this is below the figure that the UBR would need to see a strong enough signal at its end to maintain satisfactory performance , so a figure as high as +58 dBmV is normally a sign of an unacceptable return path . If other problem symptoms are also present , an upstream transmit power of +58 dBmV would constitute valid supporting evidence for requesting technical support from a cable ISP . <p> The upstream SNR can be sensed only at the UBR , so can not be discovered by end-users . <p> The external cable infrastructure is affected by weather conditions , so it is normal to see power levels fluctuating slowly with temperature .

There was some maintenance in your area overnight which is now complete and I see your modem is back online . There is one signal level off that the history shows has been running a bit high for a while . Do you see a splitter on the coax cable line that connects to the modem ? A bad splitter can cause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high transmit the modem will start to reset itself to try to overcome it . If there is a splitter , we would need to try taking it off the line for a few minutes to see if the levels adjust . If there is not a splitter , we can try a hard reset of the modem to clear out any static that may have built up on the line . To do this we 'll need to pull the power cord directly from the back of the modem and then unscrew the coax cable from the back of the modem as well . Wait about 30 seconds , then reconnect the power , and then screw the coax cable back on . When the modem has come completely back up , we 'll see if the transmit power has improved and if not , we 'll need to get a tech out there before the modem gets fried . Would you be able to try these things and let me know how it goes ? <p> Okay thanks ! It looks like transmit levels are still quite high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get this back in line . If bypassing splitters , etc. proves fruitless , then it may ultimately be best to have a technician investigate further on-site . If needed , we can have this appointment scheduled . <p> I 'm showing some other modems offline at this time but I see your modem is currently online . The upstream RX is still on the lower side though . Once you get home would you be able to check for those splitters and/or amplifiers and bypass them if possible ? <p> I did see the upstream TX was quite high and the upstream RX was too low . At this time though they 're currently within range though . These fluctuating signal levels could be caused by the splitter so I 'd like to bypass them temporarily to see if this improves the consistency of the signal levels . <p> is it still showing high , and could it be caused by all the issues you are having ? Internet has gone down multiple times , sometimes for hours and hours and everytime I check there are multiple modems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little while ago . <p> The trouble with these power levels is likely causing the intermittency , as the modem will cycle as these fluctuate in an effort to manage them .

@@40219071 @219071/ <p> This is a modem firmware issue . IT is denoted by the date and time stamp that confirms this along with this message and a reboot . <p> I was wrong when I said T3 . It is T4 timeout and the modem will reboot.You ' ' ll see it from time to time in the logs . Obviously , when it occurs you lose connection . <p> There 's also two iterations that are floating around on this modem.There is an OEM brown box being sold on Amazon and Ebay.And there is a white one which is RETAIL . <p> The white one 's already have up to date firmware that fix this problem.The OEM brown boxes are colored black modems . They are both 6141 's , however.Also the black one does not have color coded ports on the back like the white one does . <p> The issue is according to Motorola is that the brown box OEM 's were intended for cable operators but got out into the retail channel . Those boxes will work and have the same hardwareas the retail white box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown box one 's that are black may have out of date firmware causing the T4 timeout message . <p> I did n't learn of this unfortunately until it was too late after I purchased it.So I got stung with a black box with older firmware . This had a bad impact onTime Warners and Comcasts network since many people who bought them were calling in with modem issues.Motorola did not intend for those OEM models to reach customers this way . <p> WIth that said I 'm providing all of this information to Mediacom including the informationabout the firmware version that it is broken in . I explained above already which versionsfix this and can only be pushed out by the cable operators as Comcast and Time Warner did.Motorola will not provide the firmware to the end users . So some of us who got screwed on gettingthese black box ones are susceptible to the bug . It sucks but when someone is being shadyon the internet at Amazon or Ebay and does n't come clean about the OEM models having buggedfirmware from the retail versions it impacted MOtorolas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I felt strongly to share this with Mediacom as soon as I learned of this since I am affected by the timeout problem due to older firmware . I can only pray and hope Mediacomdecides to support and push Motorola 's newer firmware out that will fix it.OTherwise I got stung and have to live it or go buy the retail model . This definitely was n't worth saving5 dollars I 'll tell you that . Because it causes the customer to have to ask there operator to updatetheir modems since MOtorola wo n't give us the firmware . <p> Thanks again . I hope all this is useful I 'm willing to be it comes up again ........ In the near future as people start buying them and wind up with a OEM black model.It would be nice if Motorola would provide those users the firmware.But nope cable operators only policy . <p> lakesideguy : Well Tommy sorry for so many replies . <p> I think the FINAL solution was I just opened up an ebay dispute since the modem technically is faulty.I can not rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to push the firmware . <p> So , I think somehow maybe you can sticky this as a warning to ANYONE purchasing aSB6141 do not purchase the OEM brown box for use on Mediacoms network.The firmware may be out of date and the retail white version is up to date and does not experirence the T4 timeout and cable modem reboot . <p> This will save alot of head aches.It does n't seem to happen with everyone but so far Time Warner and now I jsut confirmed Mediacom.If you have an OEM brown box denoted by the black casing of a SB6141 you most likelygot bugged firmware that needs updating and may not work reliably on your network.The white box most likely will work fine . <p> I 'll be confirming that veyr soon as I just bought another one.The OEM brown boxes are seen as being sold on EBAY and AMAZON.And the sellers are being very deceptive saying they are new modems not mentioning they are OEM brown boxesand not retail versions of this modem . <p> Now you know why they are hiding this . That 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a big headache as I just showed Mediacom in my log file.Motorla was dead right about this one . <p> MediacomMichael : You 're welcome ! Please keep us updated on the status of the new modem . Have a great night . <p> lakesideguy : Hi Tommy , <p> I 'm pleased to report the retail modem does work fine . The T4 timeout message I showed you that occurs about once an hour has stopped . <p> And I went and looked at the modem firmware . Guess what ? It 's the Motorla 1.0.6.8 the one that Motorola says fixes the problem.Furthermore , it 's fact the retail SB6141 modem is WHITE not black . <p> The black one had 1.0.6.6 that I showed and is OEM brown box . I 'd have to sayif your on Mediacom 's network stay away from the OEM brown box SB6141 . The firmware is out of date.But the white one is fine and dandy . <p> This should really help Mediacom in the future as this issue with the SB6141 comes up.Just ensure they have got the firmware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modelthen there should n't be any problem . But if you choose to put supported or workingmodem *untested for now it is fact SB6141 white retail with firmware 1.0.6.8 works fine.OEM brown box with firmware below that does not work on Mediacom reliably .

@@40219080 @219080/ <h> Author Topic : Another one about burying cable ( Read 329 times ) <p> I 've had some intermittent internet problems over the past few months , and it 's been worse the last couple weeks . A lot of drops and unusably slow speeds that required power cycling the modem . I also have pretty bad tiling on HD channels and DVR audio/video is never synced . I finally decided to get a tech out here . The first thing he says when he walks in the door ? " We were doing some main line maintenance last week about the time you reported the issue . I bet they did n't tell you that on the phone huh ? " I said " Nope , sure didn't. " and showed him to my modem . He tested and saw that the signal was n't great , so he swapped out the 1000mhz 2-way splitter at the demarc with a 1200mhz and replaced the 2-3 foot piece of RG59 with RG6 that went from the demarc into my basement . He literally just pushed the new cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Easy job . <p> After it was all said and done , he said signals looked good . We tested my internet for latency and speed , checked HD ... all looked good . I casually mentioned that I 'd like to upgrade to 200mbps service ( or higher ) since I work from home , but I could n't talk myself into the extra cost since my connection was flaky . He said something to the effect that even though signals looked good , there was actually a little feedback in the line coming in . He said it would probably help if he replaced it , especially if I was considering upgrading my service . The inside of my house is a little older and wired with 59 , but we are almost done finishing our basement and that 's all brand new 6 . Once that 's done in a few weeks , my modem and our main DVR will be on the new stuff . So I thought , eh why not ? It does n't really need to happen right now , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said he did n't have the stuff with him so he 'd have to make an appointment to come back . No problem . It 's only 200ft from the post to my house , and being a former Mediacom installer I figured he 'd be back sometime this week with a roll of RG11 and a cable spade and be done with it in and hour . We made the appointment and the time frame I was given was 8am - 8pm yesterday . He came around 3:45 , cut the old cable outside my demarc , ran the new cable and hooked it up . Then he got in his truck and left ... with 200ft of RG11 laying on the ground . But it was almost 5:00 , so I figured it was quitting time and he 'd be back to finish up another day . <p> There is no visual property line markers between my back yard , my neighbor , and the park/playground it connects to . Just open grass . He dropped the line between a couple trees on my side and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my neighbor 's property line to the post . It ended up only a few feet away from a basketball pad . I looked out the window today and saw some kids playing with it , so I decided to call to see when he 'd be back . It was cold and snowy/rainy today so I was n't really expecting him , but I thought it was a little odd that I did n't get a phone call to let me know when he would be back . In my head I 'm just thinking that I do n't want to have to worry about my 2 and 3 year old boys messing with it ; and that mowing for me , my neighbor , and the park will be a bit of a pain while it 's there . It 's a 3.5 acre park . That dude on the mower is not going to slow down every swipe back and forth to move a cable . <p> So you can imagine my surprise when I was informed that he was only there to run the line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to actually put it in the ground . They could only tell me that it would be done sometime between now and NOVEMBER 1 ! ! That 's craziness ! Why would the tech not tell me that ! ? There is no way I would have agreed to replacing the line ( especially considering the fact that it was n't completely necessary ) if I thought it might be laying on the ground all summer long ! The best part of the story is that my internet went down twice today ! I have had no problems at all since he replaced the RG6 and splitter . But of course when I call tech support I get nothing but the same basic troubleshooting steps that I 've done a million times and the offer to send a tech out to take a look next week . To look at what , I do n't know . The brand new drop laying on the grass ? <p> Internet dropping out today is one issue , but I can chalk that up as being a fluke for now . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me an idea of when it 's going to be buried ? Is " Sometime before November 1 " really the best I can get ? I just have to wait all summer and hope that kids on the playground leave it alone ? Or that the other people that have to mow over it do n't just say screw it and cut it ? I have a damn cable spade in my garage . What happens if I just go ahead and lay it in the ground an inch to get it out of the way ? Will the bury crew come out and do the full job " sometime before November " , or will that void some service agreement ? I 'm really amazed at this situation . I do n't remember anything remotely like this happening when I worked for Mediacom . How is possible that an installer is n't able to run 200ft ground drop without a bury crew ? <p> ( To be clear - I 'm definitely not upset with the tech in the slightest bit . He did n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect . Where he put the cable makes sense . If it was underground . ) <p> Hello , jkarns ! Thank you for contacting us on our forums .

When compared to using SIP trunks via the internet , we can remove the FXO cards , The " 2-pair " wires and the Phone Modem from the equation , thus eliminating 3 points of failure as well as significant cost on both parties . <p> Also , I would like to add : Currently , the phone modems are limited to ( 4 ) lines , which means that you need an additional phone modem for every 4 lines . A company that had 12 phones lines and 2 fax lines would need ( 4 ) of those phone modems ( which I believe exceeds what Mediacom currently allows , per coaxial drop ) . Using SIP trunks ( and with the increased speed of the HSD ) , companies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I have added a diagram featuring both setups , the one on the top being the current way of connecting a VoIP system to the Mediacom phone service and the one on the bottom illustration what COULD be eliminated if SIP trunks were supported . <p> I hope this makes sense as well as makes its way to the proper division/department . <p> Does anyone know whether or not this is something that is being worked on ? It seems most of the other common telecom providers ( ATT , Cox , Verizon , Comcast , Brighthouse ) all have SIP trunking services available . <p> Hi ECC-Clinic , at this time we are not working on something like this for residential lines . For the business side , I would need to have someone from business contact you to see if there is something we can do to make something like this work for you . Can you PM me your telephone# so I can have someone reach out to you ? <p> Trunkless SIP can work fine if you keep several things in mind.1 . Your firewall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall shop . If you VoIP provider can not enter a range of address then most firewalls have chance of not working . Only Edgewater devices have true consistent NAT . What happens is the device tries to be to smart and rehashes the registration port . The Edgewater/Edgemark device is built for QoS with focus on VoIP2 . In my opinion you needs at least a 2Mbs up connection to maintain proper SIP performance . SIP can run fine of HDSL this is a 1.5MB connection ( Most premise site to site Hybrid and pure VoIP PBX are setup this way . ) Depending on the outgoing/incoming call loads . Makes me wonder why Mediacom stopped offering the 10/2 business connection now you have to order 10/1 or jump to 20/2.3 . The last comes from experience . Look at any off site backups . Make sure you throttle these during business hours . Again I run Datto and have certification in these . These offsite methods include Dropbox , Datto , and any other cloud based backup device .

@@40219090 @219090/ <p> Here is the irony Severe weather is in the area , the local news interrupts the programming to explain details and the affected areas of the approaching storm--details specific to my local area , then suddenly the entire television is frozen with a National severe warning with details of a storm 80 miles away I am unable to interrupt this to get back to the local weather alert . Instead I have to wait while the mediacom alert is being broadcast . <p> Does this really make sense ? I realize that there are legal or maybe FCC regulations on alerts but locking the box down and preventing the user from tuning into more specific and relevant information is ridiculous-- and could even be life-threatening . <p> Even our mobile devices have opt-out capabilities . This really needs to be added into our cable system or at least the ability to cancel the cable system alert and return to local , relevant programming . <p> I agree with this statement 100% , Instead of local news and weather/radar it cuts away to an annoying crawl and message with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fixed soon I 'm about ready to switch back to Satellite that never interrupted . <p> Hello kevin65804 , thank you for the feedback . While we want to make the service as customizable and user-controlled as possible , sometimes we are required by legal requirements to broadcast things , such as EAS messages , crawls , and alerts over broadcasting . We will gladly let the appropriate parties know that you dislike this though , to make sure your voice is heard . <p> You may be missing the point It 's not that the crawlers are n't necessary or legally required it is your implementation of them You disable all controls of the box so the viewer has no ability to bypass the crawler . <p> Every other modern communication device has either opt-out options or the ability to suspend/delay , interrupt these messages . I have actually reviewed TiVos implementation of this , and even though I 'm not a legal expert , I do not see where the FCC has indicated that the viewer must watch alerts that are not relevant to them while being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their safety . <p> In my example from last nights storm , I had to shut off the cable box and try to watch antenna TV to get the necessary emergency information that I needed to be prepared for the approaching storm because the crawler kept interrupting every time there was a storm alert within what appeared to be a 100 mile radius This included thunderstorm warnings which we were already aware of , for other viewing areas , while I was watching a tornado alert on local news This is counterintuitive at best . <p> Again , does the FCC require that these messages be force-fed to the viewer in spite of other options that are available through the same device ? Last night brought it to my attention more than ever because it was extremely frustrating and a bit scary to know that I can not rely on the information available on my cable providers equipment during an emergency . To have a local news announcer mention an approaching tornado and about to give the details and specifics of its approach then have the screen go dark with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make sense This is not a reasonable implementation of the FCC regulation . <p> Since your cable network is unable to determine the location of the alerts with respect to the viewers location such as our weather alert radios and mobile phones do , I think there should be an exception to allow a viewer to override the message based on their own decision making process . <p> And while we are talking about regulations , were you aware of your test broadcasts that were being issued while severe weather was in the area I 'm pretty sure that this too is not a proper or reasonable implementation of the regulations presented . Albeit a random chance , NWS does not issue tests in areas where severe weather is active . <p> Hello Kevin , I apologize for the emergency broadcast system alerts , and for you not being able to close them . We have no control over this as the FCC can interrupt programming to give the emergency information.The FCC works with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's National Weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President determines when the EAS will be activated at the national level , and has delegated the administration of this function to FEMA . Accordingly , FEMA activates the national EAS , and directs national EAS tests and exercises . The NWS uses the EAS on a local and statewide basis to provide the public with alerts and warnings regarding dangerous weather and other emergency conditions . <p> The EAS allows participating providers to send and receive emergency information quickly and automatically , even if their facilities are unattended . If one link in the system for spreading emergency alert information is broken , members of the public have multiple alternate sources of warning . EAS equipment also provides a method for automatic interruption of regular programming , and in certain instances is able to relay emergency messages in languages other than English . <p> I 've actually made myself familiar with the published FCC requirements documents ... I do n't see where it states that the device must be inoperable during the broadcast . It states that participating cable systems must visually and aurally transmit the EAS data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewing local , real-time ( not automated ) weather information that may make us safer in the process of complying with FCC regulations ? And the Presidential communication order crap you quoted is n't applicable here ... this clearly falls under state and local activation for non-authenticated message broadcasting which includes NWS , and NOAA EMS alerts . <p> For example , you could overlay the message on the current broadcast like you do with your internet traffic with packet injection <p> Thank you for bringing your concerns about this to our attention . We will make sure this is forwarded to the appropriate department , and if any changes are made in the future , we will let all of our customers know . <p> I get EAS test all the time and it is very annoying . On the test it says what counties it is for and most of the time it is n't for the county I live in . This has resulted in having 5-6 test in a week . I do n't understand why Mediacom sends test to customers outside of the test area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers outside of the test are it is a failure of the test . Like the original post stats this can lead to a very dangerous situation when you are trying to find out what is going on with the weather and it is interrupted by a warning that is outside your county . This is not something Mediacom should take lightly and should fix it immediately . If this continues I will consider contacting the FCC and see what the think . <p> Hello hinebaud , thank you for your post . The EAS test is determined by the geographical location of the head end . Depending on the location where services originate , the information provided in the EAS messaging you 've received could be some distance away . Regardless , this feedback has been acknowledged and directed to our management team for further review .

People are happy to pay , as long as it 's what they agreed to . <p> I 'm glad you came into this market - you 'll eat the competitors ' lunch . <p> The 1gbps service does run over the coax so there 's no need to wait and have fiber ran to the home . You will need to use our modem though and at this time there 's not self install option available so a tech will need to come out and install these services . The quoted price of $149.99 does not include the modem rental or any federal , state , or local taxes . We 're always working towards upgrading our network so hopefully these higher upload speeds will be available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have any timeline we can supply . <p> I 'm surprised they have n't been advertising it more heavily here in Columbia/Jefferson City MO , where it is available . Maybe that 's coming . <p> I suppose they are working out and testing their pricing ( and service delivery ) here . Right now it 's not part of any bundle , and it 's somewhat overpriced for the consumer market . I wonder why lower price/higher volume would n't yield more revenue than high price with fewer customers . <p> And I wish it were more symmetrical ( it 's 1000/50 ) . The competitor in our market is offering fiber BIDIRECTIONAL ( 1000/1000 ) but even though they spent a fortune to run fiber to homes , they ca n't deliver gigabit on the networking side - they have the physical plant but do n't know what they 're doing .

I 'm pretty sure it is easy to set up in the system somewhere some toggles for customers who either want their service to be interrupted if they go over or throttled if they go over instead of getting overuse fees . <p> It is true that all residential customers will be migrated to usage based billing , effective September 7th . However , this is unlikely to affect the vast majority of our customer base from a billing perspective . <p> please think about what your saying before you say it .. this WILL EFFECT EVERYONE as it applies to everyone .. from a billing perspective <p> i find it quite funny that i got a call tonight from your company telling me that from june to july , i went over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the lady had the gall to ask me if i was happy with my " cap " amount .... <p> first of all , i see this as mediacom trying to cover their butts now to make everyone aware of the cap that they should n't have a right to place in the first place on contracts that are well over a year old because at the time of the contract , your company knew dang well they were slipping the data cap stuff in and DID NT TELL ANYONE knowing that if some point down the road , they had some loophole to get more money out of their customers .... that 's all i see this as , and you guys can say what you will , but i think that 's how most of us feel .... we feel cheated and scammed <p> ive said it from the time i found out about these caps that if mediacom wants to cap people , that 's well and good as long as its the new customers or existing customers ( and not the ones you failed to tell about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFTER you guys decided to enforce the cap .... which basically means that no one and i repeat no one should be held to the cap that did n't  make a change or a new sign up within the last 14 days or so .... <p> and on top of all that ... your company does n't  give us any options ..... does n't  give us any deals , and wants to charge people that legitly have a reason to get out of their contract that you have now changed .... where is the good will towards long time customers ? wheres any deals or promotions for them ? Oh wait there is none unless you havnt had that particular service , then you get some kind of break .... must feel real good to be the only game in town for most people .... must feel good to treat your customers like dirt and force them into paying for things they should n't have to ... hopefully mediacom smartens up in the next 13 days and does the right thing and does not go through with this unfair new demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not , i can see a ton of people leaving your service ... <p> I got this lovely little message on my browser today ... " We are writing to inform you about changes Mediacom is making to its Internet terms of service . Although these changes won ? t affect the way about 98% of our customers use the Internet or how much the service costs , we want you to understand the changes and tell you how to see if they will affect you . <p> Effective 9/18/2013 0:00 , your monthly data usage allowance will be 150GB . The changes will only affect you if you use more than 150GB during your monthly billing cycle . Mediacom 's Always Faster Internet customers ' median monthly data usage is currently under 14 GB per month . You can easily check to see how much data you have used by going to http : **30;1448;TOOLONG . Your login credentials are your Mediacom email address and password . If you use less than 150GB , these changes won ? t affect you unless you increase your usage . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are approaching your usage allowance at 75% , 85% and 95% and when you have exceeded it . If you exceed your allowance during a monthly billing cycle , you will automatically be billed for additional above-allowance usage in 50 GB blocks at $10 per block . <p> You can control the amount of data you use by how you use your service . The amount of data you use is largely impacted by your online activities , not just the amount of time you spend online . For example , you could spend hours on Facebook , checking e-mails , or surfing the Web , and use less than 1 GB of data . On the other hand , you could spend 30 minutes downloading a movie and use 2 GB . Put simply , it 's what you do with the Internet that affects your usage , not the time you spend on it . <p> If you want to have a higher data allowance , the Mediacom Online service plans are now scaled for various levels of use , ranging from lower cost options with slower speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for the light users of the Internet , to premium service levels with very fast speeds and data usage allowances of 350 GB and 999 GB . <p> If you want to change your level of service , if you are concerned about these changes or want to cancel your service , please call us at 866-746-7314 or visit us online at http : **35;1480;TOOLONG . By continuing to use the service , you agree to these changes . <p> We appreciate your business , and thank you for choosing Mediacom to be your Internet service provider . " <p> I do not agree to this ! When I signed up over a year ago , the man who was helping me get set up , told me there would be no monthly download limit . Since I signed up I 've had constant issues with my internet , multiple reps come out , dozens of phone calls , and still having the same issues . Just last night I called to complain and was " told " it would be escalated . That gave me a little hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now a download limit ? What kind of bs is that , mid contract as well ? The service I 've had for over a year now has been extremely unreliable . I 've had enough . I ca n't afford to pay for a service I 'm hardly recieving half of the time and defiantly wo n't be paying even more for service that puts a limit on how much I can use . Again , I do not agree to this change . I 'm going to be looking into new ISPs . <p> Hi , Courtney , when did you created this email account ? It can take up to 24 hours before the address is synced with meter and TV Everywhere services , so if it was very recent , it may throw errors at you . <p> i am in the 15 down 1 up package and have been for years . last month i was at 247gb for the month . my question is. if you can legally enforce this cap , then why do n't  you actually cap my 15downat 15down ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well over 20 down . so i am using up more data in a lower capped package at your companies doing without my permission . people may not know that mediacom allows 20 mbps downloads because of bad company rating on there interent and by this happening we are being spoon fed more data as a result . can this be explained to me ? <p> my other thing . am i currently being monitored to be charged for my next billing it be another billing cycle before i see over fees if i get ? i played my ps3 for 2 hours and watched some non hd children netflix channels with my kids and already used 9.3 gb of data and its only been a day in in half since no one was home on august 23 when my cycle starts <p> i just did this speed test . if you are going to cap people , then do n't  misslead by giving more . <p> All of our modems are provisioned for use with their respective tiers , though you may at times see speeds equal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regardless of provisioned speed , this does not necessarily indicate that you will reach an allowance faster . Streaming a two hour movie will use the same data amount , regardless of speed at which it is streamed . Playing games online will transfer the same data regardless , though you may see performance issues at lower speeds , etc . <p> Usage based billing begins after September 7 , 2013 at the beginning of the upcoming cycle . If your cycles begin on the 23rd , then this will be September 23rd , etc . Usage can be tracked with the meter found here : http : **34;1517;TOOLONG using a Mediacom email address and password to log in . If one of these needs to be established , that can be done here : http : **36;1553;TOOLONG . <p> i played4 hours of ps3 and it used 8 gb of data . you guys keep saying look at the usage report . the usage report says that 8gb is equal to 400+ hours of gaming . mediacom has always claimed to be xbox certified which tells me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours possibly equal 400+ hours ? i only ask because if you keep telling people to check and give them these values they will never be able to figure out where to cut back on <p> I registered just to state my disappointment in mediacom . For years we 've been sold on unlimited internet , just to be hit with a cap . I am unsure what my data usage is . Considering we get all off our entertainment through the internet i fear my years of loyalty will be abused for an easy buck . I do not enjoy being capped ask my old cell provider . I will be shopping around and i wo n't be bragging about media on any longer . <p> The total for the day will take into account everything that utilized date- upload and download . This does n't only include online gaming on the PS3 , but all Netflix streaming performed , any downloaded or uploaded files , web browsing , other internet streaming , etc. , etc . While this may be equivalent to 400+ hours of online gaming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content . <p> I 'm getting a Mediacom message at the top of Explorer notifying me of a rate increase for data usage then the message directs you to verify receipt of the message below . When you look at the bottom of the message it is n't for verification that you received the message , its a box that says that you agree to the rate increase . <p> Notice verification and rate increase agreement are two different things and its a sleazy way to get people to agree to the new terms . Not that you need a customer to agree but why do it in this manner ? <p> Logged 45222 @qwx455222 <p> We do understand your frustration with these changes . The new data allowances will not go into effect until 9/7/13 . Currently only about 3% of our customers go over their allotted allowance that they will be placed on . We do not want any of our customers to go over , so we are giving everyone the option to upgrade . I have looked over your usage over the past month , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 250 GB allowance you will be on . <p> If you would like to have a representative contact you to go over your usage , and possibly any upgrade offers we have in your area , feel free to send any of our Moderators here with a good contact number and time in which you would like for someone to call . 
@@40219099 @219099/ <p> Last Friday evening , I signed up for Mediacom 's Prime Plus internet ( 50 mbps down &amp; 5 mbps up ) for $39.99 per month for the 1st 12 months , plus a $49.99 installation fee and $10 activation fee that they will discount to $0 . They are wanting $7.50 per month for the modem lease and $3.95 per month for the WIFI or I could use my own . Thus , since I hate renting anything , I asked the sales rep ( Phillipines based ) what modemrouter they recommended I purchase . She would only tell me one that was docsis 3.0 . <p> Thus , today I started researching online at Staples and ending up calling my local store ( Iowa ) which one they recommended . He said that they knew of some compatibility issues with some netgear models and thus did n't recommend any of them . Then , they said they did n't have any that would work . Found that hard to believe . <p> Thus , I called Mediacom and spoke with a customer service rep for awhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technicolor modems . He then said that I can buy a modem from them for $89.99 on sale ( regularly $150 ) and it would be docsis 3.0 and capable of wifi , thus eliminating my need for rental of modem and wifi . He said that I would have to call in to them and they would send it out via mail and that he did n't think I could purchase it and have it installed Thursday when the technician came out . <p> So my questions are these : <p> 1 . Do most of you recommend going with a seperate modem and router or a combo ? The real techie guys I know say go seperate and that way you can updgrade your router in the future as technology changes . <p> 2 . Do any of you know of a specific make and models of seperate modem and routers that you would recommend ? <p> 3 . Do any of you know of a specific make and model of combo modemrouters that you would recommend ? <p> I am willing to spend for middle to mid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am hoping to get at Staples as it is close to my house and order alot of other business stuff from there .

Basically what happens is , I 'll be using the internet , downloading , browsing or whatever and all of a sudden the internet just cuts out . Sometimes the modem lights stay completely lit , but the connection times out , sometimes the modem lights go off save for the power light and the receive light starts flashing as though it is trying to reconnect . I 'm wired directly into the modem and am using Windows Vista , I have n't done any driver/software updates recently that I can remember that may have caused this . I power cycle the modem sometimes when it happens and sometimes it 's fine for hours other times it cuts out every 2 minutes . Also , it remains cut out for random periods of time , sometimes its as short as a few seconds other times it 's been up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've looked all over online and tried different solutions but none have resolved my issue yet . I 'm not even sure what the cause of the problem is even : / . <p> Thanks . <p> Logged <h> MediacomScott <p> Thank you for your post . I apologize for the issues you are experiencing and I would like to help resolve your service concerns . There are a variety of issues that can cause a user to experience intermittent service , if you could please send me your account number or MAC I 'd off of the modem ( in a personal message ) , so I may look into your issue . <p> Well , I have that problem also , along with the speed decreasing dramatically EVERY DAY from 12 megs down to LESS than 1 meg DL speed .. This has been going on for well over six months now .. And getting worse .. I have told them about it , I have talked local about it but no one ever says what is really going on .. Seems to me that if some thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  care , there techs are not able to find the problem , in which they need better techs , OR they are reducing speeds to save there own money and hoping no one else will know it . <p> Come on people , this is getting out of hand .. Find the problem and fix it it can not be that dang hard to do . We are paying good money , more than a lot of other places for these low speeds , and we ca n't even keep at the speeds we pay for ? Yes , I know , lines , usage and so forth does tend to drop speeds a little , but NOT dropped by 10-11 megs ! ! ! I check my speeds at least twice a day so I know how fast I am going .. I check it on several routes , not just one and then average it out .. And I average around10-11 on a normal day , well used to that is .. And that is even on peek usage times .. So when it drops down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong .. and Mediacom REALLY needs to fix it fast ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> Ok am done for now , sorry bout that , just had to get it out of my system .. It is really ticking me off .... And I know it is also ticking a lot of other people off also . <p> I to have been experiencing the same issue with internet dropping . Difference with mine is it does what I have dubbed the " death spiral " . Surfing at " normal " speed/response times then everything starts to slooow dooown . Address resolution gets longer and longer , waiting for web pages takes longer and longer with an inordinate amount of time with the web browser stating " waiting for xxxxx.com to respond " . Finally it happens , sites stop loading , web pages display error loading page messages , chat programs drop their connections , then , the last step , Windows reports no internet access . <p> Now the strange part , the modem shows connection , all lights are normal and show good status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modem . Setup an appt. for a tech , then terminate the call . Minutes , hours or day later the internet comes back up , some time it spirals back up in reverse or it comes roaring back to life at full speed . Only pattern I can see is it normally starts mid to late afternoon by the evening its down for the count . The day of the week or weekend does n't matter , just the time . <p> Oh , tech comes out and trouble shots the system reports good signal strength or rather proper range of signal strength . First couple of visits suggested I rewire my TV 's and remove all the splitters . One tech left me a 8 way splitter and a amp for the splitter . So I rewired my house with home runs to the 8 way splitter and hooked up the amp to the splitter , made some difference but did not resolve the problem . I 'm using compression terminators on the cable ends , so no signal loss.NOTE : Assume TV signal on the high def @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's going on ? Type/age of a modems make any differences ? <p> Well for me , its pretty much the same except there is no specific time involved .. But the slowness and complete drops are growing longer as time goes by . Luck would have it so far in July that is , I only lost internet for a day three times . Ok , maybe that 's not lucky ... And the modem at this point makes no difference nor the age as I do not believe it has any thing to do with the " modems " we have . As it is a wide spread deal according to a private IM I received from one of the " Forum Moderators " or what ever ya call em here . The " engineers " have known of this problem for some time now and have YET to resolve it .. And as my very first post title said .. " What 's going on ? " <p> I was having that issue and it continued until a tech cameout and replaced the modem and all the connections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the issue i had to have my router software updated . Both times it fixed the problem . <p> Thanks for the input and all the comments . I apologize for any speed issues and we want to get those taken care of right away . If you have any problems with speed it can be caused by a variety of issues such as signal strength , modem , router , head end problem and so on . The problem is each one can be unique and there is n't a set way to fix every single one , they each require a set amount of troubleshooting and can occasionally still go undetected until we check multiple things . I apologize for this and hope to get all the speed issues you experience worked out . If you are having speed issues feel free to PM me your account number , MAC address , or the phone number on the account and we can pull the account up and see what we can do about your speed issues . If you send me this I can contact you back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just let me know which . <p> Me too ..... Internet just stops working at random times . This has been going on for a long , long time . I think Dec ' 09 a tech changed all the connectors , everything was fine until early July ' 10 . A tech was scheduled for Monday 5 July ( listen to the recording , your scheduler said Monday ) which was a federal holiday , but no tech show up . At least that time , they were able to determine that there was in fact problem . On Monday ( 07/05/10 ) they called me to remind me of my Tuesday appointment ( again , listen to the recording ) . It was too late for me to schedule a day off , so I had no option but to cancel the tech . Right now I am so frustrated with this crazy connection that DSL is looking better all the time and may be the best option . Everyday now I check my network history ( Lynksys Network Magic program ) and my connection is down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of calling Mediacom , all they ever want to do is run me throught the reboot of the modem and router - which just wastes my time and theirs . Sometimes this works , but usually not . I am fully convinced that there is a problem at the street connection , but they never check that . And of course , they wo n't even consider looking at the outside connections if nobody is at home . I have almost talked myself into DSL . <p> Thank you for your reply and I apologize for your problems . We definitely do not want to lose you as a customer and I will do all I can to check on a speed issue if you would PM me your account number , MAC address from your modem or telephone number on your account . I will do all I can to take care of any issue you have . <p> OK never mind , the issue is n't resolved . My internet continues to randomly disconnect , it was fine for about a day and now it 's back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the error message i get when the internet drops out and I do the " diagnose/repair " function Windows Vista has . Hopefully we can sort this out , it is extremely annoying when I 'm in or hosting an online call with family or friends . <p> For some reason it will not let me upload the picture using the forum functions so here is the url of the image : <p> Cable splitter or not , makes no difference . Least with my troubles . I have done a direct connect with no splitter , no router and same thing happens . I get the same exact speeds regardless . Dropped connects , speed slow downs to the max ... I does not matter if I add or remove all connecters between the main line in and my computer(s) .. <p> The problem we are all having is pretty much the same . Down-line hardware faults is likely the cause and that is what needs to be fixed asap . As I and others have said , this has been going on for a long time now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's changing or what but it 's going on an awful lot today .. ca n't stay logged in to programs for longer than 5-10 minutes or so , then disconnect , internet loss for a period of time then re-connect .

@@40219101 @219101/ <p> MediacomRoyal : All routers built in to our modems should have the same capabilities . The best way t ensure that we get the specific brand modem you are looking for , we would need to either schedule a technician to bring it out , or you could bring the modem and its power cord to the local office and swap it at the front desk . Would you like me to schedule a technician to do the swap ? <p> paulyjoe : I had Mediacom cable , internet and phone installed between Christmas 2014 and New Year 2015 . The installation technician shorted me one TiVo Mini in a down stairs room , but of course I did n't realize until right after he left . I just received that TiVo Mini last week . 4 weeks after initial install ! <p> Also , the original Hitron wireless router was terrible . Connection speeds were slow whether I was wired or wireless and web pages were frequently dropped and continuously needed to be reloaded to display without error . I was , however , able to VPN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several extremely frustrating calls to Mediacom , I finally got them to replace the wireless router . The technician who came back explained that the original technician installed the wireless router incorrectly . It was downstream of the amplifier he installed in the home , not upstream where it should have been . After he corrected that issue and swapped out the Hitron wireless router with a Cisco wireless router , the connection speeds were much better . After he left , I tried to VPN into work and realized that I had lost the ability to VPN . I called Mediacom and was very rudely and very unprofessionally told by both a customer service representative AND her supervisor ( equally rude and unprofessional ) that Mediacom did not support VPN and to contact my IT people . What ? ! ? ! I just had VPN capabilities prior to the installation of the Cisco wireless router . I tried calling and chatting with Mediacom online to no avail . The standard answer was that Mediacom did not support VPN . I FINALLY talked with someone in Des Moines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people what I needed , and had a technician bring me another wireless router . This was also a Hitron , but an older model . It had very good connection speeds and VPN was restored . <p> Now why it took so long for ANYONE at Mediacom to understand and react is a mystery to me . No one at Mediacom was able to make that Cisco router pass VPN requests out to the web and everyone there assumed I needed assistance in setting up my VPN connection . I ALREADY HAD IT WORKING BEFORE YOU REPLACED MY HITRON ROUTER ! What did n't  you understand about that ? I cant believe Mediacom does not have a list of routers that will and will not pass VPN requests out to the web . Better yet , make sure ALL of your routers will pass a VPN request . It is not an uncommon or unreasonable request . Telling your customers you do not support VPN is a lie . You may not support customers in setting up their VPN connections in their computing devices , but you surely are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hardware to the web ! <p> I 'm also still battling with Mediacom about a missing HD channel . This particular HD channel is listed in two different HD packages for my area . I get all other HD channels in my subscription except this one . NO ONE at Mediacom has been able to correct this issue . If it is a misprint in the channel listings , fine . Correct the channel listings and I 'll let it go . But if Im supposed to receive this channel I want it . It is a channel I would watch . I feel like I 'm paying for a channel I 'm not receiving . I have continually complained about this for the entire 4 weeks I 've had service and still nothing has been done . Technicians have admitted that I 'm not the only one with this issue . So why has it not been fixed ? <p> Between what I can only describe as defective or improperly setup wireless routers , incorrectly installed hardware and missing channels , I 've spent more time than I care to admit having to leave work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 8 12 and 1 5 . I get the feeling that no one really cares about what they are doing at Mediacom . Most of their customer service phone representatives are clearly giving scripted replies to inquiries . I 'm sure they are intelligent people , but lack proper training . When I can complain about Mediacoms customer service people to your own technicians and they inform me that many other customers have the same complaints , maybe its time to do something . You can not continue to treat customers this poorly and expect to retain them . If you would put half as much money into training competent , professional and courteous employees as you do advertising , youd probably be more successful and have more customers . <p> I personally have never heard anyone say anything good about Mediacom and I will probably have few good things to say myself after this experience . The ONLY thing keeping me with Mediacom is the lack of competition in my area . If and when someone else offers a comparable product in my area , many of your current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customer service improves significantly , if given the opportunity , I 'll leave Mediacom as fast as I can and never look back . <p> MediacomTim : Hello paulyjoe and thank you for contacting us here about the issues in which you are referring to . <p> I am happy to hear that the internet issues in which you were experiencing were resolved .

@@40219102 @219102/ <h> Author Topic : Tell Me If I 'm In The Wrong ... ( Read 1837 times ) <p> Called Mediacom to cancel service late last year . I was looking for one provider to give me one low rate . Was getting rid of their phone and internet and was going to another vendor who would provide me tv , phone , and internet in a bundled package . The operator asked if she could attempt to " save " my account and transferred me to a department where they offered me a great rate of $109 per month for all three with HDTV and no extra charge for DVR . I agreed to this offer and we recorded the call , did a " handshake agreement " etc . <p> First bill comes and it 's for 139 per month and a DVR fee . I refused to pay it and called to tell them they were wrong . They said their notes showed I 'd agreed to 139 and nothing about a DVR fee . I told them to check the recording . <p> I hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked the recording , I was 100% right . I agreed to $109 and no DVR fee . They assured me it would get right but I should pay the wrong bill and get a refund later . I refused to pay until I had a bill that was correct . <p> This went on for a long time . In the meantime now I 've got another bill , still wrong , and the second bill is also the higher rate . I call in and you ca n't imagine what I was told . The agent who offered me the higher rate was not authorized to do so . So they would not honor our contract . <p> I said this was fine . Transfer me to somebody who could cancel my account . I was informed if I broke the contract I would have to pay a $100 fee , but they would transfer me . Fine . They can charge me the $100 , I can sue them in small claims . Breach of contract is pretty cut and dry as legal cases go , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for my trouble . <p> They transfer me , and I explain the situation to the agent on the phone . She applies a series of " rebates " to my account which bring it down to the rate I was promised . Was that so hard ? ? ? <p> I guess it was . Because a couple months later I get another bill and there is a DVR fee on it . The next month , same thing . I call in , complain , the agent reads all the notes , verifies from the transcript that I should not have to pay this , but he ca n't make a change without his supervisor . The supervisor will call me later tonight . Yeah right , but whatever . I thank him , wait . Two days later , no call , no nothing . <p> So I 'm back where I started . From where I am sitting , this is very cut and dry . It 's an easy breach of contract lawsuit in small claims court .

Could I ask you to PM me your account number or phone number please ? I 'll see if I can get this taken care of . <p> Logged <h> MediacomMike <p> Okay , I 've gone ahead and reversed the most recent DVR service charge that you see on your bill . You 'll have this amount credited back to you on your next bill .

@@40219104 @219104/ <p> Thanks for becoming a member of the Mediacom Support Forums ! We 'd be happy to assist you here . To activate your own modem for the internet services you can do so here : LONG ... The billing account number will be the 16 digit number beginning with 8383 and the activation code should be the last 9 digits of the account number . If you need any assistance with this , just send me a personal message with the new MAC address as well as your phone or account number so we can help ! <p> Hello barneycat11 , We do not fully support our Telephone service on any modem outside of our rentals , so please keep that in mind should you have any issues with it in the future as we may have limited ability to assist you with it . <p> With that said , you should be able to provision the phone service to the new modem using that same webpage . Please make sure to use the correct MTA MAC address as it does differ from the normal MAC or CMAC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point in time , so we do have updated firmware for it and it should be compatible with our telephony system . If you have any issues please let us know. -Tom <p> We do not fully support our Telephony service on any modem outside of our rentals , so please keep that in mind should you have any issues with it in the future as we may have limited ability to assist you with it . <p> The link to the modem support list is showing modems that we rent out and push firmware to . Those are fully supported by us . These models can also be purchased , but this is what Tom is referring to when he states we do n't fully support modems outside of the models that we rent out . <p> What Tom stated is further explained in the following statement from the link you provided : " While we can not guarantee functionality of 3rd party equipment if you choose to buy a modem through a retailer or other provider , we will make every effort to assist you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Other Docsis 3.0 modems may work , but we do n't fully support them . <p> But that list of approved devices on Mediacom 's support site does imply pretty strongly that if a modem/eMTA is on that approved list , it will be supported . Obviously , there are limits on level of support on non-provider provided equipment , granted , as modem failure would not be a responsibility of the Provider , in this case Mediacom , as it would now be the responsibility of the End User/Customer . <p> Any eMTA that can be legally purchased that is on that list should support Mediacom Internet and/or Phone , is basically what I 'm trying to get at . <p> I was a long time Comcast customer , and they have all sorts of restrictions on Customer Purchased eMTAs that they will provision if they are NOT provided by Comcast as a rental -- basically just two models ( Arris TM722G and Arris TG862G ) . Other models are on their supported list , but only supported for Rental , not for End User Purchase <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will support/activate the devices , whether purchased or leased from Mediacom , if a supported device on the published list . That is a much more Customer Friendly approach , and I give Mediacom props for taking that approach <p> That being said , I 'd love to see the Arris TM1602 ( 16x4 eMTA ) and TM1602G-8 ( 16x4 , upgradeable to 24x8 ) make it on the supported list some day , but not a pressing need . 8 channels are ok for me for now <p> I 'm happy we were able to clear up any confusion there was . Once we do have those modems added to our list , we 'll be sure to let everyone know . Keep us posted if you run into any other issues or questions . <p> I 'm glad to hear that barneycat11 ! If you need us to ship you a return shipping label/box for the Mediacom rental , we 'd be happy to mail that out to you as well . Alternatively , you can bring the modem up to the local office nearest you.Just let us know how you 'd like to proceed !

( Read 502 times ) <p> Ok i brought this up before but it was n't sufficiently answered so i have to ask this again ... <p> The regional sports surcharge started with the addition of the SEC Network , but i do n't receive the SEC Network so why do i get charged the surcharge for a channel i do n't even receive , let alone do n't  even want ! ! ! <p> According to the list the SEC Network in on channel 761 ... I checked on my digital adapters , i do n't receive channel 761 , so hence forth why i am being charged a surcharge for a channel that 's not even in my service tier ? ? <p> Thanks for contacting us here ! Mediacom strives to offer a variety of programming to meet all of our customers ' needs ; this includes sports programming . Currently the majority of our customers are within the footprint of SEC schools , and sports programming is one of the most watched genres on television . I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schools , but as the channel was added for the majority of our subscribers to access all around the nation , the regional sports charge you are inquiring about here is valid , and will be going forward . <p> Thank you for the cut and paste answer that had NOTHING TO DO with my question , but i guess a form letter response is easier huh ? ? <p> What channel number is the SEC Network in my area ? If i am paying for it i should be able to watch it correct ? ? Then tell me what channel number it is so i can flip over and see what i 'm paying $2.64 a month for . <p> The SEC Network is on channel 188/ 189 and 761 . Per your line-up here : LONG ... this requires a subscription to the Sports &amp; Information digital pack to view- a pack that you are not currently subscribed to . The Regional Sports Surcharge is a fee associated with sports programming . This does not only include the SEC Network , but other similar networks such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. - the list goes on . This is calculated on a per customer basis , as this is how network carriage agreements are calculated- regardless of whether or not the channel is viewed or elected by the specific customer . This has been explained numerous times here , via DSL Reports , and through an informational notice enclosed in your statement dated September 3 , 2014 on page 2 under " Important Account Information " before the surcharge went live . This is now a surcharge associated with all Family TV subscriptions , will continue to be , and stands valid . <p> The Regional Sports Network Surcharge was n't added until the stupid SEC Network was added to the system though , and since i am not in a sports package and ca n't , and do n't want to , receive any of these channels i think its unfair for family cable customers to pay for other customers sports addictions . <p> Since i ca n't get anywhere with Mediacom i guess the FCC needs to , or an attorney filing a lawsuit so we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just ridiculous .. I have been a Mediacom customer for well over ten years now , i have put up with a lot of crap over the years , but this is the surcharge that broke my back . Talking to DirecTV tomorrow , at this point about the only association i want with Mediacom is internet service . You guys have been doing a great job on the internet service , speed upgrades , reasonable rates compared to DSL service in my area , but the TV service is just getting out of hand on charges and surcharges and fees . <p> $71.95 for Family Cable$2.94 Local Broadcast Channel Surcharge ( this one i do n't mind so much since its channels that i actually watch ) $2.64 Regional Sports Surcharge ( how do you guys even calculate this ? ? I see posts from people saying theirs is $1.94 or less , so why am i at $2.64 ? ? ? ) <p> $77.53 for just Family Cable ? ? CRAZY <p> I can get the same channels and even more for $39.95 a month on Satellite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> I talked to the retention dept today , they wanted to move me to Prime cable , install a DVR , and more boxes , and i would only save $9 a month by going to this new promo for the first year , but then the second year i would be spending about $11 more then i am now , so there is no savings . <p> " Sports play an important role in the lives of many Americans . Years ago , the big games were always on broadcast television . In recent years , however , professional teams and college conferences have started raking in huge profits by selling off their TV rights to regional sports networks like FSN , Big Ten Network and SEC Network . Mediacom strives to bring you the most popular games from the most popular teams in areas we serve . As games get spread out over more channels , the cost of bringing you sports content has risen . Up to now , Mediacom has absorbed many of these costs . Unfortunately , we are now forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fees were absorbed by Mediacom previously . With the addition of the SEC Network , my guess is that these costs become high enough to warrant a surcharge addition . This is why this surcharge was only recent applied with the addition of the SEC Network . While I agree that this does not seem fair , the holders of this programming- the parent networks- do not share this empathy , and negotiate a per customer carriage agreement to carry their programming- regardless of interest , demand , or subscription . If there are a million subscribers , the cost to carry programming is calculated base on a million subscribers , regardless of the fact that only 750,000 will actually subscribe or view . Unfortunately , this is not a system that Mediacom , or any provider for that matter , controls . <p> $2.64 Regional Sports Surcharge ( how do you guys even calculate this ? ? I see posts from people saying theirs is $1.94 or less , so why am i at $2.64 ? ? ? ) <p> This is calculated by market and is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained , this is not only the SEC Network , but Fox Sports Channels , Big 10 Network , etc . There more of this programming available in a market , the greater the surcharge may be . In areas where this programming is quite limited , the charge may be smaller . Likewise , in areas that broadcast the SEC Network , various Fox Sports Networks , extensive sports programming , etc. , etc. this charge may be greater . <p> As stated , this is not a charge that looks to be temporary , and many other providers are quickly adopting this as well . I see that you have spoken with MediacomChad over on DSL Reports about this same thing , and I can understand if the cancellation of cable services is the best avenue here . We are unable to process such billable changes here- due to insecure methods of account verification- but we can certainly have an agent contact you to ensure this is processed once the decision is made . <p> Hey Sharp84 , thanks for contacting us here . There is a variance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location in the line up of the specialty sports networks and programming . Some areas were negotioated with all the channels in the family line up while others have channels assigned to specialty pack like the Sports and Info digital tier . The specialty packs come with their own additional charges to be added to accounts . The higher the number of channels assigned to the Family line ups the higher the charge . An area with a $5.20 regional sports surcharge has more channels available without a special package than an area with a $2.64 surcharge.

I have reviewed your account and see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the beginning of the year . If looks as though the modem was replaced during the first one for a TiVo issue , with the tech adjusting signal levels at the last visit for intermittent internet connection . <p> I have reviewed the signals levels on the modem , as well as in the area and everything is reporting well within acceptable range . We are showing that the modem has been online for just under 4 days , and bonding to all down and upstream channels . We can definitely work to address and resolve the issues in which you are currently experiencing , including replacing the modem if it is deemed necessary . <p> Can you briefly describe the service issues you are currently experiencing ? <p> As the above-quoted review states , our service " constantly disconnects ... and produces an extremely unstable signal , " if any , even when just eight feet away from the modem and with all bars lit on every device . Our best remedy has been to restart the WiFi on both our phones and laptop to renegotiate a modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we restart the modem , but success with that is also sporadic , and I am hard-pressed to believe that two phones and one laptop have the same connectivity issue within them . Our hardwired Desktop seems to connect more consistently , when it does connect , but its download speed can still get quite slow . <p> Every time we call Mediacom and every time a service technician comes to the house , things seem to test fine . They might make a tweak or two , is all . For whatever reason , though , they twice found cause to replace the modem , and then said , " everything is okay . " Similar and continuing trouble in the area and during only evening hours has led one technician to believe the problem is somewhere upline from us ; somewhere away from the house , but our troubles are somewhat different than just " evening hours . " They are persistent ; all day long , any time of day . We never know when we can be online . <p> We are on our third modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well , and nothing will convince me that a modem upgrade is n't worth a try . Let 's face it : You have had since May 29 , 2014 to resolve the problem , and no technician has provided anything better than " somewhere upline . " Surely you have a modem rated better than " trash , " do n't you ? And I would appreciate trying your best model . 45222 @qwx455222 <p> At this time , there are only two modems that we deploy that are EMTA 's and wifi compatible , the Cisco DPC3925 that you are currently utilizing , and the Hitron CGNV . <p> If this issue persists , what we can do is try the Hitron if you would like to keep an all in one gateway , or we can send you two modems ( either via UPS or service tech ) , one for internet , and one for phone . <p> I appreciate that , Tim , but I 'm at a loss to decideand the issue does persist . Just now , in fact , I again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening time . <p> The goal is to achieve a reliable high speed connection with reasonable WiFi range . If one setup works better than the other , then that 's the one we should choose , but I can not do so without knowing more about the modems of each option . <p> The all in one gateway would be nice , with less equipment and less clutter , but I find nothing on the Hitron CGNV , and only a few mixed words on other Hitron models where both WiFi range and connectivity seem to be at issue . Still , a Mediacom technician once said the CGNV was better than the Cisco , and tried to use it on our system , but he could not get it to work . He decided it was incompatible with the TiVo . That does n't  make sense , though . Why would Mediacom limit the compatibility of such a small product line ? <p> The two-modem option would be acceptable , but I can not judge its viability without knowing the modems and how they review . Are they quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Might Mediacom register the successes of one modem setup against the other ? Isnt there a service log of sorts ? <p> Can you provide the model numbers of the two-modem option so I might check the reviews of each modem ?

Maybe we could try both options , and then return the lesser quality one . <p> <p> Frankly , Im shocked Mediacom does not have a ready-solution for our problem , or that they have n't at least figured things out by now , and that I have to work to solve their problem . Its no wonder all I ever hear are complaints of Mediacom . Seriously , never a praise .

I am then forced to " research " in order to overcome Mediacoms greatest insult against the hard-earned monies I pay your company , so I have a right to be angry , and I am . <p> So , in that the review of such incompatible modems is simply a waste of time , will you please provide me a list of EQUALLY compatible modems ; those not requiring me to research and to buy yet an ANOTHER price of equipment in order to properly operate my cable TV , my TiVo , my telephone and my homes WiFi ; services I pay Mediacom dearly to receive ?

" That , too , I would appreciate . <p> Hello James Andersen ! Thanks for getting back with us here . The list provided by MediacomTim is the list of approved modems for phone service , the EMTAs . Any of those would be able to be used separate from a modem used strictly for Internet . Of the non-EMTA modems available , there is only one model known to not work on the Mediacom network ( because of a firmware issue ) : the Netgear CMD31T-100NAS .

If you do get a DOCSIS 3 gateway modem , we will no longer be able to configure the wireless router side or check the router settings as it will not be our equipment . Most gateway modems do , however , come with a good user manual or even software which can be installed to assist in the router set up and maintenance . If you get a standard DOCSIS 3 modem and use an external router , we will not have any visibility of or ability to configure this either , but any home router can be connected with Ethernet to a modem ; there is no list of approved or unapproved devoices beyond the modem . <p> Thank you for the prompt replywhich I can read now that my internet is back upbut before I continue my search , let me make sure I understand : <p> Under my contract , where I am provided cable , TiVo , telephone and WiFi services , I can use any non-EMTA modem , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could check and configure the wireless settings only if they do NOT carry a rating of DOCSIS 3 . Is that right ? It almost seems like you meant to say " if we DO get a DOCSIS 3 gateway modem , " you would not be able check and configure , so which is correct ? <p> With that , then , what about the other settings ; those not related to any wireless feature ? Would you monitor and correct those as needed ? <p> And , to be clear , a " non-EMTA " modem is all I would need to utilize the provided cable , TiVo , telephone and WiFi services ? Is that correct ? 
@@40219107 @219107/ <p> I am seeing Windows 10 updates ( both windows updates and app store updates ) that are failing inexplicably when using your peer address of 108.161.84.26 when retrieving updates . I have noticed it a lot in the last couple of months and it is a really bothersome since that traffic , even though it is staying within the Mediacom network , is counting against my traffic quota . Notice , there are TWO issues there . <p> First , when the updates " fail " it makes the host continually try to download the update . It causes a nearly constant stream of downloads from that host . <p> Secondly , if your peering system is causing issues , why on earth should it count against my quota ? We already have finite amounts of traffic we can view , I really do not think errors downloading , which may be attributable to your own system causing them , should not count against our quota . Of course , that begs the question of how that would be achieved . My response is simple . Quit using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them and they really only serve to limit competition to other sources of entertainment ( Netflix , Amazon , Hulu , etc. ) or increase the revenue of Mediacom . If you have nodes that are overloaded to the point that service is suffering , perhaps consider splitting those nodes . I really doubt the caps have helped manage network traffic in any measurable way , but I would expect they have increased Mediacom 's revenue substantially , either through people going over the caps or upgrading packages to try to avoid doing so . <p> What I see in my logs is initial attempts to the first host ( with a long url ) then subsequent attempts to the 108.161.84.26 with the same url . It was trying again and again and again this morning , to the tune of &gt;10gigs of traffic due to the failure . <p> I made some adjustments to my web filtering to accommodate the 108 address to the same bypass as the Microsoft servers . The only time I ever seem to have these failures is when the 108 address is used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quota , but still it is frustrating that I might someday have this issue . It would be easy to see it happening if I were away from home for an extended period of time and the hosts on my network all attempted this all day , every day , for a week or two . If I then found out all of that traffic was to a mediacom address that was intercepting traffic that was actually destined for microsoft , I would probably be livid . And if that , in turn , caused me to give even more money to mediacom via overage fees , I would probably be compelled to complain in every way I could . That has not happened , and likely will not happen , but it is something to consider when messing with customer 's traffic to that level . <p> Mediacom does not restrict access to the Internet or content on the Internet in any way . I can certainly get this over to Tier 2 for investigation for you . Would you be able to bypass your router ans run a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems pointless , but it is required and Tier 2 will kick it back if they see a router n the equation . If we need to get the head end tech looking at the 108.161.84.26 , Tier 2 will be able to find the details to supply the head end tech . <p> Not without a fair amount of effort and exposing a host to the internet directly . Everything seems to be working again after adding the Mediacom IP to the list of windows update sources ( and apple update sources ) .

If so , they missed me ! <p> I have a lot of channels that have been reassigned to those stupid channel numbers and have rescanned my digital ready tv numerous times . I still have no weather channel , HGTV , TLC ... the list goes on and on . Am I missing something ? <p> Hello moonie57 , thanks for getting back with us here ! Digital-ready TVs have built in tuners that need to scan , and re-scan periodically , to lock onto the strongest signal for a channel . The frequency your TV tuner locks onto may not match what is listed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple frequencies and each frequency carries multiple networks . With signal fluctuations , it is possible that the strongest signal on a frequency will change . A full re-scan should get the tuner locked again on the strongest signals for each channel , and the channel number displayed will be the frequency the channel is strongest . <p> It also appears that only the Local Plus lineup is available in your area without an adapter or cable box . Channels you should receive on a QAM TV with the coax line directly connected can be found in the Digital-Ready Local Plus TV and Digital-Ready HD Local Plus TV sections of your line up found here : LONG ... Family TV channels such as HGTV and TLC will not be viewable on your digital-ready TV , unfortunately . <p> Well , as I said , I have rescanned on numerous occasions .

@@40219111 @219111/ <h> Author Topic : Mediacom TiVo service ( Read 6341 times ) <p> I 'm strongly considering upgrading my existing personally owned TiVo equipment ( at a considerable expense ) . From the little information I can find , the equipment I would purchasing is the exact same as the TiVo branded boxes that Mediacom is currently deploying as their TiVo branded solution with the exception of course the Mediacom TiVo boxes have customized firmware which allow features like purchasing PPV that the normal TiVo cable card boxes ca n't do , also unfortunately it appears the Mediacom TiVo solution does n't have all the real TiVo features such as MRV transfering and TiVo stream to name a few however this is based on informal conversations with people from Mediacom . <p> My first question is , why ca n't I get Mediacom TiVo service as a current long term customer ? It was explained to me that only NEW customers are allowed to order it which the local office casually explained the tivo service was " buggy " and they were allowing only new customers to work those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With no quote on price I would like to have it installed and at least try it before I spend hundreds of dollars to purchase the regular TiVo Roamio with multi-touch viewing with multiple Mini 's ( which is as I already described the same hardware solution Mediacom is using ) . Due to returns recent changes to the copy protect flags that Mediacom has recently enforced with their cable cards becoming unpaired , the ability to transfer movie recordings from one TiVo to another in home has been stopped which while frustrating , this why TiVo has introduced the newer single TiVo DVR with boxes that stream off that single box that in turn allows multi-touch viewing . <p> I REALLY would like to get pricing plans and be able to chose a Mediacom service that is currently in my area . If there are " bugs " , I would be more than willing to work with Mediacom to help work such out due to fact that I 'm very familiar with TiVo by being a TiVo subscriber for over 10 years and I 'm a technical orientated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a realistic understanding of Mediacom 's service capabilities . <p> Second , Can I get input from mediacom and Mediacom TiVo customers : <p> Is there a Mediacom employee who can contact me concerning this ? My local office is a dead-end Street as while the customer support staff are nice , they are only reading off a written script and wo n't consider any other option other than what is given to them . <p> And ... <p> Has anyone here have the Mediacom TiVo service and can you offer any input on the service especially if you have used the regular TiVo service including the price of what you have installed ? With the little I know about it , I would like to know more as Mediacom has released little or no info about it other than repeating " it 's a TiVo " and referring everyone to a one Web page that little real information . <p> The Tivo service is initially being offered to new customers for a few reasons such as better stock control , ensuring the services works the way it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are built slightly different . The price of the Tivo service is $19.95/month . The first box is $10/month and each additional box is $5/month . Right now we are only doing these in multi room configurations . In the future , we will be offering the stand alone service for $14.95 + $10 for the box . Also , the Tivo Stream will be $5/month when it is launched . I will have a supervisor review your account to see if there is any way we can transition your services to include Tivo . We 'll get back in touch with you about that once we have an answer . <p> I personally do n't have the Tivo service but maybe other customers can chime in with their experience if they see your topic . <p> It is $19.95/month for the Tivo service plus the cost of the cable boxes . <p> With all due respect , is n't that a little excessive ? I can see this being given the reason you are only accepting new customers instead of current ones , as any existing customers with regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediacom TiVo monthly service would be more than twice than what I paying TiVo . <p> I do not understand why Mediacom ' s monthly fee are so aggressive especially in case of TiVo service as technically there is n't much that has to be implemented and the biggest problem would be the in-house wiring issues that might create problems in establishing the Moca network that your TiVo 's need to stream content and any cable deficiencies would be the responsibility of the home occupants unless there is a I house wiring contract . <p> TiVo is a very solid mature dvr product , it sells it 's self until you charge too much for it . It would like more information if I can have TiVo service as the cost savings is that I do n't have to purchase the new equipment upfront which as of now , I 'm looking to spend at least four hundred for the initial equipment from TiVo but I also have TiVo lifetime service which remains a large investment which becomes even obsolete if I chose Mediacom TiVo service , in my humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TiVo customers . <p> With having my own TiVo 's in the last few years with Mediacom , I have not purchased a single ppv or on demand content so you are asking me to spend more monthly just to have that ability to pay you yet more . That is faulty business plan , please forward that note to your management ! <p> Thank you for your input ! Of course , these price points will hold different value for different subscribers- especially those who are already heavily invested in personal TiVo units . There are often introductory offers that will help introduce the TiVo package to new customers with promotional rates , since this system is initially offered to new customers only for many of the reasons Dallas stated . The possibility to break any existing offers may be there- we are looking into this now- but this may bring the TiVo system at standard rates , which are what Dallas has quoted .

@@40219116 @219116/ <p> I 'm hoping a Mediacom rep can help me understand a recent recurrence of internet connection problems that have been an issue for several years . From 2013 into 2014 , we exchanged a number of messages on this forum regarding problems with disruptions in my internet service and associated issues with very high upstream power levels in the range of 55-58 . When that thread ended in 2014 , I was still dealing with the high upstream power levels and the inability of a long line of Mediacom techs to stabilize my internet connection . I had already replaced my modem , replaced the coax between a 2-way splitter and the modem with high-end coax , and shortened the coax run to the modem - but problems remained . Fortunately , at some point in 2014 , a really capable tech decided to fix a few things that should have been fixed before . If I remember correctly , he removed at least one unnecessary splice in the cable running down my power pole ( before the cable goes underground ) and replaced the short piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to the cable inside the house . This seemed to stabilize the connection considerably . Although the upstream power levels did n't drop down enough to get into a really " safe " range , we were pleased to have more reliable internet service . <p> However , a few months ago , we had some new connection problems , and a tech came out in August to check things out . I do n't know exactly what he did , but he got our service back up and running . Since then , our signals and speed tests have looked pretty good when I 've bothered to check them although a fairly high upstream power level ( around 55 ) has continued . Last Friday , though , our internet became very slow at times and had trouble loading sites before disconnecting due to " time outs . " Speed tests did n't load correctly and I could n't check modem power levels . Sometimes we could connect briefly with internet sites , but never at the usual speed . I called Mediacom Sunday night , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he scheduled a tech to come out the morning of 11/25 . <p> Earlier today , our internet connection came back and seems ok at the moment , but I have no confidence that it will continue to work without interruption going forward . Speed test now shows a download speed of about 23 Mbps and an upload speed of about 2.4 Mbps , which are pretty typical speeds for our service . Modem power levels for the downstream channels are in the +3 to +4 range , but upstream power is 56.3 . <p> I 'm hoping you can look at any notes from the August tech visit ( and possibly from the earlier 2013-14 visits ) - as well as any more recent info you may have about my internet service - and give me an idea regarding the most likely issues that the tech will need to review on Friday . The techs that have come out in the past have often not had info from prior tech visits or this forum , which has made them have to start from scratch . I 'm hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that my time and his/her time are n't wasted . <p> Thanks for bringing this to our attention , I 'll be happy to help . I have investigated this further for you , and I believe I have identified what is causing the problem you 're experiencing . There is a upstream tx signal issue present on the line feeding your house . I have made notations of this in the work order the technician will receive . He will be able to look into this further once he 's on site , and will be able to determine if it can be repaired , or if further maintenance is required . We will follow up after completion to ensure that you 're back up to speed . Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns in the meantime . <p> I wanted to update my situation based on the service call on 11/25 . The tech who came out ( along with a trainee with him ) was very helpful and was concerned about the continuing problems with a very high upstream power level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he arrived ) as well as noise on the line feeding my house and affecting the upstream transit signal . He decided to try replacing the existing 2-way splitter with a different one that produces slightly lower signal loss on the line going to the modem . This change dropped the upstream modem power on my measurement to 55 dB ( and even lower on the tech 's measurement of the signal ) . The continuing noise on the outside line prompted the tech to make a call requesting maintenance to fix the problem . I do n't know what if anything has been done to fix the line noise issue , but the current upstream power at my modem is now down to 53.5 dB . Ideally , it should be a bit lower than that to be safe , but at least it 's where it 's less likely to cause regular connection problems . <p> Thanks for following up with us here ! Looking at the work orders on your account I do see that this maintenance work was completed on 11/28 . Since that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TX is around 53 right now . That is a little on the higher end , but I 'd like you to monitor the connection over the coming days to see if you notice any improvement . Just keep us posted here if you encounter any more problems and we 'll continue assisting you . I 'll also start a 7 day monitoring session on the modem which will give us a more in-depth look into the levels .

Then in looking at your approved list of cable modems with EMTA , I do n't see the one I would like to purchase .

I do see this Arris TM822G at Amazon , but it 's not on your list . Seems very much like the others Arris on your list , it is Docsis 3.0 compliant , and I assume the EMTA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thanks for the help.Dale ... <p> Returning the Mediacom rental modem would remove both of the charges in your case . We do n't officially support the TM822G so we can not guarantee it will work . I would n't worry too much about the internet side of them ; I do n't see any reason why that would n't work . It 's the phone side that may cause issues . If you purchase it , we can run it through out provisioning system and go from there . If for some reason it does n't work , you can return it to the retailer . <p> Another solution would be to purchase two separate modems ; a stand along DOCSIS 3 modem for the internet and a separate modem for the phone . The phone does not see the same benefits on DOCSIS 3 that the internet does . <p> I 'm a little confused about the two modems . I assume you mean something like the Arris TM602G and then maybe the Motorola SB6121 for the Docsis 3.0 internet support . So how would I hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other coax connection in my house ? It has a two way splitter where my coax comes into the house so the cable modem is on one and then the other one feeds all of my TV 's . That has worked great for me . So I could just connect the cable modem with the EMTA on any of those other Coax in my house ? Do I have to somehow disable the cable modem part of it ? I know I would n't hook anything up to it , but would Mediacom understand this configuration without too much confusion ? Maybe I 'm making this too complicated ! Is there any box you know of that has just the EMTA so it would n't have the cable modem feature if that makes sense and maybe be cheaper ? Thanks for the help.Dale ... <p> If you were to go the route of having two separate modems you could use a splitter on one outlet or you can connect them on different outlets . We do not designate outlets for certain services . If the outlet is active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the outlet . We are able to provision each modem to the specific service you are using it for , so an EMTA would not have to also handle your internet service . You can find a list of approved EMTAs here LONG ... but I must mention that we are unable to guarantee or support purchased equipment . We will certainly try everything we can to get it working , but recommend making sure that the equipment you purchase has a return policy . -Tommy

Internet access was lost and restored and he came back infront of my house and sat in his truck for several minutes before he left so I assume that he completed what ever else he had to do . <p> So now what ? This post began on 3/12/2016 so seven weeks , four tech visits and 5-6 tickets later the issue is not fixed . And I believe this has been basically going on long before that . A botched original installation to begin with , two Mediacom supplied routers ( one defective and the next described as inadequate by the Mediacom tech for typical multi-wirelss device use for a typical Ultra customer , purchasing my own kickass Netgear Nighthawk X4S R7800 router , a replaced Medicacom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel in the hub infront of my house , who knows what at the head end or whatever , being told countless times that my power levels are off and I 'm still not receiving ULTRA level service . <p> Of course I want this corrected . But to start I should be given a good faith refund of some sort because you have been charging me for a service level that you have been incapable of providing . Perhaps you could try over provisioning my circuit to see if that can result in the speeds I should be getting since it seems you have tremendous difficulty managing bandwidth otherwise . <p> I 'm sorry to hear you 're still having problems , wtoddsherman . I see the maintenance job is complete with resolution codes about level adjustments and the modem is reporting all healthy levels , upstream and downstream . I went ahead and resent the provisioning to the modem and you should have seen it reset . It is back up now , still reporting all good levels and info for the phone and Internet sides . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection and let me know what you see ? <p> I have applied a full month of all Internet service and equipment charges and you should see that on your next statement . <p> The Netgear R7800 router runs Ookla Speedtest itself with it 's Genie admin tools and is connected directly to the modem . I have rebooted the router and have been getting download speeds mostly between 113 - 107 Mbps . However one test returned a download of 32 Mbps . The consistency of your network is frustrating . I will continue to monitor for awhile to see if my speeds continue to meet the service level . <p> So here we go again . After all the activity and aggravation above I thought the speed problems were finally solved after a period of time went by where I was receiving acceptable speed test results . But you can see now from the link below that I am back to getting mixed and often very poor results : <p> I have revived this post so that the history of what I have gone through is apparent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ultra 100Mbs download speeds I am paying for and give me confidence that I do n't have to monitor this routinely ? <p> Hello there wtoddsherman ; thanks for getting back with us here ! I 'm sorry to hear you 're having trouble with your Internet speeds again . Looking over your modem here , I see the modem upstream signal-to-noise ratio has been hanging out in ranges that are a bit low and this may be the cause of the timeouts I see as well . I 've set an appointment for you and escalated that to the Tech Ops Supervisor to get the senior tech or the TOS himself out for this job .

I will be available at the requested time range designated for job 853499 . Left best contact # on the PM . The inconvenience of disrupting another half day of my life waiting for a Mediacom tech will almost be worth it to see what could possibly be wrong this time . I 'm guessing UFO interference .

I have sent the link to your speed test results up to the Tech Ops Supervisor along with a request to advise on the next steps . Your modem and signals are all looking good , so no explanation is seen there .

I have scheduled an additional service call on your account to record this escalation . I do not know if it will be necessary for you to be available at this time . Once that is determined I will update you here . Thank you- Sean <p> Accordingly I WILL NOT plan to be available since you have given no logical reason that a service call will be necessary or effective as the last 7 service calls have not been . <p> I expect now to be besieged with all the annoying robo calls reminding me of the call and asking whether I still need it etc etc even thought you do n't really know if I need it .

One such call rescheduled because I missed the techs call which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I responded to 2 robo calls that I still needed the service and would be present as scheduled . God forbid I go to the bathroom without my phone . We would n't want to inconvenience or misuse precious service tech resources which are clearly more important then your customer 's time . <p> Look , I 'm just livid at Mediacon at this point . Get your supervisor to respond . There is no reason that you forum representatives ( who have always been polite ) should be the recipient of my frustration . This is clearly an issue with Mediacom 's network and/or service departments . Their management should have been brought into this long ago . <p> Hello wtoddsherman and thank you for replying . I am very sorry for the time this has taken out of your normal schedule . We are still waiting on the supervisor to reply with a plan for resolution .

If you run into any problems after the tech is out please let us know and we can dig in for you . <p> The tech was unable to resolve the T3/T4 Timeouts . Is there something you can do remotely or have a more experienced person look into this matter please ? Thanks If you want more modem logs let me know and when I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal to noise ratio levels are currently dropping below acceptable readings . Let me get this sent back over to area management and see if we can get an update for you on the repair process . <p> So I guess someone set up an appointment for me on Friday , the 5th . I was told the window for arrival was between 8 AM to 8 PM . I received a call around 7:00 PM from mediacom , however we were disconnected shortly there after . I tried to call back , but nobody could locate who called and for what reason . <p> Needless to say , the tech never showed . No knock on the door , nothing . Our speeds are still lackluster , and I request that my account be further credited UNTIL the issue is resolved . Our internet speeds are slow again , only getting about 18mbps compared to the 50 that I am paying for . The TV is still coming in extremely fuzzy . <p> Please continue my credit on my account , and please explain what happened to the tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix these problems . I would not be too far off if I estimated that I have had over 20 tickets with mediacom so far in aprox 2 years service , and probably about 12 tech visits ........ <p> Still the same thing over and over . Past few days internet has been usable but still averaging about 25-30 download . Tonight has been terrible . 228 ping ( terrible ) 9.6 down ( paying for 50 down ) and 5.6 up ( great ) . <p> Please escalate the ticket further as it is NOT resolved . Also , please credit my account , and keep the credit going until the issue is resolved . This needs to be resolved and I think that my account should reflect this . <p> Thanks for following up with us here ! I 'm sorry to hear the problem is still occurring . I 've gone ahead and forwarded this information back up to your area management team . Once we receive any updated information we 'll be sure to pass this along to you here . I 'll be making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following up on the issue . It appears that the internet has been alot more stable and speeds are more consistant ( still not 100% - but huge improvement ) . <p> However , it does appear that to TV is still of terrible quality . Still comes in very fuzzy . I also noticed my last bill did not reflect any credits for the issue . I also had a tech call about 1.5 weeks ago saying he would be ther about 930 PM , and never showed . Have yet to hear more . <p> Please provide an update and also provide a credit for the TV . Internet is currently working at acceptable ranges . <p> Good morning highdroponic , the last note I am showing from the technical operations supervisor is that he was in contact with you and was going to have a tech out to your home . I am happy to hear that the internet issue has improved . Are you experiencing issues on all the TVs in your home ? -Tommy <p> Yes it is on all TVs in the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual TV coming through . One tech said he beleived it was a line to that room for that specific TV , but it would not resolve the issue with all of the other TVs . He said that they will have a tech come to replace the line for the upstairs TV , but have yet to hear otherwise . <p> Also , have you applied a credit to my account for the TV 's yet ? Again , my previous bill did not reflect anything .... <p> Typically , there is one drop to the home , so this line may need to be replaced . If the outlet upstairs is part of the worsening issue for that TV , then we can look further into that as well . I do see this appointment that was scheduled for the repair of the outlet and a rewire , so we 'll definitely want to have this completed . Once this is addressed , we can apply credit retroactively for the trouble .

My connection had been fine until probably a month ( maybe two ) ago . I have noticed that periodically , my router would lose the internet connection . I would power cycle everything and still at times it would not pick it up . I would have to reboot my box , disconnect my router and route my modem directly to my PC to get it to work . Now , typically , i would think that this is an issue with my router . HOWEVER , my neighbor down the street is having a similar type of issue and he even switched out his router and is still having issues . Any ideas on what this could be ? <p> All the modem sees is a device plugged into it , it should not matter if it is a router , PC , video game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not lose connection , it is going to be a problem with the router . There can quite possibly be an intermittent connection with your modem that could cause a loss of service and cause the router to drop but that would happen if the modem is plugged into the router or into the computer . A good suggestion to see what happens is try to narrow down when this happens most , and have the modem plugged directly into the PC without the router in line . Use the internet and see if it drops . If it does , we would need to check into the connection leading up to the modem . <p> If you PM me your MAC address off the back/bottom of your modem I can check and see if I can see anything on my side that would indicate intermittent connectivity on Mediacom 's side . <p> Same problem . For about the last month I will get random disconnects and have to reset everything . I 've had mediacom at this location for 2 years now with no issues whatsoever up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've tried bypass my router , does n't  work , I 've tried putting in new cabling and removing a splitter coming into the modem and that too does not work . I 'm getting very tired of these disconnects and having to call mediacom constantly . <p> We would be glad to take a look at this for you . You are saying the random disconnect happen when you do n't have the router connected as well correct ? If that is so it will be a problem on our side that we need to look into . Please send me your MAC address or Account number through PM and we can get this taken care of for you . <p> I have had this same type of problem off and on many times over the years . I seem to notice it more during very wet weather . I really do n't know if that has a thing to do with it but ... I FINALLY figured it out after spending days on the phone and unplugging things and replugging things and oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! I CA N'T BELIEVE I DID N'T THINK OF THIS BEFORE ... take the cover off the bottom of the modem and pull the battery out for about five minutes . Also , this first time I would unplug the router just to be sure to cover all the bases . Unfortunately it does n't stop it from happening and no tech that I have talked to or that has come out here has been able to figure out what is causing it . At least it 's a temporary fix and then it 's good for a month or two . When you have just about forgotten that it had ever happened , hey ... there it is again ! ! ! I hope this helps ! ! <p> I have been talking with Mediacom and here for a couple months at least now . Still no solution to the problem if 11 meg drops in speed or disconnects . Have tried every thing I could think of and also things people inhere have mentioned in hopes of resolving this but , I have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is on there end , Mediacoms , and it is taking forever to get any thing done . I am sorry if I sound upset or angry , but , I am . This is not acceptable for a company that has been so good in the past and now seems to have fallen off the wagon . I love Mediacom and do not want to switch but if this continues , I am going to have to and I have a feeling a lot of others will also . Just to let ya all know , the speed drops are not time related , it has nothing to do with splitters , routers or how far the modem is from the incoming line . I have my suspicions on what is going on but will keep that to myself for now . <p> I would really like to see Mediacom get off there tails and get this fixed .. Waiting several months is really not a good way to run service company . As they can plainly see , it is all over and NOT in one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken care of now . <p> Once again I apologies for sounding angry , but this has gone on way to long .. <p> And yes , I also have sent my MAC and info in PM already and am waiting for good news to come my way and all our ways REAL SOON ! ! ! ! <p> EDIT ! ! ! ! ! ============I apoloize for the drop in speed thing . I CAN see speed drops of 1-2 or possibly 3 megs during peak hours yes . But NOT 11 megs ! ! that is just plain crazy thinking there . Do you know how many people would have to be online at the same exact time to get an 11 meg drop from an ISP like Mediacom ? I do n't  know , but I am more than willing to bet it would take at least ALL Meciacom customers and more to make a drop that large .. Unless of course , there equipment is n't allthat great , which , I am starting to think is a good possibility . Ok , am done .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would love to take a look and see what is causing the issues . Who did you PM your info to ? I just want to make sure this gets taken care of . Feel free to also PM me the info so I can help you also . 
@@40219138 @219138/ <h> Author Topic : Data Caps ( Read 2110 times ) <p> For the fourth month in a row , I am going to be above 90% of my 350GB data cap , with plenty of time left to pass it completely . There has got to be a better way than this . Online services are expanding , forcing higher data requirements . But instead of rising to the occasion , it feels like Mediacom is punishing its customers . When the third week of the month rolls around , I should n't have to be concerned with the amount of data my internet usage takes up . <p> Hello yawg21 , thank you for your post ! We understand that the data allowance you have currently does n't fit your need . We have a number of products with different data allowances that may fit your needs better . We worked hard to create a number of different tiers of service that will fit all of our customers , from launch with a 150GB data allowance to Ultra Plus 3T , which has a 3000GB data allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to see about upgrading to a tier to fit your needs . What is the best telephone# to call you on and when would be a good time ? <p> I 'm not actually interested in a different tier of service at this time . <p> I am interested in Mediacoms ( and your ) point of view as to what is a reasonable solution to increased internet usage by your customers on a grand scale . How can you justify limiting my internet usage through data caps today when a year from now you could have a ( as a hypothetical example ) 10-%-20% increase in usage overall . Does n't the 3% of your customers that hit the data limit seem like small potatoes in comparison ? <p> We care about every customer , which is why we have created tiers that should fit every customer . We constantly review data increases across the board , just like we do speeds , and if we see it as a necessity to increase data allowance we will do that . That is the same method we take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 20 Mbps down . Now we are testing 300 Mbps down in certain areas . We will grow with our customers and do all we can to offer competitive tiers of service that fit the needs of our customers . <p> In regards to reviewing data increases , you may want to do it again . The second most replied to posting on this board is about data caps and it looks like that thread was active until as recently as February . And since then you 've improved the speeds of each of your packages , should n't it make sense that you would have increased data allowances to match ? The entire point of increasing speeds was to allow your customers access to more data in a smaller amount of time . <p> Thank you for providing feedback on our usage allowance . At this time , we do n't have a program that will limit the connection however it 's possible a third party router can limit the bandwidth . However limiting your bandwidth most times will not decrease the overall usage as data is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This is only an example . If you were trying to download a 700 MB game It would n't matter if you downloaded this at 1 Mb/s or at 10 Mb/s as the end result would still be 700 MB downloaded . Having a higher speed connection would only mean you get the content faster . Does this help clarify ? <p> Thank you for providing feedback on our usage allowance . At this time , we do n't have a program that will limit the connection however it 's possible a third party router can limit the bandwidth . However limiting your bandwidth most times will not decrease the overall usage as data is still being used . I 'll try to further explain below . <p> This is only an example . If you were trying to download a 700 MB game It would n't matter if you downloaded this at 1 Mb/s or at 10 Mb/s as the end result would still be 700 MB downloaded . Having a higher speed connection would only mean you get the content faster . Does this help clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's not a problem . The problem is with streaming capabilities over-exceeding the amount of bandwidth than most people needs . Some users like me are very satisfied with standard definition quality videos . A 15MB download will often have lower quality .. so it will take more to reach the data cap . But someone with 50MB download will get High Definition quality streaming , and watch their bandwidth eat up in no time , especially when there is multiple users in the house . Mediacom knows that 's why they did the 350GB cap instead of 500GB , so users can pay extra $10 per 50GB . They hope to persuade users to pick the higher data cap at 999GB which will take much longer to get . I think for most users that are on the 350GB plan are much easier to reach that than if there was a 500GB plan . But again , it will not change , because Mediacom look at customers as $$ making schemes . <p> Most streaming services will offer options to limit the quality your videos are streamed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in more consumed data , most services will offer this alternative to control the quality of streamed video . This holds true for Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , YouTube , Hulu , Twitch- the list goes on and on . It is very rare for streamed video to be offered in a quality that is not controllable by the viewer . <p> 100MB plan to 999GB 4 times the speed of 25MB .... sounds about right with 1000GB . I have that plan , and i hate when people are not being honest as well , there are too many people complaining of slow internet for it to just be there router , or my router , my download speed right now is only 1 mbps struggling , instead of 100 mbps or any where near 100 , 64 dollars a month , they need to fix this nation wide problem scattered across states <p> I agree the data caps are ridiculous . When I was with Windstream I never once got an over usage charge , yet I seem to get them every month with MediaCom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know of any other internet provider that does that . And if you 're going to do that why do n't you make it very easily accessible to upgrade your account online vs happen to call you and do that . Or better yet why do n't you be great at customer service and when you see a customer constantly going over their data cap offer to upgrade for them . I just do n't understand where you get off limiting my data caps I 'm at the point where I think I may just switch back to Windsteam because I never ever ever have this problem with them what they told me my bill was is what it was going to be there was no over usage charges nothing like that they let me use my internet the way I wanted <p> Hello Andybates , thank you for joining us on the forums ! As indicative of this 2.5 year old thread , our usage policy has been in place for some time and can be reviewed online here : LONG ... . While we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these are scaled to offer flexibility to many types of users . At this time , I show you have an active subscription to our Prime Plus tier , which is associated with a monthly allowance of 350 GB . Usage over this amount , as indicated in the policy , is provided in 50 GB chunks at $10 each . At this time , we do maintain a standing upgrade offer that will see the account bumped up to the next service tier- Ultra- for an additional $5.00 per month for a year . This would double speeds and increase the monthly allowance to 1 TB . We are unable to process the change here via the forums , due to insecure methods of account verification ; however , if you would like to explore these options and process an upgrade , we can have an agent contact you . Alternatively , we can be reached any time at 866-452-4747 . <p> Understand that Mediacom and other ISPs implement data caps as a form of greed and greed only . Mediacom should be absolutely ashamed that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ownership up at night . Again , they only have them to squeeze more money out of you and for not other reason . There is no excuse for this inexcusable practice . <p> No matter how much you try to complain about the data caps they 'll be there as long as the customers pony up the money for overages . <p> I highly recommend that all mediacom customers looks into alternative internet providers that do not have data caps . If I had another viable alternative to mediacom I would leave them this instant solely due to the data caps ( even though I do n't exceed them ) . Like I already said , it is a practice that is absolutely inexcusable . <p> Luckily for me I will have an alternative here by the end of 2018 . Mediacom has until then to get rid of them or I 'm gone . <p> We understand your point of view and appreciate your honest feedback . There were multiple factors in the decision to enforce our long-standing data allotments a few years ago and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adjusting the allotments to meet current data expectations . At this time we have no plans on removing data allotments and will continue to do our best to tailor different levels of our tiered internet services to best suit each of our users and their families ' needs.Thanks , -Tom 
@@40219139 @219139/ <h> Author Topic : Extending Wifi Signal ( Read 2194 times ) <p> I have a 2 story house with the cable modem/router combo installed upstairs per the tech 's recommendation . I have struggled with signal strength downstairs since the install have finally gotten tired of the poor performance from wireless repeaters . The installation utilizes an Actiontec MOCA adaptor upstairs at the hitron cgn modem/router . What are my options for more reliably extending the range of my wireless signal ? <p> I would like to keep the setup upstairs and add something downstairs . Could a MOCA adaptor be plugged into a cable outlet downstairs and then Ethernet wired into a wireless router , or do they make wireless routers that can plugged directly into MOCA enabled cable jacks ? Will Mediacom provide equipment to get a proper signal through my house ? I 've tried calling a couple of times only to be told that Mediacom is n't responsible for my wireless signal and can not help me ... <p> Hello cableerik ; thanks for the post ! The MoCA is not for the Wi-Fi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet by carrying the network signals over the coax cables in your home and even it would be useless with a router but no modem . Though we can not control factors that affect Wi-Fi signal , mainly interference but of many types , the Wi-Fi channel setting can be adjusted to try to minimize these effects . If the majority of your Wi-Fi devices are upstairs , then it may be best to leave the modem/router upstairs , but if not , the modem location can be moved to a more central spot . The repeaters you have are simple repeaters or are they boosters as well ? Ultimately , if the makes/model of routers we have for our gateway modems do n't provide the strength you need , it may be best to purchase a separate router and get a standard modem installed . <p> Maybe I am misunderstanding the Moca adaptors , or maybe the function is different or limited with your install . A couple questions : <p> 1 . If I buy a good wireless router hoping to get enough range out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Cisco DPC3828 ) . The modem has a button to turn the wireless signal off . I 'm assuming this could be done but maybe something has to be done on your end ? <p> 2 . I was under the impression that I could put another MOCA adaptor ( such as Actiontec ECB2500 that is currently installed ) on a cable outlet and utilize it 's Ethernet port to plug in for wired internet . Any reason I could n't plug a router into it ? Actiontec also has a wireless network extender ( WCB3000 ) that claims you can plug into any cable outlet that is Moca enabled and extend your network . Would this work ? It claims to work if you have a Moca enabled device such as the ECB2500 installed , which I do . <p> Hey cableerik , just so I can make sure everything looks good with your internet service on our end , can you send me your account or phone number in a PM ? <p> 1 . If you do purchase your own router , you can still use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal to baseline the modem which will disable all wireless features and make it function as a modem only , not a modem/router combo . <p> 2 . Our MOCA is only used for connecting your Tivo service to the internet so the box can download guide data and On Demand features . It will not effect your wireless signal in your home and is not a wireless extender . It will not connect any devices to the internet through a hardwired connection and is only used to give your Tivo boxes access to the internet . <p> Thank you for the account information . Looking over your modem , I am seeing a few slight spikes in the downstream rx signal . Is the coax cable of the modem connected directly to the wall socket , or are there any splitters or adapters in between ? <p> Good morning cableerik ! You can certainly connect a purchased router to the Mediacom modem , but we will have to baseline it from here . When that is done , only the router will be able to connect to the modem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything else using Ethernet will need to connect to your router . <p> Looking over the modem here this morning , it was not reporting as it should . It had only one channel bonded for upstream and one for downstream , and it was not recognizing the internal router . I was able to reset it by sending a signal , but it seems the server that stores the Wi-Fi and router settings is not automatically sending the info to the router . I see you did have a Hitron modem/router previously and that info is saved on the server . Though I cant give or take any network names or passwords through online contact , I can update the current router with previous router settings . Is the network information the same as before in your home or is there a new network on the new modem/router ? <p> So I was impatient and tried to make it work before you baselined it , and everything worked great . Hooked the new router into port 1 and set everything up . Singal was much better with the router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to work . I was initially getting Internet from port 1 directly to my laptop but now I ca n't get Internet out of any of the Ethernet ports on the modem . Any chance you can set it back to how it was lol ? Or any other advice ? I 've already confirmed the Ethernet cables are good . Tried resetting the modem multiple times as well . <p> Looking over your modem , I see that it is giving off a valid IP address for internet access and is recognizing the ethernet connection as well . Have you restarted the devices that were directly connected to the modem ?

When connected to TV via HDMI cable , then powered up have a rapidly flashing ' record ' on the display panel of the box . Have a second DC700x in a different room and that box is working quite fine . THis would tend to indicate signal is adequate - at least at that particular jack . Tried swapping the failing box for the working box at this location and it continues to fail . This tells me the issue is with the box and not the jack or signal . <p> Anything I can do to get this 700x box working short of taking the afternoon off my job to swap it out ? <p> As a side note , a few weeks prior to noticing the 700x was non functional , the digital to analog converted in our master bathroom failed . Phone support attempted to reset the converted unsuccessfully . Swapped this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swap out works as a fill in for the one in the master bath . <p> Phone support said they 'd send out a replacement digital to analog converter since the local office is only open during business hours - meaning I 'd have to take time off my job to accomidate the limitations of Mediacom 's local office . Phone support said I would then return the failing one in the box supplied . Received an empty box containing a return shipping lable and a sheet cautioning me that I needed to return all components - box , remote , power cord , etc - upon terminating service . No indication of intent to swap a failed part for one that works . <p> Good morning , thanks for bringing this to our attention .

To send this , click on the speech bubble below may name to the left of this post . Thanks ! <p> Thanks , I 've received your information . I 've just built and sent across a set of signals that will attempt to reinitialize this box .

Keep me posted , and let me know if anything changes ! <p> Regrettably , no changes . Still flashing and unresponsive . Probably means a trip to the office in Moline ? If so , can my 17 year old son on his spring break do this for me next week , or do either his mom or I have to make the trip ? <p> Unfortunately , it looks like the issue is going to lie with the box itself rather than any software or hardware configuration .

If I switch over to a Mediacom whole house Tivo , can I use my own Tivo Mini units in extra rooms , and can I add on my external hard drive that I am currently using on my own Tivo unit for additional storage ? <p> Hi Dbarber600 , and welcome to the forum ! You can use your personal TiVo units and Minis with our whole home TiVo . However , we do not guarantee or support personal equipment .

Also , how much storage does the Mediacom Tivo unit have , in terms of both GB and hours of HD storage ? <p> Yes , you can use our main Tivo unit and still retain the minis .

You will need the assistance from tivo support in order to complete this . Unfortunately , we can not assist with that process . <p> The main Pace XG1 Tivo box does have 1TB of storage , however the mini units do not have their own separate usage individually , and rely on main Tivo box 's storage capacity and tuners.

I became a Mediacom customer 10/1/13 when they talked me in to leave AT&amp;T and gave me Amnesty on my old bills . Remember I have been a customer since 10/1/13 and now I am being charged yet again for an old bill . One Rep and One supervisor read the Amnesty notes over the phone but , no resolution . The bill amount when I received with Amnesty is the same amount of the bill I am being charged with and of course the lovely extra fee of 20% ( interesting ) . I am unable to obtain the Mediacom records department and I am not getting assistance on resolving this issue . I am not responsible to pay an old bill when I have been a customer since 10/1/2013 and was GIVEN Amnesty when I established new service with Mediacom . Please have this resolved and requesting formal letter of the issue being corrected and with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not my old bill . The old bill is not in my name , not my social security number , not a partner . I am not married and never had that last name that is on that old bill . I do n't understand how Mediacom and put someone else 's bill on my account and making me responsible to pay . The old bill is at my address , I rented a room . If a person wants your services the owner of the house should not be responsible or there would be a lot of issues with owner that own apartment complexes . By the way , the old 2008-2011 is from Mediacom not stating a Modem was turned in but , it was . It 's Mediacom error not that person on the account . It 's human error and it would be nice if it was corrected properly . <p> I have two accounts . I have an office that has residential account and my house I recently started . I have been having issues constantly . Not getting proper connection , bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues , etc . It has been a nightmare . I have issues with customer service ( being put on hold for 25 minutes or more ) , not showing up on repairs , not properly resolving repairs when they did show up . You have two really good repairmen and I am grateful for them . <p> Major issues regarding this , Putting an old past due amount on my current bill and not giving proper contact person to try to resolve the issue in a rational and professional manner . Mediacom not warning the customer of such charge and Mediacom not properly investigating Amnesty or proper person who is responsible for the past due amount . Mediacom should NOT but the customer under this much stress and having to try to find ways to resolve this issue . It is very hard to find a good representative at Mediacom that knows what is really going on and how to resolve the issue correctly . I am requesting Mediacom Corporate contact information . I need information on how and who to contact to properly resolve this issue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like them resolved . I will be more than happy to receive them via email or postal mail . 1 .

@@40219151 @219151/ <p> Earlier this week , my internet service was shut off due to an alleged DMCA violation . Apparently , 20th Century Fox filed a complaint because my IP was involved in sharing the movie " Red Tails " . To begin , it was n't me downloading it , but that 's only where the issues I have with this begin . <p> One problem I have is that this is my alleged " third strike " . In November I had to go to the local Mediacom office to sign some form for acknowledging that illegal downloading had already occurred . Back then it was n't me , either , but I signed the form anyway so I could resume using the service . This time my account has been shut off for good and , as stated earlier , I was told it was because this was the third time something like this has happened . The problem there is that I had never received any notice of a first violation . I had received two prior mailings from Mediacom , but both dealt with billing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Going a bit further , is the claim I got on the phone from customer service reps that the company is required by the DMCA to shut off my service or face legal action themselves . While I 'm not a lawyer , my understanding of the law is that there are protections in place for ISPs as long as they are n't providing havens for people that infringe on copyrights . They are required to shut off service to those that violate the law , but not necessarily after three times , or one time , or anything of the sort ; that is the company 's prerogative . <p> Then there is the issue that the only way to possibly get the internet back is to file a counter-notification form to the copyright holder themselves and that 's far from any guarantee . By filing this form , I would be sending personal information to that company and possibly subjecting myself to legal action from them . Even though I am innocent of any wrongdoing , that is a possibility I would not like to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the internet back through Mediacom is to either successfully win legal action against the copyright holder or to wait and see if they do n't respond within a certain amount of time . Neither of those are particularly appealing options . <p> Again , I am not a lawyer , but , reviewing the Acceptable Use Policy ( http : **27;1864;TOOLONG ) , there is nothing about a " three strike rule . " The policy also states that Mediacom MAY terminate service for violations of the policy and that these are done at its discretion . Is there any possibility that , proving my non-involvement and complete ignorance of the problem , Mediacom can use their discretion to NOT terminate my service ? It would be nice if , as a loyal , paying customer I could be shown some amount of due process by my provider . I would also like to know the exact time in which the alleged violation occurred , because for most of that day I was away from my computer until I logged in to find my service shut off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my internet runs out of a barracks room on a military base where hackers and IT people are trained ( unfortunately I am not one of them , or maybe I would have known how to better prevent this from happening in the first place ) . <p> Again , though , to my knowledge this was only the second violation on my account . <p> It would be nice if I could get some answers , preferably by somebody with some legal knowledge and not a customer service rep reading talking points . Unless resolved soon I will bring the issue before my own legal representatives . <p> Logged <h> MediacomJames <p> Unfortunately we do have a three-strike policy in regards to DMCA violations , and we are not able to waive that policy for any accounts . Since the infringements occurred using your internet service the strikes do go onto your account , regardless of whether it was done by yourself or someone else using your internet service . Short of the counter notification process , we will not be able to resume your internet service .

Please reset my PIN to the last four of my account number so I can get in and change it . <p> I 'm also experiencing dropped calls to your support ( 2/3 ) and some flickering on my TV so perhaps there is a problem with the signal . I 've already got an order for a tech to come out and check that - hopefully both problems can be resolved when the signal issue is fixed . <p> I have gotten a very poor impression of this company as a new ( 4 days ) user . I 'm a software engineer and have experienced my better managed cable providers . <p> Issue one : I called my own telephone number as per the VM setup instructions and was told my new PIN was not valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forum to ask someone to reset my PIN . This indicates a poorly managed initial setup service and could be easily solved by any number of processes and procedures . Waste of time and frustration resulted from this . <p> Issue two : I ca n't register on the Mediacom website since apparently I have to wait for a bill to get that PIN . Why ca n't I just put in my account number and go through a wizard to do the initial setup ? Alternatively , why not just send out an activation link to set up a new account like everyone who knows what they are doing on the internet does ? <p> Issue three : I called support and had the phone connection dropped twice and I 'm told they ca n't just do a call back . Why do n't they immediately do a support ticket so when I do call back I can pick up where we left off ? <p> Issue four : The dropped phone calls may have something to do with a flickering picture on my TV indicating a bad connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuesday to look into that . <p> Issue five : Poor installation process lacking quality checks . My normal speedtest speed is good , which is all the installation tech checked and apparently he did n't look at the TV picture where the problem was obvious from the beginning . <p> All of the above indicates a lack of concern with quality and customer satisfaction . I also question upper level management who allow this sort of thing to happen . Do they use their own service and are they all lacking in any type of technical expertise ? <p> I 'm a technologist and if I 'm frustrated with things that any 1'st year comp-sci major could do easily in terms of process , what the heck is grandma going to do ? <p> Thanks for contacting us here ! I 'm sorry to hear about the issues you 've been encountering since the services were connected . I 'll outline like you have done above . <p> 1 .

We can not pass along the PIN over the phone or email . <p> 3 . When speaking with the representatives over the phone , they should notate the account after each call they take summarizing the issues and steps taken to resolve the problem . I 'm sorry that this has n't occurred in the past . Also , it 's best to verify the issue the customer is having that way they 're not assuming what the issue is . I understand this is frustrating but it also helps ensure the issues are addressed properly . <p> 4 .

The phone partially lost connection again on a local call - it just got too garbled to hear . So far two dropped calls and one screwed up - not sure about this . <p> The long distance calls were to Mediacom support . The local call was to the home number in the afternoon from my work number , not sure which day , but in the last few days . The local call did n't disconnect completely , it just got garbled so we could hardly speak . <p> To dig into this , can you record the next three calls that happens on with the date and close to specific time as possible .

@@40219154 @219154/ <p> Over the last 6 months we have had problems with our internet . When I say problems I mean , the internet is on for 30 seconds the goes off for 10-20 sec then back on again . It makes doing anything online nearly impossible . We contacted support and they proceeded to send a tech ... two weeks later . The tech arrived when my roommate was here and told her that " everyone in this area has problems , thanks for calling , bye " . That was it ... He did n't do anything . Eventually the drops starting getting so bad that we were going anywhere from 1 hour to 12 hours without it at all . Once again I contacted support . This time I would not let her get off until we accomplished something . After 4 hours of her , " I do n't knows " . The internet came on and stayed on for about 24 hours . The disconnects started again . We have a tech scheduled to come , once again , I guess to personally inform us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have a web conference tonight for the MBA program I am in . I went outside and followed the line to the junction box where there have been multiple lines cut with a pair of wire cutters and one of the lines is hanging about three feet from the ground in the backyard of a 6 year olds house . Not knowing if this line had power to it or was crossing over a powerline that had been cut I contacted Mediacom Support and informed them of this potentially deadly safety concern . The response I received from a Support person named Gin , was , " I am sorry for this inconvenience but we ca n't send anyone until our schedule permits . " . A dead 6 year old is an inconvenience in the eyes of this company . I told the agent that either someone would be out here ASAP to remove the line and fix this issues or that I would cut it myself . I would rather get hurt than allow a small child to . Our internet has been completely off now for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours . I gave thenlady until 2PM EST to have someone call me about this issue or I was cutting the line down . At 1:56 the internet miraculously came back on and has been every since . We consistently have problems until we complain . Then all of a sudden our problems cease long enough to appease us and come back . I do n't know why Mediacom is purposefully stopping our connections . Maybe because of overload . But there have been too many coincidences to think this is an accident . <p> By the way , I have taken pictures of these hanging wires and I have the chatlog from our conversation . I will be posting these on every forum and every alert site I can find unless someone gets their butt out here to take care of it today . The lack of concern for the safety of a child is absolutely insane . Mediacom , because of the lack of cable internet competition , has lost all accountability .

Yes , I am having issues with my internet as is everyone else and I do not expect you to put the priority on my connection above anyone that was there before me . However , the hanging wire in the backyard of a child , which is not mine , is my primary concern . In all likelihood it is simply a cable wire and not dangerous . If , because of the amount of severed wires on the powerline above it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severed or damaged powerline then it is very likely conducting that electricity through the cable itself and is deadly . There are too many damaged and cut wires above to tell from the ground if this is the case . It is possible though .

It is more cost efficient that trying to make them happy . For those that did n't know this is a common business principle you learn in school . Cheap disgruntled customers lead to a higher increase in value than expensive happy customers .

There is n't a problem with the hardware because it is capable to pick up a signal , when one is there . Where there is n't I 've hooked the modem up to the cable outside that runs straight from the junction box and it still fails to work until it receives a signal . I can assure you that this problem is because there is no signal coming in . The existence or lack thereof , of a signal , can be manipulated from your end . Whether you are personally doing it or whether Mediacom has it setup to set off these intermittent connections to reduce the strain on their infrastructure and you can override them . The bottom line is that the people on the other end of support are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are able to take it away at will as well , or at least , let it fail . Every single time for the last 7 times I 've contacted Mediacom about this , the signal returns within 5 minutes after sometimes being out for days . I doubt you could convince anyone that this is simply a coincidence . Would you please allow the signal to return and I will stop coming to these forums . A tech has already been here and said it was normal . I have no reason to believe that him coming back will make it any different . Will he retract his statement and say he changed his mind and it wont be normal anymore ? So our connection normalcy is dependent upon the number of times a tech has to come ?

I assure you this is not being caused by a representative flipping a switch from here . There is obviously and issue somewhere between your modem and the tap . It could be something as simple as a bad splitter ( you could remove splitter and see if issue persists with coax cable connected direct to modem to test ) or even water in the line . I am not able to see exactly what the issue is , only that there is definitely an issue here that needs to be addressed by a service technician at your location . <p> Its not a bad splitter . I took the modem outside and connected it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still would not work . Wherever the issue is it is on the junction box at the pole going toward you . Resetting the modem will not do any good . I am not saying that someone is " flipping a switch " . However , each time I contact support the signal returns within 5 mins of us talking . This has happened for 7 consecutive times spanning the last 3 months . At no time in between was there contact with support that this did not occur . I do n't know , maybe it is just some very strange coincidence ... If you look at our records spanning the entire time we have had your service since August of 2013 you will see that " 10% " of the time is not just for the past week but for the entire time . I have contacted you all over and over and over again for 6 months and here I am still . I can not understand how the company can justify charging 100% service fees for 10% service . We have had a service tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at with our records was " normal " . When he comes out here and fails to do anything whatsoever , whether out of sheer laziness , incompetence , lack of knowledge etc ... and leaves , we have to wait another two weeks before someone that can fix the problem may show up . You charge us full price for internet we do n't have , send a tech that says its normal to not have what we are paying to have , then when we call back to get another tech you tell us it will be another two weeks for a problem that is 6 mos old and you failed to fix the first time ? Really ? ... On top of all of this you allow wires to hang down in the yard of a kid and will only see about them when your schedule permits ? Honestly , I think people need to start getting together and file a class action lawsuit . We do n't pay for power we do n't use . We do n't pay for water we do n't use , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use except for internet . If Mediacom was forced to charge people for only usage and not as a package , I bet they would change their service policy . All it would take is one person to subpoena the connection records and file a suit disputing the charges during the periods that they lacked the service that they were charged for before Mediacom would have to resort to charging people based on usage or face multiple suits across the country ... That is a thought . Especially considering my sister is a lawyer and hates Mediacom with a passion . Americans will only be pushed around for so long before they start pushing back . Judging by these forums , I do n't think finding disgruntled customers will be a problem . Do something , do n't do something , I think I know what I 'm doing next . I especially do n't like being taken advantage of . <p> Logged 45222 @qwx455222 <p> jalexan4 , As I have stated here I do understand your frustration . Since you have contacted me here , I have been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work order for the tech that is coming out to address your issue , and have sent this to our local dispatch to see if this can be moved up so that your service can be restored . As it is a Sunday , not a business day , we may not hear anything back until tomorrow . The last completed trouble call on your account was 10/26/13 . If this issue persists after the trouble call is completed , and the tech does not send this to Maintenance to look further up the line , then we will be more than happy to escalate this issue to Area Management to look into . I assure you that our Social Media Team does want to resolve your issues so that you are getting the service in which you are paying for . After you last post , I credited you from the day you called in and setup the trouble call to the 15th . I assure you , we will continue to do everything we can from here to resolve your issues . <p> I just wanted to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed today . How are your services working now ? Please keep us updated and if any additional work or troubleshooting needs done to get this resolved we will be happy to help .

@@40219156 @219156/ <p> I am a Mediacom Communications Corp . customer paying for 50Mbps/5Mbps , and I have recently decided to devote the time into possibly bringing a very problematic issue in to light . I sort of recently found out that Mediacom buys " internet " from Comcast and AT&amp;T , which leads me to believe is the cause of me not to be able to watch streamed video at more than in my internet plans speeds constraints . I can not watch Netflix at high bit rates at certain times of the day , constant buffering on streams on Twitch.TV ( Streaming platform website ) on high bitrates ( source quality ) . <p> I have performed tracerts to Twitch.tv and provided them to a twitch admin , and he stated <p> " Well , that 's really interesting . You 're coming into our network via Comcast , but Comcast is not announcing Mediacom 's internet prefixes to us . I wonder why that is ... We actually see your IP via a 3rd party transit provider behind AT&amp;T , which means Mediacom buys internet transit from AT&amp;T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is internet capacity concerns between us and AT&amp;T , the good news is we have a solution for that coming very very soon . However , if the problem is Mediacom 's connection to AT&amp;T , that 's something Mediacom is going to have to work with AT&amp;T to improve . " <p> It has been about a week now , and nothing has been improved , and I doubt this " solution " is going to do anything to fix the problems , even if they do , I still have youtube issues . I want to know why I am getting these issues around " peak usage hours " when the speeds I 'm getting are literally not even half of what I pay for , how is that in the realm of tolerance of the excuse that " peak usage hours " causes slower speeds ? ? ? I have a program called Steam downloaded on my computer that let 's my download games to my games library . It has never seemed to show me any slow speeds , I always get around 5-6.5MBps when downloading from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jpeg showing the speeds I typically get from steam along with youtube stats showing how horrid the bandwidth usage is depending on the day . Both of them are on the same video and same quality .. I will also provide a tracert used on the sites I am having trouble with . The domain is live.twitch.tv and after around 10 pings , its blocks the icmp address , which is why it times out . I will show the results of a bittorrent sample of a site called Glasnost , which shows if your isp is shaping traffic or not . I can not get the site to test flash video for some reason , it bugs out . <p> I have many other things to provide , but I would have probably scrambled them in the text , and I will wait for replies to provide more insight on this . In my opinion , I think it has to do with Mediacom 's agreement with AT&amp;T/Comcast , and how shady both those companies are , and also to do with the lines coming in my area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentionally being throttled during select times , to save a few bucks . <p> Hello , thanks for letting us know about this trouble . We do run through Comcast and ATT backbone providers and have heard of similar trouble before , usually having to do with peering between the backbone and the endpoint service . Unfortunately , there is little that we can do to address this directly , but we can certainly ensure that things on our side of the network are running smoothly . Currently , I do show your modem to be online with great signal levels , properly provisioned for 50 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up , bonding to multiple downstream and upsteam channels , connected to a router , and operating in an area where utilization remains good- with 7 of 8 channels maintaining below the 70% mark . During peak times , what results do you receive on a speedtest ? Do you notice any differences when connected directly to the modem- bypassing all other equipment ? <p> Since this is an issue with streaming video sources , almost exclusively , additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The above traceroute to YouTube.com shows little trouble , with the exception of a slow response time at a peering point along the ATT backbone . Google also has a video quality report that can be viewed here : LONG ... which may carry some additional information . Likewise , if Twitch is troublesome , pings and traceroutes to the hosting server can help . <p> I thought I put in the tracert to twitch , guess I did n't . The tracert to twitch.tv is to live.twitch.tv , so do n't be confused if you see that . I do n't understand why a whole line of the live.twitch.tv tracert is cutting off though . After 10 twitch.tv blocks the connection , so that is why it only goes to 9 . And basically what you told me in the first part of your message is that you know there are troubles with the backbone providers you have with the services your customers use , but seemingly are n't doing anything about that or pressuring those companies to get their **** together ? Hopefully this fcc decision does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , looking at all the forum posts , I see that a majority of them are about internet speed issues , which would prompt me to ask myself , what are you guys doing to improve customers views of you as a company , maybe by utilizing a little of that money you are getting and beef up the actual network in areas you have a complete monopoly in ? It 's quite frustrating when me as a customer literally can not do anything when the company he pays hundreds of dollars to decides to stay in the stone ages and not offer actual guaranteed speeds instead of bull****ting customers and giving them $5 upgrades to a service they wo n't ever be guaranteed because their backbone providers have a complete choke hold on anything that can happen anywhere in my area . Man up and do something about it as a whole , instead of forcing customers to sit back and wait because apparently Mediacom customers can not contact Comcast and tell them anything because we are n't technically their customers , which is totally bs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think ? It shows users being throttled while watching high quality video , because how would someone with 50/5 " broadband " not be able to watch a 1080p video or a high bitrate stream , how is showing the percentage of users that are being able to stream quality video at different times of the day going to help ? All that shows is when isp 's and backbones decide to save some money and throttle you . <p> This tracert to twitch was n't during troublesome hours , I just provided it as you asked , i 'll do another tomorrow . Most likely wo n't show really anything because ping times are n't even related to the issue that is actually going on behind the scenes <p> Another question , why do you guys basically provide false information saying " upstreams are spiking that would causing this delay you are having . I 'm forwarding this to area management to look into further . Once we have any updates on this issue , we will be reaching out to you . " I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing is resolved . Why do you guys insist this is going to further your reputation as a company ? How is this solving anything by saying you are notifying " area management . " <p> These forums are here to assist customers with their issues . I see the customer that MediacomRobert was working with , from which you pulled the quote , was experiencing intermittent latency and high ping times . After looking over the upstream signal for his area there is a very high percentage of errors in for the entire area . Since this was an area issue we have forwarded this over to the area management team to further investigate . We continue to keep in contact with the specific area management teams that we notify of area signal issues and update the customers with any information we receive . Once you 're able to perform the aforementioned troubleshooting steps feel free to update us here ! <p> I can pull other quotes from different people saying basically the same thing if you want me to . Here is one from you November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the original poster is still having troubles today ! " Thanks for following up with us here ! Since there have been multiple technicians out and you 're still experiencing the problem I 'll be forwarding this up to your area management team for further review . Once we receive any updated information from them we 'll be sure to pass it along to you here ! " <p> Here is ANOTHER by you on October 16 , 2014 : " You 're welcome ! Be sure to keep us updated . I know we 're still working with your area management on that utilization issue as well . " This is still an ongoing issue for the poster as well , around 5months later ! <p> We work with many many customers across many platforms , topics , threads , and sites . We interact with area Technical Operations Supervisors , managers , construction teams , maintenance crews , and directors in an effort to address localized and area-wide concerns as the situation arises . We are well aware of open topics and posts , as we keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue addressing your concerns here , we can do so with additional information requested . If , at any time , you feel that you are not receiving the support you need , we can also be reached any time at 866-452-4747 . <p> The tracert i just did was around 3PM during " peak hours . " The timeouts are normal because the website blocks icmp addresses after they have successfully connected . Are you guys not familiar with glasnost or something ? Can you guys take a look at that imgur of the test and tell me why the downloads are so low ? Do you just disregard anything that is n't a speedtest.net test ? Here is the tracert to twitch.tv http : //pastebin.com/ZYX6B07H which shows really no problems , even more reason for me to believe something is up with traffic being messed with . <p> We generally prefer our customers to run speed tests from speedtest.net for a baseline of speeds . Since we do n't traffic shape or throttle any services or websites the glasnost tests would not be needed . For troubleshooting purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retesting Twitch and Youtube ? Could you also ensure your flash player is up to date ? Another troubleshooting step you could try would be restarting the PC into safe mode with networking and testing the videos you 're having issues with . <p> Who are you speaking for when you say you do n't traffic shape or throttle ? Are you just going to disregard the test I provided showing slow speeds ? I 've already bypassed the router and nothing has changed , it has nothing to do with my hardware . <p> We are speaking for Mediacom . We do n't throttle service or traffic shape on our network . The last trace route you sent was going through a router . Are you able to bypass the router and give us a ping tests/trace routes during peak hours when you are having problems ? Once you have that bypassed send us the results on here . <p> Here you go , bypassed the router. http : //pastebin.com/FEeQprwM I believe you when you say Mediacom as a company does n't throttle or limit bandwidth , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do behind the scenes , which is what this is ultimately about . <p> This is likely less of an issue with throttling and more a problem with bottlenecking at certain peering points between these services and the backbone . As such , this would affect a large number of users across a large number of ISPs . Unfortunately , there is little that we can do , directly , to affect this , as this will typically be contingent upon cooperative efforts between the backbone providers and those services . As you mentioned in your first post , correspondence with Twitch staff suggested this possibility : <p> " If there is internet capacity concerns between us and AT&amp;T , the good news is we have a solution for that coming very very soon . " <p> As such , we can certainly work to identify problems within our network . So far , there has been little posted that suggests an issue to be present in that respect . It seems as though speeds themselves typically perform very well , though we have been unable to confirm this as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protocol will be widely inaccurate , as this peer-to-peer process will heavily depend on the host 's upload capabilities . While you may be provisioned for down speeds of 50 Mbps , this will mean very little if a test host can only upload at 5 Mbps- as an example . <p> In essence , if the issue lies in general speeds or even speed or lag to a specific service , we can look into this more closely and work with Tier 2 and Network Operations to confirm this . To do so , we require further information gathered during the time trouble exists . This includes- all while wired directly to the modem- general speedtests ( typically performed to a server geographically near and- ideally- to multiple so that an average can be calculated ) , ping tests and traceroutes to the service , and a readout of your ipconfig /all . With this information , we can move forward with diagnostics on our network to determine any underlying trouble . <p> Well considering in his post he used the word " if " he was most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he is or not . Nothing has improved on twitch during " peak hours " for me anyway . That still does n't explain why the same thing is happening on youtube video streaming because the quote you mentioned that I posted in my original post , was from a twitch admin , not associated with youtube . When you say " little posted that suggest an issue to be present in that respect . " Do you not know Comcast 's track record in recent history with the FCC regarding what is most likely happening here ? I can provide as much as I can regarding the information you need to push this forward .

Because I do not get blocked out when using the app over LTE , I am assuming there is an issue with the DNS settings you provide . <p> Can you provide any relevant feedback since you advertise this as a watch anywhere service that I pay for . I would prefer to watch the games over cable in HD but somehow in the year 2017 you only offer the channel in SD . <p> Hello keithhov !

That 's why its deflating it no longer works . I am blocked out from the national apps because I am considered to be in the local markets and while I hate that policy I understand why I am block out . <p> This app is only for users who pay for the channel through my Mediacom account , that is why I expect Mediacom to figure out why Mediacom users are being blocked out for a service we pay for . <p> Good evening Keithhov .

I know you are n't blacking me out . <p> I am paying Mediacom for access to Comcast sportsnet through cable and through streaming , many cable customers with other cable companies and Mediacom customers have the right to stream ALL wizards and capitals games using the app there is no fine print about blackout restrictions , There are no blackout restrictions associated with this service .

A : Just as with televised MLB/NBA/NHL games on NBC Sports Regional Networks , availability of games via TV Everywhere is subject to territorial blackout restrictions . <p> I have been blacked out of games where there is no territorial blackouts , quite simply the games are only available locally on NBC sports regional network . No national feed is being broadcast , no national feed stream on NHL network no NBA TV . Further strengthening that argument is that this just happens to occur with both the NBA and NHL at the same time . These black outs are simply an error , what causes that error is not for me to investigate . I pay for the content through Mediacom , I have a relationship with Mediacom . You have a relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its now playoffs in both leagues so any troubleshooting is now mute but it all comes down to one sentence ......... I have been blacked out of games where there is no territorial blackouts . Not looking for an explanation of fix at this point .

Mediacom gives you access to the app , we have no control over what NBC is showing on the app . That being said , we will look into this . Again , I 'm sorry for this , and your frustration .

What we are getting is around 10Mbps download , I could get this kind of service from DSL at a fraction of the cost . We are both gamers and we pay for the higher speeds to make gaming and watching HD moves as seemless as possible . This has been an ongoing issue for the last several months at least . I read a post that talked about the modem being setup incorrectly , not sure if this is the issue . We are both IT guys by trade ( Computer Engineer and System Adminitrator ) and have trouble shot the issue to the best of our abilities . We both think that it is an issue on Mediacoms side . I would really like to get this resolved or we will be looking into an alternative provider . <p> Last Edit : February 18 , 2015 , 06:58:09 PM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thank you for contacting us here about this issue . We have reviewed your modem and all signal levels are well within acceptable range , you are bonding to all down and upstream channels , and you are currently provisioned to the proper speeds . Are you seeing these speed drops at certain times of the day ? Are you seeing these speed drops connected direct to the modem via ethernet , or wireless ? <p> Also , do you happen to see any issues with any other services , such as cable ? <p> Cable comes in through the basement and goes through one splitter before hitting the modem . The speed tests that we have run are from hard wire , not WiFi . We generally run tests in the evening after we are home from work , this is also when we do most of our gaming/watching movies . There have been a few test run on the weekends with the same results . Does n't  seem like a speed drop to us , it is consistently underperforming , we do n't  expect it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for the information ! First and foremost , I do see that the equipment being used may not properly handle the 150 Mbps speeds on our network . In order to achieve these levels , a DOCSIS 3.0 modem capable of bonding at least 8 downstream channels needs to be used . It looks like current model used- a Motorola SB6121- is only capable of a 4-channel bond . We would definitely want to ensure that the correct equipment is being utilized , and we can have a replacement shipped out to you free-of-charge if you would like . It is likely that a modem capable of 8+ downstream channels will address the issue entirely , as all other signal levels , etc. are in great shape . <p> Beyond this , I do see that the modem is connected to a router as well- looks like possibly a Belkin . Have you run speedtests with this unit bypassed- connecting directly into the modem itself , rather than a wired connection to the router ? Do you see results any closer toward the provisioned levels ? <p> That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight about either having you send a new modem or acquiring one on our won . I am unsure if this modem was provided or something that he purchased . The router is pretty new if memory serves , I believe it is a Linksys WRT1900AC Wireless AC Router , which when I last researched router was one of the top performers . We have performed speed tests both with this unit bypassed and included with similar results , so pretty sure this is n't the issue . <p> My brother has been dealing with this for longer than I have . He is telling me that we have an ARRIS / Motorola SB6121 SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem , which is docsis 3.0 . This modem should support 150 Mbps . He says that he used to get 50Mbps ( still not great ) but for the last few months we have been seeing 10Mbps . He is of the opinion that something on Mediacoms side changed . If you send us one is there a rental charge or upfront fee ? Alternatively if we purchase one will this LONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page . <p> The Motorola SB6141 is a a model in use by a lot of our customers with purchased modems , and it also has a little bit more capabilty than the SB6121 . The 6121 has a maximum downstream channel bonding limit of four , while the 6141 can bond to eight downstream channels and two upstream channels to spread out the load a bit more a stabilize speeds . While they are both DOCSIS 3 , the channel boding is an important piece of getting the max speeds . Alternately , if you were to rent a modem from us , there would be a rental fee of $5 per month for a comparable DOCSIS 3 modem capable of bonding to all channels like the 6141 . <p> We have purchased an ARRIS / Motorola SurfBoard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem . It is compatible with All Major Cable providers like Comcast/Xfinity , Cox , Charter , Time Warner , Mediacom , Bright House . Supports internet download speeds up to 686 Mbps and upload speeds up to 131 Mbps based on your Cable provider service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future proof your modem as your Cable Internet Provider enhances capability .

If you would prefer you can also give us a call at 866-452-4747 and a representative over the phone can get the MAC address from you and provision the modem .

I 've taken a look over the signal levels and I 'm showing all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels , and the utilization is low for your area as well . Could you directly connect one PC to the modem and run 3 speed tests from different servers on speedtest.net ? Once you perform those tests could you also link us the results ?

I was doing some research to figure out why i was randomly getting blank webpages , and after opening chrome 's developer tools i realized that i was being redirected to the IP address of 97.64.255.12 which was not always opening . After figuring out that this was being caused by the perftech warning i was wondering if there anyway you can send me an email instead of a popup when i 'm starting to reach my cap ? What i love about the popup is that it keeps informing me that i was getting close to my cap last month even though i still had 235.9 GB remaining . But then why am i still being notified when my billing cycle restarted 2 days ago ? <p> Also have another question because this URL does not look encrypted. &gt; So by employing this iframe is MediaCom putting me an my family 's Data at risk ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ http page you can be redirected to a site that you were n't intending to log into and also not know if the certificate was safe . I know my Wife and Kid would not noticed this and would still proceed to login not knowing better . Do other mediacom customers realize that they too could be put at risk ? <p> Just to confirm what i was thinking , i did a quick search and multiple sites say putting an https iframe inside of a http page can put end users at risk and chrome plans to block and warn users of sites that do this with more than a " Not Secure box " . <p> Hello , spkmedia ! I am very sorry to hear about the overage notification banner issues . Unfortunately , I am not able to setup emails instead of popups ; however , we can disable the popups and you can check your internet usage as often as you would like , either on our MediacomToday.com website or with our Mediacom smart phone app ! <p> As for the data risk issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind our corporate firewalls . After speaking to Tier-2 , your data should not be at risk ; however , on Monday , I will be asking the developer of the PerfTech to make absolute sure for you . <p> Thank you for checking into this for me . I do n't think it matters if server is located on mediacoms network and is behind a firewall . All it take is for someone to click a link that they believe is legitimate or some JavaScript vulnerability to modify the page . Keep in mind that most sites should hopefully start blocking this behavior . Even the default link LONG ... is supposed to show weather.com but weather.com is blocking this from happening via X-Frame-Options . I just do n't like how the iframe is hiding the true endpoint and the certificate information . <p> We were able to opt you out so you wo n't be receiving those pop up notifications anymore . If you ever swap out modems in the future , please let us know , as we may have to remove you from that list again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd like to say that the use of this iFrame injection is resulting in about 1/3 blank pages for me whenever I 'm surfing . <p> On a personal note , I think it 's intrusive , obnoxious and unnecessary . I truly hope Mediacom reconsiders the methods in which they notify their customers about account details . I 'm sure spkrmedia and I are n't the only 2 experiencing this issue , and it likely is resulting in a bad perception of you as an ISP . Also , it is a bit of a privacy issue as not everyone who uses the connection should necessarily know that info . <p> Hello Ins , can you please explain why the iFrame would cause you to have 1/3 of your pages to be blank ? We offer an opt out to customer 's not wanting the pop ups , we apologize for the inconvenience . <p> It 's likely due to the fact that I am on a VPN connection and it 's not allowing the traffic through . Since the request from your servers are coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire request and results in a blank page . <p> Also to be noted is that the iFrame is breaking some sites ' layout when scrolling downward . For example , on my Android phone when browsing slashdot.org , the header image is half cut off and it 's impossible for me to scroll down . This phone is not a part of the VPN connection on my PC and so is a different issue regarding the Mediacom iFrame . <p> A VPN would completely bypass mediacom 's ability to inject into your pages . They would not be able to tell the difference between you browsing a website and sending an email if you are connected to a VPN and routing all traffic down that . I suspect you have an issue elsewhere , like an adblocker plugin or NoScript or something to that effect , but I do n't think this one is Mediacom 's fault . <p> A VPN would completely bypass mediacom 's ability to inject into your pages .

You can view a list of customer owned compatible modems by going go : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mediacom does not provide will work with our system . That being said , as long as you get a Docsis 3.0 cable modem , you should be fine . Even though it is not necessary , I would recommend purchasing a modem that can bond to at least 16 downstream channels . If the modem that you mentioned is a 16x4 , you should be able to bond to 16 downstream channels and 4 upstream channels , if available . Your area does have 16 downstream channels to connect to . A 16 downstream modem will handle all of our speeds except for our 1 Gig service .

Check your network connection . If wireless settings were changed , make sure your wireless clients are reconfigured accordingly . " This I assume is what is causing all my issues .

@@40219179 @219179/ <p> There are several comparatively recent threads on the topic of blocking Robo calls ( that mask their origination using fake caller IDs ) It is impossible to block individual numbers to stop this since we 've been getting several daily . As of a year ago , Media Com 's position was that it took head-end reconfiguration , which could only be done during a maintenance operation . As of June , one of the requesters asked for how Mediacom could accomplish that : the3 answer was that the request would be passed along . The recent strings seem to deflect the issue ( the need for a systemic robocall blocking ) , and suggest that we , the end user , block calls individually : That is impossible because of the software being used to spoof caller I.D .. Blocking anonymous calls does help ( I 've tried it . To my understanding , the only way to block this is simultaneous ring . Unless the technology has changed drastically , is n't this just a variation of the same technology used in call forwarding ? Without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November topics responses ) , can I simply ask : 1 ) Is Mediacom planning to implement a robo-blocking system ? If yes , when ? If not , the nuisance factor is enough justification to look at alternatives . <p> Hello Emeso . The spoofing of caller ids has plagued phone providers for quite some time and the software and technology is constantly changing . Mediacom 's abuse department works hand in hand with the FCC and other agencies on trying to prevent these types of calls but the only defense currently is to enable the anonymous call rejection feature and to add numbers to the selective call rejection list . Also make sure to add yourself to the Do Not Call Registry once a year . In the meantime , Mediacom is constantly working to implement new technology to try to deter such calls . I do apologize that I can not give you more than this . Thanks <p> Unfortunately , you are not considering the fact that the computerized calling system they are using applies random numbers - making your suggestion illogical - analogous to locking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , your " anonymous call rejection " does n't do any good either - it neither blocks the nuisance robo calls nor the abusive political calls ( e.g. , 800-service ) . I question how dilligently this is being pursued by MediaCom when the other major cable providers have this service already available , and have had for over a year . The technology is neither new , nor " novel , " but I believe , a variation of the call forwarding protocol . Sounds like it 's time to use another phone service provider . <p> We 'd hate to lose you 're service and hope you reconsider changing service providers . We 'll continue to work to bring the best customer experience possible and will continue to have these calls blacked .

So I called David Slinker , CenturyLinks local press contact , for an update . <p> Though Des Moines was n't on the initial group of cities announced on Aug. 8 , many parts of the metro just recently got higher speed service , he said . In just the past few weeks CenturyLink has rolled out its first 100-megabyte Fiber to Home technology in several new housing developments in Greater Des Moines , including some areas of downtown Des Moines , he said .

@@40219184 @219184/ <h> Author Topic : Private router issues ( Read 1057 times ) <p> A little background : I have had issues over the years with my wireless routers and my cable modem - now with Mediacom but with other cable carriers as well . I have been told a number of times that my router is the problem and I have replaced it a couple of times . This appears to be a common problem and I suspect millions of people have done similarly . Recently I discovered ( hard to believe it took me so long ) that the cable modem and router do not communicate well . To be precise , the cable companies ( including Mediacom I believe ) have their systems set to kick off routers that do not belong to them - and the MAC address of the router will generally identify whether it is a Mediacom router or a privately purchased router . What I discovered is that changing the router setting to clone the MAC address of the computer that was used to set up the cable modem access will " fool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I made this adjustment and things improved markedly . However , my router still gets kicked off every couple of nights . The cable modem is still connected with access , but the router needs to be unplugged and then plugged in again to restore internet access to my computer . I believe this is still due to some setting in the Mediacom network . I have given up on calling technical support because they only tell me to buy a new router . I am considering a class action lawsuit ( which I hate ) because I believe millions of people have replaced their routers unnecessarily . I am hoping that this forum can help me resolve this issue . <p> Good Morning , thanks for letting us know about this trouble ! We ourselves do not block out any user-purchased equipment . We do offer a Home Networking service with a leased gateway device , but this is not required for internet to function , nor is it required to establish a wireless home network . Independent routers can be used without any trouble . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , there can be a few possible causes to this trouble that we can suggest . Since this happens once every few days , it sounds as though it might be an issue with the equipment 's DHCP settings . These can be accessed from your router 's config utility . By turning this up , you should be able to increase the amount of time before all your devices renew IP information . <p> My Netgear N300 router apparently does not let you set the lease time . There is a potentially risky way to get around this but I am not savvy enough to try and there are a number of comments that this should not be necessary . I would add that my problem appears to be quite common and happens with any number of different routers - just try a little searching and you will find that many many people have troubles with their routers disconnecting periodically ( the lease time is not supposed to be a problem since it keeps getting automatically renewed before expiring ) . <p> Between the cable providers and router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back an forth . Meanwhile I , and many others , get told it is the router , no its the cable modem , no its the settings , no its ...... For the record , I started with a Mediacom modem/router and went to the modem with my own router because the Mediacom router was so bad . <p> So , what does it take to get the connection to not get lost every day ? To reiterate : the modem is staying connected ; the router must be rebooted ( approximately ) daily in order to stay connected . My DHCP server lease time can not easily be reset . I have two wired devices connected to the router and one wireless device . My problems improved when I cloned the MAC address of my computer , but have started getting worse again . <p> Update : the problem is getting worse now . I have lost my connection twice this morning . Both times the modem remained connected but I had to reboot my router to re-establish the connection . I really do n't think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the router and the modem . What settings could account for this ? <p> If the modem is staying online and it is the router that is losing connection , then the best way to begin narrowing down causes would be to bypass the router and connect a device directly to the modem with the same ethernet cable- letting it run in this configuration for as long as possible . If you continue to see loss , you might try to swap the ethernet cables . If this problem disappears , then it would likely be an issue with the router or its configuration . Further , if you are seeing this happen only on one device in the network , etc. , then it may very well be an issue with the configuration of that device , specifically . <p> I can swap the connection of my computer to the modem ( disconnecting the router ) and the connection works . So , it is the router that loses the connection . It happens on all devices connected to the router ( wired or wireless ) . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the DHCP server ? I have a starting and ending IP address - they are the same until the final decimal , then the starting is .2 and the ending is .254 . <p> That 's typically normal , to allow a bunch of devices to connect to the router . Devices will start at x.x.x.2 and have IPs assigned up to x.x.x.255 . Most routers these days will assign IP reservations , so the device IP will remain the same- tied to the MAC- with each lease renewal . DHCP renewal is usually automatic and streamlined , to avoid any issues , but I have seen rare circumstances where this has posed a problem . <p> The problem continues . Every day or two I need to unplug my router and plug it back in . It then works fine . But somehow , during the night , it loses the connection . As far as I can tell the modem remains connected throughout . I repeat - I do not believe this is a hardware problem and I do not believe my router needs to be replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modem , and my router . What next ? <p> I did n't try that today but I believe ( from past experience ) that the connection is fine if I bypass the router . The modem was showing itself to be connected this morning . The indicators on the router were fine as well - but the connection was lost and became re-established immediately after rebooting the router . I have the mac address on the router cloning the one on the computer . <p> A bit more background . I had purchased my own modem a couple of weeks ago , thinking that was the problem ( Mediacom has since installed a new modem and I returned the one I had purchased ) - the technical support phone person could not get my new modem recognized . When the installer put in the new Mediacom modem , it took him 2 hours to get the modem recognized by the network ( despite it showing as connected ) . While all of these problems could be unrelated , I have a feeling they are all related and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attached devices . <p> If you are only having an issue with your 3rd party equipment , then that would indicate an issue with equipment itself . If we did not sell/lease you the equipment we would be unable to take an in depth look into the internal settings of your equipment . <p> Read back over the thread . Your answer is right out of the book - and the reason why I keep thinking about class action lawsuits . Millions of people are told the same thing and many go on to buy new routers . I do not believe that is the problem . And my situation improved ( but did not get solved ) when I cloned the computer mac address rather than using the mac address of the router - something none of your support people bother to tell people and few know about . <p> My trust of your support is zero . Do a little searching and you will find these problems are not rare - and I find it hard to believe that routers somehow magically all break in this way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am old and no longer cooperative - I will get to the bottom of this eventually - with or without your help . And the more it costs me in time , the more likely that your lawyers will eventually have to deal with this . <p> How about checking to see what device(s) your network thinks are accessing the internet from my account ? And then telling me how the access is renewed - how often , at what times , and what mac address it expects and what happens if it finds a different address ? <p> Yes , I originally had Mediacom home networking . The wireless router never worked well , so I installed my own router . For awhile , your network thought there were 2 wireless routers connected and when i got the new modem installed ( because the old one was no good ) , they discovered that and changed the network settings . Supposedly , the network now knows that I have a Mediacom modem ( with no wireless capability ) and my own wireless router . I say " supposedly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new Mediacom modem , my own router , etc . I have no way of knowing exactly what your network believes is connected nor whether my account has been set up correctly . <p> I did that at one point , but will try again . Can you please verify a few things for me1 . Has my modem been continuously connected over the past 4 days ? 2 . What MAC address does the configuration show for me - can you tell if it is my computer 's MAC address or something else ( I think it was the installer 's laptop that was used when the new modem was initially connected , but I am using my desktop computer now ) ?

Yet , I find us getting dangerously close to these 250 caps . So to me , 250gb is nothing . It might be a lot for elderly people but why do I feel like that little kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game powered by quarters only to get on , enjoy the quick ride and it quits because time has ran out ? <p> We already changed cellular providers after they did this same crap saying it to protect their network , infrastructure , backbone , NOC , ect yet are always upgrading , always offering more speed ? <p> Just drop it - it gets you nowhere . Bandwidth is cheap and if you want to control the 3% you are talking about , you have other means.Century link will not introduce caps as they have no cable tv to protect . They will walk in and take all the business.I am waiting for their 40 Mbps to arrive .... ( and have 100mbps with you ) ..... and will still switch despite the fact that I am at 10% usage at the end of my billing cycle . <p> Let 's say you want to water your garden but do n't have a hose , so you barrow one from your neighbor .

He asks since you are using it would you mind chipping in by renting it from him for each day you use it . You agree to pay $5 a day that you use it . Now keep in mind you are n't using his water , that you are getting for free from a community well , he does provide filtered water but you decided you do n't need that to water your garden . <p> You use the hose for a couple months then your neighbor says : " Well I have been tracking the amount of water you use and it 's a lot . If you signed up to use my filtered water for a small fee this would n't be a problem , but instead you are using the community well . I 'm going to allow you to pump 25 gallons of water a month through my hose without charging you any extra , but if you pump more than that through the hose each month I 'll have to charge you $1 for each extra gallon you use for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much water gets pumped through the hose he responds " Well I want to get a better hose and since you use more water from the community well and not from my filtered water I need to charge you more for it . " <p> This would n't be a problem if more neighbors had hoses , but to get your own is very costly . Your neighbor knows this and knows that since you do n't have much of a choice you will pay this price even though that water you are using comes from the community well that he does n't have to pay any extra for . <p> Less than a month into the caps and I 'm already told that I 'm over my limit . Thanks for the " free " 50 GB you 're throwing in this month , but when I signed a 2 year contract it was n't for these terms .

Speeds would , of course be limited to your subscribed tier and modem provisioning . Otherwise , I would recommend a ping and traceroute to any site in question to help identify any latency or loss in the path . <p> That is how much of our available bandwidth we are allowed to use before we are considered ' over ' --- 5.13% <p> Since mediacom likes to keep throwing out the ' 98% ' figure like it is the gospel , I figured we could focus on another polarizing number . <p> The math behind this figure is based on a Prime plan ( 15Mbps ) with the cap of 250GB/Month . That seems to be the most popular plan that mediacom offers . <p> 15 MegaBits per second is equal to 1.875 MegaBytes per second ( 1MB = 8Mb ) . At 1.875 MB per second , you would download 6.75 GigaBytes in one hour ( 1.875MB * 60 * 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ download rate of 6.75GB/hour , we would reach that cap in approximately 37.03 hours ( 250GB / 6.75 GB ) . A 30 day month is 720 total hours ( 30 * 24 ) . Our time to max out 250GB , 37.03 hours , is 5.13% of 720 hours ( 37.03 / 720 ) . <p> ........ 5.13% ........ <p> How can you sell us service and tell us that we are only entitled to use 5.13% ? <p> I do understand your frustration and I 'll be happy to have someone contact you to offer any available upgrade promotions . Could you send me a personal message with a good contact number and time you 're available ? <p> How can you sell us service and tell us that we are only entitled to use 5.13% ? <p> This is just a bit misleading . Not that I agree with the caps ( I hate ' em ) , but this is just misleading#1 : They 're offering you speeds up to x . Usually , you get close to x , but you do n't actually get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's nothing saying they ca n't put a cap on how much you can download <p> Using your own example , I should be furious that each of my VPS'es ( which I pay way less for than MC 's cable , and get WAY more bandwidth for ) only allow me 2tb/month of download . I mean , they have the capability of pushing 1g/s , so why am I so limited ? <p> The limits are rather arbitrary , but if someone like me ( an avid video viewer ) can get by on barely 250 gig a month , so can you . It 's not really that much <p> I too am quite angry about this new cap . I work from home as Technical support for Comcast , and they are just now moving away from this data cap system due to the complaints . I certainly did not sign a contract to be capped , I have fought with verizon about this same issue to keep my unlimited data from them . And to be quite honest , I do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service plan in my area is the Prime Plus . They do n't  offer any speeds greater , and I certainly wont be paying for Ultra when I cant get ultra speeds . I will be writing the BBB about this , and filing a complaint with the FCC as well . It took the BBB and FCC and the Police about 2 weeks to force verizon to switch my account back to the unlimited data . Let 's see how long it takes mediacom . <p> Hello Derrickmehaffy , I am more than happy to verify all the internet tiers that are available in your area . Please send me a personal message with your account number or phone number , and I will see if there is a package that better meets your needs . <p> These data caps are really getting to me with multiple family members using things like Amazon Prime , Steam , YouTube , NetFlix , Vudu , and other streaming/usage eating services . I ca n't take it anymore ! <p> Every month it almost seems to come close to hitting the 250gb limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if I do n't have enough things to worry about , Mediacom I hate you for doing this . I practically have to be a gestapo not allowing my family to use the internet for any streaming services for a couple days or a full week just to make sure it stays under the limit . <p> If I find something better I 'll drop you guys like a bad habit , plus with all the daily disconnects we get is not worth the price we pay . I do n't think I 'm under contract anymore , though I was thinking about going to the Prime Plus if the deal was better than what I currently pay . Just like you wanted Mediacom ! How will you fix this ? <p> We have been having some major issues with this new data cap ! First off we were told we would be grandfathered in because we signed a two year contract to for unlimited Internet , and a higher level supervisor said that it was noted on our account that we were unlimited ! Then during another phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us we were about to go over our limit ) we were told there was never such a thing as unlimited Internet and that the last person lied to us And they upgraded us to another plan and said we would n't be changed for overages because this was the true unlimited plan ! Now we are getting another nag screen saying we are near our limit again ... I think this new system is rigged or something and we are getting very tired of being lied to over and over .. Something needs to happen here we are not happy at all . We watch Netflix only in the evening and game from time to time .. But there 's no way I 'm using 350gb of data and even if we were we have been told time and time again we were UNLIMITED ! <p> We have never really pushed against the ceiling , but this month we had a computer go down . And I had to reinstall the games , software , etc . <p> I 'm 40gb away from being over the data cap after this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rationing internet usage in our house or pay extra . It just frustrates me . I 'm supposed to enjoy using the internet . Instead , it 's being a source of frustration because of this data cap . <p> And it 's going to be a problem next month too . Because we are just slowly downloading all of the games back onto our computer . <p> It also worries me for the future . I have six kids , four of whom are going to receive devices that use the internet this Christmas . <p> edited to ask and add:I also have a question . Does it cost Medicom more if I use 400gb rather than 250gb . If so , what is that cost ? This policy just seems ridiculous to me . Like other users here have expressed . If these caps continue , I will be looking to switch . <p> Of course it does n't cost them anything extra . This has and always will be nothing more than a cash grab by Mediacom . It was a calculated decision that the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cap and pay extra fees . Remember that a significant number of Mediacom victims live in areas where the only other option is Satellite . It 's already well documented that cable companies will play friendly when possible to avoid direct competition , and Mediacom already has a history of fighting Muni fiber projects LONG ... because they know they would lose . If you want to make a difference against this corporate greed , it 's pretty simple : <p> -Unsubscribe if you can , if there are no other internet options at the very least find a different TV provider , or phone for people that actually fall for those scam snail mails they constantly send customers to get them to switch . If you live in an area where there is decent uncapped competition , convince friends/neighbors to make the switch if possible. -Fight for local high speed internet service in your community. -Speak with local city leadership about the franchise agreement Mediacom has . Let them know of your dissatisfaction , express how other cable providers in adjacent areas have unlimited service ( if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get local media attention . Older people who watch local TV news/read newspapers are exactly the kind of people that Mediacom wants to drain the bank accounts of . If you start exposing them using these avenues it will get their attention . <p> Dealing with the BBB or " the police " wo n't get you too far , but there are ways to hit them where it hurts .

I had been using a temporary modem until my permanent one was received in the mail a couple of days ago . When I called to activate the new modem , the tech had some trouble and was advised to continue using the temporary modem until I got a replacement from the local office . Today when I walked into the local office to get a replacement , the agent initially said she did n't have any permanent modems to give out , and that she only had rentals .

Yeah , since I paid for a new one and I have no idea how much this one has been used , I would like a new one shipped if that 's possible . And since the one I have works fine from a technical perspective , I 'm OK if you just want to skip the fw update and have me wait for the new one .

@@40219193 @219193/ <p> Choosing a telephone system for a small business used to be a simple proposition , because there really was n't much to choose from . All phones were pretty much the same . As it has for so many aspects of our lives , digital technology has changed all that . Now , when it comes to picking a telephone system , small businesses are n't  restricted to traditional telephones and managed voice solutions has become a preferred alternative . In this blog we compare managed voice services with traditional telephones and list some of the advantages of switching to this newer technology . <p> First , let 's look at the basic differences between old-fashioned analog and digital telephone systems . Analog phones ( the traditional landline ) use standard copper wire and what are called plain old telephone service ( POTS ) phones . Compare that to the latest technology , digital phones . They are used by businesses for managed voice services . A digital PBX ( private branch exchange , a switching system that allows a large number of telephones in a business to be connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the addition of various features and capabilities that are n't  available for use with analog phones . <p> For small businesses , managed voice services offer innumerable advantages over POTS phones . Voice over Internet Protocol ( VoIP ) technology can increase the productivity of a small business by allowing its employees to seamlessly multi-task . It allows businesses to integrate software programs such as email and remote conferencing over the Internet . An employee can conduct business with a client while simultaneously using other applications , including the Internet . Using VoIP , employees can hold conversations anywhere there is an Internet connection , meaning they are n't  tied down to being at a desk in the office anymore . As an added benefit , outgoing calls display your companys number on caller I 'd , rather than an employees personal phone number . Employees can check incoming calls no matter where they are . With VoIP , the world truly is your office . <p> As you can gather from its name , managed voice services truly let you manage your calls more efficiently . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer and route calls cutting your payroll costs and increasing productivity . <p> Gone are the days of poor call sound quality . VoIP technology has evolved to provide voice clarity that is indistinguishable from traditional telephones . <p> Here are some of the other advantages to small businesses that replace analog phones with a managed voice system : <p> Saving money . Many businesses save as much as 30% when they make the switch from analog to digital . Long-distance VoIP calls are also relatively cheaper than traditional cell phone calls . <p> Added features . Because managed voice services are software application-driven , businesses can take advantage of features not available with analog phones . These include call blasting , which is also called simultaneous call forwarding . This feature will ring each line simultaneously to reduce wait times for callers . VoIP also let 's users conduct virtual meetings , share data via video conferencing and attach documents . <p> Flexibility . If you 're planning on expanding your business , you want a phone system that will grow it . With managed phone services , its simple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a web interface and either buy/lease them a phone or install a mobile app on their smartphone . <p> Versatility . An IP phone can be programmed to ring on a cellphone when an external call comes in but route to voicemail for other calls . Another feature that is popular with small businesses transcribes voicemails in emails or text messages . Users can hold a video chat on a desk phone without having to use a complex telepresence system . <p> Predictable expenses . Voice and data charges appear on one bill and are generally the same amount from month to month . Small businesses usually pay a fee based on the number of concurrent calls that can be made at the same time . <p> No new maintenance expenses . Because no new equipment is needed , there are no new costs for maintenance . <h> About Us 45223 @qwx455223 
@@40219195 @219195/ <h> Author Topic : Battery Backup for DHG535 ( Read 1989 times ) <p> Some of my family have moved into my mother 's house in northern illinois this week . While I was there checking things out I noticed that mediacom installers put in separate pieces of equipment for internet ( a cisco wireless DOCSIS 3.0 gateway ) and phone ( a Thompson/RCA DHG535-2 modem ) . <p> I was alarmed to see that the DHG535 unit was just laying there- in the midst of a living space where a child inadvertantly disconnected power thus cutting off the home from phone service . Even more alarming was my discovery that the unit lacked a backup battery ! To the best of her recollection the installer NEVER warned my 82 yo mother about the significance of keeping power to the unit What 's even more stunning is that the 535 unit has space for a battery but lacks one . I 'm stunned , first because I 'm under the impression that its a violation of of FCC regulations to provide compromised CPE and second because this is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever seen ( and that says alot seeing as I delt with the old NYNEX and Atlantic Bell ) : not only were both peices left sitting on heavy pile carpeting , there is a 50 foot coil of unconnected coax just laying under a table and the siteing of Cisco unit violates every commonly held precept about effectively locating a wireless access point . <p> When I called customer support about the battery issue the reply we got was " no backup is provided " How do install a piece of equipment that takes a battery and then NOT PROVIDE THE BATTERY ! What kind s retarded corporate policy is that ? CS would n't even tell me if I could procure my own battery . This is insane . I just want to know if this is really the case for mediacom when dealing with the customer : no battery , you 're on your own when the power goes out ... just pray that it 's not an electrical fire that causes it . <p> These batteries have been known to cause conflicts with service , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of electrical power , despite the modem maintaining a powered connection , service will be lost if power is also disabled at the node outside- as it usually is . When service restored , the modem often has difficulty reacquiring connection without a power cycle , as it continues to think a connection was present all along . The absence of the battery ensures that the modem will return in the event of a power loss- which will take down signal anyway . <p> With this being said , it is still apparent that the install was done poorly . Wires should have been trimmed , and a dedicated , easily accessible but out-of-the-way place should have been found for the equipment . If you 'd like , please PM me the account number or phone number and I can pull things up and see about setting up an appointment for an install follow-up to get this done properly . <p> I will PM but , for the record , the scenario you describe does n't cover 50% of likehoods . Off the top of my head I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riser of an apartment or condo building ( as happened to me in 1/99- entire buss unit blew up cutting power to all the units in the building AND the cell tower ) , ( 2 ) electricity lost due to downed last-mile powerline in a semi-rural area with poor cell service ( hurricane Irene last fall in RI ) and ( 3 ) a 911 emergency that is preceeded by the inadvertant disconnection of power ( take your pick as to why : manually unplugged , local outlet breaker is tripped . I could come up with a million reasons but the most important is the one I ca n't conceive of- that 's the credo of sound engineering <p> As I understand this , the service problem boils down to the 353 CPE needing a manual reset from the customer and the beancounters and rear echelon techs did n't like getting hammered with complaints and inquiries and service calls after a major power disruption . So we are put in jeapordy because they did n't like reaping the rewards of failing to properly educate the consumenr or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People reading this : get up , find a pen &amp; paper and let 's harrass the management of Mediacom into doing the right thing : put batteries back in where the designers planned , provide external backup or get some better equipment . <p> Another reasons the batteries are n't in the modems ( any new model I see go out does not even have a battery slot anymore ) is sometimes there are conflicts with software updates . When they are sent out late at night , 2-3 am or so , sometimes the modem would n't reset and take the update properly because the battery was n't allowing it to fully reset . Also , there are many many power supplies throughout most hybrid-fiber coax systems to power up minibridgers/line extenders , so power outages more than times affect more than just 1 house and hit an entire block . The lack of battery was to make things simpler for elderly users who may not easily understand how to reboot/unplug a modem , or even what a modem was when explained to over the phone even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked up . Understandably so ! If it was just mentioned a couple times at an initial install and they never had to deal with it til a power outage 6 months to a year later , it would probably be better if the modem came back up on it 's own rather than having to wait a day or two for a tech to come out ! It would be great if the batteries did n't interfere and helped out more , but sadly they did not . <p> It did sound like the installer did n't take too much pride in his work , and that 's a sad deal . Anytime that phone is installed there is supposed to be a 911 Information paper that the customer reads/signs to show they understand that in the case of a power outage that Mediacom phone service may not work : / He may not have went over this properly with your relative , and that 's not a good deal either . <p> I feel bad that you feel shorted for not getting the battery . My mother has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have a battery slot , my modem is about 3 years old with a battery slot ) and never has trouble unless there 's a power outage . But she has all cordless phones so they would n't help much anyways !

So if I do the math I do n't come up with FREE ! <p> Our box as been reset 4 times today . And I am still unable to access On Demand so I can watch the last 20 minutes of the movie I was watching when I got ERR-4294967295 . No . Joke . Got that error twice . Also ERR-255 and ERR-7 . Our ability to access On Demand has degraded from errors mid movie to errors when I select a movie and finally our current state of being - completely unable to access On Demand at all . <p> They 're sending a tech out next Wednesday and we do n't need to be home this time . For those counting that 's a full week I need to wait for someone to possibly get our service working again properly . <p> If not for trees on our property completely blocking line of site for either available satellite service we 'd have cancelled service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TWICE had the joy of viewing a Mediacom 10 year anniversary commercial offering Digital Cable for $7.95 a month for one year .

I was warned last week not to try cancelling service then getting it back later for the cheap price - they watch out for people trying to get away with that , ya know ? ! <p> Short of contacting the FCC is there anything else we can do ? Can no one at Mediacom make this service work correctly ? ? <p> A service tech is in our house now . I am trying to remain calm . But what he has said so far is making me very angry . <p> He advises Mediacom is wasting more money than it is worth to send techs out for On Demand problems . Claims On Demand errors are a wide spread problem in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head when some equipment was replaced . The demand has been high lately because people are staying inside due to the heat . That means , he says , that when demand is peaked , people are ready in the " stream " get kicked out when someone else gets in . <p> His recommends we just quit obsessing over it . Because , of course , On Demand is free . REALLY ? <p> He also stated that if people like us do n't quit complaining Mediacom will pull On Demand from the area completely . Says it 's already been threatened . <p> I received a phone call from another tech who was on his way to our home this morning . Seems the tech that was originally scheduled by phone support did n't get cancelled when the Social Media team was able to get an earlier appointment for us ? <p> During my phone conversation with the tech this morning I told him what had happened last night . He asked if our box had been switched out ? I told him it has been several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even offer us a different box . He said he 'd like to come on out and see if there is anything more/different he can do .

Good thing I work from home temporarily . <p> Frankly , we 're *this* close to canceling our service with Mediacom completely . We can watch most of our favorite shows online or on NetFlix these days . <p> A very new tech - said it was only his third day doing calls on his own . He checked all signals and declared them all right were they ought to be , checked all connections inside the house and installed a new box . <p> When we tested On Demand we got an Error 7 again . He called someone ( supervisor ? ) who stated error 7 was because of a bad connection somewhere or because we were running the cable through a vcr . He again checked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tv and the cable is not running through a vcr ( I do n't think we even own one anymore - but it 's not running through our blu-ray player either ) . He verified the drop is new . He then went over all the connections throughout the house again . <p> Finally he asked me if anyone had been up on a ladder at the pole in our back yard . I replied that to my knowledge , no , no one had been up there to check anything . So he got his ladder and went up . He thought he found something and called his supervisor ( ? co-worker ? ) again . <p> He 's not 100% certain this is the problem but thinks it 's likely . He stated we have reverse tilt - something about each channel is supposed to go up 2 points but ours is going down ? I 'm not a techie but that 's what I got from the explanation he tried to keep simple for me . <p> He stated he is not permitted to repair this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to put in a maintenance request today but thought it would be a couple weeks before anyone who show up to fix the issue . <p> I find it interesting we 've had tech , after tech , after tech , after tech out here and it 's the " new kid " who finds a problem . Several , like the guy last night , showed up and did n't do a thing but LOOK at our equipment and offer excuses . <p> Can the Social Media Relations Team speak to whether this could truly be the problem and can you do anything to speed up the Maintenance request ? <p> Logged <h> MediacomCarson <p> I actually got with an area supervisor this morning on this . He said he was going to get another technician out today and work with them over the phone ( I am amusing this is why that tech was calling a supervisor so often . ) Maintenance orders can only be put in and approved by local supervisors so it sounds like this finally got to the right people .

Am getting Ref code : S0a00 . <p> I have called and done the automated reset and talked with a phone support person , Megan . She stated there is no outage reported in our area and further stated there has been NO MAINTENANCE TICKET put in for our On Demand problem ! ! ! <p> Megan said she is escalating our On Demand problem . ( I 'd be rich if I had a dime for every time I 've been told THAT ! ) She also gave us HBO free for 30 days .

Fantastic . <p> As of last Thursday we 've been told by both Dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either company unless we cut down two huge trees and a neighbor cuts down an even bigger third tree . So we are well and truly stuck with Mediacom . <p> Can someone please check on our current outage , the maintenance ticket that was supposed to have been put in a week ago AND give us some sort of credit on our account for this constant lack of service and hassle ? What we really want is the services to work correctly . We really are n't that interested in free HBO or other channels . What we really feel entitled to is a free MONTH ( or more ! ) for all of the problems , time spent waiting on techs to show up , etc . <p> Mediacom has simply failed to deliver . There should be some financial penalty on Mediacom , NOT the customer , for that failure ! <h> MediacomCarson <p> From what I understand there is still maintenance for VOD in that area . I am trying to get a hold of the local supervisor as we speak . When I hear something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you it was not our intention to have this issue go on longer than it has . We have to go by what we are told by the area techs/supervisors . I hope to have something for you today . <p> I 'm confused , I think . Is there a complete outage in the area ? Or just VOD ? We still ca n't get any channels at all . Still getting the " One Moment Please . This Channel Should Be Available Shortly . Ref code S0a00 " error on every single channel . <h> MediacomCarson <p> I got a hold of the local supervisor . The area issue is only affecting VOD . It has been reported and they 're working on getting that fixed as quickly as possible although I do not have an ETA . The channels being out sounds like a completely different issue .

@@40219201 @219201/ <p> Our household has had issues with spotty internet connection since we moved in ( 7-8 months ago ) . At its worst , we get multiple disconnects per minute ( I monitor this with ping www.google.com -t on a command prompt ) , and on most days this goes on for hours . The issues seem to occur primarily during daylight hours , and are either less prevalent or nonexistent at night . I have attached an image of the modem 's status page and log from roughly an hour and a half after a reboot during midday . Already , there are hundreds of thousands of uncorrectables across all channels after only being online for an hour and a half . The uncorrectables seem to build up every time there is a drop in connection .

Three different modems have been used , all with the same issues ( one provided by Mediacom , one a self-bought Arris , and one a self-bought Zoom ) . The issue occurs whether one uses wifi , is hard wired to the router ( after the modem ) , or is hard wired to the modem and the only system online at all .

I have purchased a two-way coax splitter as well as coax connection terminators to try and remedy this , but the 9-way splitter is using a grounding wire and I do not wish to make the change myself so as to avoid damage to the system . <p> It may be relevant that we live very close to a WalMart Supercenter . I have to wonder if we are not on the same line as them , and due to the store 's high traffic during the day , they could potentially consume a lot of the bandwidth on the line during daylight hours .

Looking at your modem signal history , I am seeing fluctuation with the Upstream CER , CCER and SNR levels through out the past week . This is probably the main cause of the intermittent issues you mentioned . The signals on the card look fine and as such I would rule out a street/area issue .

This particular tech has been sent out before ( multiple times if I remember correctly , but it was at least 4 months ago ) , and he remembered our issues . I showed him the coax switch and he said it was in good condition and a new model , so was likely not an issue .

This is why I am leaving Mediacom in the first place because they wanted me to be home to repair my cable after they cut it digging in my yard to hook-up a neighbor . Of course I was never told Mediacom was going to dig in my yard I did not have to be there for that . I will not be home tomorrow either so we will see what happens ! I do not have a cable box to turn in so there is no reason for me to be there .

I also have several remote server connections configured with my public IP . I know that Mediacom does not offer static IP addresses to residential customers . So my question is regarding the life cycle of my IP lease . I lived in a different town until the last couple months and my IP only changed twice in three years with Mediacom . However , since my move I have had five different IP addresses . Actually the four times it has changed have been in the past two weeks . I 've been having some issues with my connection speed and have had to recycle the power on my modem several times . ( I have a ticket in for that . ) But it seems like every few times I recycle it changes . As a result I have spend a significant amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my IP ? What are the conditions of re-lease ? If my modem is working correctly and I do not have to recycle the power , how often will my IP change ? <p> Unfortunately , I do not have an exact time frame for IP lease tables . Generally , resets of the modem- unless it 's a full clear of its registry- wo n't change the IP assignment . However , since there has been some trouble , this might be causing trouble with the DHCP assignments too . While IPs are n't statically assigned , I 've seen DHCP addresses apply for a year plus . <p> Yes , absolutely . The modem can be replaced for another at the front counter . Once the new one is home and hooked up , it can be registered using your 16-digit account number and activation code ( last 9 of the account number ) .

While I am unable to provide services at the same introductory rate that Directv is providing at this time , we may be able to provide a faster more consistent product .

Pixelating on one TV usually indicates a signal issue . I would recommend making sure all connections at the outlet and the cable box are securely fastened . If so , then we would need to schedule a tech visit to check the outlet . -Tommy <p> Yes I have gone through all the connections , taking them off , reattaching them even all the way down to the basement connections . No change . Now I notice the pixalating ' creeping ' into other channels . Its getting worse . <p> I already have an appointment scheduled but the first one available is July 31st . That 's three weeks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of my cable viewing available for three weeks . <p> The turn around for service/tech calls use to be one or two days . What has happened ? I can probably answer that ..... people did not heed the final analog to digital conversion deadlines and now Mediacom has to scramble to handle all the influx of service calls . <p> What should be happening is that digital/analog service calls be placed in one ' bucket ' and others put in another bucket . Customers ( 28 year customers with Mediacom - me ) should not have to wait three weeks for service call . <p> Well I fixed my issue of ' pixelations ' , ' One Moment Please " and half the stations not working . Maybe my solution will help some of you . If it is happening on one television it is much easier to correct . So we assume the HD box and related equipment are working . So the problem has to be in the signal quality as mentioned above . <p> Checking connections at the TV/box did not help so down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad channel with issues and then literally started **26;2147;TOOLONG each cable . Starting at the primary splitter ( IN plus out for TV and Internet ) . No change . Then I found tucked up on one of the basement rafters was an eight way splitter . The key here is finding out what Out cable controls the affected TV . Trial and error , calling up to my son for status we finally found the correct one . There was one open coaxial port on the splitter , moved the affected TV cable to that connection and instantly everything worked . So two weeks of no cable all because of one bad connection down in the basement . It took a dozen trial and error attempts and dis/reconnecting and of course the last one checked was the bad connection . Taped over the bad one so as not to use it again . <p> Mediacom : please cancel my tech appointment for the 20th . <p> Also Mediacom , I assume that the three week wait times for onsight tech support is because of the analog to digital conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital is and they just ignored the warnings/information . But whatever the case , some better form of onsight tech support has to be created . I as a 28 year customer should not have to wait three weeks for service . If people are having issues because of the analog/digital conversion , there should be a ' hotshot ' tech team that does nothing but work on these issues . In and out quickly . And it should not be first in , first out to receive service . If a Mediacom tech is working down the street from me , why ca n't he/she divert from the schedule and try and service my problem since he is right down the road instead of possibly driving 20 miles to the next appointment . Just some suggestions .

I 'm on a very limited income and ca n't afford much more than the channel if that 's possible.Thanks for replying .. <p> To be honest , i 'm surprised it has n't happened . A year or two ago , in order to grow ESPNU , ESPN gave the okay for cable &amp; satellite providers to swap ESPN Classic for ESPNU . I see that Mediacom has moved ESPN Classic to digital , but has n't replaced Classic with ESPNU in the basic packages . The changed happened on DirecTV a long time ago .

I received one bill in error saying I owed $138 for a week of service , had to call to get that figured out . Now the bill I just got is for $232 . What is with the 2 months billing cycle , is that just to confuse discrepancies with our monthly bill ? I called to talk to a snippy customer service rep for her to explain it to me and that was useless . From the very beginning , just setting up service has been a nightmare . Not to mention the problems with internet , numerous calls to customer service , 2 different repair guys telling me I needed to do this or that or that I had to buy a new router . Spent over $100 on a new router and still the wifi keeps dropping from my other computer . Now I 'm told I need to buy a booster , my house is not big ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the signal . Another call into cust service and they wo n't even send anyone out because from their screen it says its working . My neighbor works for you guys and looked at it , he said my modem needs swapped out and that he 'd do it . Well he has n't and I cant get an appt through calling you guys to have it done . Now this bill ..... I seriously do n't think this is going to work out . I have a previous balance of $48 , then a payment of $65 . The previous balance was because originally I was just going to do internet but ended up adding cable to it 4 days later . So am I being billed $48 for a month of internet service PLUS the cost of my package when I only had internet alone for 4 days ? This DIG STARZ charge of $1.96 , what is that ? Thought STARZ was free . Family Video ? What is that charge ? I was told one add on channel pack was included free and I chose the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees and surcharges the first line is Total Fees $6 followed by 8 more lines of additional specified fee 's and taxes , what is the $6 ' Total Fees ' charge exactly ? Its not even total fee 's because there are more . I was told my package was going to be $118 a month , this is not $118 . Oh and I have asked several times why I was not given the special ditch the dish pricing that I 've gotten 4 times in my mailbox of $89 , no one can answer that for me either and it includes the same services I have and we did break contract with Dish to switch to you.So it this bill showing I owe for 2 months of service intentionally done that way so that by the time my next bill comes and it too is messed up and higher than it should be , I will be close to my 90 days to cancel and have to stick to my contract ? So many problems and its only been ONE month ! ! I did n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thanks for posting to the Mediacom forums ! We 'll be happy to help go over your bill and ease some of the confusion here . First , on the billing side I see your services were connected on 3/21 . There was an issue with the initial installation order so all of the services had to be removed and then added back again . This generated a disconnection as well as the first bill you received with the $187.68 balance . That balance included an installation charge ( $44.99 ) and unreturned equipment . This particular bill should have been sent though with the install but not the unreturned equipment . After taxes , the bill should have been $48.68 . You paid $65.22 which left a $16.54 credit balance . <p> On April 11 , a new bill was generated . This was for services from 03/21 - 05/20 which is a 2 month bill . The credit balance from the previous month is on this statement as well . Mediacom normally collects the first month of service up front so your 1st bill is not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case . None the less , you have not been over bill because this will cover services for 2 months . <p> The charges you are seeing under " Monthly Charges " are a breakdown of the different services included in your bundle . Future statements , assuming no changes are made , will be $122.72/month + tax . This price includes $10.50 for your additional non-TiVo HD box , $5 for the internet modem rental and $5 for the phone modem rental . The Total Fees is a local franchise fee . <p> On the internet connection side of things , there are many factors that go into the signal strength that is received by each computer . Unfortunately some of those are outside of Mediacom 's control . Do you have any issues with the connection with a PC is connected directly to the modem ? If one computer is receiving a good wireless signal , there could be a lot of signal loss just where the other computer is being used . We could try moving the modem to another location to help . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need further clarification ! <p> I was told instillation would be $75 , but we did a soft credit check and were given $40 off of the instillation fee . That leaves $35 for the instillation fee , where does the $48 ? come in ? Why charges for 2 modems when I only have one ? You did n't say anything about why I was not given the $89 special for being a satellite customer . Funny , the people I get on the phone never have an answer for that either . The first guy I talked to about the wifi issue said that the mediacom provided wireless is not very good and to go with my own router . He left , I tried my own and it did n't get better . The next guy to come out checked everything and said I needed a new router , mine was not working properly and left . I went and bought a new one and still it is not working right . My neighbor ( who works for you guys doing repairs ) came and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the distance between the computer and router . He thought we should change modems and said that he 'd grab one from work and do it but has n't . I 've called to try to get a service call scheduled and they wo n't set it up . So my services are not working properly and you do n't  care is what I 'm getting from this.Please DO tell me WHY I am not given the $89 special again , I am curious to know the answer to that . <p> Since this does relate to billing and it seems you 've got a few questions on the matter I would like to reach out to you and give you a call to go over everything . It might be a bit simpler and easier to get this taken care of over the phone . Could you send me a private message with a good contact number and time to reach you ?

I have been experiencing a lot of issues with my Scientific Atlanta modem ( as in it locks up and I had to unplug the power and reboot the modem 4-8 times per day to get back online ) . I called support on Tuesday , and they shipped me out a new modem . Well , yesterday , I received a new Cisco DCP3925 , and it is simply fantastic . <p> However , in the box was a piece of paper explaining some Additional Terms and Conditions - Monthly Usage Allowance which were apparently effective on August 1st , 2012 .

But I do n't read through every single page of my bill each month , as they are delivered digitally . Plus , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my payment online accordingly . Most months , I do n't even bother opening the bill itself , I just make the payment online . <p> That being said , I am honestly disturbed by Mediacom 's lack of disclosure on our account pages . It would be prudent , in the event of drastically changing a customer 's user agreement and placing a limit on their plan , to maybe have a pop up window when they access their My Account page , or maybe when they are paying their bill . It would be smart to have it displayed more prominently for existing customers , because I know I for one do n't go looking at the offerings on their main site ( as those prices are for new customers only ) . <p> Above everything else , though , is the fact that from the My Account page , I can not actually see a METER of what I have consumed for this month . Sure , I can see my phone usage details , but I can not see in a graph or chart depicting what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit actually is . How can Mediacom expect customers to track where they are for the month if they do n't provide us with tools on their website ? ? ! ! This is honeslty the most upset I have been with Mediacom in 7 years of service . The fact that they changed existing customers without more notification is disturbing enough , but that after making the change , they did n't place a clear and easy to understand graph on our billing page to show us our usage is appauling . <p> Up until now , I was perfectly happy with my Mediacom Internet service . But after finding all this out in the last two days , I do n't think I can continue to support this company . Verizon Wireless did this same type of thing , changing all their plans to have limited data .

If you connected internet service before August 1st , 2012 , you are grandfathered in to the old acceptable use policy that did not included usage based billing . If you made a change to your internet service after that point , you would be placed under the new data allowance policy and the representative that made that change should have explained it to you .

Also , you say that if I have n't changed anything about my plan since August 1st , 2012 , which I have n't , I should be grandfathered into my unlimited data plan . But when I look at this meter on my Mediacom Today page , it shows I have a 250 GB limit . When I look at my bill , it just says Mediacom Online , not Launch , Prime , or Ultra . So is this just a limitation of the meter ? Will it always show 250 GB limit for the people that really do n't have a limit on their accounts ? Thank you for the clarifications ! <p> I 'm curious about this as well because I just received a notification about my usage since I often stream Netflix and I was under the assumption that I was under a grandfathered plan .

@@40219225 @219225/ <p> Like other service providers , Mediacom has gigabit aspirations , but unlike some , such as AT&amp;T and Google Fiber , it wants to enable the faster speeds to almost all of its business and residential customers . <p> Mediacom Communications Corp . has a large and varied footprint . In all , it serves 22 states , primarily in the Midwest and the South as well as parts of California and Arizona . In March , Mediacom announced Project Gigabit , a three-year , $1 billion project aimed at bringing 1 gigabit per second service to " virtually all " of the 3 million homes and businesses it serves . <p> Telco Transformation had the opportunity to get an update from the operator 's Dan Templin , who is senior vice president of Mediacom Business Solutions ( MBS ) ; president of Mediacom 's CLEC holdings ; and senior vice president of OnMedia , Mediacom 's media sales division . Here is a lightly edited transcript of our chat with Templin . <p> Telco Transformation : Please describe the business side of the company . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve predominately outside the top 75 DMAs . We leap over the midsize and the down-market enterprise into very large concerns . We serve key verticals that really are prevalent in every market . They include healthcare , educational , municipal and finance . <p> For example we are the provider for the vast majority , if not all , of every major university and college in Illinois , Iowa and Missouri . The same with rural healthcare . We serve all the major hospital groups in our core states because while they are rural and have unique challenges they also have the same needs as other hospital such as very large broadband connections . They need more sophisticated connectivity than the LECs have historically provided . In our area those are CenturyLink and Windstream , with a little Verizon and a little AT&amp;T . <p> TT : The mix sounds challenging . <p> DT : It certainly is a challenge to not have the dense areas as a Chicago , a New York or a Houston . There also are some unique opportunities . We really have had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That has led us to strategically build and extend our network on a carrier-level and enterprise-level basis . We can serve down market and do it very very well but we also are trying to reach carrier wholesale and national . So we built it to an enterprise-class level . <p> At the same time , we service down to a small client level . We provide same mindset to them . For instance , we provide SLAs on performance down to the very smallest modem-delivered customers we serve . <p> TT : MBS is working through a $1 billion investment . Can you describe some of what you are doing ? <p> DT : The investmentis consistent with the approach I mention on the network and how we built it . We did n't approach it from a cable TV core . It was addressed from an ISP core . We deliver DOCSIS 3.0 effectively to over 99% of our footprint with a commitment to move to 3.1 over the next two years . We 'll be able to offer very easily a 1 Gig symmetrical product with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a big portion of this new investment and it will have benefits to the business space perhaps more so than the consumer side . <p> The other benefit is Project Open Road , which is a very aggressive buildout to put more businesses on-net . Historically we run Mediacom Business , particularly when it comes to construction , on a per success-based model . While that had benefits , we wanted to increase the pace . When we have opportunities against competitors we win very very often . Part of the billion dollar investment beyond 3.1 is to put businesses on-net . That removes the barrier of time and expense of construction that to some degree has been a hurdle . <p> On the fiber side , since early 2011 we started in earnest with cell backhaul . It started with cell backhaul projects for the big four plus U.S. Cellular -- which is a TDS company that is big in the Midwest . We serve the vast majority of macro sites they have , particular in Iowa , Missouri and Illinois . That was a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In doing so we moved to a much more robust PON network . We were doing GPON , now we are doing EPON . It also had us making investments on the core and backbone -- in capacity and circuitry -- and in design . Providing services to the largest telecom companies in the world led us to really step our game up in terms of design , ring architectures and our metro Ethernet capabilities . Now we offer fully redundant self-healing networks . <p> It really has been transformational for the company from a technology standpoint and certainly from a revenue standpoint . It has helped us improve our game from an engineering perspective . <p> TT : How are you transitioning your core network ? <p> DT : We consolidated to two main headend locations and of course a number of CMTSs . We are pushing both CMTSs and the ring architecture deeper into the network so there are many fewer active customers and active locations on a given ring . On the original network a single cut could take dozens if not hundreds of locations out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five or less towers on any failure group . They are effectively ringed on their own . <p> TT : Are you moving to software-defined networks ( SDN ) ? <p> DT : We have not moved on NFV so far . On SDN side we are in the labs right now with a couple of different providers . For us it 's just a matter of making the architecture easier to provision , support and monitor . It is one of the challenges of our geography . We have a lot of area to cover . It is very difficult to handle the demand with a traditional model . The SDN rationale for us is fairly simplistic -- turning up and provisioning on an automated basis is really attractive . <p> We know we have to get there . We are in a bit of bakeoff between three providers . Each of them already has a place on our network , so it 's more about who will be the first among equals . Once we figure that out we will deploy it . Our SDN deployment probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see a significant deployment . <p> TT : Where will you deploy ? <p> DT : We 're looking at eastern Iowa as the area where we would first test it out . The key markets there are Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities area because it is almost a concentration of midsize cities . SDN has particular benefits in those locations . <p> TT : How about network functions virtualization ( NFV ) ? <p> DT : I think so . NFV will be driven by the corporate engineering group more so than business services . It 's not a customer-facing issue . SDN is because of touch points . I know it is on CTO JR Walden 's radar screen . I ca n't tell you how close he is to pulling trigger on it . <p> DT : We were still working off spreadsheets for orders . As we get more successful we can in some cases get a 200- or 300-location national order . We were doing do it on spreadsheets . <p> It was a more than million dollar investment just in that platform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplifies complex orders across different states and different areas , which means across different operating groups for us . It is part of our evolution from a local cable operator a regional and in some cases national broadband company . <p> We also are upgrading our billing system and other automation . We are deploying automatic ASR access service requests processes , which is new . We must serve the AT&amp;Ts , the Comcasts and others with multiple orders where they have national accounts for which we provide locations within our footprint . It has to be a seamless process for them so that it is seamless for their end users . We went to client portals and also are developing quotation engines so prices can be loaded into their quotation system to help national account bidding . <p> TT : So the company has created niche serving the big guys in your neighborhood , so to speak . <p> DT : We are probably more like a US Signal or Zayo a regional broadband provider -- than a Comcast in Philadelphia or Charter in New York . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts . It is not expected that Mediacom is going to secure , for instance , The Home Depot national account relationship . We just do n't serve enough of their locations . But we are the absolute best choice for their locations in our footprint . We just have to be positioned to be an enterprise or national account caliber provider , effectively a subcontractor supporting AT&amp;T , Comcast or Charter when they secure those orders nationally . <p> It has n't been easy or and has not been without an awful lot of effort across the entire organization . It goes hand in hand with technology changes . It is easier to build a network than operate it or manage it . We are doing both in tandem as quickly and as well as we can . <h> About Us 45223 @qwx455223

Let us know if you have any further questions about this and we will be happy to help . <p> Thanks for the reply . Can you tell me the model modem Mediacom sells ? As you most likely are aware I can purchase one for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same model and I had future issues Mediacom could diagnose online . Does that make any sense ? As an aside , for your information , the same day I asked the question on the forum I received the following E-mail , obviously a fraud ; Dear Mediacom Customer , <p> We are upgrading the Mediacom and our services . As the primary contact , you must renew yourMediacom enrollment as soon as possible or it will be canceled and your account will be limited.Sign-in using the link below so we can renew your membership . Please save this e-mail for your records . <p> Thank you for making us aware of that email . Can you go ahead and forward this to abuse@mediacomcc.com so our fraud and abuse team can look into this ? In regards to the purchased modem , we can not guarantee the exact make and model , as you will be shipped whatever is available in our warehouse at the time of purchase . The main added benefit to using one of our rental modems or purchased modems with our wireless Home Networking , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a third-party router where we are only able to offer general trouble shooting steps , since we can not access the equipment . Even with purchased modems , we are still able to see all of the same and live and historical signal data and provisioning codes . Let me know if that helps or if you have any further questions about this ! <p> Thank you . I sent the fake E-mail as suggested . Just so I do n't clog the forum up with another thread one last question . If I purchase a new modem locally . What is the best procedure when connecting it ? IE. Call Mediacom first or connect the Modem and call Mediacom at that time ? Any other suggestions ? <p> Thanks for getting that reported to our abuse team , JackB ! To activate a modem , it must be online to receive the provisioning , so you will need to set up the modem and let all the lights go solid before activating . You can connect your computer directly to the modem when it comes online and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll want to use the 16-digit account number and the nine-digit activation code ( this is just the last nine digits of your account number ) , and once entered , the m , ode will reset and download the provisioning file . You can also call in to 866-452-4747 , if you prefer and an agent can get it activated for you with the MAC i 'd . You can also PM your MAC i 'd to the active moderator here in the forums when you 're ready to activate , and we can send the provisioning for you . When you 're ready , just let us know which activation method is best for you .

@@40219236 @219236/ <h> Author Topic : data usage ( Read 3399 times ) <p> Hello I am needing help to figure something out . I have noticed that I have been using more data than normal so I decided to test out why . Last night I shut off all my devices except my desktop computer around midnight when I went to bed . Now at 22:24 pm my data usage was at 184.6GB I knew it would go up from that time because there was still a hour and a half that had n't been reported yet . When I first checked it this morning it was at 186.8GB at 01:15am then the next time I checked it , it jumped to 189.4GB at 2:12am ( as of 10:44am today ) . My question its how can my usage jump 2.6GB within less than an hour when everybody in my house was asleep and no devices other than my desktop was connected and was in sleep/lock mode ? I would really appreciate any help figuring this out since I ca n't understand this . Thanks . <p> also here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total of 679.7 GB for the billing period of June 29-July 28th . Last month my kids were using the roku nonstop all day long plus I had the desktop , laptop , tablet plus about 8 or 9 phones connected . A couple of the phones are the kids and they play on the web watch youtube , netflix etc. etc . I also have a neotv that we watch netflix or hulu plus a blu ray that connects to netflix . Nothing has changed concerning how we use the internet , nobody else has my password plus I normally check to see how many devices are connected so I can see if there is anybody that has cracked my security . So on average I used about 22.66 GB on a daily basis . But now in the this month it 's showing on average I 'm using 27.05GB which is what I do n't understand since our usage has n't changed plus for the last 2-3 days I have been limiting how much time the kids can watch the roku etc. but it does n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please help thanks . <p> I 'm unable to break down usage by specific times , unfortunately , and I am not able to identify what program or device is actively contributing to total numbers . I do know that total usage comprises uploaded and downloaded data , so it is possible that something may have been uploading to a server , etc . Since most of the devices were off and other were asleep , then it 's possible that the increase may be due to the meter delay : <p> " As of 8/4/2014 07:20 Actual usage shown is not real-time and may be delayed up to 24 hours " <p> Though the meter numbers update regularly throughout the day , this may not always factor in data usage on an up-to-the-minute basis , so some may as of yet be unreported . For example , if all devices were off and usage still increased by 2.6GB during that time , then that may be previously unreported data from within the last 24 hours updating to the meter . <p> ok I can understand the delay factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from using 679 GB one month and then to using almost a third of that within a week into the new month when as I have stated I have started limiting access to the roku etc . I have n't changed the way I use the internet at all since last month except for the limiting time online for the kids . Normally you would think if somebody is spending less time using data that the usage would go down not up . Since I 'm a stay at home mom I 'm almost always here and can almost always know what devices are online and if they are using youtube etc . I will just have to monitor it more and see if I can figure it out . I will have to do another test tonight and see what happens . <p> also if it can be delayed by 24 hours that would mean that I could possibly be getting data metered from the last day of the month onto this month and so on which I do n't consider that to be right .

So an a 31 day billing period that could run up to 77.5 GB of data ( might not seem like much but that is data I would rather use than just have my computer updating useless stuff constantly ) . So what I did was I turned off updates on my tiles , turned off syncing and a couple other things and that should help save on some of my data .

I understand about how it 's measured etc. but I still have n't figured out what 's going on with my connection using so much data . I changed my SSID and password for my router , have n't allowed any of the kids to use the roku , my daughter has n't used her laptop at all today and has been using mobile data on her phone , I 'm also using only mobile data on my phone . I have wrote down every mac device i 'd number for every device in the house so I can check to see if they match up to what 's listed on my router .

If the data is being measured by date ( meaning what I use today is what I use today not what I used yesterday ) I would really like to know what exactly I have used today so I can check it against my own data and see what 's going on . Especially since at about 11:50 last night I unplugged both my router and modem and did n't plug them back in until 6:00am this morning to make sure that nobody was using any data overnight . Thanks for any and all help you can give me in figuring this out . <p> At the bottom of the usage meter there should be a statement with the last time the meter was " updated " . This is normally updated multiple times throughout the day however it could be up to 24 hours behind .

Note that recent usage may not be included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage aggregation and reporting . <p> Looking over your modem 's connection history for the past 24 hours I do show you have used quite a bit of data . I do show the period of time the modem was offline and this must have been the time you had it unplugged . Other than this , the modem 's bandwidth has been sitting around 3,100 Kbps - 5029 Kbps . This means , your bandwidth is being consistently used . We do n't track usage in detail so we could n't tell exactly what 's using the data however this could be from online backup programs , downloading files/game updates or browsing the internet on multiple devices . <p> At this time we do n't have a program that will track usage ( In GB/MB ) " live " .

Even with this greedy data limit scheme I have been ok with not going over for most of the year . However , with no changes on my routine internet usage somehow now my data usage has skyrocketed and I am getting several overage charges for the past 2 months .... nothing has changed here at home . Never went over in the several months past . What is different now ? Has my Data limit been lowered without my knowledge ? <p> Logged 45222 @qwx455222 <p> Hello Juntao and thank you for contacting us here about this issue . There area alot of factors that can go into a spike in usage during a giving billing cycle . Downloading updates to equipment , gaming , streaming , as well as quite a few other things can cause your data usage to go up . I see that you are currently subscribed to our wireless service . With this , you are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just double checked your wireless settings , and I am not seeing that you have any SSID or password set up with our service . Are you using this service or your own Personal Wireless router ? <p> We 're unable to determine what 's exactly causing this high usage as we do n't track usage in detail due to privacy . If you 're sure no one is connected to your wireless network then a device on your network is causing this . If you have any further questions or concerns please let us know . <p> I noticed my last post lacked a little bit of information and I wanted to clarify some additional causes to higher than normal usage periods . If you 're consistently streaming HD content or streaming from multiple devices your usage could increase drastically . The average HD movie ( Running 2 hours ) is around 3 GB . Another cause could be a virus on one , or all of your computers as most virus 's can spread throughout a network once infecting a computer . It would be best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of your connected devices . We do offer a free anti virus and I 've included a link below that will provide additional information and instructions on how to install this program . If you need further clarification or have any follow up questions please feel free to let us know . <p> I 've noticed this on my usage as well . Have several months where I use roughly 730 to 750 GB ... And that 's with heavy traffic . Still have almost 250 GB to work with every month . But there are months that are not different than any others where I get right at my 999 GB limit and have to ration usage throughout the house . Have no idea what happens . And I keep track of all usage through my secure router . The router says I only used in the 700 range , but the usage meter will say higher . <p> I would expect this out of cell phone service but not on home internet . Never have I had to worry about how much or how often I use my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than infuriating . Now the smart consumer would seek service elsewhere . I certainly would love to be rid of Mediacom . But it seems all the isolated rural areas such as mine Mediacom is the ONLY high speed internet service available I am yet again stuck with my hands tied . Your continued poor service can thrive while continuing to be poor knowing that the majority of your customers do not have any other choice . The addition to these data usage caps shows nothing but pure and absolute greed . As if it was n't bad enough already , now these data caps are just another throb added to the headache that is Mediacom . Please feel free to forward this around to know that thanks to the high speed internet monopoly you people have here in Ridgecrest , California , we , your customers , are bending over yet again due to lack of option . Thank you Mediacom for being not the best , not the worst , just the ONLY service we , the people of Ridgecrest are just stuck with . 45222 @qwx455222 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upload , this is why you may see a discrepancy in the totals between your router and the meter . <p> Juntao , we do understand your frustration . Only about 3% of our subscribers go over the monthly data allowance on the service level they are subscribed to , and even some of those are not aware of what is causing it . It could be a program running in the background on your computer , it could be someone that is unknowingly on your wireless service . We see the latter issue pretty frequently actually . If you feel that you are not using the amount of data that is being reported on the usage tracker , you can actually login to the Clear Access program via http : **28;2280;TOOLONG using the Mediacom email address and password you setup . Once here , you can see what devices are connected by serial number , you can even block them from accessing your network . You can change the SSID and password , among other things . <p> After you have done this , if you are still using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look into upgrading your package so that you are not charged any overages as it looks like over the past few months your usage has gradually gone up . Please feel free to let any of the Moderators here know how you would like to proceed and we will be happy to assist you however we can . 
@@40219241 @219241/ <h> Author Topic : Bill Increased Unexpectedly by $30 ( Read 2037 times ) <p> I am posting this based on online feedback garnered from several sources , including this board , which indicates that I might have better luck obtaining service for my complaint here than through traditional phone support channels . This is also for the purpose of creating a public record of my interaction with Mediacom related to this specific issue . <p> In September 2012 I contacted Mediacom to inquire about service . I wanted only internet service as Mediacom is the only HSI provider in my area offering speeds greater than 15Mbps . I relayed this information to the sales rep who took my call . He informed me at the time that I could not get just internet service but if I signed a 2 year contract that he could offer me a discounted rate for the first year on cable and internet service . I informed the rep that I did NOT want to sign any sort of agreement or bundle pricing . I only wanted internet service at one rate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own modem and did not require Mediacom equipment for the $5 monthly rental fee . He then told me that he could offer me " Ultra " cable internet service plus basic cable TV service for a rate of $75 per month ( plus tax and installation ) . I asked him to confirm that this was a permanent rate and he assured me that it was . I asked him to confirm that it was not a contract agreement . He said that it was not . I then asked him again to confirm that the $75/month rate plus tax and the one-time installation fee would be all that I would pay . He verbally confirmed this information . I accepted the offer and st my installation appointment date . <p> On 9/28/12 my Mediacom service was installed at my current residence . The installer was over 2 hours late . The installer , not an actual Mediacom employee but a subcontractor , was able to connect my service without incident although he did bring a cable modem along despite the fact that I had explicitly told the sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not leave the modem . I signed the installation work order and the installer left . I immediately called Mediacom to inform them of the late arrival and was given a $20 credit on my bill . <p> After a few months of service it became apparent that the service level promised by Mediacom was not being met . My " Ultra " speed internet service rarely , if ever , got above 25Mbps ( the speed promised was " up to 50 Mbps " ) . I also experienced several service interruptions and outages during my first few months . I contacted technical support who confirmed that my cable modem was DOCSIS 3.0 and was working properly . Several calls later a technician was scheduled to replace the cable line from the service pole to my residence . After replacement of the line my service interruptions improved however my speeds never did . I even went so far as to set up an automated test which collected data for 2 weeks at intervals of every 5 minutes . At no point did the speed peak beyond 25Mbps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " Ultra " HSI to " Prime Plus " HSI . The rep I spoke with at that time offered my more services but I flatly refused . The rep informed me that my new rate would be $50 per month . I again confirmed with the rep that this was not a contract and that the rate would stay as it was indefinitely . She again confirmed that this was the case . I thanked her for her time and the call ended . <p> This month ( September 2013 ) I checked my monthly statement as I always do . My monthly rate is now $75 per month . There was no warning , no notices printed on any prior statement , nothing at all indicating why the rate had gone up . Tonight ( 9/23 ) I contacted customer service . After some time on hold the rep informed me that 1 ) my 2 year contract had expired and 2 ) that my rate had now been raised to its regular level . I was stunned . I informed the rep that I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely been in residence for a year let alone two . The rep put me on hold again and returned a few minutes later saying that my " promotion " was only good for one year and had now expired . She went on to tell me that there were " no other current promotions available that could lower my bill . " At that point I informed her that was not acceptable and requested to speak with her supervisor . She told me that she would see if " one was available " and put me back on hold . After a brief time she returned again and asked me if I would be willing to lower my internet speed to get a lower bill . I told her that was also unacceptable as I had been told that the speed and monthly rate were permanent and that I should not have to downgrade my service for Mediacom to honor its pricing . The rep did tell me outright that she did not see any documentation in Mediacom 's system that indicated that I had been informed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would transfer me . She put me back on hold . <p> Several minutes later I was connected to an alleged supervisor whose tone of voice and initial comment , " I understand that YOU have a problem ? " did nothing to gain my trust that she was remotely interested in actually reaching a resolution . I told her that the problem was not mine , but Mediacom 's as its representative had , on two separate occassions , told me that my rate was permanent and that nowhere in any written form in my possession was the package that I was paying for labeled or marked as a " promotion " , " contract " , or " agreement . " The " supervisor " then informed me that I would have to speak with " another department " who could possibly adjust my bill . When I asked which department she told me that it was the " retention department " but they were not accepting phone calls at this time . I asked her what that meant exactly . She told me that they had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets created " so they could call me back . She asked for the best time to reach me and the best phone number . I told her that the best time was anytime during their regular business hours and provided her with my cell phone number . I asked her when I could expect a call back . She said that it should n't be more than 24 hours . She told me that everything I 'd said had been recorded and notes had been made . I took the opportunity to summarize that my grievance was that at no time was I told that I was on a promotional package , there was no written documentation anywhere stating the same , and there was no written notification of the rate increase in advance . I thanked her for her time and the call ended . <p> So , now , I will wait and see if I actually get a call tomorrow . From the sounds of the other posts in these and other online forums , however , I am not overly confident that will happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . You 're currently subscribed to Prime Plus and Basic Cable without a contract . You 're and have been receiving a discount for these services . Normally the full price for Prime Plus is $59.95 and Basic cable is $29.95 . I 've requested to have the original sales calls pulled to provide training to the representatives if needed.I wanted to set the expectation that we would be unable to continue the previous discount as this promotion has expired . However we may be able to provide you a loyalty contract . Could you send me a personal message with a good contact number and time you 're available ? I 'll make sure someone contacts you tomorrow from our retention department . <p> I find those prices interesting . On your website currently for my area it 's offering a rate of $14.95/month for the same internet plan for a year for existing customers . Plus I never even wanted the cable television service to begin with but was told that was a better piece at the time . <p> I also find the tone of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicates that Mediacom does not feel it necessary to be responsible for its actions , or in this case , inaction in not properly or accurately informing the customer of the terms of service . PM forthcoming . <p> I want to be clear that the fact that , in addition to never being plainly told , NOWHERE does my bill for the past 12 months reflect that the rate is promotional . Nor did I ever receive any paperwork stating that either . Is Mediacom somehow exempt from basic contract laws ? <p> I understand your frustration . You 're currently not in a service contract . The pricing online is for customers looking to add that line of service . This is explained in the Terms and Restrictions on the same page . I do apologize if I came off as rude , my intention was to only explain the situation and what resolution we would be able to offer . I assure you we will take the appropriate action for any representatives that provided misinformation . I did receive your personal message and will have that department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is anything more I can do to help feel free to let me know . <p> i 'm sure this is gon na get deleted but it has to be said .... how many times is mediacom gon na say " the call will be pulled for training purposes " ... when does mediacom take responsibility for the actions of their reps mis informing people and leading people on thinking they have one thing , then turn around and say that 's not what you have ..... why is it our fault that your reps tell us things that they are either mis informed about or mis trained and we the customer have to pay for their screw ups ? .... what other business do you know of that if their employee tells someone something for a certain price for a certain amount of time only to have that price and/or time change because the rep was wrong ? if the reps are telling people something that 's legally binding on the phones , and you have recorded proof of it , Mediacom should honor what was agreed to on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not take the mistake of their employees out on us the customer <p> We do n't make customers pay for mistakes that were done by Mediacom Employee 's . If this was done correctly at the point of sale the price would be the same . Situations like these Mediacom will honor 1 additional month at the quoted rate . Going forward the rate will be the same promotional rate that other Mediacom customers pay subscribed to the same promotion . At this point , the customer can make an educated decision about accepting the rate going forward or discuss offers for another promotion that would suit their needs , as the customer would have done at the original point of sale . <p> except that 's not fair ... when a customer is told one thing and made sure what he/she was told a few times was right .... why should Mediacom not honor what was said for the duration of said time and money ? alot of people make decisions on what to get and what not to get while talking to someone and lock that price/time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person is being told that what the rep on the phone told him was wrong and now has to either pay more or change companies because of a mistake made by mediacom ..... this is n't the first time ive herd that on these boards with myself included in that ....

I tried to switch to Verizon home service but Mediacom canceled our phone service before we could port our number back , forcing us to switch back to Mediacom 's crap home phone . <p> Over the past few months , I have made a " DOWN TIME " log of Mediacom 's internet . Now , I require internet mostly at night since that 's what I do all of my programming work . But , again , like tonight my internet has been down since 8 PM until 2 AM .

We are all continually experiencing sub par performance across the entire United States . No amount of complaining or pointing out the obvious has yielded any results .

Please hang in there with us and understand that we really are doing everything we can . <p> Hi- I 'm following up on the PM you sent to Tommy . He 's out sick today . I looked over the signal levels and can see two main points that could be causing a lot of the trouble . Signal received by the modem is quite weak overall , but prone to low spikes . When it hits a bottom low , this is most likely when you see it disconnect . Signal-to-noise levels are a bit off on the signal sent out as well . My records show that we have not had a technician out to repair these issues either in quite some time or at all , and- historically- these signal troubles or ever-present . I apologize , as I 'm not sure why after the times you have spoken to someone they have not been able to identify this . At this point the best bet would be to schedule a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could set this up for you if you 'd like . <p> The poor quality .. what seems to be nationwide is'nt really the fault of the mods here . Blame their management - high quality infrastructure costs money . Why spend on this when there is no competition in rural areas ? So the equation is simple , continue dishing out bad quality at high prices , let the field reps manage the complaints and fix them . <p> If you observe the mean time between failures as a metric , mediacom service has got to be amongst the worst in the nation . At least the mods here are polite , not something that can be said for the rude people on the phone you get to talk to and which is why I have stopped calling in . <p> I ca n't wait to get out of the rural area I live in . <p> Logged <h> MediacomBill <p> Thanks for the feedback . Your kind words about the mods is appreciated . I can tell you that Mediacom is investing millions of dollars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custom made it is frustrating how long it can take for the repairs to take . <h> MediacomBill <p> It is up to the field tech to determine what needs to be done in the field . Their job performance ratings are based % of first call resolution . That ping rate you posted was pretty bad . Can you do a trace route for us . I would like to see at which hop it starts to breaks down . <p> I 'll send you a PM with a little bit more information in just a few moments , but signal levels are all looking great at this point .

@@40219245 @219245/ <h> Author Topic : Speed Test reliability ? ? ? ( Read 917 times ) <p> I just recently upgraded my service 50Mbps service to the 200Mbps Service and it did n't really feel like there was a difference in speed of loading/streaming etc . Also being a stickler for getting what you paid for ... I wanted to see that shiny new number . So I hook my Laptop directly to my SB6190 and fire up my go to Speedtests . For reference , I used nearly all of the speedtests that were in this article . LONG ... The results left me more than frustrated . Let 's just say 4 out of the 5 that I used had me at 40 - 60 Mbps and 1 had me at nearly 250 Mbps . The question is who do you believe ? As a customer , I 'm inclined to agree with the 4/5 results and if I was support I would say definitely the one that showed 250 . Also , I looked at my Modem SNR and its a steady 40 . I also did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just shy of 100Mbps . <p> So before I go off the deep end ... does MC support use a specific 3rd party speed test as gospel ? I have n't seen anything that shows that they have their own like Comcast ( which customers do n't trust and prefer " independent " tools ) ... <p> Hello Specht624 , I would like to pull up your modem and everything out . Please send a personal message with your account number or phone number to an active moderator and we will look into this further . Correct , we use Ookla servers just like Comcast and speedtest.net . However , we use servers that are verified by us to give the most accurate speed test . -Tommy <p> Regardless of the whether or not there is an issue with my acct . I still ca n't get over the massive difference in speeds between all the other tests and the Mediacom/Ookla tests . So I decided to run TCPview while running the tests and now I think I found the answer . Why does the Mediacom Speedtest use port 8081 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routing the test in manner inconsistent with normal web traffic , is n't that masking any issues of local congestion and showing me inflated numbers ? <p> I know ookla has multiple tests on sites running over port 8080 , but I 'm not sure about port 8081 . I 'll ask to see what we can find out . I have n't seen many reports of users seeing massive changes between our speed test and others , but we do have a more direct path on the routing to our test , from my understanding . <p> Looking over your account , I do not see any major signal issues that would cause speed problems . When you test directly on speedtest.net and http : //testmy.net/ , what speeds do you get and what servers are being pulled ? <p> This is what I would hope to see and I would n't be unhappy if they were all running around the low test of 173 Mbps ... but when I ran this the other day under the same conditions ( directly connected to my modem via ethernet ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mbps while the ookla tests were running well over 200 . So this has me thinking that the issue was congestion in my area which is being masked when running the tests over ports 8080 and 8081 or as you put it " we do have a more direct path on routing to our test " . This is like driving on the highway in rush hour and I ca n't go above 60mph but you 're in the passenger seat saying that if there was n't any traffic you could go 200 mph . <p> I understand that internet speeds are n't guaranteed and the speed on any single test should n't be seen as gospel but ... if does become a trend where I am seeing that my speeds are consistently considerably lower ( under 100Mbps or 50% or my service level on port 80 ) what should I do about this ? And do n't get me wrong , at this point I am not unhappy but I want to have a better understanding of what 's going on . <p> Hello Specht624 , thanks for sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect server response times . The mediacomtoday.com test tests the Mediacom network whereas the others may choose an alternate path off our network and beyond our control . If you are able to run some tracert commands from the command prompt when your computer is directly connected to the modem and the same hop is shown to have long response times in multiple tests , we can report this to our NOC if on Mediacom network , but if it is a hop that does not belong to us , we are limited in what can be done . We can alert the owner to the problem , but we have no way to force a repair . If you 're able to do any additional testing showing the path , please send that on over so we can check it out .

Had that message I 've written already in this topic . Now that the tech has come the second time they ALL say what I ' ' ve written already in this topic . That 's where I 'm at , the short story of it to say the least . I 've recently had a big surgery so might not get back to this topic very fast . Thank You for all and any help , CrazyOne <p> Hi CrazyOne , thank you for joining us on the forums and for bringing this to our attention ! Reviewing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the initial order processing . This has already been corrected , so this is now likely an issue with equipment authorization or signal trapping . The timing of some of these account notes suggest that you may have spoken with an agent after posting here . Are you still having trouble ? I do n't want to move forward with any initializations or remote changes if things have already been addressed . Let us know and , if the problem still exists , we can work from there . <p> Hello MediacomDrew and thanks for your help.To you wondering if I spoke to an agent after posting in here would be No I didn't.Am I still having trouble , Yes.I 'll hold writing all history and only write that which you request . Again , thanks <p> I 've left the box on as I 've seen posts other places it needs to be for your changes to be done/made since I first started this topic . I just checked and still the same problem . Also , what about the DVR ... Sorry , I 'll wait as I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm full of ? for you and the others and ready to answer yours.Again thanks , CrazyOne <p> Good morning , CrazyOne . I 've sent an initialization signal to the cable box there for you and this may take 15-20 minutes to reach the box and take effect . The box should reset and may complete powered down an need to be powered back up . Once It 's back up , the guide will take a bit to fully load as well . Can you let us know if you see a change there in a little bit ? <p> Looking over your offer , I see it includes a digital cable box with Family TV and some movie channel services , but neither DVR service nor equipment is listed . <p> Hello MediacomRoyal I had the chance now to check it had powerd down and once turned on and checked I can again say no joy . I do have local channels and their HD versions as well a FEW others . Like shoping channels and SD versions of Halmark M&amp;M , tennis , IFC . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone the tech did something with his smart phone as he did when he first installed that box . Had all channels as I should and were coming in except the HD versions of said channels at first install . The movie channels included are up , smiles , and working both SD &amp; HD of those . Those are included , with the package , not free or temp . Have that in writing . The TiVo DVR service is a free temp part of the package , 3 months . I 'm starting to write history , sorry , and said I would n't . But finish bout DVR , she said would get DVR box . The package comes with FREE HD , FREE On Demand , ect.Edit : He did install a HD DVR box and that , was and is in use . But tech said he could n't get it up and going , the DVR service , as it was the weekend . That 's where that has been left at . I just checked and still no DVR service . Like I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this stuff and even how to use things . Smiles <p> I 'm sorry to hear the signal did not help with this , CrazyOne . We can schedule a technician to come out for this if you like , though our techs have no control of any systems through their phones . <p> I think it would be best to call in to discuss your offer specifics as well as you are not set up with an Xtreme ( TiVo ) offer . If you were set up with TiVo equipment and service , TiVo equipment would have been installed . Your account is set up with a triple play offer including a digital cable box , Local Plus TV with Starz/Showtime premiums , Internet service , and phone service . OnDemand and DVR service are not included , and the 525 box shown in your equipment is not capable of OnDemand or DVR service as it does not contain a gateway or recorder with hard drive . The channels included in your package can be seen in your area lineup and include all channels listed under Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Showtime/TMC Group , Digital Premium Starz/Encore Group headings as well as the StarzEncore and Showtime/TMC channels listed under the HD Premium channels heading . <p> I do not believe we are looking at two different accounts , as the account number shown in your profile in the forums matches the account discussed above , and the IP address used to access these forums is assigned to the modem assigned for service on the same account . <p> Hello MediacomRoyal , ah , looks like I might get a headache in here also . As yous also are saying two things for same and that being as it is said at different times . Same I 've gone through with customer service on the phone . Screen shots , screen shots ... <p> Good morning , CrazyOne . I 've sent an initialization signal to the cable box there for you and this may take 15-20 minutes to reach the box and take effect . The box should reset and may complete powered down an need to be powered back up . Once It 's back up , the guide will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you let us know if you see a change there in a little bit ? <p> Looking over your offer , I see it includes a digital cable box with Family TV and some movie channel services , but neither DVR service nor equipment is listed . <p> " Family TV " <p> Please , one of you send me identifing numbers for the box I have to verify and we will go from there on . I did spend time on the phone ALOT and found out the person who first signed me up enterd things wwrong and they were corrected and things should be working now . Have a voice recording of that . One of yous even mad mention of that in this topic I do believe . As far as not controling with phone , well he was even channeling up and down with it . Dont't know what else he did but as he typed it appeare ... Never mind that for now , numbers please as what is being said in here . <p> Wait for those , CrazyOne <p> Edit : As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear . The only , only equipment I received prior to the installaton was a hitron model CGNVM-2559.What do you show and it 's identifier #s as to the cable box you say I have that 's " shown in your equipment " . Thanks again ... <p> I am showing the cable box that you have on file has an SN number that ends in 2048 and the MAC address of the modem ends in 0CC1 . To go over the equipment information in detail , we will need to speak with you directly over the phone . If you have any further questions about your current service packages , please let us know and we will be happy to have one of our Total Care specialists reach out to you directly . <p> Hello MediacomAllie and thanks for the info.So you said my cable box SN endeds with 2048 and MediacomRoyal said , I 'll quote ; " OnDemand and DVR service are not included , and the 525 box shown in your equipment is not capable of OnDemand or DVR service as it does not contain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm assuming " 525 " is a model number . You also said the MAC address of the modem ends in 0CC1 . I will check into these when I can . To be honest after over 400 minutes on the phone with mediacom and what the tech did to me and my property as he left the second time makes this all upsetting and getting harder to stay calm . As said , will check and when I feel like raising my blood presure again I will continue down this rabbit hole I guess . <p> Please keep us posted ! In an effort to clear some of the confusion , the cable box installed is a full cable box and further review confirms that it is capable of HD , DVR recording and playback , and OnDemand services . HD programming should broadcast without trouble , and OnDemand should be accessible at any time . DVR capability is currently disabled ; however , as the necessary service codes are not active on the account itself . A current channel line-up can be found here : LONG ... Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should be able to view programming in the following blocks : <p> At this time , what channels are broadcasting as intended and what channels are you not able to pick up ? Are you receiving any continuing error messages on-screen ? OnDemand can be accessed from Channel 1 or by pressing the OnDemand button on your remote . Is this working as intended or are you receiving further errors ? DVR services and features will not function at this time as these service codes are not on the account , as mentioned previously . <p> Yes , confusion for sure Ok I will try to help yous be less confused about channels I can see as of this post now , come in , and those with errors that should come in . Just to say again , they were all coming in except the HD channels when first installed . Now to the channels ; <p> Family TV ( Includes Local Plus TV ) Will list channels I can see at the tme of writting this and the others have the error message I 've written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starz/Encore GroupHD Premium Channels Showtime set and Starz setSeems all are coming in for all those . <p> HD Family TV ( Included with Family TV ) Will list channels I can see at the tme of writting this and the others have the error message I 've written in this topic already.759-841 <p> On Demand is up and working with no errors . MediacomDrew , there was and is , no confusion in my brain , as to what I had for a cable box . But I question how someone can come on here and post I have a whole different one as that is what is listed for my equipment . Yes the DVR capability is currently disabled , I checked . But hopefully get the channels worked out and then we 'll deal with that fly in the soup . That 's quite a few channel to investigate at one time . <p> Good morning , CrazyOne . As the additional service ( Family TV ) has been added to your account and you are still missing channels after multiple signals to the box , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . I have reserved the next available appointment , and I 'll PM those details now . <p> MediacomRoyal , see that , this is the thing , Family was not added as a service it is , is part of the , my bundle I signed up agreed to . As said over and over and over and over again ALL THE CHANNELS I WAS SUPOSE TO GET WERE COMING IN EXCEPT THE HD CHANNELS OF SAID CHANNELS AT FIRST INSTALL . The eledge tech that did the install said they would come in to just give them a little time . They , HD channels of Family , had and still do , have that message I 've already wrote in this topic . But now since that same tech came back the 8th of March because they , the HD channels , were n't coming in yet . As I 've said over and over also as he was here I then lost all , that 's all channels period . After he threw his fit and ect and slamed the door on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . What then was starting to be seen was channels I can see with my ant which is over 47 feet above the ground and pulls a lot of stations and they are HD not that 480 BS on those lower channels . Now I do have the HD local channels coming in , as of four hours ago when I looked and was on it anyway . It has became VERY , VERY clear that no one , no one that works for Mediacom has all the facts of anything that 's gong on with stuff at Mediacom at any time . Please , please do n't take that wrong as I 'm not putting anyone down in any way . Just making the observation of it because of what I 've been going through and have so far . I have n't checked the PM as yet , so do n't know what is all in it . A different tech was suppose to come back on the 8th and swap boxes , but instead the same one came empty handed and as said ... not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LLC has been informed not once , not twice , but three times what will happen if the same tech knocks on this , my door . And better be a DVR HD box if replaced , as that is needed for all my services I signed up for and agreed to for th .... They know how much , and if they forget have voice recordings to remind them and also papers . Ok , I 'm starting to rant so will close this response <p> Hello MediacomVic , Auh first , what appointment was that , that you said was completed ? I received a PM from MediacomRoyal that I responded to saying the one set up would n't work and reason why and the best time when one might be able to be set up after I found things out today ( 3/22 ) . So , as I assumed , not at first but later , it was n't the cable box but what he did at the service box before entering my place . You have just confirmed it for me as I checked a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , check all of them and see if all working . If they are , then we will take care of the rest of things such as DVR service as it IS suppose to be active on that , my account . No one , no one came into my place for an appointment and has even called me about an appointment . If they would of called I would of told them I was n't home , MediacomRoyal knows why I was n't home . <p> Anyway , will check , then post back here to this topic.Thanks MediacomVic , CrazyOne <p> Hello Mods , Well , not perfect by no means as channals come and go when ever they feel like it . Now I 'm not talking about loosing a signal , but it then poping up a not authurized . It is NOT a constant thing or certain channal(s) just happens when it happens . Oh , and I investigated a little more when it was happening and found channal was not supose to have but did . Authurized as in coming in . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LoL or scream I guess . Try to pay on line and says not a valid e-mail . Auh , used one I 've been using for couple decades and even used the one given to me by mediacom and that even says invaild e-mail . Not to mention , they even went back to first month that I payed for day of the supposed install for the month and install saying I still ow like 31.89 . WHAT ! ? I 'm tired and my health makes myself even more tired . Any and all help to at least get this bill payed for now is most helpful and thanks <p> I 'm sorry to hear the issues are still happening and I 'll be happy to assist you with this . I was n't showing any issues reported at this time and I 'll be happy to send some signals to the cable box . These signals can take 15-20 minutes to process . If the issues are still happening , then I 'd like to have a service appointment set up to look at this further
