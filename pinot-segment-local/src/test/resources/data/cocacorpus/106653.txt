The meta-analysis was based on 1728 effect-sizes , 151 unique samples from 96 studies and the average effect-size at the end of the programs was .34 . In a remarkable contrast to most educational research , these short-term or immediate gains were followed by substantial additional gains between the end of the program and follow-up assessments ( ES = .17 ) . The effect-sizes varied substantially according the particular program and outcome , and improved as the length of the program and the ages of participants increased . Too little is known , however , about why adventure programs work most effectively . 
@@41691328 @1691328/ <h> What are Experiential Learning Cycles ? <p> Experiential Learning Cycles are models for understanding how the process of learning works . They are distinct from other models of learning , such as behavioral models or social learning models , in two notable ways : <p> Experiential Learning Cycles treat the learner 's subjective experience as of critical importance in the learning process . ELCs draw on experiential education principles , which are largely based on the educational philosophy of John Dewey ( 1920's-1950 's ) . <p> Experiential Learning Cycles propose an iterative series of processes which underlies learning . Depending on the model , there is anywhere between one stage ( experience alone ) through to six stages of learning to be considered . <p> Experiential Learning Cycles are commonly used to help structure experience-based training and education programs . For example , Experiential Learning Cycle models are amongst the most important pieces of theory used in many outdoor education programs . <h> Why break down learning into distinct stages ? <p> By breaking fuzzy processes ( such as learning ) down into distinct stages ( such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can better understand , test out , and make use of the main components . <p> However , trainers and educators who use convenient models , need to be critical consumers . Whilst a good model can greatly aid research and practice , a poor model ( one which is wrong or misinterpreted ) can create more problems than it solves . <p> Here is an example of how it can helpful to break learning down into discrete steps : <p> Tom is a typical three-year old boy in almost all respects , except that recently he has been throwing more temper tantrums than usual , they seem to be lasting longer , and occasionally they become particularly destructive to furniture , etc . Tom 's parents are struggling to find ways to help Tom learn other ways of dealing with his frustrations and anger . They are concerned that if Tom does n't learn to deal more appropriately with his emotions , that the problem could continue through his early schooling years and perhaps longer . <p> Tom 's parents seek help from a psychologist who recommends implementing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both of these procedures have been shown to be effective in helping children learn to deal with emotions and learn more effective behaviors because they intentionally add a " reflection " stage to the " action " stage . Such approaches to parenting can be seen as similar to the 2-stage Experiential Learning Cycle ( action - reflection ) . <p> In many fields related to experiential learning , education , and training , the underlying " theoretical engine " is the idea that people can learn very effectively through direct , hands-on experience , as long as these experiences are well designed and facilitated . <p> But there are many examples where experience alone is not sufficient for meeting particular learning goals . In such situations , it seems to work better if the raw experience is packaged together with facilitated exercises which involve thinking , discussing , or creatively processing cognitions and emotions related to the raw experience . <p> Note that the term " Experiential Learning Cycle " is often used to refer to the 4-stage process model discussed extensively by Kolb ( 1984 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus Juch ( 1983 ) has collated 17 models . <p> The underlying philosophy of experiential learning cycle ( ELC ) models is Deweyian . By Deweyian is meant that Experiential Learning Cycle models emphasize that the nature of experience as of fundamental importance and concern in education and training . <p> A further , Deweyian assumption underlying ELCs is that people learn experientially and that some experiences are educative whilst other experiences are miseducative . All experiences are understood to be continuous , that is , each experience influences each future experience . <p> It is the teacher 's responsibility to structure and organize a series of experiences which positively influence each individual 's potential future experiences ( Dewey , 1938/1997 ) . In other words , " good experiences " motivate , encourage , and enable students to go on to have more valuable learning experiences , whereas , " poor experiences " tend to lead towards a student closing off from potential positive experiences in the future . <p> This can be easier to understand with an extremely negative example , such as child abuse . Abusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead an individual towards shutting down or turning away from potentially positive experiences , particularly those involving trust of others . On the other hand , nurturant , warm experiences , particularly during the foundational years in child development , can help to foster an openness to experience , which augurs well for the child 's future . <p> Dewey emphasizes the subjective nature of experience - the maxim " one 's man 's meat can be another man 's poison " applies in education and training . Thus , the educator must be constantly alert to individual uniquenesses in the background of the participants , and personality , learning style , etc . <p> This does not necessarily mean descending into a completely free , unstructured style of education and training . Many educators claim the headiness of completely student-driven education has been tried and failed ( e.g. , A. S. Neill 's " Summerhill " ) . <p> However , there is also much disgruntlement with over structured training approaches ( such as competency-based training ) and overly prescriptive , restrictive schooling , particularly for non-academically inclined students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide people with less direct " content " or " information " and more of the underlying skills that foster learning capabilities and life skills . <p> Thus , we might construct a philosophical spectrum with regard to the structuredness of approaches to learning : <p> At various times or in different circumstances , a more free or a more structured approach may be more appropriate . Most often , however , a learner needs some amount of freedom to develop experience-based understanding ; likewise in most educational settings , learners need some degree of guidance as well . <p> Thus , Experiential Learning Cycles can be seen as providing a semi-structured approach . There is relative freedom to go ahead in activity and " experience " , but the educator also commits to structuring other stages , usually involving some form of planning or reflection , so that " raw experience " is package with facilitated cognitive ( usually ) thinking about the experience . <p> The length of time spent of each stage can vary between seconds , minutes , hours , or even days , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , to 10 to 60 minute activities . <h> Descriptions of the 9 Experiential Learning Cycle Models <p> Nine Experiential Learning Cycle models commonly in experiential learning literature have been identified and can be organized in terms of the number of stages they propose , from 1 to 6. <h> 1-stage model <p> The first model , a 1-stage model ( experience ) , is simply that experience alone is sufficient for learning . In many cases this is true . Pickles ( n.d. ) traces this underlying philosophy further back to the oft-used by experiential educator 's Confucius quote ( from around 450 BC ) : <p> Tell me , and I will forget . Show me , and I may remember . Involve me , and I will understand . <p> The goal of education from this point of view then would be to structure and organize learning activities in which experiences themselves facilitate learning . For more information about the 1-stage model , see the " Outward Bound " model in James ( 1980/2000 ) , Bacon ( 1987 ) and " Are the Mountains Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> 2-stage model <p> The second model , a 2-stage model ( experience-reflection ) , is that experiences followed by periods of reflection is an effective way to structure and facilitate experiential education . <p> The second 3-stage model is based more directly on Dewey 's ( 1938/1997 ) theory of experience , involving : " observation of surrounding conditions-knowledge obtained by recollection-judgment , which puts together what is observed and what is recalled to see what they signify " ( Dewey , 1938/1997 , cited in Priest &amp; Gass , 1997 , p. 145 ) <p> This model suggests that a participant has a Concrete Experience , followed by Reflective Observation , then the formation of Abstract Conceptualizations before finally conducting Active Experimentation to test out out the newly developed principles . <p> Although its the most commonly cited , whether Kolb 's 4-stage Experiential learning Cycle best represents learning in all situations is debatable . <p> There are other stage models to be considered , and many critiques have been made . Nevertheless , the Kolbian 4-stage model is widely known and used in education and training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is a 3-stage Model More Practical ? <p> Of course in briefly summarizing these 1- through 6-stage Experiential Learning Cycle models , details and variations and elaborations have been necessarily left aside . <p> One issue worth pursuing , however , is whether the 4-stage stage model is the most useful , particular in practical settings . <p> Personally , I 've found the 4 obtusely named stages of Kolb 's Experiential Learning Cycle somewhat abstract and foreign . I also like to explain the learning model or process being used to students , and the 4-stage model isnd not particularly student-friendly . <p> Instead , I 've found that a simple , 3-stage model , do-review-plan ( see Figure 3 ) appeals , particularly when explaining the model directly to participants and for basic staff training : <p> DOgo forth and have an experienceREVIEWreview what happened and what can be learnedPLANplan a way to tackle the next round of experience <p> The 3-stage do-review-plan is closely related to the 3-stage plan-do-review , which is a quality improvement cycle used in management and business . The difference is that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the initial stage , rather than planning ( plan ) which is often the initial stage for management and business . However , the cycle is continuous in both cases , so the designation of a fixed starting point is rather arbitrary . <p> The most direct application of the model is to use it to ensure that teaching ... activities give full value to each stage of the process . This may mean that ... a major task is to " chase " the learner round the cycle , asking questions which encourage Reflection , Conceptualisation , and ways of testing the ideas . ( Atherton , 2002 ) <p> Critiques of Experiential Learning Cycles are basically , as follows : <p> How on earth can the fuzzy , varied process of learning be condensed into 4 ordered stages ? <p> How many stages of learning are there really ? Could be anywhere from 0 to 100 , there 's no real way of telling . <p> The teaching of experiential learning cycles to trainee teachers can narrow them down into fixed ideas about how to teach ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity , and ever onward ) <p> The research evidence for the experiential learning cycles models is generally lacking . <p> Greenaway ( 2002 ) has several interesting comments , criticisms , and further links . For example , he makes the interesting point that : <p> It is often assumed that the stages of a ' learning cycle ' are managed by a facilitator , but they can also be self-managed or even ' unmanaged ' in the sense that learning from experience is a normal everyday process for most people . <p> My recommendations for further online critiques and elaborations of Kolb 's ( 1984 ) theory of experiential learning and his Experiential Learning Cycle are to read :

In these situations , it can be more informative to use the effect sizes , possibly with confidence intervals . <p> Significance tests conducted with high power can be misleading <p> For studies involving large sample sizes ( e.g. , &gt; 400 ) , a different problem occurs with significance testing because even small effects are likely to become significant significant , although these effects may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to effect sizes than to statistical significance testing . <p> To sum up : <p> When there is no interest in generalising ( e.g. , we are only interested in the results for the sample ) , there is no need for significance testing . In these situations , effect sizes are sufficient and suitable . <p> When examining effects using small sample sizes , significance testing can be misleading because its subject to Type II errors . Contrary to popular opinion , statistical significance is not a direct indicator of size of effect , but rather it is a function of sample size , effect size and p level . In these situations , effect sizes and confidence intervals are more informative than significance testing . <p> When examining effects using large samples , significant testing can be misleading because even small or trivial effects are likely to produce statistically significant results . This can be dealt with by reporting and emphasising significance test results . <h> Effect sizes <h> Types of questions <p> One of the most common question driving evaluation of intervention programs is " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often , the question(s) could be more usefully phrased as " how much effect did this program have ? " and perhaps also " how does this effect compare with the effects of other interventions ? " . <p> To answer the " did we get an effect ? " question it is necessary to compare the observed result against 0 . If the results are to be generalised , the comparison against 0 or a control group can be done inferentially , using statistics such as paired samples t-tests , repeated measures ANOVAs , etc. are used . Alternatively , confidence intervals can be used . If the results are not to be generalised ( i.e. , where the population data is available ) , then the question can be answered simply by examining the effect sizes . <p> To answer the " how much effect did the program get ? " question , effect sizes can be used . <p> To answer the " how does the effect compare with the effects of other interventions ? " question , effect sizes can be used because they are standardised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other types of interventions obtained from meta-analyses . <p> Use of effect sizes can also be combined with other data , such as cost , to provide a measure of cost-effectiveness . In other words , " how much bang ( effect size ) for the buck ( cost ) ? " . This is not an uncommon question that government or philanthropic funders may wish to ask and increasingly there is a demand for such " proven evidence " of outcomes and cost-effectiveness in psycho-social intervention programs . <h> Advantages and disadvantages <p> Some advantages of effect size reporting are that : <p> It tends to be easier for practitioners to intuitively relate to effect sizes ( once it is explained ) than significance testing <p> Most undergraduate and postgraduate research methods and statistics courses tend to teach and overemphasise classical test theory and inferential statistical methods , and to underemphasise effect sizes and confidence intervals .

For more information , see Valentine and Cooper ( 2003 ) , Wikipedia , and Wikiversity . Effect sizes can be converted into other types of effect sizes , thus the choice of effect size is somewhat arbitrary . For program evaluation , however , standardised mean effect sizes are more commonly used . <h> Standardised mean effect size <p> Standardised mean effect sizes ( such as Cohen 's d and Hedge 's g ) are basically z scores . These effect sizes indicate the mean difference between two variables expressed in standard deviation units . A score of 0 represents no change and effect size scores can be negative or positive .

A well-known guide is offered by Cohen ( 1988 ) : <p> .8 = large <p> .5 = moderate <p> .2 = small <p> Percentile scores , based on the properties of the normal distribution , can be used to aid interpretation of standardised mean effect sizes . Percentiles can be used to indicate , for example , where someone who started on the 50th percentile could , on average , expect to end up after the intervention ( compared to people who did n't experience the intervention ) . For example , imagine a child of average reading ability who participates in an intensive reading program . If the program had a small effect ( ES = .2 ) , this would raise the child 's reading performance to the 58th percentile , a moderate effect ( ES = .5 ) would raise the child to the 69th percentile , and a large effect ( ES = .8 ) would raise the child to the 79th percentile . These calculations can be easily done using a free web calculator , such as at HyperStat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) are effect sizes . Correlational and standardised mean effect sizes can not be directly compared , but they can be converted . In the context of an intervention program , a correlational effect size would indicate the standardised covariance between Time ( independent variable ) and Outcome ( dependent variable ) . As with standardised mean effect sizes , interpretation of the size of correlational effects needs to occur within the context of the study , but a general guide ( Cohen , 1988 ) is that : <p> .5 = large <p> .3 = medium <p> .1 = small <h> Confidence Intervals <p> If there is no desire to generalise the findings to a population , then the ESs statistics can be interpreted without the CIs . <p> The main typical use of CIs is to help guide the process of generalisation based on a sample .

Does the CI include some other benchmark ? e.g. , using the logic described in a. , it is possible to make comparisons with benchmarks , such as whether the population effect size(s) are likely to differ from a benchmark , such as .2 , which is the typical ES reported for outdoor education programs with school students in the Hattie , et al , ( 1997 ) meta-analysis . <p> It should be also be noted that the desired range of likelihood is chosen by the researcher . Although 95% is commonly chosen as a default , this is likely to lead to Type II errors in program evaluation , which is often conducted with small sample sizes . Less stringent confidence intervals , such as 90% or even 80% , may be more appropriate .

@@41691347 @1691347/ <h> Field Theory - Kurt Lewin <h> Field Theory - Kurt Lewin <p> Kurt Lewin ( 1890-1947 ) was a famous , charismatic psychologist who is now viewed as the father of social psychology . Born in Germany , Lewin emigrated to the USA as a result of World War II . <p> Lewin viewed the social environment as a dynamic field which impacted in an interactive way with human consciousness . Adjust elements of the social environment and particular types of psychological experience predictably ensue . In turn , the person 's psychological state influences the social field or milieu . <p> Lewin was well known for his terms " life space " and " field theory " . He was perhaps even better known for practical use of his theories in studying group dynamics , solving social problems related to prejudice , and group therapy ( t-groups ) . Lewin sought to not only describe group life , but to investigate the conditions and forces which bring about change or resist change in groups . <p> In the field ( or ' matrix ' ) approach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total situation has to be taken into account . If only part of the situation is considered , a misrepresented picture is likely to develop . <p> Later on , yoda in Star Wars brought field theory back into vogue , with his kind wish for Luke Skywalker , " may the force field be with you . " But likewise , Luke had to influence the force . <p> The following two passages offer a more detailed summary of Lewin 's field theory . <p> For Kurt Lewin behaviour was determined by totality of an individuals situation . In his field theory , a field is defined as the totality of coexisting facts which are conceived of as mutually interdependent ( Lewin 1951 : 240 ) . Individuals were seen to behave differently according to the way in which tensions between perceptions of the self and of the environment were worked through . The whole psychological field , or lifespace , within which people acted had to be viewed , in order to understand behaviour . Within this individuals and groups could be seen in topological terms ( using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life spaces ( such as the family , work , school and church ) , and these were constructed under the influence of various force vectors ( Lewin 1952 ) . <p> Hall and Lindzey ( 1978 : 386 ) summarize the central features of Kurt Lewins field theory as follows : <p> Behaviour is a function of the field that exists at the time the behaviour occurs , <p> Analysis begins with the situation as a whole from which are differentiated the component parts , and <p> The concrete person in a concrete situation can represented mathematically . <p> Kurt Lewin also looked to the power of underlying forces ( needs ) to determine behaviour and , hence , expressed a preference for psychological as opposed to physical or physiological descriptions of the field ( op. cit . ) . <p> In this we can see how Kurt Lewin drew together insights from topology ( e.g. lifespace ) , psychology ( need , aspiration etc. ) , and sociology ( e.g. force fields motives clearly being dependent on group pressures ) . As Allport in his foreword to Resolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these three aspects of his thought were not separable . All of his concepts , whatever root-metaphor they employ , comprise a single well-integrated system . It was this , in significant part , which gave his work its peculiar power . <p> Lewin is most renown for his development of the field theory . The field theory is the " proposition that human behavior is the function of both the person and the environment : expressed in symbolic terms , B = f ( P , E ) . " ( Deaux 9 ) This means that ones behavior is related both to ones personal characteristics and to the social situation in which one finds oneself . <p> The field theory may seem obvious to us now , but most early psychologist did not believe in behaviorism . Many psychologists at the time believed in the psychoanalytic theory that held human motives to be blind pushes from within . Lewin thought of motives as goal- directed forces . He believed " that our behavior is purposeful ; we live in a psychological reality or life space that includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are important to us but also imagined states that do not currently exist " ( Tesser 340 ) . <p> Lewins field theory lead to the development of actual field research on human behavior . With boldness , Lewin manipulated complex situational variables in natural settings . His approach has guided experiments in the field of social cognition , social motivation , and group processes . Most importantly Lewin helped develop action research . Action research uses empirical social research , social action , and controlled evaluation . <h> Quotes by Kurt Lewin <p> " A successful individual typically sets his next goal somewhat but not too much above his last achievement . In this way he steadily raises his level of aspiration . " <p> " Learning is more effective when it is an active rather than a passive process . "

The idea is that by having one 's capacity tested this helps to develop one 's capacity . <p> Development-by-challenge principles are well-accepted in the biological realms , e.g. , in order to get physical fitter , one must engage in regular physical exercise . Likewise , the argument runs , to develop many aspects of mind and character , one must engage in physical , moral , &amp; psychological exercise . Just as physical exercise leads the body to create new muscle , so too the encounter with challenge helps the brain to grow new neuronal connections and the spirit to rise . In a nutshell , challenge-based philosophies are based on the organic idea that capacities can be strengthened by gradually using them more . <p> Development-by-challenge philosophy was a critical part of Kurt Hahn 's philosophy , best exemplified by the way he talks about the purpose of Outward Bound ( e.g. , see quotes ) . <p> As greater strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person can learn to apply themselves to an every increasing unfolding of challenges in increasingly complex and difficult situations .

Once a student develops skills in encountering challenge , his/her self-efficacy ( believe in one 's ability ) naturally grows .

Thus self-efficacy can continues to increase until it meets new barriers which challenge the inherent ego-processes of self-efficacy . <p> experience transformative Note that what a student also learns from a succession of challenges is how to gain ( rather than lose ) from challenges .

For example , some challenges are traumatic . If someone has been traumatized , future use of challenge must be used with caution . But " normal " , basically healthy people generally respond positively once engaged in meaningful challenge . Initially , however , there may be considerable resistance and fear to the perceived threat of engaging in challenge-based activities . <p> Often forgotten in the discussion of challenge , is the equal need for nurturance , support , encouragement , and other forms of positive regard and reinforcement . Where an experience is particularly challenging , more support must go hand-in-hand . Challenge and support work together to " stress " and " heal " -- Kurt Hahn , for example , referred to Outward Bound as a double-edged sword which cut and healed .

Therefore , use these general guidelines to help interpret IQ scores : <p> IQ does not indicate the ' value ' of a person <p> An IQ score reflects someone 's level of performance on a standard set of tasks .

Larger differences ( e.g. , greater than 10 points ) are more meaningful and reliable .

His theory of experience continues to be much read and discussed not only within education , but also in psychology and philosophy . Dewey 's views continue to strongly influence the design of innovative educational approaches , such as in outdoor education , adult training , and experiential therapies . <p> In the 1920 's / 1930 's , John Dewey became famous for pointing out that the authoritarian , strict , pre-ordained knowledge approach of modern traditional education was too concerned with delivering knowledge , and not enough with understanding students ' actual experiences . <p> Dewey became the champion , or philosophical father of experiential education , or as it was then referred to , progressive education . But he was also critical of completely " free , student-driven " education because students often do n't know how to structure their own learning experiences for maximum benefit . <p> Why do so many students hate school ? It seems an obvious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into account the unique differences between each student . Each person is different genetically and in terms of past experiences . Even when a standard curricula is presented using established pedagogical methods , each students will have a different quality of experience . Thus , teaching and curriculum must be designed in ways that allow for such individual differences . <p> For Dewey , education also a broader social purpose , which was to help people become more effective members of democratic society . Dewey argued that the one-way delivery style of authoritarian schooling does not provide a good model for life in democratic society . Instead , students need educational experiences which enable them to become valued , equal , and responsible members of society . <p> The most common misunderstanding about Dewey is that he was simply supporting progressive education . Progressive education , according to Dewey , was a wild swing in the philosophical pendulum , against traditional education methods . In progressive education , freedom was the rule , with students being relatively unconstrained by the educator . The problem with progressive education , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning needs a structure and order , and must be based on a clear theory of experience , not simply the whim of teachers or students . <p> Thus , Dewey proposed that education be designed on the basis of a theory of experience . We must understand the nature of how humans have the experiences they do , in order to design effective education . In this respect , Dewey 's theory of experience rested on two central tenets -- continuity and interaction . <p> Continuity refers to the notion that humans are sensitive to ( or are affected by ) experience . Humans survive more by learning from experience after they are born than do many other animals who rely primarily on pre-wired instinct . In humans , education is critical for providing people with the skills to live in society . Dewey argued that we learn something from every experience , whether positive or negative and ones accumulated learned experience influences the nature of one 's future experiences . Thus , every experience in some way influences all potential future experiences for an individual . Continuity refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on into the future , whether one likes it or not . <p> Interaction builds upon the notion of continuity and explains how past experience interacts with the present situation , to create one 's present experience .

This explains the " one man 's meat is another man 's poison " maxim . Any situation can be experienced in profoundly different ways because of unique individual differences e.g. , one student loves school , another hates the same school . This is important for educators to understand . Whilst they ca n't control students ' past experiences , they can try to understand those past experiences so that better educational situations can be presented to the students .

This at least indicates a need for further work in understanding how culture and cultural identity interacts with outdoor education experiences . <p> Purdie and Neill ( 1999 ) also reported on difficulties experienced by Japanese students in an Australian-based outdoor education program ( e.g. , reluctance around activities such as swimming in a river and dressing and undressing near fellow students in a coeducational setting ) . Such observations are consistent with broad cultural and psychological research which suggests that cultural and personal identities are a powerful filter through which individual experiences are interpreted . <p> One of possible reasons for the nil or negative effects of outdoor education programs is culture shock .

Adaptation may be easy for participants who are familiar with outdoor settings or have had similar experiences , but for those who have had little exposure to the outdoors the process can create many personal and interpersonal difficulties .

Garry Richards has led the way again by recently designing a new version , called the Review of Personal Effectiveness with Locus of Control ( ROPELOC ) , which includes several new scales and several reworked scales from the LEQ . Psychometric testing of the ROPELOC has been completed ( Richards , Ellis , &amp; Neill , 2002 ) . <p> The ROPELOC instrument measures key psychological and behavioural domains that constitute " life effectiveness " . It is specifically designed to be sensitive to the effects of experience-based intervention programs . <p> The two Locus of Control scales measure the persons tendency to take responsibility for his/her actions and successes or to see external controls determining actions . The LOC is an optional part of the ROPE system but is usually used , as it is a very useful indicator of likely behaviour even though it is not behaviourally based , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument consists of 3 items per scale , all of which are rated on a scale of " 1-False , Not like me " to " 8-True , Like me " . <p> The ROPELOC has good internal consistency estimates ( Cronbachs alpha ) , ranging from .79 to .93 , and a well-defined factor structure as shown with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses .

The underlying intention of the instrument design was to provide an administratively efficient and psychologically valid method for assessing typically targeted youth development objectives for adventure-based youth at risk programs . The measured objectives emerged from consultation with numerous youth-at-risk programs . Sixty-five self-report measurement items are proposed to to assess the 17 youth development objectives ( approximately 3 to 5 items per scale ) in Personal , Social and Environmental domains . In addition , observer items have been developed . The style of the items and the measurement scale derives from the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire ( Neill , Marsh , &amp; Richards , 1997 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effectiveness of life skill education programs , particularly in outdoor education . It is recommended that potential users select from the 17 measured objectives in order to reduce the overall number of items and to customise the instrument so that its relevant to their program goals . Potential users should also consider that approximately half the scales have not been previously psychometrically tested , although their face validity appears reasonable . It is also requested that potential users read the conditions of use . <h> General description of the YARPET <p> The Youth at Risk Program Evaluation Tool ( YARPET ) consists of a set of 17 proposed factors and 65 measurement items designed to assess life skill and personal , social , community , and environmental development constructs typically targeted by intervention programs with youth ' at risk ' . The measured objectives emerged from consulting with youth-at-risk programs about commonly sought outcomes and build upon previous constructs from the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire and the Review of Personal Effectiveness . Self-report and observer assessments can be gathered at least before an after an intervention program . Empirical analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention program participants may have experienced change with regard to the desired outcomes . Users are encouraged to select from amongst the factors and to consider developing new factors in order to customise the measurement to match specific program objectives . Limitations of the instrument include a lack of reported psychometric properties , thus reliability and validity is yet to be demonstrated . <p> Good instrumentation is vital for good quality empirical research ( Neill , 2003 ) . Designing valid measurement of psycho-social constructs , particularly amongst youth at risk , has attracted considerable attention , but relatively little methodology and measurement development hasbeen directly applied to experiential and outdoor education settings . In other words , there are some useful research tools ( e.g. , Dahl &amp; Reed , 1999 ) , but none that are ideally suited to immediately measure all the objectives identified by any particular youth-at-risk adventure-based intervention program . <p> For example , Russell ( 2002 ) used the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire ( Y-OQ ) in his longitudinal assessment of seven outdoor behavioral health programs ( which ran wilderness-based programs of between 21 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include that self-report and parent observer versions exist , the psychometric development has been solid , and that clinically comparable norms are available . Downsides include the cost ( it is a commercial instrument ) , its length , and that it lacks customizability for adventure-based youth-at-risk interventions . <p> Of course , no instrument is perfect , particularly when it is applied to a variety of circumstances . The current instrument is designed to provide a low-cost , adventure-oriented , user-friendly instrument for program evaluation and research into youth-at-risk programs which target typical youth development outcomes . Some other possible instruments and places to search are listed on the Tools , Instruments , and Questionnaires page . <p> Experiential intervention programs for youth at risk typically target a holistic range of objectives . The proposed items are designed for use in longitudinal research and evaluation designs which aim to determine the degree to which a range of typical youth development objectives are achieved by outdoor and adventure intervention programs for youth at risk . <p> The evaluation tool derives from a program evaluation system that has emerged from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide for a rigorous and reasonably comprehensive evaluation of the extent to which program objectives are achieved in a cost and time efficient manner . <p> Most youth-at-risk programs are conducted by leaders and administrators who do not have a background in research , but who are skilled in report writing and knowledge about their own program . Thus , as long as program operators are supported in selecting an appropriate evaluation methodology , and with good quality data analysis , they can construct good quality reports to funders or evaluators , or for internal program development . <p> This instrumentation is also designed to be user-friendly for participants , program instructors , and administrators . <p> The self-report tool can be administered pre- ( Time 1 ) and post-program ( Time 2 ) to get a measure of the short-term program impact . It is recommended , however , that baseline and followup assessments are obtained , as well as observer measures ( e.g. , by leaders , parents , teachers , and/or peers ) . <p> This evaluation tool is also designed to be customizable . Program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the instrument is relevant to program objectives , for fearing of undermining the overall validity of the questionnaire . With this instrument , the goal is to get the best of both worlds - psychometric validity and flexibility . Evaluators can select from the pool of 17 scales , to develop a set of items for evaluating the effects of a particular program . <p> An initial youth development objectives was developed through consulting with a range of youth-at-risk programs and outdoor education organizations . In addition , current instruments ( e.g. , the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire ) and lists of youth development objectives ( e.g. , the Search Institute 's 40 Developmental Assets ) often referred to by adventure-based youth-at-risk programs were consulted . Objectives most commonly cited by youth at risk programs were emphasized in selecting the objectives for measurement . <p> Electronic database searches were then conducted for existing instrumentation which could be adapted . Where suitable instrumentation was not identified , new items were constructed . Note that where there was existing instrumentation , three items per scale are recommended .

Potential users should view the proposed tool as a promising pilot tool which is ready for use , but which requires establishment of reliability and validity through analysis of initial data . <p> Social objectives include being able to work in a team , taking on leadership opportunities , conflict resolution skills , listening skills , and engagement with community . <p> Environmental awareness and skills include knowledge and interest in local environment . <p> Institutional outcomes include recidivism and completing of intervention programs . The current measurement tool does not assess institutional outcomes since these are usually derived from existing records . <p> Table 1 . Seventeen youth development objectives which are typical of adventure-based youth-at-risk programs <p> Initially , searches were conducted for existing instrumentation to measure each of the objectives .

However , the best single item has been indicated for each scale , to allow for a short ( 1 item per scale ) instrument .

@@41691380 @1691380/ <h> Abstract <p> The impacts of outdoor education programs on participants remains a topic of much interest to practitioners and researchers . Hundreds of empirical pre-post studies have been conducted in an attempt to better understand the impacts . Typically , psychosocial constructs such as self-concept are measured before and after outdoor education programs . In order to summarize the results of such studies , five relevant meta-analyses have been conducted ( Bunting &amp; Donley , 2002 ; Cason &amp; Gillis , 1994 ; Hans , 2000 ; Marsh , P. E. , 1999 ; Marsh , H. W. , Neill , &amp; Richards , 1997 ) . These research reviews show that education programs have small-moderate impacts on constructs such as self-concept , locus of control , and teamwork . Impressively , the effects appeared to be retained over time . The most effective programs were conducted by particular organizations , involved adult participants , and were longer . Comparisons to meta-analyses for other types of interventions revealed that outdoor education program impacts were similar to other self-concept change programs and other psychological interventions , but not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research review were that future research should seek to understand more about why different programs and different participants achieve different outcomes and for effect sizes to be used by outdoor education programs to monitor educational effectiveness . <h> What are the effects of outdoor education ? <p> Are people any different after participating in challenging adventure activities ? Which programs or participants have the most dramatic effects ? What are the effects of outdoor education ? Such questions have attracted animated discussion since modern forms of outdoor education started appearing over 50 years ago . <p> Typically , the effects of outdoor education have been in the form of testimonial support , anecdotal examples , and passionate rhetoric . For example , the promotional material of outdoor education organizations invariably communicates highly positive claims and examples , outdoor education instructors verbiage with clients exhibits highly optimistic and positive hopes , and a surprising amount of so-called academic work has a clear tendency to uncritically promote the view that outdoor education programs are good things for people . <p> For most outdoor education advocates the ready-at-hand , ad hoc evidence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , the smile when a participant conquers a challenge and the glowing words spoken during a debrief are often compelling . But is it enough to let such evidence speak for itself ? <p> A list of claims about the effects of outdoor education would be very long . Yet for most advocates of outdoor education , what they have personally seen , heard and felt provides sufficient evidence for many wider claims . <p> Such a critique of outdoor educators may seem harsh . But professional outdoor educators should know more about research results , as should all stakeholders in outdoor education programs and related fields of endeavor . Indeed , so should researchers of outdoor education ! To date , however , there has been a lack of high quality research reviews that have been written for both researchers and practitioners . Thus the current article undertakes to compare and summarize the findings of empirical outcome research on outdoor education and related programs for both general audiences . A challenging aim for the article is to provide maximum information about the empirical outcome findings in outdoor education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ways of measuring outcomes , then describes the use of meta-analysis as a method for objectively summarizing pre-post empirical research results , and finally provides recommendations for future outdoor education research and evaluation studies . <h> Ways of researching outcomes <p> There have been two main objective ways that outdoor education outcomes have been researched . <h> Post-program Surveys <p> One of the more common has been to directly ask participants at the end of a program something like " How valuable was this program for your personal growth ? " . On face value this approach has appeal . Indeed , it appears to be a prevalent method . In a recent survey of the practices of over 100 Australian outdoor educators approximately 80% reported that their program used written end-of-program surveys , or happy sheets as they are colloquially known ( Richards , Neill , &amp; Butters , 1997 ) . However , such evaluations are notoriously problematic indicators of program effectiveness . For example , a study by Neill , Richards and Badenoch ( 1997 ) found little relationship between staff and participants ratings of amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and .4 ) . Similarly low correlations were found between participants end-of-program self-reports and their pre-post changes on reliable , psychometric questionnaires . <p> End-of-program reports of the impact of the value of an experience are one valuable source of evidence . However , post-hoc reports are vulnerable to many potential distortions . For example , scores can be inflated by post-group euphoria ( Marsh , Richards , &amp; Barnes , 1986 ) , post-purchase rationalization ( or post-commitment justification ) , group think , and other problems related to difficulties in validity remembering , understanding , and then accurately reporting on what happened during an experience and resultant effect on ones psyche . <p> Disparities between different ways of assessing intervention programs is a broader phenomenon . For example , in a review of management training research , it was claimed that the " reaction of trainees bore no relationship to the effectiveness of the training " ( Bright , cited in Lawson , 1997 , p. 7 ) . <p> To date very little research has explored the relationships between what stakeholders , such as staff and participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the program effectiveness . Thus , the validity of post-experience ratings remains an area for further investigation . <h> Pre-post Testing <p> A second major approach to examining the effectiveness of outdoor education has been to gather participants self-perceptions ( or observer perceptions ) before and after a program and then test to see if there are any differences . Hundreds of empirical evaluation studies have utilized the basic pre-post design , or variations of it . Such studies have used a wide variety of dependent measures ( e.g. , self-esteem , locus of control , etc. ) and have been conducted on several different types of programs . The validity of this approach depends on important factors such as the quality of measurement tool , the use of control or comparison groups , and whether followup testing is conducted ( Campbell , &amp; Stanley , 1963 ) . <p> The variety in the methods and measures of outdoor education pre-post outcome research makes the task of reviewing the literature formidable . There have been several notable reviews of the empirical research ( e.g. , Barrett &amp; Greenaway , 1995 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Ewert , 1982 ; Gillis , 1992 ; Gillis &amp; Thomsen , 1996 ; Godfrey , 1974 ; Iida , 1975 ; Reddrop , 1997 ; Richards , 1977 ; Shore , 1977 ) , however they have all faced difficulties in presenting a systematic overview of the outcome research . Perhaps an indicator of this is that there is only one review which has been published in a peer-reviewed journal ( Crompton &amp; Sellar , 1981 ) and it is over 20 years old . <p> One of the main difficulties faced by these reviews has been to effectively synthesize and systematically summarize the empirical findings from the variety of empirical studies . Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) described the problem that " the number of research endeavors in adventure programming has grown so large that qualitative literature reviews ( like annotated bibliographies ) are no longer sufficient tools for understanding the strengths and weaknesses of trying to measure change that results from adventure programming Cason and Gillis " ( 1994 , p. 40 ) . <p> Since the 1980s , a new , systematic review method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method for entering the empirical results reported by different studies into a central database which is then analyzed and summarized . Well conducted meta-analyses allows for more objective appraisal of the outcome evidence , which can lead to clearer understanding about the nature of outdoor educations impacts on participants . To date , five meta-analytic reviews of outdoor education and related outcome literature have been conducted , and it is these five reviews which the current article summarizes . <h> Understanding meta-analysis <p> Meta-analysis is a statistical technique for accumulating and representing the research results reported in various studies . Meta-analysis pools the findings about a single research question from many different sources and analyzes the overall effects . <p> Meta-analysis results are reported in terms of effect sizes . An ES , as used in this article , is a measure of how much difference existed between ratings at two different points in time ( e.g. , before and after an outdoor education program ) . In essence , the effect size indicates the quantified amount of change . <p> For general interpretation , an effect size of 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction for a measured outcome , and a positive effect size means an increase in a measured outcome . It can also be noted that effect sizes are proportional . Thus , an effect size of .40 represents twice as much change as an effect size of .20 . <p> Various experts have offered suggestions about the meaning of different effect sizes . For example , it has been suggested that an effect size of .50 is a change of practical significance while .25 is educationally significant ( Wolf , 1986 ) . Cohen ( 1977 ) suggested that .2 was small , .5 moderate , and .8 large . Other authors have warned against global guides to interpreting effect sizes since who and what is being measured needs to be identified before a genuine assessment about the value of a particular effect size is made . <p> In practice , a small effect size can be very impressive if , for example , the outcome is difficult to change ( e.g. , a personality construct ) or if the outcome is very valuable ( e.g. , an increase in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large effect size does not necessarily mean that there is any practical value in the change , particularly if it is n't related to the aims of the intervention ( e.g. , political orientation ) . <p> Meta-analysis as a review method is not without its critics . Criticisms tend to fall into two categories ( Bangert-Drowns &amp; Rudner , 1991 ) . Some researchers complain that meta-analysis obscures important information by averaging numerical representations across studies . Other researchers argue that research is best reviewed by a reflective expert who sifts through research and develops kernels of insight from the array of argumentation in a field . Thus , there are advantages and disadvantages to both traditional style and meta-analytic reviewing . An ideal reviewing method , then might involve making use of both meta-analytic methods and traditional review methods . <h> Meta-analytic outdoor education research <p> Five meta-analyses of the effects of outdoor education and related programs have been conducted ( Bunting &amp; Donley , 2002 ; Cason &amp; Gillis , 1994 ; Hans , 2000 ; Marsh , P. E. , 1999 ; Marsh , H. W. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The studies vary considerably in their scope and focus . The major study ( Hattie , Marsh , H. W. , Neill , &amp; Richards , 1997 ) included 96 studies , representing over 12 , 000 participants , included outdoor education programs results for both youth and adults , coded for pre-program effects , program effects and post-program effects . Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) conducted the first outdoor education meta-analysis , based on pre-post outcomes reported in outdoor education research with adolescents ( 43 studies ) . Most of the studies in the Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) study were included in the Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) , hence the results of the two studies are generally consonant . <p> The other three outdoor education meta-analyses reviewed the pre-post outcomes for particular types of programs . Marsh , P. E. ( 1999 ; 22 studies ) focused on the impacts of American camping programs ( 22 studies ) . Hans ( 2000 ; 24 studies ) focused on the effects of adventure programming on locus of control outcomes . Bunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of ropes challenge course programs on teamwork , self-concept and self-esteem outcomes . <p> Table 1 <p> Overall results from five meta-analyses related to outdoor education <p> Study <p> Focus <p> d <p> N studies <p> N effects <p> N participants <p> Cason &amp; Gillis ( 1994 ) <p> Adventure programming for adolescents <p> .31 <p> 43 <p> 147 <p> 2,291 <p> Hattie et al .

The lowest average effect size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , P. E. , 1999 ) and the highest average effect size was reported for ropes challenge courses ( .55 ; Bunting &amp; Donley , 2002 ) . For the other studies , Hans ( 2000 ) reported an effect size of .38 , Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) reported .34 and Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) reported .31 . The findings for the larger studies and the ones focused on outdoor education programs ( i.e , Cason &amp; Gillis ; Hattie et al. , 1997 ) suggest overall effect sizes between .3 and .4 . By broader educational and psychological standards this is be considered a small-moderate amount of change ( Cohen , 1977 ) . <p> Camping programs seemingly low effect size of .20 may not be unexpected , given that not all camps aim to enhance campers personal and/or social development . Indeed , camping programs that had a personal development philosophy had an effect size of .41 . It should also be noted that Bunting and Donleys ( 2002 ) relatively high overall effect size of .55 for ropes challenge courses was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range in effect sizes . Further undermining the reliability of this study is issue that a strong negative relationship was found between quality of study and size of outcome ; in other words , poorer quality studies tended to have higher ES , a finding also reported by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) . <p> In summary , a reasonable consensus amongst the five outdoor education meta-analyses is that outdoor education programs have a small-moderate impact for typically measured outcomes such as self-esteem , behavior problems , and teamwork . In an attempt to be more precise , Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) reported that their results suggested that 65% of participants were better off for having participated in outdoor education programs . <h> Do the Effects of Outdoor Education Programs Last ? <p> Hattie et al. , ( 1997 ) examined the long-term effects of outdoor education programs and reported an additional effect size of .17 for assessments up to 18 months after the end of the program . This finding means that the average program effect size of .34 is followed by an average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of .51 . This evidence suggests that , on average , outdoor education participants experience additional growth on returning to their home environments . Despite wide effect size variations between different studies , Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) noted that the additional .17 is impressive because longitudinal education and training research generally shows a loss over time of immediate program benefits . However , it should also be noted that much of the research on which these long-term results were based was Outward Bound expedition-style programs , thus the generalizability of the finding is limited . <h> What are the Main Outcomes of Outdoor Education Programs ? <p> While overall outcomes are useful as a general guide , detailed information about the effects is needed . Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) grouped the results into six broad categories leadership , self-concept , academic , personality , interpersonal , and adventuresome ( see Table 2 ) . <p> The pre-post program effect sizes for each of Hattie et al.s ( 1997 ) six categories were statistically significant . Interestingly , the smallest program effect size was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect size was for self-concept ( .23 ) . This might indicate a sleeper effect whereby self-concept changes in particular are begun during a program and then continue to unfold afterwards . <p> The effect sizes reported by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) for programs with adolescents were placed into seven categories behavioral assessment by others , self-concept , academic , attitude , locus of control , clinical scales , and school attendance ( see Table 3 ) . There was a very high effect size ( 1.05 ) for studies using clinical measurement scales . This finding could be due to the fact that clinical scales are mainly used for researching specialized and intensive outdoor education programs for participants who have emotional , behavioral or psychological difficulties . Such programs tend to utilize a more highly disciplined and individualized approach than is usually the case in programs with an personal development , educational or recreational emphasis . High effect size for therapeutic and/or behavioral problem clients may also be due to the clients having a greater room for growth than average outdoor education program participants . The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gillis ( 1994 ) ranged between .30 ( locus of control ) and .61 ( academic ) . <p> Hans ( 2000 ) focused on a single outcome , locus of control , and this study largely corroborated the findings of Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) and Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) for small to moderate shifts towards an internal locus of control . Marsh , P. E. ( 1999 ) focused on outcomes for self-constructs ( mostly self-esteem and self-concept ) . Bunting and Donley ( 2002 ) reported results for three main outcome categories , team development ( ES = .58 ) , self-concept ( ES = .23 ) and self-esteem ( ES = .16 ) . <p> Roughly , the small-moderate average effect size finding applies to different outcomes categories , with the notable exception of clinical scales in the Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) study . The largest followup effects appear to be in the area of self-concept . The overall effects seem to suggest enhancement of self-related constructs , action-orientation , and coping behaviors . <h> Are All Outdoor Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1997 , p.77 ) , outdoor education programs " can obtain notable outcomes and have particularly strong , lasting effects . It is clear , however , that adventure programs are not inherently good . There is a great deal of variability in outcomes between different studies , different programs , and different individuals " . <p> This theme of wide variability in the effect sizes was also evident in the Cason and Gillis ( 1994 , p. 46 ) meta-analysis which stated that " when one considers the large range of effect sizes collected , -1.48 to 4.26 , and the wide variation in the findings , a singular summary effect size ... can not adequately reflect the effectiveness of adventure programming " . <p> Other research reviews have come to similar conclusions about variability in outcomes . Burton ( 1981 ) , for example , reviewed 161 outdoor education studies and reported that 38% had " mostly positive " outcomes , 26% had " some positive " outcomes , 34% had " non-significant " outcomes and 2% had " negative " outcomes . <p> This variability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education research and warns against accepting false comfort from the small-moderate average effect sizes . Hattie et al . ( 1997 , p.70 ) emphasized that " only some adventure programs are effective , and then on only some outcomes , and it is probable that only parts of the programs are influencing these outcomes " . <h> Moderators of Outdoor Education Outcomes ? <p> Meta-analytic methods of summarizing research can be used to consider the effect of moderator ( or process ) variables on outcomes . The meta-analytic studies have examined the influence of program length , participant gender , participant age , participant type ( e.g. , delinquent , management , gender mix of group ( all male , all female , co-educational ) , nature of program ( e.g. sailing , wilderness ) , organization running the program and quality of the study . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) found that 36% of the variance in outcomes could be explained by the abovementioned factors . Outcomes were most influenced by the organization running the program ( Outward Bound Australia , ES = .47 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , program length ( programs greater than 20 days , ES = .41 ; less than 20 days , ES = .23 ) , and age of participants ( adults , ES = .38 ; students , ES = .21 ) . <p> Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) found that the quality of the study had an impact on the outcomes , with lower quality studies reporting higher effect sizes , as did Bunting and Donley ( 2002 ) . This should warn researchers to be wary of using instrumentation and designs which are below par since they may inflate results . This concern becomes even more important in the light of how few programs use high quality assessment tools . According to a recent survey only 7% of outdoor educators reported that their programs utilized standard tests as part of their evaluation strategy ( Richards , Neill , &amp; Butters , 1997 ) . <p> Hattie et al ( 1997 ) and Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) reported a weak but positive relationship between program length and the size of outcome , and Bunting and Donley ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ropes course programs and outcomes . Hans ( 2000 ) did not report any effects for program length , and length was not used by Marsh , P. E. ( 1999 ) . Overall , outdoor education program length explains a small but consistent amount of variance in participant outcomes . <p> With regard to the effect of participant age , stronger outcomes were found by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) for younger rather than older adolescents . This negative correlation between age and outcome was also found for the camping studies ( Marsh , P. E. , 1999 ) . This is consistent with other research suggesting that older adolescence is a period during which self-concept is somewhat resilient to change ( e.g. see Hattie , 1992 ) . However , the strongest outcomes of all were found for adult-aged participants ( Hattie et al. , 1997 ) , although Bunting and Donley ( 2002 ) found linear effects of age on ES , from school-age , through college-age to corporate client-age . <p> Hans ( 2000 ) found two significant influences on locus of control outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary purpose had higher effect sizes than programs with goals such as recreation . This finding seemed to be consistent with Marsh , P. E.s ( 1999 ) finding that camps with a self-development philosophy achieved a reasonably high ES , whereas for camps without such a philosophy , participant changes were negligible . These findings lend credibility to the possibility that organizational mission and culture is a critical factor underlying program effects and this could explain the strong effect sizes that have been reported for Outward Bound programs in Australia ( Hattie et al , 1997 ) . <p> The second significant moderator from the Hans ( 2000 ) study was that residential and semi-residential programs were more effective than sessional programs which utilized adventure activities but did not take participants away from their familiar environments overnight . <p> In summary , the main influences on empirical outdoor education research outcomes are the outdoor education organization running the program , the age of participants , and the length of program . Other moderators of note were quality of study and whether the program was residential . Overall , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are small-moderate average effects which vary considerably from participant to participant and from program to program . <h> Outdoor education outcomes compared to other intervention programs <p> Research on many educational , training and therapeutic intervention programs can provide useful comparison with outdoor education outcomes . The most famous meta-analytic study ( based on 475 studies ) reported an average effect size of .70 for psychotherapy ( Smith , Glass &amp; Miller , 1980 ) , noticeably greater than the average outdoor education effect sizes , although it should be noted that psychotherapy tends to be conducted with a different clientele than is normally the case for outdoor education programs . <p> Another useful comparison is Lipsey and Wilsons ( 1993 ) meta-analyses on psychological treatments , a study which represented over one million participants . The overall effect size was moderate ( .47 ) , with 83% of the reviewed meta-analyses finding effect sizes over .20 . Lipsey and Wilson stated that " little in conventional reviews and past discussions of these treatment areas , either individually or collectivelyprepares a reviewer for the rather stunning discovery that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( p. 1192 ) . The Lipsey and Wilson ( 1993 ) study provides outdoor education programs with a useful comparative benchmark , particularly for outdoor education programs that seek recognition for effecting psychological changes . <p> Another useful comparison can be made with non-outdoor education programs designed to enhance self-concept . Hattie , J. A. ( 1992 ) conducted a meta-analysis of 89 self-concept enhancement studies , and found an average effect size of .37 . This effect size represents an average of outcomes for self-concept change programs such as psychology courses , behavior therapy , cognitive therapy , and client-centered counseling . An effect size .37 for non-outdoor education self-concept program changes is similar to outdoor education programs . As with the outdoor education meta-analyses , however , the Hattie , J. A. ( 1992 ) study of non-outdoor education program effects found large variations depending on the type of intervention program . <h> Recommendations <p> On the basis of the research reviewed , three main recommendations emerge for future research and evaluation in outdoor education . Firstly , future research should describe the programs methods in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence of individual differences on outcomes . Thirdly , effect size benchmarks should be used in program evaluation studies . <h> Future Research Should Describe the Program 's Methods in More Detail <p> All five outdoor education meta-analyses were consistent in calling for future research to provide more details about the educational methods used in the program being investigated . The lack of methods information in the primary empirical studies limited the extent to which meta-analysis could analyze process variables . A lack of more detailed information about program features such as program philosophy , type of activities , instructional techniques and facilitation style , instructor experience , program difficulty , weather , environment , group sizes , activity sequencing , and methods for dealing with behavior problems was noted . <p> Given the wide variation of outcomes between different types of programs it is critical that future research must undertake to document in much greater detail the nature of the programs being conducted . <p> An argument can be made that future empirical studies be treated as mixed mode studies with indepth qualitative descriptions of the program process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited information because they use standardized treatment regimens . However , outdoor education programs often lack reliable documentation . outdoor education programming methods needs to receive greater attention in future research . <h> Investigation is needed of the influence of individual differences on outcomes <p> Meta-analytic findings to date have provided little insight into the phenomenon of individual differences influencing outdoor education participant outcomes . Research reviews have struggled to identify and provide models of relevant participant characteristics and processes that significantly influence the nature of their experience and learning . The lack of definitive evidence about causes of individual variations in outcomes may signal a need for different lines of investigation . Two recent studies have illustrated some possible approaches . <p> Fry and Heubeck ( 1998 ) examined the effects of personality on the mood states of participants in Outward Bound programs . In this study , extroverts and introverts had noticeably different mood patterns during the different phases of the program . Neill and Heubeck ( 1998 ) found that school students who reported using productive coping skills ( such as focusing on the positive , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits from outdoor education programs than those who reported using non-productive coping skills ( such as self-blame , worrying and ignoring the problem ) . <p> These two studies suggest that research on individual differences , such as personality or coping styles , may enlighten a path towards developing more effective , individualized programming in outdoor education . <h> Use Effect Size Benchmarks in Program Evaluation <p> The reporting of effect sizes has utility beyond meta-analysis . Reporting of effect sizes is now considered a standard part of empirical reporting ( American Psychological Association , 2001 ) . Effect sizes allow for comparative quantification of program effectiveness . Program evaluation results can be compared with internal benchmarks ( e.g. , compare this program to last years program ) or external benchmarks ( e.g. , compare this program with typical effects for outdoor education programs or for other types of intervention programs ) . <p> An important contribution of such comparisons can be to provide feedback about a programs relative strengths and weaknesses . This can be valuable diagnostic information to help identify areas for possible improvement , and to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five decades of modern day outdoor education , the empirical outcome research has been synthesized . On average , outdoor education programs appeared to have small to moderate effects on participants self-perceptions of personal qualities and capabilities . This finding is similar to the average outcome for psychological training and other types of educational self-concept change programs . These results provide scientific support that outdoor education programs , on average , provide legitimate and effective educational training . It would seem that outdoor education methods have something genuine to offer education , training , and psychology . A particularly impressive strength is that outdoor education programs seem capable of triggering an ongoing cycle of positive change within participants . <p> However , readers should be warned against the comfort of average results . Some outdoor education programs are much less effective and some outdoor education programs are more effective . Outdoor education is not a panacea . Many programs which claim to deliver personal development through the outdoors may be ineffective and almost all programs could be substantially improved if the outcomes of psychological interventions and psychotherapy are accepted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not conduct systematic , rigorous evaluations of program effectiveness , nor are the methodologies of various outdoor education programs well described and available for public dissemination . For the programs that conduct some evaluation , there are disturbingly few that use standardized testing instruments and too many rely on end-of-program written surveys as indicators of their effectiveness . <p> Further outdoor education meta-analyses would also be useful . The Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) study could be updated . In addition , meta-analytic studies of specific aspects of outdoor education programming , such as adventure therapy , would be useful . For example , a meta-analysis of adventure therapy programs could be conducted , as could a meta-analysis examining the influence of different facilitation techniques on participant outcomes . <p> Outdoor education scholars might also consider other innovative research reviewing methods . For example , a central electronic database of primary outdoor education research data could be developed to allow powerful secondary and cumulative analyses . It is no longer sufficient for outdoor education advocates to simply believe in the benefits of outdoor education , or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available tools be used in order to understand how what effects outdoor education programs have on participants and how the best possible learning experiences can be provided . <p> Marsh , P.

@@41691384 @1691384/ <h> MacKaye 's Vision for the Appalachian Trail consisted of 4 parts ... <p> The beginnings of an Appalachian trail already exist . They have been established for several years -- in various localities along the line . Specially good work in trail building has been accomplished by the Appalachian Mountain Club in the White Mountains of New Hampshire and by the Green Mountain Club in Vermont . The latter association has already built the " Long Trail " for 210 miles thorough the Green Mountains -- four fifths of the distance from the Massachusetts line to the Canadian . Here is a project that will logically be extended . What the Green Mountains are to Vermont the Appalachians are to eastern United States . What is suggested , therefore , is a " long trail " over the full length of the Appalachian skyline , from the highest peak in the north to the highest peak in the south -- from Mt . Washington to Mt . Mitchell . <p> The trail should be divided into sections , each consisting preferably of the portion lying in a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the immediate charge of a local group of people . Difficulties might arise over the use of private property -- especially that amid agricultural lands on the crossovers between ranges . It might be sometimes necessary to obtain a State franchise for the use of rights of way . These matters could readily be adjusted , provided there is sufficient local public interest in the project as a whole . The various sections should be under some sort of general federated control , but no suggestions regarding this form are made in this article . <p> Not all of the trail within a section could , of course , be built all at once . It would be a matter of several years . As far as possible the work undertaken for any one season should complete some definite usable link -- as up or across one peak . Once completed it should be immediately opened for local use and not wait on the completion of other portions . Each portion built should , of course , be rigorously maintained and not allowed to revert to disuse . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The trail could be made , at each stage of its construction , of immediate strategic value in preventing and fighting forest fires . Lookout stations could be located at intervals along the way . A forest fire service could be organized in each section which should tie in with the services with the services of the Federal and State Governments . The trail would immediately become a battle line against fire . <p> A suggestion for the location of the trail and its main branches is shown on the accompanying map . <p> 2 . Shelter Camps -- <p> These are the usual accompaniments of the trails which have been built in the White and Green Mountains . They are the trail 's equipment for use . They should be located at convenient distances so as to allow a comfortable day 's walk between each . They should be equipped always for sleeping and certain of them for serving meals -- after the function of the Swiss chalets . Strict regulation is required to assure that equipment is used and not abused . As far as possible the blazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done by volunteer workers . For volunteer " work " is really " play . " The spirit of cooperation , as usual in such enterprises , should be stimulated throughout . The enterprise should , of course , be conducted without profit . The trail must be well guarded -- against the yegg-man and against the profiteer . <p> 3 . Community Groups -- <p> These would grow naturally out of the shelter camps and inns . Each would consist of a little community on or near the trail ( perhaps on a neighboring lake ) where people could live in private domiciles . Such a community might occupy a substantial area -- perhaps a hundred acres or more . This should be bought and owned as a part of the project . No separate lots should be sold therefrom . Each camp should be a self-owning community and not a real-estate venture . The use of the separate domiciles , like all other features of the project , should be available without profit . <p> These community camps should be carefully planned in advance . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very purpose for which they are created . Greater numbers should be accommodated by more communities , not larger ones . There is room , without crowding , in the Appalachian region for a very large camping population . The location of these community camps would form a main part of the regional planning and architecture . <p> These communities would be used for various kinds of non- industrial activity . They might eventually be organized for special purposes -- for recreation , for recuperation and for study . Summer schools or seasonal field courses could be established and scientific travel courses organized and accommodated in the different communities along the trail . The community camp should become something more than a mere " playground " : it should stimulate every line of outdoor non-industrial endeavor . <p> 4 . Food and Farm Camps <p> These might not be organized at first . They would come as a later development . The farm camp is the natural supplement of the community camp . Here is the same spirit of cooperation and well ordered action the food and crops consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sown and harvested . <p> Food and farm camps could be established as special communities in adjoining valleys . Or they might be combined with the community camps with the inclusion of surrounding farm lands . Their development could provide tangible opportunity for working out by actual experiment a fundamental matter in the problem of living . It would provide one definite avenue of experiment in getting " back to the land . " It would provide an opportunity for those anxious to settle down in the country : it would open up a possible source for new , and needed , employment . Communities of this type are illustrated by the Hudson Guild Farm in New Jersey . <p> Fuelwood , logs , and lumber are other basic needs of the camps and communities along the trail . These also might be grown and forested as part of the camp activity , rather than bought in the lumber market . The nucleus of such an enterprise has already been started at Camp Tamiment , Pennsylvania , on a lake not far from the route of the proposed Appalachian trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City . They have erected a sawmill on their tract of 2000 acres and have built the bungalows of their community from their own timber . <p> Farm camps might ultimately be supplemented by permanent forest camps through the acquisition ( or lease ) of wood and timber tracts . These of course should be handled under a system of forestry so as to have a continuously growing crop of material . The object sought might be accomplished through long term timber sale contracts with the Federal Government on some of the Appalachian National Forests . Here would be another opportunity for permanent , steady , healthy employment in the open .

@@41691387 @1691387/ <h> Reliability - overview <p> Reliability is the extent to which a test is repeatable and yields consistent scores . <p> Note : In order to be valid , a test must be reliable ; but reliability does not guarantee validity . <p> All measurement procedures have the potential for error , so the aim is to minimize it . An observed test score is made up of the true score plus measurement error . <p> The goal of estimating reliability ( consistency ) is to determine how much of the variability in test scores is due to measurement error and how much is due to variability in true scores . <p> Measurement errors are essentially random : a persons test score might not reflect the true score because they were sick , hungover , anxious , in a noisy room , etc . <p> Reliability can be improved by : <p> getting repeated measurements using the same test and <p> getting many different measures using slightly different techniques and methods . <p> - e.g. Consider university assessment for grades involve several sources . You would not consider one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your knowledge of " individual differences " . Many questions are asked in many different formats ( e.g. , exam , essay , presentation ) to help provide a more reliable score . <h> Types of reliability <p> There are several types of reliability : <p> There are a number of ways to ensure that a test is reliable . Ill mention a few of them now : <h> 1 . Test-retest reliability <p> The test-retest method of estimating a test 's reliability involves administering the test to the same group of people at least twice . Then the first set of scores is correlated with the second set of scores . Correlations range between 0 ( low reliability ) and 1 ( high reliability ) ( highly unlikely they will be negative ! ) <p> Remember that change might be due to measurement error e.g if you use a tape measure to measure a room on two different days , any differences in the result is likely due to measurement error rather than a change in the room size . However , if you measure childrens reading ability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to changes in childrens reading ability . Also the actual experience of taking the test can have an impact ( called reactivity ) . History quiz - look up answers and do better next time . Also might remember original answers . <h> 2 . Alternate Forms <p> Administer Test A to a group and then administer Test B to same group . Correlation between the two scores is the estimate of the test reliability <h> 3 . Split Half reliability <p> Relationship between half the items and the other half . <h> 4 . Inter-rater Reliability <p> Compare scores given by different raters. e.g. , for important work in higher education ( e.g. , theses ) , there are multiple markers to help ensure accurate assessment by checking inter-rater reliability <h> 5 . Internal consistency <p> Internal consistence is commonly measured as Cronbach 's Alpha ( based on inter-item correlations ) - between 0 ( low ) and 1 ( high ) . The greater the number of similar items , the greater the internal consistency . That 's why you sometimes get very long scales asking a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a higher cronbachs . Generally , alpha of .80 is considered as a reasonable benchmark <p> individuals are sorted into many different categories based upon relatively small individual differences e.g. intelligence <p> Lower reliability is acceptable when ( Note : For most testing applications , reliability estimates around .70 are usually regarded as low - i.e. , 49% consistent variation ( .7 to the power of 2 ) . <p> tests are used for preliminary rather than final decisions <p> tests are used to sort people into a small number of groups based on gross individual differences e.g. height or sociability /extraversion <p> Reliability estimates of .80 or higher are typically regarded as moderate to high ( approx. 16% of the variability in test scores is attributable to error ) <p> Reliability estimates below .60 are usually regarded as unacceptably low . <p> Levels of reliability typically reported for different types of tests and measurement devices are reported in Table 7-6 : Murphy and Davidshofer ( 2001 , p.142 ) . <h> Validity <p> Validity is the extent to which a test measures what it is supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basis of experience and empirical indicators . <p> Validity asks " Is the test measuring what you think its measuring ? " <p> For example , we might define " aggression " as an act intended to cause harm to another person ( a conceptual definition ) but the operational definition might be seeing : <p> how many times a child hits a doll <p> how often a child pushes to the front of the queue <p> how many physical scraps he/she gets into in the playground . <p> Are these valid measures of aggression ? i.e. , how well does the operational definition match the conceptual definition ? <p> Remember : In order to be valid , a test must be reliable ; but reliability does not guarantee validity , i.e. it is possible to have a highly reliable test which is meaningless ( invalid ) . <p> Note that where validity coefficients are calculated , they will range between 0 ( low ) to 1 ( high ) <h> Types of Validity <h> Face validity <p> Face validity is the least important aspect of validity , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All that face validity means is : <p> " Does the measure , on the face it , seem to measure what is intended ? " <p> Sometimes researchers try to obscure a measures face validity - say , if its measuring a socially undesirable characteristic ( such as modern racism ) . But the more practical point is to be suspicious of any measures that purport to measure one thing , but seem to measure something different . e.g. , political polls - a politician 's current popularity is not necessarily a valid indicator of who is going to win an election . <h> Construct validity <p> Construct Validity is the most important kind of validity <p> If a measure has construct validity it measures what it purports to measure . <p> Establishing construct validity is a long and complex process . <p> The various qualities that contribute to construct validity include : <p> criterion validity ( includes predictive and concurrent ) <p> convergent validity <p> discriminant validity <p> To create a measure with construct validity , first define the domain of interest ( i.e. , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed which adequately measure that domain . Then a scientific process of rigorously testing and modifying the measure is undertaken . <p> Note that in psychological testing there may be a bias towards selecting items which can be objectively written down , etc. rather than other indicators of the domain of interest ( i.e. a source of invalidity ) <h> Criterion validity <p> Criterion validity consists of concurrent and predictive validity . <p> Concurrent validity : " uDoes the measure relate to other manifestations of the construct the device is supposed to be measuring ? " <h> Discriminant validity <p> Important to show that a measure does n't measure what it is n't meant to measure - i.e. it discriminates . <p> For example , discriminant validity would be evidenced by a low correlation between between a quantitative reasoning test and scores on a reading comprehension test , since reading ability is an irrelevant variable in a test designed to measure quantitative reasoning . <p> Cultural bias : does the psychological construct have the same meaning from one culture to another ; how are the different items interpreted by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be different for different cultures . <p> Gender bias may also be possible . <p> Test Bias <p> Bias in measurement occurs when the test makes systematic errors in measuring a particular characteristic or attribute e.g. many say that most IQ tests may well be valid for middle-class whites but not for blacks or other minorities . In interviews , which are a type of test , research shows that there is a bias in favour of good-looking applicants . <p> Bias in prediction occurs when the test makes systematic errors in predicting some outcome ( or criterion ) . It is often suggested that tests used in academic admissions and in personnel selection under-predict the performance of minority applicants Also a test may be useful for predicting the performance of one group e.g. males but be less accurate in predicting the performance of females . <h> Generalizability <p> Just a brief word on generalizability . Reliability and validity are often discussed separately but sometimes you will see them both referred to as aspects of generalizability . Often we want to know whether the results of a measure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other tests or other groups . <p> So , is the result you get with one test , let 's say the WISC III , equivalent to the result you would get using the Stanford-Binet ? Do both these test give a similar IQ score ? And do the results you get from the people you assessed apply to other kinds of people ? Are the results generalizable ? <p> So a test may be reliable and it may be valid but its results may not be generalizable to other tests measuring the same construct nor to populations other than the one sampled . <p> Let me give you an example . If I measured the levels of aggression of a very large random sample of children in primary schools in the ACT , I may use a scale which is perfectly reliable and a perfectly valid measure of aggression . But would my results be exactly the same had I used another equally valid and reliable measure of aggression ? Probably not , as its difficult to get a perfect measure of a construct like aggression . <p> Furthermore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , or even in Australia ? No . The demographics of the ACT are quite different from those in Australia and my sample is only truly representative of the population of primary school children in the ACT . Could I generalize my findings of levels of aggression for all 5-18 year olds in the ACT ? No . Because I 've only measured primary school children and there levels of aggression are not necessarily similar to levels of aggression shown by adolescents . <h> Standardization <p> Standardization : Standardized tests are : <p> administered under uniform conditions . i.e. no matter where , when , by whom or to whom it is given , the test is administered in a similar way . <p> scored objectively , i.e. the procedures for scoring the test are specified in detail so that ant number of trained scorers will arrive at the same score for the same set of responses .

@@41691398 @1691398/ <h> Team Building is about Discovering How People Think and Work <h> Team Building is about Discovering How People Think and Work <p> Introduction <p> Team building programmes around the world are a growing phenomena . It is a common practice for most organisations today to hold team building events at either department level or company level at least once a year . <p> One of the main reason is that most managers today believe team building events are able to bond organisation members together both horizontally ( between subordinates ) or vertically ( between managers and subordinates ) . However , what is lacking is the understanding of the concept of team building . As a result , team building events today often end up to become merely a trip to the park , a one night stay at a posh resort or an afternoon of games . The outcome has left much to be desired unless the concept of team building is well understood which is essential to maximise the benefits for the time spent . <p> Robbins and Coulter ( 1999 ) in their book " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work teams to learn how each member thinks and works " . Unfortunately , in today 's practice , the definition of team building has been misinterpreted . The key phrase here is " to learn how each member thinks and works " . <p> Team building events therefore should go beyond the idea of a " trip to the park " . They have to allow for learning about how each member of the team thinks and works in relation to the workplace . On the contrary however , most team building practitioners today are commonly using so-called team-building events to simply encourage people to work together , not learn about how each team member actually thinks and behaves . The common message carried behind the way most team-building games is " you all must learn to work as a team " . The facilitator needs to do more - they need to provide structured opportunity for helping team members learn more deeply about how each person operates in the workplace . <p> In the Malaysian context , the wrong perception of team building has come about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team building event army-style . Although the games and activities used may have been modified to suit civilians , the methodology behind the training is still very much army-styled . <p> I was in the army and I know what team building army-style is about . You are made to work as a team . If you do not , the whole team suffers . Take a point in case everyone has to fall- in sharp at 6.30am for physical training everyday . If one person is late , the rest of the platoon members will have to endure physical punishment together with him . You see , in the army , you are made to work as a team . It is a necessity to survive , it is not a choice . However , this is not true in the corporate world . Not all organisations are made in such a way that if they do n't  work as a team , the organisation will not survive . In fact , some organisations promote individualism . AT&amp;T , Ford , Motorola , Google and other large U.S.-based companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Robbins , 2001 ) . <p> Adults do not just learn to work as a team from a one or two day event . So , why do n't people just learn to work as a team by just attending a few games and activities as part a team building event ? <p> Barrier 1 . Adults are more complicated than children <p> As adults , we are much more complicated now as we have been when we were much younger . Let 's compare to when we were much younger , say 13 years old . In those days , people generally easily acquainted with classmates , worked and played with them . On average , special efforts to " learn to work with others " are unnecessary because children live and grow together . As we get older , we learn to become more sceptical of others . This is often culturally reinforced . We are no longer as nanve in our ideas about other people . Combined with the rapid shifts in workplace environments and personnel , this eventually makes it harder to work as a team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting changes and other peoples values <p> As we grow , we become more inflexible and intolerable of others . We may not accept others views and opinions and therefore , may not so easily change ourselves so that we may be able to work with others . However , we may try to compromise as we work along . Therefore , by just asking adults to work together is not the answer . Working together takes time , it takes effort . Some people may not even gel together after years of being in the same office . It does not help by asking people to work as a team ; they have to experience and understand other people 's ways of working and being in order to really believe in their capacity to find effective ways of working together . <p> Adults are able to learn things if it is applicable to them . Teach someone how to use the Personal Digital Assistant and he/she will probably learn it in a few minutes if he owns one . However , teach him how to do some mathematics problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not need to use it . If its applicable , is memorable . Therefore , adults do not need to learn to work as a team . They have already obtained the skills of working with others . There are exceptions to this of course ! If the job determines that they have to work together , they will . Therefore , it is often redundant or unnecessary to teach people how to work as a team . If they do not , simply speak , they have decided not to and they will abide with that decision . You cant teach an old dog a new trick so to speak . Therefore , team building events is not the answer to all failing teams . <p> To make team building events practical and beneficial , consider the following : <p> Solution 1 . Allow for interaction that leads to understanding <p> A trip to the park will not ' just work ' . It may promote interaction , everyone may have a good laugh , but it is not structured . The best they could probably remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be structured . You must be able to lay out your goals . At which level of interaction are they at ? To which level do you want them to interact ? Bear in mind the purpose of interaction is to create understanding , and understanding that will help each other to know where they come from and why do they act in a certain manner . Useful information could be gained e.g. the persons family background , how was s/he brought up , what are his pastimes , who are his friends . All this may just surface from the interaction , but generally needs more structured prompting . <p> Initiative games are best used to see how we behave . A problem is given to a team to solve . Each of the team members may have different ways of solving the puzzle . By allowing team members to understand why Mr. A or Mr. B and Mr. C makes certain decision will enable the team mates to understand better why Mr. A makes such decisions in the workplace . The process is crucial , not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one facilitator shouted to the team If your raft sinks will just show that you are unable to work as a team . My friends , it is not important if the raft sinks or not , most importantly , how each of them makes decision and reacted in front of the eyes of their team mates is the most important ! <p> Conclusion <p> Team building events are meant to take people away from the office and put them in an unfamiliar place . It is where people are most likely dressed informally and therefore , behave differently . At these occasions , positions in office are often forgotten and the true self thus appears . As one participant once said we tend to put down our guard and behave differently . Not only do we act differently , we say different things too . The way we act and behave out of the formal work setting is often our more true self . Team building experiences should help to show our true human nature . We may start to notice that Director A has a great sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a kind , caring soul . Knowing each others true attitude and behaviour will often change our perceptions of fellow workers . The next time you meet Director A along the office corridor , you would probably give him a cheeky smile a reminder of what happened at the team building event the other day ! <p> Team building events will therefore be more successful when there is a structured programme which will allow specific objectives to be met . Activities that allow opportunity to reveal the way we think , make decisions and react will create better and further understanding of work mates . Finally , a team building event that allow each others attitudes and behaviour to surface creates better relationships in the office . However , managers are reminded that team building does not just happen in one day or two days , it has to happen in the workplace every day and it takes time . Managers must promote interaction in the workplace among work mates to learn how each member thinks and works , to allow team building to work . This might also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role plays , profiling tests and many others . Managers need to contribute to the process rather than being hopeful for the best results from one or two team building events .

In the case of reviewing outdoor education research literature , the concern is to do with the power of the research being too low . Lipsey and Wilson ( 1993 , p. 1200 ) explain that " when alpha is set to the usual levels ( e.g. , .05 ) to limit Type I error , Type II error will be unrestrained and can range very high ( e.g. , 50%-90% ) unless sample sizes are quite large ( Schmidt , 1992 ) Becausethe null hypothesis is generally false inpsychological treatment researchand , also , sample sizes are modest , high Type II error rates will result in a larger proportion of spurious null ( statistically nonsignificant ) results in treatment research " .

The statistical power for that sample size , with alpha equal to .05 and a treatment effect of 0.47 , was 0.76 .

When the ES is below .47 , or sample size falls below 67 , the power drops off quite sharply . With ES = .20 and n = 50 , not an untypical situation in outdoor education research , the Type II error rate will be a disturbing 83% ( Lipsey &amp; Wilson , 1993 ) . Thus , for four out of every five outdoor education research studies which find report non-significant results , there may , in fact , have been positive effects of interest .

As Carl Jung ( 1934 ) put it : <p> Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts , earthquakes , landslides and inundations , modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche . <p> So , wilderness has come to refer to " states " of wilderness as experienced/defined by human beings .

" ( http : **35;139;TOOLONG ) <p> The first Outward Bound program was inspired by Dr. Kurt Hahn , a German educator , who responded to the needs of Lawrence Holt , head of the Blue Funnel Shipping Line , a merchant shipping company . <p> Holt 's problem was this -- during World War II , young merchant seaman were not surviving as well as their older counterparts in lifeboat situations , after their ships had been torpedoed by German U-boats . <p> Hahn figured he knew why -- that the younger sailors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old sailors had been brought up in an age of sail , and learnt lots of practical skills and dealt with difficult situations before , giving them more confidence and ability to cope with demanding challenges . <p> The early Outward Bound programs were conducted in Aberdovey , Wales , with sea-based theme , but also including land expeditions .

@@41691411 @1691411/ <h> Abstract <p> This article summarizes evidence from meta-analyses of outdoor education , psychotherapy , and education which can be used to help determine the relative efficacy of adventure therapy programs . The major outdoor education meta-analysis by Hattie , Marsh , Neill , and Richards ( 1997 ) cites an effect size of .34 for immediate program effectiveness . Meta-analytic studies of innovative education programs in school settings report similar effects ( Hattie , 1992 ; Hattie et al. , 1997 ) ; psychological training meta-analyses report slightly higher effects ( Lipsey &amp; Wilson , 1993 ) , and meta-analyses of psychotherapy effectiveness find stronger effects ( Casey &amp; Berman , 1985 ; Smith , Glass , &amp; Miller , 1980 ) . This article derives outcome benchmarks for adventure therapy program outcomes from existing outdoor education , psychological , and educational meta-analyses and recommends that the benchmarks be used in adventure therapy research and evaluation to allow for more accurate assessments of program 's effectiveness . The suggested benchmarks should be used as guides only and should be refined in future by meta-analyses of adventure therapy outcomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meta-analysis , benchmark <h> Introduction <p> In modern Western psychology , therapeutic interventions for dealing with psychological problems have , approximately , a 100 year history . Today , mental health professionals find themselves dealing with an increasing range and depth of psychological problems . Fortunately , mental health professionals have at their disposal an increasingly diverse and sophisticated range of intervention methodologies . Increasingly , there is also demand from stakeholders , whether consumers , workers , insurance companies , government , or the general public , that mental health interventions be accountable . In other words , bona fide interventions need to offer and deliver measurable , positive impacts on clients and society . <p> This presents a significant challenge to the relatively new field of adventure therapy . In recent years , dialogue in professional development adventure therapy settings has largely centered on important issues which deal with defining adventure therapy , creating professional networks , qualifications , training , and ethics . These have been necessary emphases , indicative of a profession in the early stages of development . A key next step for advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread research and evaluation . A critical task for this research is to establish a clear assessment of the relative efficacy of adventure therapy programs . Meaningful benchmarks need to be established with which to compare the effects of various types of adventure therapy . <p> The current article aims to summarize existing meta-analytic evidence in outdoor education , psychology , and education in order to suggest some initial benchmarks which can be used to guide assessments of the relative impact of adventure therapy programs . In the future , these benchmarks should be updated by adventure therapy meta-analyses , and possibly , by combining primary outcome data from adventure therapy research and evaluation studies into a centralized database . In addition , this line of research should incorporate , where possible , qualitative insight from clinical studies . <h> How Can We Summarize Adventure Therapy Research Findings ? <p> Getting a clear picture of the adventure therapy outcomes can be confusing because of the limited amount , variable quality , and difficult availability of adventure therapy research literature . A few sources , however , are particularly helpful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 ) has provided three well-considered , up-to-date critical reviews and the books by Gass ( 1993 ) and Davis-Berman and Berman ( 1994 ) provide probably the most significant collations and commentary on adventure therapy research and the field of adventure therapy , at least for North America . From an international perspective , the published proceedings of the first two International Adventure Therapy Conferences ( Itin , 1998 ; Richards , 2003 ) can be recommended , as can the growing range of internet resources at sites such as the Wilderness Research Center ( http : **25;176;TOOLONG ) , Adventure Therapy Web LONG ... Institute for Outdoor Leadership and Education ( http : **34;203;TOOLONG ) , and the Adventure Therapy Resources at the Outdoor Education Research and Evaluation Center ( http : **37;239;TOOLONG ) . Despite these sources , the adventure therapy field is notably undermined by a lack of well-organized , definitive , and widespread knowledge about the effectiveness of different types of adventure therapy programs . <p> Similar problems have been encountered in other , related fields . For example , the value of psychotherapy has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity . Problems associated with interpreting and summarizing many different research studies about psychotherapy led to a famous controversy . In 1961 , Hans Eysenck published a seminal article in which he concluded that psychotherapy was not effective in changing clinical outcomes in clients , a claim which he continued to reiterate ( 1985 ) . Eysenck 's 1961 article sparked intense debate because there were claims that he had been bias in the articles he chose to review . In an attempt to resolve the issue , Gene Glass ( 1976 , 1977 ) developed a technique in which he collated summary statistics ( e.g. , means , standard deviations , N , correlations ) from different psychotherapy studies into a single database , coded each study 's characteristics , and then statistically analyzed the overall outcomes and the relative influence of various independent variables ( such as gender of client , length of treatment , etc. ) on outcomes . Glass termed this procedure ' meta-analysis ' and claimed that it allowed for a more objective overview of quantitative data from many studies . Contrary to Eysenck 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 ) meta-analysis found that psychotherapy , on average , had a moderately strong effect on clients ' therapeutic outcomes ( .68 standard deviations ) , akin to a 30% improvement in the measured outcomes . <p> Since 1980 , meta-analysis has been used widely in medicine , psychology , and education , proving to be a powerful research summary tool , particularly in relation to understanding the effectiveness of treatments and interventions . While there has yet to be a major meta-analysis of adventure therapy outcomes , there have been four key meta-analyses of outdoor education programs ( Cason &amp; Gillis , 1994 ; Hans , 1997 ; 2000 ; Hattie , et al , 1997 ; Marsh , 1999 ) ; innovative education in classrooms for affective outcomes ( Hattie et al. , 1997 ) ; and psychotherapeutic and psychological intervention research ( Casey &amp; Berman , 1985 ; Lipsey &amp; Wilson , 1993 ; Smith , et al. , 1980 ) . The current article summarizes the results of these meta-analyses and thus proposes some initial benchmarks that can be used in future adventure therapy research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meta-analyses report results in terms of ' effect sizes ' ( ESs ) . In outcome studies , an ES is a measure of how much difference there is between measures of clients ' well-being at two different points in time . Typically , the key ES of interest indicates the difference between measures before and after an intervention . It is also of interest to see whether there is maintenance , ongoing growth , or loss of any immediate or short-term change . <p> In statistical terms , an ES is the mean difference expressed in standard deviation units . An ES of zero indicates no change , a negative ES means a reduction in an outcome , and a positive ES generally refers to an improvement in an outcome measure . Various other interpretations of ESs have been suggested . For example , according to Wolf ( 1986 ) an ES of .50 represents a practical or clinically significant change while .25 is an educationally significant change . Cohen ( 1977 ) provided the most widely accepted guideline , suggesting that .2 is small , .5 is moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be avoided , and that in order to interpret a particular ES it is necessary to compare the result with closely related effect sizes . It should also be noted that a small ES can be very impressive if , for example , the outcome is difficult to change ( e.g. , a dysfunctional behavior ) or if the outcome is highly valued ( e.g. , recidivism ) . On the other hand , a large ES does not necessarily mean that there is therapeutic value in the change , particularly if it is not related to the aims of the treatment ( e.g. , religious orientation or physical fitness ) . <p> It is also important to emphasize that program outcomes should not be compared against zero , no change . It makes more sense to compare program outcomes with minimum acceptable outcomes or other internally or externally established benchmarks . Benchmark comparisons can provide valuable diagnostic information about intervention strengths and weaknesses and help stakeholders to make informed decisions . <p> The outdoor education meta-analytic studies represent results from approximately 12,000 participants and indicate small to medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on typically measured outcomes such as changes in self-concept , self-confidence and locus of control . According to Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) , these effects seem to increase even further over followup periods of up to 18 months , but no other meta-analyses provide comparable followup results . Despite these promising overall outcomes , there is wide variability , with ESs varying substantially between different types of outdoor education programs ( Hattie , et al . ) . For example , only a small immediate effect of .17 ( for 416 effects ) was found for non-Outward Bound Australia research studies . The most effective outdoor education programs were those which where longer , involved adult-age participants , and were conducted by particular organizations , such as Outward Bound . Thus , the meta-analytic outdoor education results caution against blanket claims about the effectiveness of outdoor education and adventure therapy programs . Instead , they suggest promising potential and encourage closer analysis of particular types of adventure-based programming . <p> It is possible to derive from outdoor education meta-analyses categories of reporting ( i.e. , particular types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly pertain to adventure therapy programs . Such results are presented in Table 2 . According to the adventure therapy results in Table 2 , the overall adventure therapy effects appear to be positive and ongoing . Whilst adventure therapy outcomes appear to be stronger than for outdoor education , they are not nearly as strong as for individual psychotherapy ( compare Table 2 with Table 1 ) . This suggests that there is considerable room for developing more effective adventure therapeutic practices and achieving strong outcomes more consistently . <p> An exceptional ES ( 1.05 ) was reported for ' clinical scales ' used with adolescents ( 12 effects ; see Table 2 ; Cason &amp; Gillis , 1994 ) . The studies which contributed to this overall high ES are worthy of closer investigation . Cason and Gillis do not provide identifiable referencing for these studies but they explain that the majority of the high ESs for clinical scales emerged from studies with residential populations in treatment centers or adjudicated youth in alternative correctional placements . In these residential settings , participants are more likely to experience adventure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to contribute to more emotionally intense experience and stronger outcomes ( Cason &amp; Gillis ) . This claim would seem to be supported by the Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) meta-analysis results in which short-term outdoor education program effects were similar for delinquent ( .33 ) and normal ( .35 ) participants , but during the follow-up period were stronger for delinquents ( .32 ) than for other outdoor education participants ( .14 ) . However , some caution should be applied to avoid over-interpreting these comparisons between ' normal ' and ' delinquent ' groups . Adventure therapy participants are likely to start lower on psychological measurement scales and thus have greater ' regression to the mean ' effects and more statistical ' room for growth ' . <p> Other useful comparative ESs for adventure therapy outcomes can be drawn from Smith and al . ' s ( 1980 ) meta-analysis of adult psychotherapy outcomes ( .68 ) and Casey and Berman 's ( 1985 ) meta-analysis of child psychotherapy outcomes ( .71 ) ( see Table 1 ) . It should be remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic work conducted by trained therapists in periodic session-based intervention regimens . <p> Lipsey and Wilson ( 1993 ) report a more moderate , but still impressive ES for psychological change and training programs ( ES = .47 ) , based on summarizing 156 meta-analyses , with over one million participants . Such a comprehensively derived ES could be a very useful general benchmark for evaluation purposes in adventure therapy . Ideally , however , adventure therapy researchers and program evaluators should utilize the breakdowns of specific outcome categories reported by psychotherapy meta-analyses and the psychological intervention meta-analyses ( Casey &amp; Berman , 1985 ; Lipsey &amp; Wilson , 1993 ; Smith et al. , 1980 ) and then develop specific benchmarks appropriate to their particularly program and client group . <h> Limitations of Meta-analysis <p> While meta-analysis offers a more systematic way of reviewing research findings than traditional literature reviews , there are several limitations to be borne in mind . First , meta-analysis can only report on areas in which there have already been several primary research studies conducted . Thus , a meta-analysis reflects the existing scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where research is yet to be conducted . A second issue is that in order to be included in a meta-analysis , a study must report sufficient descriptive statistics ( M , SD and N ) , which has not always been the case , particularly in low quality adventure therapy research studies . <p> A further important caution is that the published literature may not accurately represent actual adventure therapy programming . For example , a recent survey of outdoor education programs found that only 7% of programs used standardized outcome measures ( Richards , Neill , &amp; Butters , 1997 ) . Of these 7% , an even smaller percentage have their results published . Thus , the published data probably emerges from less than 1% of existing programs and may lack representativeness . It is also well known that journals are more likely to publish statistically significant results . A weakness of meta-analysis , then , is that it may unwittingly contribute to overestimating adventure therapy program effectiveness . Readers are cautioned against possible misuse of the available statistics . The available results should be used as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Conclusions <p> Gillis ( 1992 ) recommended that " someone needs to conduct a meta-analysis of therapeutic aspects of **38;278;TOOLONG that includes the criteria of clinical significance along with traditional methods of effect size " ( p.7 ) . Four years later , Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) made two further key points that the field of adventure therapy needs to create a collective document that addresses its effectiveness and that clinically significant events of adventure therapy need to be examined through a massive survey of consumers . In other words , Gillis has called for major quantitative and qualitative research studies to be conducted across the field of adventure therapy . Building on these suggestions , a proposed agenda for future adventure therapy research could be to conduct : ( a ) meta-analytic investigations of specific aspects of adventure therapy programming ; ( b ) good quality and well disseminated program evaluations which utilize meta-analytic outcomes as benchmarks ; ( c ) innovative , large-scale qualitative investigations which identify and seek to be better understand clinically significant moments and processes which occur in adventure therapy programs ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure therapy outcomes online database . <p> Integral to conducting good quality research and program evaluation studies is the development of purpose-built , multidimensional evaluation tools which are rigorously developed using the best available psychometric techniques ( e.g. , see Ewert &amp; Sibthorp , 2001 ) . This is the current expectation in educational and psychological research and adventure therapy researchers should strive for no less . To date , the adventure therapy profession is yet to develop or incorporate into its work an appropriate suite of clinical outcome measurement tools . In the absence of specific adventure therapy tools , researchers should be considering well-developed and readily available mental health instruments , such as the General Well-Being instrument which assesses positive and negative aspects of reported mental distress and well-being ( Heubeck &amp; Neill , 2000 ; Veit &amp; Ware , 1983 ) and the Youth Outcomes Questionnaire used in Keith Russell 's investigations of outdoor behavioral healthcare program outcomes ( Russell , 2001 ; 2002 ) . <p> &gt;In the twenty-first century , the specter of accountability will continue to grow . Thus , for the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program evaluation practices are required . Benchmarks derived from meta-analysis offer a systematic way to categorize and evaluate outcomes . A comparison of a program 's ESs with appropriate meta-analytic benchmarks can provide useful diagnostic information about the program 's relative efficacy . <p> LONG ... It is recommended that every adventure therapy program examine its program evaluation methods to ensure that the most up-to-date and valid methods of comparison are being used . To be doing anything less borders on professional malpractice . Adventure education and therapy organizations have now generally accepted that financial and safety auditing is part of successful program management , but educational or therapeutic auditing is far from fully embraced . <p> The initial benchmarks suggested in this article are necessarily rough ( .4 ) and should be revised and expanded as new evidence becomes available . It is important that quantitative adventure therapy research and evaluation studies endeavor to report breakdowns of results in terms of programming factors such as client problem(s) , intervention length , sequencing of activities , facilitation style , and so on . By doing so , we can better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can provide more insightful analyses of the extent to which adventure therapy outcomes are influenced by various programming and facilitation factors . <p> In the twenty-first century , it is possible to apply innovative research methods to fuel the professional growth of new fields such as adventure therapy . For example , a central electronic clearinghouse of adventure therapy research and evaluation studies , and outcome data could be developed . Such innovative efforts to integrate knowledge and practice could be the difference between adventure therapy remaining as a fringe method for psychological treatment or being developed into genuinely effective methods for the alleviation and treatment of psychological problems .

We commonly use the term " slow " , for example , to describe people who perform poorly at school , or " quick " to describe those who are efficient at solving mental problems . <p> In more modern terms , the basic premise is that the speed at which we process thought can explain why one individual is more intelligent than another . <h> Are intelligent people faster at retrieving and processing information ? <p> So , are intelligent people faster at retrieving and processing information ? <p> Evidence for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between IQ and : <p> inspection time : speed of intake of perceptual ( stimulus ) .

Anderson ( 1992 ) however also argues that there is more to intelligence than speed of processing ( p. 13 ) . It is also to do with higher levels of knowledge which are acquired through the low-level components ( such as processing speed ) . In other words this low-level functioning limits the higher level capacities . <p> Further to this , Anderson proposes that it is specificity and individual differences in types of knowledge which subsequently leads to the specific abilities such as those identified by Gardener .

@@41691421 @1691421/ <h> Major Themes &amp; Assumptions of Psychoanalytic Theory <p> Last updated : 21 Sep 2003 <p> Firstly , it is important to understand that psychoanalytic theory was not designed as a personality theory per se . Rather , it was the first major , coherent , psychological theory . Psychoanalytic is broad in scope and offered unique , controversial insights into how the human mind worked . In addition , psychoanalytic theory provided a new approach to psychotherapy , thus it provided new treatment techniques for psychological problems that had previously puzzled doctors and others . Unlike other personality theories , the psychoanalytic theory is relatively cohesive ( e.g. , the Biological Theory consists of many different , separate ideas , models and theories ) . This approach to personality takes up the challenge of explaining what is going on when what is going on is difficult to understand . <p> The main thrusts of the psychoanalytic perspective on personality are that : <p> Psychic energy is needed to make the mind go &amp; the energy ( motivation ) can not be destroyed , it must be expressed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind needs some kind of energy to make it go . This energy is used in psychological work such as planning , thinking , feeling , remembering . The psychic energy is thought to come from 2 main drives : Eros ( or libido , the life and sexual instincts ) and Thanatos ( death instinct ) . The thinking is that at any time there is only a finite amount of energy available and if its busily being used say to repress memories , and deal with anxieties , then its not being used fruitfully . If the neuroses can be resolved , then the psychic energy can be freed to use more creatively and productively . <p> Psychic Determinism : Everything that happens in a persons mind and everything a person does has a specific , identifiable cause i.e. psychic determinism . Psychoanalysis has no room for miracles , accidents or free will . All seeming contradictions of mind and behaviour can be resolved : nothing is accidental , e.g. , it is not accidental when you forget someones name , drop something , say one thing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hidden causes out , bring them into conscious awareness , and through this insight , the cause can be resolved . <p> Humans have base instincts ( unconscious urges ) : In Freudian psychology , the unconscious is extremely important in determining behaviour . This is a pervasive theme of the approach : that a lot of desires , motivations and conflicts are seething below the surface , below the level of consciousness . Freud believed that people are driven , fundamentally , by unconscious , animalistic , instinctual urges , particularly lust ( eros ) and aggression ( thanatos ) . These urges are often in conflict with the demands of society . For example , humans desire pleasure , but society places limits on the kinds of pleasure-seeking which it deems acceptable . Freud emphasizes the extent to which humans are motivated by psychosexual pleasure . <p> Topography of the psyche ( unconscious , pre-conscious , conscious ) : Using an iceberg metaphor , the unconscious is understood to be the large part of the mind , which is hidden from view . The pre-conscious is represented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which there are fleeting glimpses of the unconscious , " flickering " across the screen of consciousness . Finally , the relatively small part of the iceberg which sticks of the water is seen as equivalent to the small amount of conscious awareness that the human experiences . Freud also believed that if there was information that was too painful for the conscious part to bear , that defense mechanisms would act to push it down it into the unconscious part of the mind . <p> Structure of Mind ( I 'd , Ego , Superego ) : The mind has an internal structure -- three parts with separate motivations : I 'd ( irrational and emotional part of the mind ) ; the Ego ( rational part ) ; and the Superego ( the moral part ) . <p> The Way Psychic Conflicts are Resolved Shapes Personality : Personality characteristics are determined by the way in which a person learns to resolve unconscious conflicts amongst the I 'd , Ego &amp; Superego . This evolves from how people handle several psychosexual stages during childhood . Personality is very strongly influenced by early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of early childhood experiences . People 's I 'd , Ego and Superego develop characteristic patterns of interaction which for them resolve the urges for psychosexual pleasures . However , in some people , a psychosexual stage may not be effectively resolved and this leads to adult personalities characterized being " stuck " at a particular psychosexual stage ( e.g. , anally retentive or anally expulsive if the 2nd psychosexual stage " anal " ( learning how to " let go " of faeces ) ) is not resolved , depending on which of the I 'd , Ego , and Superego becomes more dominant . The quality of a person 's mental health was seen as determined by the extent to which psychic conflicts had been effectively resolved . If the forces of mind are in balance , according to Freud , then good psychological health ensued . Personality is viewed as a dynamic set of process which are always in motion i.e. psychodynamic . Because of the dynamism , it is possible for an adult personality characteristic to be altered quite dramatically through therapeutic ( psychodynamic ) insight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Shield Our Psyche 's from the Pain : Psychological defenses are proposed as important aspects of human functioning . Because of human 's desire for pleasure ( note , they also have destructive instincts ) , life is essentially too painful for the human being to endure consciously , therefore much of the pain and conflict is diverted via defence mechanisms and kept within the unconscious . It is within the hidden unconscious that much of the conflict takes place , and these conflicts in the unconscious mind are seen as the root of behavior and conscious experience . Apparently paradoxical or irrational behaviors can be accounted for by these inner conflicts , i.e. , psychic determinism . <p> Unconscious Leaks Into Conscious Awareness via dreams , slips of the tongue , psychosomatic symptoms , and so on : The unconscious is dynamic , and the psychic energy must go somewhere , plus there is psychic determinism . In other words , whilst the unconscious conflicts may be largely kept from conscious awareness , they still significantly influence behaviors , psychosomatics , plus leak into the preconscious . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Therapeutic relief can be effected by helping a person to bring underlying conflicts , often related to past negative learning experiences during critical psychosexual stages . To the extent that insight and understanding can be achieved , and a person can resolve many psychological problems . Note that the therapeutic emphasis on the role and value of achieving " self-insight " is a notion later explored by humanistic psychology . Psychoanalytic therapy was the first " talk therapy " -- it was noticed for the first time formally in psychology that talking about it helps ! Psychotherapy may also use project assessment techniques , such as the Rorschach Inkblot Test .

For each stage , there can be two extremes in psychological reaction - either doing too much or not enough of what is ideal . <p> An adult character type : in the first three stages this adult character type is one that is related to being fixated or stuck at that stage .

@@41691442 @1691442/ <h> Introduction to Individual Differences <p> Last updated : 31 Mar 2007 <p> Individual differences is a cornerstone subject area in modern psychology . In many ways , it is the " classic " psychology that the general public refers to - it refers the psychology of the person - the psychological differences between people and their similarities . <p> " No two persons are born exactly alike ; but each differs from the other in natural endowments , one being suited for one occupation and the other for another . " <p> Individual difference psychology examines how people are similar and how they differ in their thinking , feeling and behaviour . No two people are alike , yet no two people are unlike . So , in the study of individual differences we strive to understand ways in which people are psychologically similar and particularly what psychological characteristics vary between people . <p> In the Western psychology approach to individual differences , it is generally assumed that : <p> People vary on a range of psychological attributes <p> It is possible to measure and study these individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour and performance <p> We can classify people psychologically , according to their intelligence and personality characteristics , for example , with moderate success , however people are complex and much is still left unexplained . There are multiple and often conflicting theories and evidence about individual difference psychology . <p> Human beings have been aware of individual differences throughout history , e.g. <p> Gender differences -hunters=men , gatherers=women <p> Intelligence differences - caste , class , education , etc . <p> Personality differences - job specialisations <h> Early study of individual differences <p> We have come a long way since Franz Gall invented phrenology in the early 1800s . Phrenology is the study of an individual 's bumps on the skull , which supposedly reveal character traits and mental abilities . <p> Phrenology had such vogue that by 1832 there were 29 phrenological societies in Britain and many journals in both the UK and US devoted to the study of phrenology . It was seriously proposed to select Members of Parliament from their " bumps " . Some phrenologists even moulded children 's heads to accentuate good qualities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of its assumptions holds true : the idea that various brain regions have particular functions . <p> Darwin suggested that nature selects successful traits through the " survival of the fittest " . His cousin , Sir Francis Galton ( 1822-1911 ) concluded that he could apply the principle scientifically . Why not measure human traits and then selectively breed superior people ? He assumed human traits , everything from height and beauty to intelligence and ability , to personality traits such as even-temperedness , were inherited . <p> Modern psychology has formalised the study of individual differences over the last 100 years . Individual differences psychology is still a young science and a relatively recent development in modern psychology . There are still many debates and issues . Current knowledge will change and evolve . So , have an open-minded , but critical perspective as we go along ! <p> Since there are multiple and controversial viewpoints , it is necessary to move beyond reliance on personally preferred viewpoints to also embrace alternative perspectives , particularly those which are utilized in psychological practice and which have solid research support .

However , this could be because adult programs tend to operate with motivated volunteers , whereas youth programs more often involve an element of compulsion by parents or teachers . <h> Organizational Philosophy &amp; Culture <p> The programs ' philosophy and culture give rise to everything else ; staffing , program design , recruitment , communication with participants , etc. ; program quality ultimately stems from the official and implicit reality and professionalism of the operating organization ; Does the program have a strong philosophy focusing on development of the desired goals ? And does the program culture set up strong expectations of success in reaching the desired goals ? .

At least that 's my conclusion from having read and researched outdoor outcomes and related program outcomes over the last 10 years . For the citations , on this , go to the more indepth summaries and papers . Some extra points to add : <p> Although the relationship between length of program and effect is significant and positive , it still only appears to be a relatively small effect . Thus , length along is no guarantee for success , and is it is possible for a short program to effect substantial , lasting change . <p> The relationship between length of program and size of effect is likely to follow a decay curve - i.e. , the benefits of going from one day to two days will be much larger than the benefits of going from six to seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of going from 21 to 22 days . <p> There may be a weak relationship between length and effects because of grossness in assessing length . Length at the lower ends can also be measured in number of hours of treatment , or number of hours of active treatment ( do we count being asleep for example ? ) . Also , increasingly programs are moving towards intermittent treatment and it is difficult to clearly measure of establish the actual meaning of " length " . <p> The relationship may also be weak because instructors and participants have a gestalt tendency to treat any program as a whole program , regardless of the number of days . To the extent that we are influenced by " hero myths " or " stage theories " of change , then we can appreciate that the entire cycle will be fitted by a good instructor into a program , regardless of the number of days .

For Dewey , the long-term matters , but so does the short-term quality of an educational experience . Educators are responsible , therefore , for providing students with experiences that are immediately valuable and which better enable the students to contribute to society . <p> Dewey criticizes traditional education for lacking in holistic understanding of students and designing curricula overly focused on content rather than content and process which is judged by its contribution to the well-being of individuals and society . <p> On the other hand , progressive education , he argues , is too reactionary and takes a free approach without really knowing how or why freedom can be most useful in education .

For example , my experience of a lesson , will depend on how the teacher arranges and facilitates the lesson , as well my past experience of similar lessons and teachers . <p> It is important to understand that , for Dewey , no experience has pre-ordained value . Thus , what may be a rewarding experience for one person , could be a detrimental experience for another . <p> The value of the experience is to be judged by the effect that experience has on the individual 's present , their future , and the extent to which the individual is able to contribute to society . <p> Dewey says that once we have a theory of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject matter in a way that it takes accounts of students ' past experiences , and then provides them with experiences which will help to open up , rather than shut down , a person 's access to future growth experiences , thereby expanding the person 's likely contribution to society . <p> Dewey examines his theory of experience in light of practical educational problems , such as the debate between how much freedom vs. discipline to use . Dewey shows that his theory of experience ( continuity and interaction ) can be useful guides to help solving such issues . <p> Throughout , there is a strong emphasis on the subjective quality of a student 's experience and the necessity for the teacher of understanding the students ' past experiences in order to effectively design a sequence of liberating educational experiences to allow the person to fulfil their potential as a member of society . 
@@41691448 @1691448/ <p> Based on the work of these previous authors , Priest proposed what he termed the " Adventure Experience Paradigm " ( AEP ) .

Resilience is also exemplified in war , sport , psychological battles of the mind , and other triumphs of the human spirit . <p> I ask not for good health , but for an alert and discerning mind . I ask not that things go my way , but that I have perseverance and courage . I ask not for less responsibility , but for increased strength . - Master Cheng Yen , Tzu Chi <p> Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem about the qualities of a resilient person , called If . Perhaps the central line which captures resilience is : <p> If you can keep your head about you , when all are losing theirs ... <p> There is also a famous anecdote attributed to Buddha , which captures the essence of resilience : <p> A man travelling across a field encountered a tiger .

( Reps , 1971 , p. 32 ) <p> Resilience is that quality which lays the foundation for and gives rise to the triumph ( albeit temporary ) of the human spirit .

@@41691450 @1691450/ <h> Practical Psychological Aspects <h> Psychological Theory &amp; Outdoor Education <p> A wide range of psychological theories can be utilized to explain outdoor education processes and outcomes . Some of these theories are briefly outlined : <h> Physical Fitness <p> At their most basic level , outdoor education programs are physical . For example , gains in participants mobility and fitness levels arguably occurs and contributes to overall psychological well-being . <h> Stress &amp; Arousal ( e.g. , King , Stanley , &amp; Burrows ) <p> Outdoor education programs often put participants in situations that challenge them physically , emotionally , mentally and socially . The nature of this arousal has been studied both physiologically and psychologically ( Work by Camille Bunting ; Van Gelder , Richards &amp; Neill , 1992 ; Wilde , 1994 ) . <p> When faced with challenging situations , participants cope in different ways , some of which are effective , some of which are ineffective or even destructive . The immediate feedback provided by the environment , group and practical situations can help outdoor education participants to develop more effective coping strategies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Neill , and Richards ( 1997 ) as one of the key possible theoretical factors in the notably positive meta-analysis results for the effects of adventure education programs . <p> Resilience refers to one 's capacity to withstand stressors without going under . In fact , a highly resilient person may actually thrive on problems , seeing them instead as opportunities . Outdoor education philosophy , perhaps best exemplified in the work of Kurt Hahn , strongly promotes the idea that tough outdoor experiences are valuable for " toughening " people up and developing a greater ability to deal with real-world challenges . <h> Self-Concept ( Shavelson ; Marsh ; Hattie ; Neill , 1994 ) <p> Self-concept enhancement has been understood as a major aim of many outdoor education programs , such as Outward Bound . While overall enhancement of self-concept is achieved , it has also been shown that there are specific and predictable differential gains in different dimensions of self-concept ( Marsh , Richards and Barnes , 1986a , b ; Neill &amp; Heubeck ( in progress ) ) , an area worthy of further investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a model for enhancing achievement motivation has used to structure aspects of outdoor education programs . Outdoor education programs often aim to enhance participants motivation to achieve . <h> Self-Efficacy ( Bandura ; Parle , 1983 ) <p> Self-efficacy refers to a person 's belief in his ability to successfully do things . Bandura , the key self-efficacy , argues that this cognitive belief has a strong relationship to actual performance . Enhancement of self-efficacy should arise when actual skills are developed , but it may also be useful to directly foster a positive belief about personal capability . <p> Locus of Control refers to the extent that a person believes he/she has personal control and responsibility over the events of his/her life and the larger events around him/her . Several studies have been conducted examining the effects of outdoor education programs on participants Locus of Control . In general , there are substantial shifts towards a more internal Locus of Control . Outward Bound programs , for example , have been shown to produce a more internal locus of control in participants ( Marsh , Richards &amp; Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tended to adopt Kolbs experiential learning cycle to structure and facilitate many activities . Difficult goals are set , action and experience takes place , feedback is given and performance is reviewed , then new plans are made for improved performance . <p> Most outdoor education programs are group-based experiences . The dynamics of group interaction and group development are fundamental to the achievement of outdoor education aims and to nature of personal experiences in outdoor education programs . <h> Self-Categorization Theory ( Turner ; Morrison , 1995 ) <p> Changes in self-perception are intimately related to the perceived norms , values and identity of the social groups one belongs to . Outdoor education programs are like entering a new culture which leads to the formation and development of unique group values and norms that in turn influence the self-perceptions of group members . <h> Remedial &amp; Recidivism ( Marsh &amp; Richards , 1986 ) <p> Outdoor-based education programs have been shown to achieve positive remedial effects on low academic performers ( Richards &amp; Richards , 1981 ) .

@@41691464 @1691464/ <h> Can the Mountains Speak for Themselves ? <p> Thomas James <p> Colorado Outward Bound School <p> 1980 <p> Several years ago , a course director named Rustie Baillie coined the phrase , " Let the mountains speak for themselves " . He was reacting against pressures in the Colorado Outward Bound School to verbalize student experience on courses and to use counseling techniques to manage the group process of patrols . Baillie was not the first to react . In interviewing staff and trustees from the early years of Outward Bound in this country , I discovered that the issue was as vehemently debated then as it is today . In fact , the debate began right after the first season in 1962 when there was a falling out about whether to instill an " intellectual element " in courses , and since then there have been plenty of historical examples of the rift . In 1964 the school director required nightly staff debriefings on the meaning of each days activities in the base camp at Marble , and one staff member of those years told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on the six-day alpine expedition . In 1966 the chief climbing instructor tried to introduce a written guide to counseling techniques . In 1967 or so there started to be readings and other written materials available for use in the field . By the next year there was an outline to help foster spiritual awareness . <p> In the years since then there have been other examples of the urge to intensify the counseling , teaching and therapeutic aspects of working for Outward Bound . For those who were not sympathetic it was all cant and crud they had to clear away to run a straightforward Outward Bound course . For those who were sympathetic , the schools support for this kind of skill was not anywhere near adequate . Many felt , and still feel today , that there would have to be a great expansion of human relations techniques in Outward Bound before the program could offer its students personal growth that would transfer to their lives back home . <p> The issue has been around long enough to make me conclude that it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Outward Bound and will never go away . At the risk of offending many people who have strong feelings and a lot of their own lives wrapped up in the issue , I am going to summarize a few perspectives that I have heard or witnessed . I will add a couple of thoughts of my own , for whatever they might be worth to others . Finally , I will sum up the issue in a way that I hope will be conducive to further discussion among staff . The purpose of this paper is not to fix one point of view as right and good . It is merely to give others some tools for thinking about their own roles as Outward Bound instructors . I hope my thoughts will be a stimulus to continue the discussion wherever it may lead , not to end it or demand a certain outcome . <p> To begin with , it seems to me that the people who are saying anything equivalent to " Let the mountains speak for themselves " are also saying something more , which is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bound course to give their students a good experience . They can rely on a training sequence , a way of grouping students and committing them to task performance , activities like solo and the rappel etc . In an evening discussion on Kurt Hahn last winter , course director Chris Brown put it well when he said that no matter what else might be added on , he always comes back to the tried and true activity structure of the course . The rappel works ; the expedition teaches ; solo asks the questions that need to be asked . <p> So the point is not exactly that the mountains do the teaching . It is that the training sequence we are using is a remarkably effective way to help people to learn in the mountains . When it is applied in a straightforward way , then the mountains , which we might as well translate to mean " Necessity " or " Natural Process " , do in fact teach their valuable lessons to all who are willing to make the effort . <p> This is what Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said that " a patrols experiences need relatively little instructor facilitation in the realm of an intensive twenty-two day mountain expedition " . The experience happens naturally if instructors are skilled enough to take their students safely through the adventurous activities that make up Outward Bound , and when they do that , the mountains are extraordinary teachers indeed . From what I have been able to gather as a newcomer to Outward Bound , this is what the British instructors have generally represented in the Outward Bound movement in America : strong , taciturn , no-nonsense mountaineers who look like the type who have saved lives and mastered impossible situations , but who would never want to make a big deal about it . They want students to know by experience . They want to keep other activities and " head trips " from hampering the direct experience of mountain wilderness , teacher extraordinaire . <p> Having said that much - and I think it is obvious that much more could be said - I want to add only two points about this perspective . To begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an activity that requires a high degree of consciousness and self-scrutiny . The same is true , I believe , of river running . Sometimes it is tempting for educators and psychological buffs to depict the action side of Outward Bound as devoid of reflection , when in fact that life of actions is often composed of mental activity of the most significant kind . As I see it , the so-called " rock jocks " are not pushing a low-consciousness activity . From an educational standpoint , I would interpret their point of view to be saying that the learning that takes place naturally and integrally on an Outward Bound course does not need elaborate verbalization and testing in a controlled group process in order to be conscious , useful and transferable . <p> On the negative side , letting the mountains speak for themselves means that the staff may be transmitting little culture and few values other than those of mountain living and expeditions . There is a danger , cited by a staff member in another Outward Bound school a few years ago , that this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and this is the life . " The lesson then would be one of self-absorption : " We are a strong , beautiful , alienated elite that treasures above all else this lifestyle and these awesome mountains . Do n't  you want to be like us ? " I am putting the argument in an extreme form to make a point . There may not be a single person in the whole Outward Bound movement who exemplifies the extreme . But there can not help be some tendency that way in anyone who loves the mountains and is young . Moreover , in a program in which formal ideology is to teach through the mountains and not for them , any instructor worth his/her salt is going to assume that you have to do a lot of teaching for before you have a safe and adventurous context to teach through . Yet , if the learning ends at mountain living , then is it not at least debatable whether the life-stylist may have given their students short shrift ? <p> Usually during the past year when I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock-jocks " ( or some more or less derogatory phrase ) on one side and " touchy feelies " on the other . I hope I have said enough about the former so that anyone who is not sympathetic to them will take a fresh look at their point of view , perhaps seeing in a new light the excellences and depths of human response that they are capable of bringing to an Outward Bound course . Similarly , I hope that what I am about to say on the other side will give pause to those who are intent on letting the mountains speak for themselves , a pause long enough to consider why some people might want to explore other possibilities on a course . One surprising discovery I made this year while researching the history of the Colorado Outward Bound school was that student impressions of courses are remarkably consistent even where different styles of instruction were involved . It seems that all kinds of instructors can impel students into a good Outward Bound experience . This suggests to me that no one has a corner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the differences do not represent conflict so much as they reflect creativity . What this says to me is that no one stands to lose from greater communication and a wider range of sympathies . <p> So why do some people want to spend more time verbalising the experiences of students on an Outward Bound course ? If we ask this question , we might as well also ask another one : Why has this school , which was originally staffed mostly by mountaineers and ex-military men , drawn so many educators and social worker types since the mid-1960s ? The answer to the latter question is that these people have found an intensity of learning and being in Outward Bound that usually does not exist in conventional institutions . Isnt this what has brought us all to Outward Bound ? But they also look for a connection between that intensity and the life to which students return . This is really what is meant by teaching through the mountains and not for them . And this is why , in the model developed by Vic Walsh and Jerry Golins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to explain the learning process of Outward Bound , they say that the outcome of the stress , challenge and mastery in an unfamiliar environment should be to reorient the meaning and direction of the learners life experience . Direct experience is the key , but there must be some way to help the student beyond immediate consumption of experiences to the greater challenges of improving their lives back home . The usual label is " transference " , helping students to transfer their newfound competence and confidence back to an environment that may not sustain them so excitingly as Outward Bound did . <p> The people who talk about education and personal growth and group process are not denying that challenge and adventure are the bedrock of Outward Bound . They are not seeking verbalization and reflections instead of action , but in addition to action , as an enhancement and not as a substitute . Now , as I did with other perspectives , I 'd like to make only two additional points here , one positive and one negative , though of course there is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On the positive side , the verbalising point of view is sensible because it reflects the way most people go about learning and making changes in their lives . I will first say what I mean by this in the abstract ; then I will describe how it might appear on a course in the field . In the abstract ( and please bear with me if you are not sympathetic to this kind of talk about Outward Bound ) , educators are apt to follow John Deweys notion that the challenge of any form of education is to select present experiences that will live fruitfully and creatively in future experience . Few would disagree with this . Dewey , who was probably the greatest educational thinker ever produced in this country , wrote of learning as an experiential continuum , a continuity of growth experiences . But here is where the disagreement begins , because he characterized learning not as the experience itself , but as thinking about experience . So a form of education like Outward Bound that provides intense experiences also needs to provide tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened on a course into the experiential continuum of those who have passed through it . Another equally abstract way of saying this comes from social scientists who have studied learning behaviour and concluded that the experience of the learner must be generalized into the learners repertoire of skills and knowledge . Students need help to draw inferences , to see the pattern that connects their continuous experience . And this is precisely why we have schools , even those as informal and far-flung as the Colorado Outward Bound School . <p> In a less abstract vein , the process of thinking about experience does n't  have to be either a church social or a Mazola party . It can be as integral to the experiences as is skills instruction , if handled skillfully It might be only a well-placed word here or there on a course , some perspective on nutrition or safety or physical exercise , a sincere but non-judgmental suggestion of the possibilities back home , perhaps just an openness to someone who is thinking out loud about the past - and beyond this , some knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their experience . This could be as simple as an initiative game or as elaborate as an intensive journal , depending on the circumstances . It could be a chat about energy use while doing the dishes or a nightlong rap on philosophy and previous lives around glowing embers . As in the teaching of skills , it is crucial to maintain the pace and authenticity of the experience , not interrupting adventure with contrived interactions . But the process of thinking about experiences does not have to be contrived , though I suspect it does require more energy from instructors than they would have to put out for a straightforward expedition with no extras . <p> Much of what the educators and personal growth advocates are talking about is remarkably similar to what all instructors are trying to do in their own way . In a recent paper on working with small groups , Candice Chrislip described it as helping student " to isolate a particular success on the course , to identify the process they went through , and to make this success available to them as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bias in that direction because I am an educator in my own values , I still would find it hard to argue on any ground that her statement was not central to Outward Bound . And the more tools we have for carrying it out , the better . <p> On the negative side , it may be pretentious to expect that Outward Bound can do any more than give its students what course director Ron Gager has called a " short-term turn-on " . The standard course is only twenty-three days long . Instructors have no formal training in counseling , therapy , communications , human relations etc . In fact , what instructors are trained to do is let the mountains speak for themselves by guiding a patrol into the wilderness , building up its skills for outdoor living , and then confronting it with a characteristic set of problem-solving tasks . Students coming to Outward Bound are looking for this very thing . For the most part they will not ask of more ( especially the adolescents ) . Certainly there are very few who are ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for therapeutic healing in any meaningful sense beyond the " short-term turn-on " . Most are looking for action and they want more than anything to learn that they can do more than they thought they could . What I am driving at is that the mountaineers are making an important point by demanding a more limited set of expectations for an Outward Bound course . Perhaps that point is that we should do what we do best , which is to deliver students into an extraordinary experience of action and adventure , leaving them to make of it what they will . We can provide the spark , as Kurt Hahn said , but it is up to others to keep the flame alive . <p> Obviously , the dichotomy or " defining tension " I have described is too simple . Everyone is in the middle somewhere , partaking of both sides , but I hope what I have said will be useful in firing up others to think about the possibilities of Outward Bound . It may be that someone who has been a hard-core skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment with new techniques in human relations , just to keep the job interesting and find out why people make such a fuss over " touchy feely " . On the other hand , for those who came fresh from highly verbalized settings and are ready to charge into the millennium of human potential , it might be interesting to ease off for a bit and savour the excitement of Outward Bound in its most austere and economical form . Meanwhile , the school will probably continue to do what schools always do in staff development , which is to push people to build up the complementary side of their skills and knowledge , either to strengthen hard skills if they are weak in that area , or to soften up a bit if they are so hard as to be antisocial . Hooray for our differences !

@@41691468 @1691468/ <h> Operant Conditioning &amp; Personality <p> Instrumental conditioning is a second form of conditioning that influences personality . Instrumental conditioning relies on the law of effect ( postulated by Thorndike back in 1898 ) : <p> If a behaviour results in a MORE satisfying state of affairs you 're more likely to do it again . <p> If a behaviour results in a LESS satisfying state of affairs you 're LESS likely to do it again . <p> Instrumental conditioning is seen as more active than the passive classical conditioning .

Responses leading to an increased state of satisfaction are repeated versus responses leading to a state of dissatisfaction will decrease the response ( Thorndikes Law of Effect ) . <p> B. F.

Skinner placed a pigeon in the box and it starts to dance around until it hits the bar and gets food .

Just concentrate on environmental conditions . The focus is on environmental determinism . Peoples internal dispositions , the biological inheritance and processes , and the unconscious do n't  matter . <p> The term REFINFORCER came to be used rather than the initial " satisfying state of affairs " . A reinforcer is anything that strengthens a tendency to behave in a particular way ( food satisfies hunger so you eat ; money reinforces the likelihood that you 'll keep working ; a child will behave well overtime because mum and dad approve . These reinforcers all use POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT ( i.e. they add something good ) . A reinforcer could also use NEGATIVE REINFORCEMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MORE likley to occur . <p> The term PUNISHER refers to unpleasant or aversive outcomes : punishers reduce the likelihood of doing the behaviour that came before them . Could be child being reprimanded for performing a behaviour and making child less likely to do the behaviour . This is negative reinforcement.Theres controversy over how well punishers work . <p> The likelihood of a behaviour will be increased by : <p> positive reinforcement ( adding something pleasant ) OR <p> negative reinforcement ( turning of/removing something unpleasant ) <p> The likelihood of a behaviour will be decreased by : <p> positive punishment ( adding something unpleasant ) OR <p> negative punishment ( turning off/removing something pleasant ) <p> Essentially , our behavioural tendencies are governed by the environment are shaped by past experiences in the form of rewards and punishments . <h> Advanced Instrumental Conditioning Concepts <p> Discrimination &amp; Generalization <p> Extinction <p> Shaping - successive approximation <p> Schedules of Reinforcement different schedules of reinforcement lead to different behavioural tendencies across time <p> Discrimination still means being able to discriminate between stimuli i.e. responding differently in the presence of DIFFERENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by variations in prior reinforcement . So for example a DIFFERENCE develops because a certain stimulus is present whenever a behaviour is followed by a reinforcer BUT when the stimulus is absent , the behaviour is NEVER followed by a reinforcer. e.g. I 'm not a great Monty Python fan but my husband is and so too is one of my daughters . When she talks Monty Python to me she never gets much response but she does from her dad . So these days she basically only talks about Monty Python to her dad . <p> So the presence or absence of dad gains an influence over whether the behaviour takes place . So dad becomes a " cue " for the behaviour . Even very small differences in stimuli can result in different behaviours . A clock showing 1200 means its time to knock off work whereas when it shows 1300 its time to come back . <p> Generalization allows for continuity in behaviour .

" Different schedules of reinforcement lead to different behavioural tendencies across time " .

Or PARTIAL : the behaviour is not reinforced EVERY time ; it can be at a variable ratio , a fixed ratio , a variable interval , or a fixed interval . <p> Ratio = reinforcer after number of OCCURENCES of the behaviour <p> Interval = reinforcer after period of time that the behaviour has occurred <h> Personality Change <p> Plan intervention schedule : <p> e.g. systematic desensitization <p> e.g. counterconditioning <p> e.g. aversion therapy <p> There appears to be no doubt that some types of our behaviour are caused by learning - and this is demonstrated in clinical practice by some of our therapies of systematic desensitisation and graded exposure which are all based on learning theories - designed to cause extinction of certain behaviours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolpe ) In this form of treatment the person learns that previously anxiety provoking stimuli now are associated with relaxation ( so a DIFFERENT emotion is conditioned ) e.g. phobias ( the idea being that the phobia for say dogs occurred because the person felt intense fear in the presence of a dog one time and this previously neutral stimulus became linked with anxiety via classical conditioning ) .

@@41691470 @1691470/ <h> Overview <p> The issue of what causes individual differences in intelligence goes beyond psychology , and involves moral , political , ethical , educational , social , physiological and statistical issues to name just a few . The issue of how differences in intelligence come about between individuals and groups is a topic of much fascination and controversy - it can arouse strong reactions and elicit personal beliefs and biases . <p> This page outlines some of the main psychological concepts and evidence that relates to explaining individual differences in intelligence . <p> As a student , it is your responsibility to develop a familiarity with the basic arguments , strengths , and weaknesses for and against the causal influences and correlates of intelligence . <h> Nature vs Nurture - What do you think ? <p> In looking for the causes of individual differences in intelligence , a major issue is the relative contribution of genetics and environment . <p> 100% Genetics ( Nature ) <p> 90% Gen. <p> 80% Gen. <p> 70% Gen. <p> 60% Gen. <p> 50-50 <p> 60% Env . <p> 70% Env . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Nurture ) <p> Rate the extent to which you believe nature and nature influence ( cause ) human intelligence . <p> Warning ! As you learn more about the theory and research on genetic and environmental influences on human intelligence , you may find that you change some of your beliefs and assumptions . <h> Pendulum of opinion on Nature vs . Nurture through history <p> The zeitgeist ( the intellectual and culture " flavor " of a time and place ) has swung back and forth over time with regard to the amount of influence that nature vs. nature has on human intelligence . <p> For example , in the late 1800 's in the UK , as Darwinism took off , the role of genetically determined capability was considered very important . <p> This was in constrast , for example , to the 1960 's in the USA , when views were more in favor a " tabula rasa " ( blank state ) view of human intelligence - in other words , all people are capable of much more , if given conducive environmental conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Western psychological world is somewhere inbetween - both genetics and environment are seen as playing important roles . To be more precise , the modern view about nature vs nurture in intelligence is " interactionist " . This view is well expressed by Ridley ( 1999 , p.77 ) : <p> " Mother Nature has plainly not entrusted the determination of our intellectual capacities to the blind fate of a gene or genes ; she gave us parents , learning , language , culture and education to program ourselves with . " <h> Historical trends in the nature-nurture debate <h> Late 19th century - early 20th century ( Nature ) <p> From the mid to late 1800 's through to the early 1900 's opinions rested in the nature camp . This was consistent with the scientific discoveries of the role of inheritance and natural selection by Mendel and Darwin . <p> The major contributor to the psychological argument was Francis Galton in his book " Hereditary Genius : Its Laws and Consequences " ( 1869 ) . <p> Galton had observed that the gifted individuals tended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to analyze biographical dictionaries and encyclopedias , and became convinced that talent in science , the professions , and the arts , ran in families . <p> Galton took this observation one step further , to argue that it would be " quite practicable to produce a high gifted race of men by judicious marriages during several consecutive generations " . <p> This suggestion became know as eugenics , " the study of the agencies under social control that may improve or repair the racial qualities of future generations , either physically or mentally . " Galton wanted to speed up the process of natural selection , stating that : " What Nature does blindly , slowly , and ruthlessly , man may do providently , quickly , and kindly " . <p> Galton was convinced that " intelligence must be bred , not trained " . Such arguments have had massive social consequences and have been used to support apartheid policies , sterilization programs , and other acts of withholding basic human rights from minority groups . <h> Post WWI : 1920s-1930s <p> After World War I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place . This began to challenge the commonly held view that intelligence was directly , genetically linked to racial differences : <p> e.g. blacks from Illinois had higher IQ scores than whites from 9 southern states - a finding difficult to reconcile with the simple idea that whites are intellectually superior to blacks . <p> Evidence now seemed to support a closer link between social class and intelligence , rather than race and intelligence . As a result , a number of psychologists in the 1920s and 1930s shifted their position towards the environmental camp . <p> The shift against ' nature ' views was given momentum by the backlash against the social consequences of government policies : <p> e.g. sterilization laws had been passed in 24 US States , resulting in 20 , 000 people being sterilized against their will . 320 , 000 people suffered the same fate in Germany . <h> 1940s-1990s <p> The backlash faded , and the pendulum swung back towards the middle . From the early 1940 's , it seemed there was a rejection of simplistic nature or nurture views , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social prejudices and inequalities were still evident and growing . <p> Thus , in the 1960 's , the focus of the problem was shifted away from the individual as the cause of the problem , and centered on social determinants . Thhe pendulum swung towards the nurture/environmental end and away from the nature/genetic end . Efforts were made to arrest poor educational achievement through special schooling , and to alleviate poor living conditions through welfare . <p> It became politically correct to minimize talk and discussion of the role of ' nature ' in contributing to any individual differences , let alone intelligence . The evidence of differences in intelligence between socioeconomic groups and racial groups , however , did not go away . <h> Recent trends " The Bell Curve " controversy <p> From time to time , there have been inflammatory articles which present and interpret evidence of IQ differences between groups ( in particular Jensen , 1969 ) . The most recent , and most major of these publications was Herrnstein and Murray 's ( 1994 ) " The Bell Curve " . This book provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ' , at least in the public 's eye , but even more so , it generated massive debate and controversy in psychology , sociology , education , and politics , not to mention the media and household . The 800+ page book , written for laypersons , hit the best-seller lists in the U.S. <p> " The work 's main thesis is that an individual 's intelligence - no less than 40% and no more than 80% of which is inherited genetically from his or her parents - has more effect than socioeconomic background on future life experiences . " Manolakes ( 1997 ) , p.235 <p> In addition to the premise that measured intelligence ( IQ ) is largely genetically inherited , a second important premise was that IQ is correlated positively with a variety of measures of socioeconomic success in society , such as a prestigious job , high annual income , and high educational attainment ; and is inversely correlated with criminality and other measures of social failure . It was suggested that SES successes ( and failures ) are largely genetically caused . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - " pseudo-scientific racists " ; - and the book as " alien and repellent " <p> The politically right saw the authors as : - " brave and respectable scholars , " ; - whose book was " lucid " and " powerfully written " <p> The part of The Bell Curve that captured public attention was on the differences in IQ between African and Caucasian Americans . Further to this were the suggestions made by Herrnstein and Murray about the implications of a predominantly genetically-inherited intelligence for public and social policy . Since IQ was largely seen as genetically determined , the authors expressed resistance to educational and environmental interventions . They argued that money spent in this way is wasted . The authors also argued that America is becoming a society of ' cognitive castes ' , with the lower caste including a large proportion of African-Americans . Hence their statement that the ' genetic capital ' of society is being eroded because the less intelligence , lower class is reproducing at a greater rate than high IQ classes . <h> Evidence in favour of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 1920s there was no evidence for the heritability of IQ . It was just an assumption of the practitioners . Today that is no longer the case . The heritability of IQ ( whatever IQ is ! ) is now an hypothesis that has been tested - on twins and adoptees . The results really are quite startling . No study of the causes of intelligence has failed to find a certain and often substantial heritability . What varies from study to study is the amount that can be attributed to heritability . <h> Concordance rates of IQ scores <p> Evidence from family studies provides the main supporting evidence from which arguments about the relative roles of genetics and environment are constructed . <p> A large number of the study of twins reared apart was undertaken by Thomas Bouchard of the University of Minnesota starting in 1979 .

These authors conclude that heritability can account for 48% of the variation in IQ . The highest estimates have come from reviews of research by Herrnstein &amp; Murray , 1994 ( 74% ) and Eysenck ( 80% ) . A safer bet is probably to sit on the fence - 50:50 ! <p> Heritability indices , however , are not pure measures of genetic inheritance - they included prenatal environmental influences , ( e.g. whether the mother smokes , what she eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these heritability indices are likely to overestimate the role of genetics . <h> Correlation of child-parent verbal ability scores <p> This graph shows correlations between children and their parents and adopted children and their biological and adoptive parents on verbal ability scores . <h> Heritability &amp; intelligence <p> It must be noted , however , that heritabilty is not pure genetic influence as the pre and postnatal environments must be taken into account . Heritability estimates based on comparing correlations between IQs of monozygotic ( identical ) twins reared together with IQs of dizygotic ( fraternal ) twins and siblings are likely to overestimate the genetic component because monozygotic twins share more similar environments - both in the womb and out <p> twins reared apart are not assigned at random to foster or adoptive parents - since homes are selected purposely to with regard to characteristics of the child and characteristics of the family . This would partially account for the IQ correlations attributed to inheritance <p> twin studies may not be generalizable to the population at large as twins are more susceptible to prenatal trauma leading to retardation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in intellligence test scores . heritability indexes refer to the population on which they were found at the time and is not applicable to an analysis of test performance between two population groups e.g. ethnic groups . <p> heritability does not indicate the degree to which a trait can be modified e.g. even if the heritabilty of a trait , like intelligence were found to be 100% it would n't mean it could n't be modified . ( Anastasi &amp; Urbina , 1997 ) . <p> In the discussion to date , we have focused on the heritability ( or otherwise ) of general intelligence . What about the subcomponents of intelligence ?

" - John B. Watson , 1924 <p> This was a famous quote in the heyday of behaviorism , when the child was considered to be a ' tabula rasa ' ( blank slate ) onto which anything could be sculpted through environmental experience . This would be a 100% environmental view , but virtually no psychologists would accept such an extreme position today . <h> The Flynn effect : Are we getting smarter ? <p> In the 1980s , a NZ-based political scientist , James Flynn , noticed that IQ was increasing in all countries all the time , at an average rate of about 3 IQ points per decade i.e. the average IQ across the world has risen over 1 standard deviation ( i.e. 15 points ) since WWII - predominantly due to environmental effects . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IQ tests to ' 100 ' . <p> Could this be due to diet ? Possibly but IQ scores are still rising just as rapidly in well-nourished western countries . Could it be schooling ? Interruptions to schooling only have temporary effects on IQ . Importantly , it is those test s that test abstract reasoning ability that show the steepest improvements . One researcher , Ulric Neisser suggests that the Flynn effect is due to the way we are being saturated with sophisticated visual images : ads , posters , videogame and TV graphics etc - rather than written messages . He suggests that children experience a much richer visual environment than in the past and that this assists them with visual puzzles of the kind that dominate IQ tests . <h> Intelligence varies with at least 21 factors <p> Some of the other circumstances and attributes that have been found to vary to a greater or lesser ( but always significant ) extent in relation with IQ ( Bouchard &amp; Segal , 1985 ; Liungman , 1975 ) - note that not all of these relationships support an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malnutrition ( -ve ) <p> Birth weight <p> Birth order <p> Height <p> Number of siblings ( -ve ) <p> Number of years in school <p> Social group of parental home <p> Father 's profession <p> Father 's economic status <p> Degree of parental rigidity ( -ve ) <p> Parental ambition <p> Mother 's education <p> Average TV viewing ( -ve ) <p> Average book-reading <p> Self-confidence according to attitude scale measurement <p> Age ( negative relationship , applies only in adulthood ) <p> Degree of authority in parental home ( -ve ) <p> Criminality ( -ve ) <p> Alcoholism ( -ve ) <p> Mental disease ( -ve ) <p> Emotional adaptation <p> " No single environmental factor seems to have a large influence on IQ . Variables widely believed to be important are usually weak .... Even though many studies fail to find strong environmental effects .... most of the factors studied do influence IQ in the direction predicted by the investigator .... environmental effects are multifactorial and largely unrelated to each other . " - Bouchard &amp; Segal ( 1985 ) , p.452 <p> So , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing a small a small fraction to the variance in IQ scores . <h> Intelligence &amp; race <p> Let 's focus on some of the correlates of intelligence examining in particular the interplay between race , environment and intelligence ; between SES , environment and intelligence ; between education , environment and intelligence ; and between occupation , environment and intelligence . <p> Herrnstein and Murray ( 1994 ) in The Bell Curve state that : Asians and Asian-Americans have a ( .32 standard deviation ) higher average IQ than white Americans , and that white Americans have a ( 1.58 standard deviation ) higher mean IQ than black Americans . <p> Further , they claim that this difference is not a function of cultural testing bias . <p> Herrnstein and Murray ( 1994 ) acknowledge that the causes of these differences could be environmental , however the differences in IQ appear to be too large to be accounted for by environmental influences alone . They provide much qualification , cautioning , and warnings about how their evidence should be interpreted and used . In particular , they remind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' desirable ' human qualities ; and The fallacy of drawing conclusions about individual on the basis of group findings . <p> It would be incorrect to characterize " The Bell Curve " as out-and-out a racist , eugenicist , etc. book . Even detractors acknowledge the importance of its contribution to psychological and social debate . But the book does , in general , support a view that intelligence is largely heritable . <p> Note that there have also been investigations into racial differences on subcomponents of intelligence . Herrstein and Murray ( 1994 ) report that : East Asian scores are typically the same or slightly lower than White American scores on verbal IQ , but much higher on visuo-spatial IQ Black Americans tend to score higher than whites on subtests involving arithmetic and immediate memory , whereas whites typically score high than blacks on subtests of spatial-perceptual ability <p> Differences in IQ scores between races does not necessarily imply genetic causes . Most psychologists accept that there are group mean differences in IQ scores for non-culturally-loaded tests . However , these differences are confounded with the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers , brought up in white family - no evidence of lower IQs 2 . Adoption studies - e.g. black children brought up by white families only slightly lower IQs than white adopted children ( Howe , 1997 ) <p> Some theorists suggest that socioeconomic disadvantages are the main causes of ethnic differences in IQ . <p> Even if the variation within a group reflects genetic differences , the average differences between the groups could be wholly due to environmental factors . Imagine , two pots , with randomly allocated seeds from the same batch . The two plots have equivalent genetic potential . One plot received fertilizer ( an environmental condition ) , the other pot receives no fertilizer . The average height ( i.e. intelligence ) differences between each pot will be due to environmental differences ( fertilizer ) , however the height differences amongst individual plants within a pot are due to genetic differences ( assuming similar conditions throughout the pot ) . <p> There is debate about whether heritability estimates even matter , since they ca n't be applied to an individual or be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) states that : <p> " It does not matter whether the field of human behavior genetics finally decides that the heritability of IQ in the United States is 25% , 40% , 50% , or 70% . Any such estimate will be utterly useless to anyone seeking better ways to improve the intelligence of the nation through health care and education . " <h> Intelligence &amp; socioeconomic status <p> Herrstein and Murray ( 1994 ) argue that low intelligence causes low SES , rather than the other way around . So , according to these authors , while SES is correlated with IQ , it should be considered a consequence rather than a cause . <p> However , adoption studies seem to indicate that SES has a strong , causal effect on intelligence , e.g. : <p> " Well-controlled adoption studies done in France have found that transferring an infant from a family having low socioeconomic status ( SES ) to a home where parents have high SES improves childhood IQ scores by 12 to 16 points or about one standard deviation , which is considered a large effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 76 ) . <p> Several recent US studies have demonstrated improvements in children 's IQ 's by improving the lives of infants in disadvantaged circumstances . These studies employed random assignment of children and families to treatment and control conditions . <p> Experimental group received : enriched , educational day care outside the home every weekday from 3 months to start of schooling <p> Control group received : nutritional supplements and pediatric medical care or crisis intervention but no educational day care <p> Even though the children returned to their home environment every day and spent holidays and weekends with their families ( mostly unemployed , single mothers ) in poverty-stricken neighbourhoods , there were large gains in IQ ; almost as much as in the French studies previously mentioned . <p> Furthermore , the mean IQ of the enriched groups appeared to be quite typical of healthy American children . These children continued to show higher IQ scores than controls at age 12 ( Wahlsten , 1997 ) . Of course , in these American studies , SES and education were being manipulated . There is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Intelligence &amp; education <p> A number of studies have shown that schooling and intelligence influence each other . Higher intelligence tends to lead to prolonged schooling and longer schooling leads to higher IQ . <p> Intelligence at age 5 predicts better than any other variable a child 's future educational progress and attainment ( Kline , 1991 ) . <p> Wahlsten ( 1997 ) : delays in schooling cause IQ to ' drop ' 5 points per year temporary drop in IQ during school vacations <p> Winship &amp; Korenman ( 1997 ) : 2.7 IQ point advantage for each year of schooling thus to predict later IQ , two estimates are useful : early IQ estimates and number of years of schooling <p> A study by Cahan and Cohen , found that older children in a grade tended to score slightly higher than their younger classmates but importantly they found that children who are in a higher grade but are virtually the same age as children in the grade lower have higher IQ scores . It is postulated this is due to the extra year of schooling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased schooling has little effect on intelligence and have refute the suggestion that intelligence can be modified . <p> " Compensatory education has been tried and it apparently has failed . " - Jensen , 1969 <p> " the story of attempts to raise intelligence is one of high hopes , flamboyant claims , and disappointing results . " - Herrstein &amp; Murray ( 1994 ) , p.389 <p> One justifiable criticism levelled at educational enrichment studies conclusions about increased IQ is that what is being modified is performance on a test rather than an actual modification in intelligence . Children in enrichment programmes often receive extensive instruction and practice in test-taking . " What has been temporarily modified in the early stages of early intervention programmes is performance on a test , not the childs general intelligence " ( Herman Spitz , 1999 , p. 289 ) . <p> This would account for the well-known fade-out effect , whereby initial , often very high gains in IQ scores , in experimental " enriched schooling " groups , return to the level of the control group a few years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large nationwide programme , the Head Start programme , aims to enrich the schooling of disadvantaged children . On the whole , the results have been mixed . Head Start and programmes like it have been criticized for not living up to expectations in changing IQ . The main defense is that the primary aim is not to improve IQ , but to accelerate academic development - IQ change is a bonus , academic development is more important . <p> Head Start type programmes have also been criticized for not effecting last changes . This is not surprising if children return to poor , unsupportive , deprived environments . And , in fact , such a finding supports the idea that IQ is malleable - in both directions . <p> New and better ways of educating , improving , and maximizing individual potentials in intelligence are likely to be developed . As this happens , more and more of the **26;402;TOOLONG variation in IQ is likely to come under control and estimates of the ' environment ' proportion could increase . <h> Intelligence &amp; occupation <p> " In more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 0.3 ... this correlation is certainly a low estimate of its true size ... no other variable , either of ability or personality , can approach this figure . " - Kline ( 1991 ) , p. 139 <p> Herrstein and Murray estimate the relationship between IQ and occupation to be between .2 and .6 ( i.e. that IQ explains between 4% and 36% of the variations in occupation ) . These correlations are slightly higher for skilled , professional jobs , and slightly lower for jobs that require less skill . Whilst this might be useful in describing groups , it means there is questionable value in administering an IQ test to an individual in an attempt to help determine their occupational options . It may be a useful approach , however , to help select the best 100 employees from a 1000 applicants ( Howe , 1997 , p.97 ) . <h> Comments on the scope &amp; quality of intelligence research <p> All this research uses psychometric , quantitative tests of intelligence , which we know from previous lectures corresponds somewhat ( but not entirely ) with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very focused on North American populations . <p> Multiple intelligences or subcomponents of intelligence are barely considered in much of this research . Neither are alternative measures of intelligence , such as speed of processing , evoked potentials , or practical intelligence , etc . <p> Future research on brain-behaviour connections will probably help to more accurately isolate the functions of ' intelligence ' ( Weinberg , 1989 ) . <p> In addition , as we come to understand and develop more effective environmental interventions to maximise individuals ' IQs , this will possibly expand the relative important of the ' nurture ' component . <p> Nevertheless , there remains the spectre of eugenics - those who would argue for selective breeding on the basis of intellectual ability . This issue is likely to rear its head again in the future and with new genetic technologies could appear in a more dynamic form . <h> The role of " interaction " <p> An underresearched area , while the nature vs. nurture debate has raged , is the contribution of interactions between genetics and environment on IQ variance . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to estimate the relative contribution rests on the somewhat naive notion that there is a constant , true value . In reality , " gene expression is environment dependent " and it impossible to obtain pure estimates of genetic vs. environmental contribution - one could not exist without the other . The environment a child experiences is partly a consequence of the childs genes as well as external factors . To some extent a person seeks out and creates his or her environment . If she is of a mechanical bent she practices mechanical skills ; if a bookworm , she seeks out books . Thus genes may create an appetite rather than an aptitude . Remember that the high heritability of short-sightedness is accounted for not just by the heritability of a gene for short sightedness but by the heritability of literate habits . Thus , a future area for research which blends those in the nature camps with those in the nurture camps would be examine which environmental components allow people to optimally realise their genetic potentials for a variety of areas of cognitive performance ( e.g. see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about intelligence ? <p> So , what can we say about nature vs. nurture as causal determinants of intelligence ? A conservative , seemly safe position is that : " In the field of intelligence , there are three facts about the transmission of intelligence that virtually everyone seems to accept : <p> 1 . Both heredity and environment contribute to intelligence . 2 . Heredity and environment interact in various ways . 3 . Extremely poor as well as highly enriched environments can interfere with the realization of a person 's intelligence , regardless of the person 's heredity " ( Sternberg &amp; Grigorenko , 1997 , p.xi ) . 4 . Although most would accept a causal role of genetics , the exact genetic link and how it operates is very far from being understood - another point that most psychologists would agree on . It is certainly not a single gene , but a complex combination of smaller genetic markers. 5 . But likewise , it is difficult to pin-down single , identifiable elements of the environment which directly influence IQ scores . Several environmental factors influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that its difficult to define but that there is SOMETHING we call intelligence that appears to relate to ability to reason abstractly , to learn and to adapt . That we can measure some part of it , although poorly ; that its partially caused by genetics , partially be environment ; that the real causes are the complex , not well understood interplay between genetics and environment ; that it is somewhat though not greatly modifiable ; that sometimes what we learn from tests is used inappropriately but that IQ tests can be useful in helping children attain their potential . <h> Final quotes <p> " Measures of intelligence have reliable statistical relationships with important social phenomena , but they are a limited tool for deciding what to make of any given individual . Repeat it we must , for one of the problems of writing about intelligence is how to remind readers often enough how little an IQ score tells you about whether the human being next to you is someone whom you will admire or cherish .

@@41691472 @1691472/ <h> What is facilitation ? Helping a process along <p> To facilitate , is to help something ( usually a process ) move along . The word derives from " facile " which is French for " easy " . To facilitate , then , is literally to make something easier . Through facilitation , the instructor provides subtle " boosts " to help participants through a series of experiences which combine to create a desired effect . <p> Facilitate does not mean " solving a problem " or " doing it for someone " . It means doing something that makes a process run a little better . When a situation is too difficult , a facilitator is there to help . When a student or a group are having desirable experiences , the facilitator can be less obtrusive . In general , the goals of facilitation often include participants analyzing and better understanding their thoughts , feelings , and behaviors . <p> However , facilitation can also be understood to mean all the behaviors and actions of a teacher , instructor , trainer , mentor , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This includes subtle , unconscious behaviors of the instructor which can have profound influences on what unfolds . <p> Facilitation is everything that an instructor does , thus it includes intentional , unintentional , subtle and obvious behaviors . Four types of facilitative behaviors can be identified , as follows : <h> Intentional - Overt <p> These are things an instructor does intentionally and these are noticed by students . <p> Examples <p> 1 . A facilitator shows students how to make a fire . <p> 2 .. A facilitator uses Socratic questioning , such as when asking a question of a group during a debrief . <p> 3 . An instructor counsels or gives verbal feedback to a participant . <h> Intentional - Covert <p> These are things an instructor does intentionally but they are not noticed by students . <p> Example <p> 1 .

An instructor is naturally warm-hearted ( without realizing ) and this quickly makes students feel accepted and excited about the program . <h> Unintentional - Covert <p> These are things an instructor does without intending and they go unnoticed by the students . But it does affect individual 's experiences and has subtle socio-psychological impacts . <p> Examples <p> 1 . As a group are sitting down to have a discussion , the facilitator unintentionally sits either too far apart from the group ( e.g. , is ego-centric ) or unintentionally too far into the group circle ( e.g. , is anxious , shy ) . The group do n't consciously notice but it effects the way participants respond to the instructor . <p> 2 . An instructor uses gendered language and this goes unnoticed by the group but it contributes to underlying gender issues and tensions within a group . <p> Note that many definitions , theories and practical approaches to facilitation only focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , for example , seems to assume that everything ( or at least the important stuff ) happens in the conscious minds of both participants and instructor ( overt-intentional facilitation ) . Facilitation theories and training which use insights from psychology and group work tends to include more focus on unconscious , subtle , socio-psychological processes ( unintentional and covert facilitation ) . <h> Examples of research on ways an instructor shapes participant experiences <p> There are a myriad of ways an instructor shapes and moulds a participants ' experience ( e.g. a carefully placed word of encouragement , using body language to reinforce desired behaviors ) . So facilitation is an infinitely complicated process , particular with groups . <p> Ultimately , even the smallest of an instructor 's decisions and actions can profoundly influence the nature of a participants ' experience .

Mortlock himself was a strong climbing and paddling adventurer and he took his can do spirit and belief in people 's inner capacities to learn and handle challenge to what some may consider an extreme extent with novice students . In this sense , Mortlock perhaps represents a British era-equivalent philosophical educational adventurer much as Willi Unsoeld was in the US . <p> Mortlock provides an adventure education philosophy which thrives on the energy and human possibilities which are released and realized when engaged with true adventure . Mortlock is a strong advocate for exposing people to genuine risk experiences at the edge of people 's abilities , whatever the form of outdoor adventure , whether on land , at height , at sea , or underground . <p> In the opening pages of " The Adventure Alternative " , Mortlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wing and was able to rapidly equip them to independently undertake high adventure expeditions and experiences . Mortlock 's theme here follows in the tradition of Kurt Hahn , in that people are seen as capable of much more than they generally realize , but that due to post-industrial values and lifestyles in modern Western society , there is much less real physical risk and danger , resulting in fewer opportunities for people to discover their inner capabilities . <p> Mortlock adds an important qualification to his otherwise glowing depiction of the value of adventure . Mortlock embraces to the heart of his philosophy his observation over the years that that what is adventurous for one person is a dawdle for another and is dangerous or harmful to another person - what is one 's person 's meat is another person 's poison . Thus , Mortlock emphasizes that is the subjective nature of an adventure experience which is paramount and this subjective experience stems from a combination of the objective physical task ( including environmental conditions ) and the person 's capabilities and resources at the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with John Dewey 's theory of experience , viewing experience as emerging from the coming together of all that is accumulated from past experience and how that interacts surrounding circumstances e.g. , the activity , the teacher , the environment , the group , etc . <p> Mortlock 's adventure philosophy centers on proposing the existence of four basic " adventure states " , which progress in intensity from : <p> Stage 1 : Play : Characterized by little emotion through relatively easy participation in activities which are below the person 's skill level <p> Stage 2 : Adventure : ( Characterized by enjoyment and excitement , where a person 's is using his her capabilities more fully , but the person maintains control over the situation and his/her self <p> Stage 3 : Frontier Adventure : Characterized by peak experience , which emerges from a person experiencing adventurous challenges very close to his/her limits . If the person succeeds , then generally a peak experience is had , but there is real risk of pushing too far and falling/failing , leading to Stage 4 . <p> The shift from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his little red book entitled ' Adventure Education and Outdoor Pursuits ' ( 1973 ) . The Adventure Alternative ( 1984 ) marks the next big shift in the UK - the integration of environmental awareness into adventure education .

The educational principles in praise of adventure shine out from the meandering undercurrent of political and social commentary .

Contrary to expectations , overall use of coping strategies decreased in comparison to the control group . In addition , although there were gains in mental health , the control group also improved . Finally , a moderate relationship was evident between coping styles and mental health . Longitudinally , however , these links were only small . Possible explanations which warrant further investigation were : ( i ) Reduced use of coping strategies may indicate that adolescents have become more effective in their coping as a result of the outdoor intervention ; ( ii ) Validity concerns about the psychometric structure of the instrument ( Adolescent Coping Scale ) ; ( iii ) Outdoor education programs for schools tend to operate with a general educational philosophy but do not specifically target intervention for coping behaviours .

This trip 's main purposes are recreation and adventure . The group is made up of six 11 and 12 year old boys and one leader . The leader is trained in Basic First Aid and survival skills . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys . Day One : 2PM : We 've paddled six miles to our camp . One boy has been whining and irritating the group all day and , as we begin to build our shelter , he becomes hysterical , complaining of a bad earache . <p> The Choices : <p> A. Bring the whole crew back the six miles , find a house , call base camp , get the kid out of there , and paddle back to go on with the weekend . <p> B. Wait until morning to see if it gets worse and then decide what to do . <p> C. Bring everyone back and end the trip . <p> We asked the class to split themselves into groups according to what they would do . <p> Group 's Comments : We really felt like it went well . We engaged in some good dialogue about the rights of the group and the individual . Our goal was not to convince people of what was right or wrong , just to get them thinking about situations that they might encounter as leaders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fairly even split between A and B but were surprised by everyone going with B. Even after they were challenged by our group , they all chose to stay until morning . Maybe make the earache into something a bit more serious . <p> Instructor 's Comments : This scenario illustrated a problem in presenting the group vs. individual ethical issue in the context of a medical issue . It was clear to the group ( many of whom were currently involved in emergency medical training and/or who had led trips ) that the ear-ache symptoms were too minor and the distance/time/effort to help too great to warrant doing much other than option B , continuing with the trip and monitoring the boy 's earache . The group did a reasonably good job of altering the scenario and information as the discussion progressed in order to focus attention back onto the ' should we continue for the group ' or ' should we change the group experience in order to cater to the needs of an individual ' issue . <p> Instructor 's Recommendations : Scenario : I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such medical contexts ; instead simply have competing interests of a group vs. individual in a programmatic sense , e.g. , one group member is very slow at walking , others are very fast . The question is in such a case , where there are no other competing issues , what should be done ? Assume that its not appropriate to split the group ( e.g , for safety reasons , such as there is only one intstructor ) . Or Hunt 's example , I think , is whether a weaker member should be challenged to climb a summit which the rest of the group are hankering to do and may well be a valuable culminating challenge for him . These are more typical kinds of scenarios than medical group vs. individual because increasingly nowadays , medical decisions are made as just that - medical decisions - based on clear medical criteria primarily . This is not to say that group vs. individual ethical issues do not interact with the medical decision , but just that at an introductory level , this may be too complex as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario . To make ethical scenarios work more powerfully and to enhance the experiential nature of the training for both presenters and participants , I definitely recommend dramatization of the scenario . In doing so , I would recommend that greater character development of the individual and the group dynamics . In this way these more subtle characteristics can be incorporated into trainees ' decision making and discussion based on the scenario . 
@@41691495 @1691495/ <h> Introduction to Outdoor Education &amp; Ethics <p> This webpage offers a brief guide for those interested in exploring the topic of " ethics and outdoor education " . <p> Ethics , in simple terms , is the study of morality . Morality refers to the " rightness " or " goodness " of matters . From one point of view , whether something is right , good , or valued , is a subjective judgment to be made based on particular situations ( or ethical subjectivism , Hunt , 1990 ) . From another point of view , there are some absolutes , for example the view that " killing another human being is bad " is always true ( or ethical objectivism , Hunt , 1990 ) . Many particular viewpoints derive from these two differing , underlying types of philosophy . <p> Further , for some people , the rightness or goodness of an action or decision is based on the consequences of the action or decision ( consequentialist theory , Hunt , 1990 ) . For others , the rightness or goodness is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent of the consequences ( nonconsequentialist theory , Hunt , 1990 ) . <p> Outdoor education , once the can of worms is opened , reveals itself as having a minefield of potential and ethical issues and dilemmas as any other field . Perhaps the most commonly discussed ethical issues involve weighing up the relative human and ecological benefits ( e.g. , see Bureau of Land Management , 2002 ) of outdoor education activity . For example , how we can justify all the expensive gear , travel resources , impact on environment , and so on , for the human pleasure of a high-end adventure trip ? The trash strewn up and down Mt . Everest , can it be morally justified ? Can we morally take students into environmentally sensitive areas for their benefit only for them to cause significant damage to that environment ? <p> Other common ethical topics include the ethics of leisure-class lifestyles , ethics of the use of risk and deception for educational , developmental , or therapeutic purposes , ethics of choice or compulsion with regard to participation in challenges , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Examples of Ethical Issues in Outdoor Education ? <p> In a book dedicated to the topic of experiential education and ethics , Hunt ( 1990 ) provided an introduction to the use of philosophy for resolving ethical dilemmas in experiential and outdoor education , with indepth chapters on some particular ethical scenarios in outdoor education settings related to : <p> Informed Consent : It is ethical to disclose the content and risks of activities to students , so that they can make informed decisions regarding their participation . But when , if ever , is it appropriate to go ahead without informed consent , if its without the interests of students to do so ? <p> Deception : Sometimes in outdoor education , deception is used for supposed benefit of students . There is often an element of intentional surprise , of purposely telling students misleading information , so that students encounter and work through challenges themselves . However , deception of others is a ploy fraught with danger - so when and how can it be ethically justifiable ? <p> Secrecy : Sometimes instructors in outdoor education intentionally without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving students a map without roads marked and not telling students where water can be found is to keep this information secret . When and how can the practice of secrecy be ethically justifiable in outdoor education ? <p> Captive Populations : A captive population has no choice in their participation . For example , if an instructor leads a group intentionally into a difficult situation on an expedition and then gives a group two options - to go one way or another , then the group is being forced to choose from two options it may not have chosen had it been given a choice much earlier on . The people are captive to the situation and must choose one way or another . A person is ' captive ' for example when up in a high ropes course . They are often faced with choices , such as down the zip line or climb down the ladder , when they may not have chosen either if they were in a non-captive situation . Sometimes participants are sent onto programs and required to complete programs ( such as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and not entirely of free will in their participation . Is this ethical ? <p> Sexual Issues : For example , participants in an outdoor education program who did n't previously know one another begin acting on their sexual attraction to one another , including having sexual intercourse at night during the program . The two participants are open with others about their relationship . Some of the participants feel uncomfortable about the situation and approach the instructor and ask her what she thinks should be done about the situation . <p> Environmental Concerns : For example , a physically disabled participant on an outdoor education program involved in a ten day river rafting trip defecates in his pants and requested the assistance of an instructor to help him wash himself in the river , without the other participants in the group knowing , to avoid embarrassment . The instructor discusses the situation with another instructor who points out that this is a particularly environmentally sensitive river ecosystem and that there are strict park regulations that no fecal contamination whatsoever is allowed to enter the water stream . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Haras , 1997 ) <p> Individual versus Group Benefit : This is a very common dilemma that occurs when there is a conflict between what might be optimally beneficial for the group as a whole versus what might be optimally beneficial for particular individuals . For example , a difficult summit might be an ideal challenge for the development of some individuals , but represent too great a challenge for the group as a whole . Sometimes these matters can be easily resolved ( e.g. , make the summit optional ) , but a lot of the time outdoor educators find themselves challenged to compromise group or individual benefits in making a decision . Got to an individual vs. group class scenario . <p> Students ' Rights : For example , if instructors withold letters written to students by family and friends , because they believe it is beneficial to students to spend time only with the group and the environment , is that ethically justified ? What are students ' rights ? <p> Social Implications : For example , a nuclear power plant company approaches a financially struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teamwork of their managers as they are preparing to engage in a major new phase of production and they want their managers to work more effectively . The nuclear power plant company has been subject to criticism by environmental surveillance agencies for possibly contaminating the local environment . The company officials say that as part of their new phase of more efficient production that this will allow them to eliminate any negative impacts they may have had on the local environment . When the financially lucrative opportunity to provide teamwork programs for the nuclear power plant company is presented to the outdoor education company 's staff , they are divided about whether or not to conduct the program . Some staff said no , the organization should not be associated in any way with a nuclear power company full stop , let alone one with such a poor environmental record . Others said yes , we should do the program , partly to keep the organization alive and to help fund programs for local youth , others said , yes , do the program and try to change the value-system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the program and treat the managers as they would any other participants , as human beings on their own merits , regardless of their race , gender , height , weight , religious affiliation or professional affiliation . What would you do and why ? ( see also Yerkes &amp; Haras , 1997 ) <p> Paternalism : Paternalism refers to taking away an individual 's right and capacity to make a decision , supposedly in the interests of that person 's well-being . For example , if a participant wants to leave a program , but a powerful other , e.g. , course director , talks and coerces the person into staying on the program . Or a person wants to use a different , well-proven , safety technique in which he/she has considerable expertise during a program , and an instructor refuses saying his/her technique is better . What are ethical approaches in these kinds of situations ? <h> Other Examples <p> Perhaps some of the examples so far are overly dramatic examples and may seem far-fetched , but such situations do occur , as do a myriad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is it ethically sound to spit toothpaste into the woods ? Should participants be required to swallow their toothpaste , even though it may make some people feel a little sick ? For example , I participated in a backpacking trip on the Appalachian Trail with students who drank every single drop of waste water , including toothpaste and washing up water , in order to look after the environment . <p> Is it ethically sound for an outdoor education instructor to provide developmental experiences for participants who have value systems that the outdoor education instructor opposes ? For example , I struggled with my relationship with student who revealed himself to me confidentially during an Outward Bound Standard course I was instructing as someone with pro-Nazi beliefs and who had been accused of rape during college . <p> Is it ethically sound for the instructor of outdoor education group to spend more time talking with some participants because he/she feels more comfortable with those participants ? For example , in almost every teaching situation and outdoor education leadership situation I observe that the leader prefers to spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets along well and is comfortable with . Is this an ethical approach to teaching ? <h> Research Findings on Outdoor Education , Ethics , &amp; Moral Development <p> Research on ethics and outdoor education is not particularly extensive , however there have been some findings worthy of note and further discussion . It should noted that small amount of research that has been conducted on ethics in outdoor education , has tended to focus on whether programs can enhance the moral development of participants . The findings , however , show weak , if any , effects , and probably suggest that for moral development to occur , it needs to specifically established as a program objective and to have intentional moral development sessions and learning processes structured into the program . It may also indicate that the Defining Issues Test ( DIT ) , which has been commonly used in these studies , should be re-examined as to its applicability for detecting possible moral development impacts of outdoor education programs : <p> Garvey ( * ) investigated the moral development of students involved in a semester-at-sea program which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students and found not appreciable gains in moral development . <p> Giampietro ( 2001 ) conducted a Masters thesis in which he found no notable differences in the rate of moral development for students studying outdoor education compared to students in other disciplines , even though the outdoor education students were involved in discussions about ethics during their education . <p> Gass and Garvey ( 2001 ) investigated the moral development of students involved in college student internships which involved moral development training and found few , if any clear improvements . <p> DeSeeuw ( 2001 ) found no overall positive effects on moral development of intercultural , experiential travel trips . However , DeSeeuw did find that for one particular group , instructed by herself , particularly large enhancement of moral development , most likely due to her personal enthusiasm and intentional discussions with her group and individual students on matters relating to morals and ethics . <h> Codes of Ethics <p> There have been several efforts to produce codes of ethics within the field of experiential and outdoor education . <p> Outdoor Institute/TEG/Values Statement/Draft Code of Ethics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OutdoorEducation , Development Training and Recreation ( 3/1/98 ) <p> An Australian-based code of ethics for outdoor education is currently under development . <h> Links <p> Ethics UpdatesThis is an advanced academic resource with material on moral philosophy and ethics .

The role that the natural environment can or should play in outdoor , adventure , and environmental education provokes a wide and deep range of views . <p> As the environmental movement has unfolded in the face of increasing ecological disasters in recent decades , it has in turn caused considerable new changes and questions about how outdoor education is to function and what , indeed , it should be trying to do . <p> In general , it is fair to say that outdoor education programs of today , are considerably more " environmentally conscious " or " eco-friendly " than were programs prior to 1980 's . But the question as to what exactly outdoor education should be teaching students about the natural world and the human relationship with that world , remains very much up for grabs . <p> In this respect , two major positions about the role of wilderness in outdoor education are evident : <p> Pro-Wilderness : The role of wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature itself is believed to have beneficial effects ( often considered to be powerful or potentially transformative ) ; the mountains have a power which speaks for itself ( or at least when we learn how to listen ; see Are the Mountains Still Speaking for Themselves ? ) <p> Anti-Wilderness : The role of wilderness in outdoor education is less important than the roles played by the adventure activities themselves , the facilitator , the group , and the participant themselves . In other words , outdoor education program effects can largely be replicated in non-wilderness settings using adventure-based principles and non-wilderness based adventure activities . What 's more , indoor and urban-based adventure programming is cheaper and more accessible to the majority of human populations , in cities . <p> Those who side with the view that outdoor education should be closely tied to environmental education and that programs should endeavour to bring participants into a closer and more caring relationship with nature will find much reward in the work that has emerged in Australia over the past 10 or so years , particularly from the Outdoor Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recent publications ) . 
@@41691497 @1691497/ <p> This is an overview of key players in the modern history of intelligence testing many of whom you may already be familiar with from their work on other aspects of psychology . <h> 1 . Francis Galton : The 1st Modern Attempt ( late 1800s ) <p> Intelligence tests are grounded in the work of Francis Galton in the late 19th century . Galton is considered to be the father of the study of individual differences and , incidentally was the half-cousin of Charles Darwin . For Galton , measurement of intelligence was to be as direct as possible a measure of underlying intelligence . Hence , Galton suggested reaction time as a feasible approach and pursued various sensori-motor measurements . <p> Interestingly , more contemporary " Galton-like " approaches are being pursued by psychologists such as Arthur Jensen and Mike Andersen who assert that they are assessing the integrity of the central nervous system - inherent capabilities ( Intelligence A ) - as opposed to manifestations of intelligence in everyday life ( Intelligence B ) . ( Weinberg , 1989 ) . <h> 2 . Alfred Binet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Alfred Binet is celebrated in history as the man who created the first ' intelligence test ' in the form as we know them today . He is commonly known as the " father " of IQ testing . In 1904 , Binet was commissioned by the French Ministry of Public Instruction to develop techniques for identifying primary grade children whose lack of success in normal classrooms suggested the need for some form of special education ( Gould , 1981 ) . In 1905 he produced the Binet-Simon scale with Theodore Simon - the first intelligence test . Binet took a pragmatic approach , choosing a series of 30 short tasks related to everyday problems of life ( e.g. attend to simple instructions <p> name parts of the body <p> compare lengths and weights <p> counting coins , <p> assessing which of several faces is ' prettier ' , <p> naming objects in a picture , <p> digit span ( the number of digits a person can recall after being shown a long list ) , <p> word definition <p> filling in the missing words in sentences , etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning . <p> The tests were arranged so as to be of increasing difficulty . Each level of tests matched a specific developmental level - i.e. all tests at a given level were capable of being solved by any normal child in that specific age-group . <p> This was a turning point in psychology : A new type of test had been produced in which the average level of performance was the criterion . In 1908 the test was revised and then again in 1911 . This edition was the model for many future tests . The test results proved to be correlated with other criteria ( e.g. results of school examinations , assessments of teachers , etc. ) <h> 3 &amp; 4 . Terman ( 1916 ) and Stern ( 1912 ) <p> Lewis Terman ( 1877-1956 ) of Stanford University in the US decided to use Binet 's test . He found that the Paris-developed age norms did n't work very well for Californian school children . So he revised the test : adapted some items , added other items , established new age norms , and extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This became the Stanford-Binet revision in 1916 . In this revision the Intelligence quotient first appeared . The Intelligence Quotient or IQ was a score meant to quantify intellectual functioning to allow comparison among individuals . To arrive at an IQ score , Terman relied on a formula expressing the relation between an individuals mental age and chronological age developed in 1912 in Germany by Wilhelm Stern : 1912 Wilhelm Stern proposed the following formula : IQ = mental age x 100 chronological age <p> This formula works fairly well for children but not for adults ( Thomson , 1968 ; Weinberg , 1989 ) <h> 5 . Yerkes : Army Tests ( WWI ) <p> The US army at the beginning of WWI was faced with the problem of assessing the intelligence of great numbers of recruits in order to screen , classify , and assign them to suitable tasks . The Stanford-Binet test required a highly trained person for individual administration - thus it would prove time consuming and costly for large-scale use . <p> So , when the US entered WWI in 1917 a committee was appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of the war . Head of this committee was Robert Yerkes . His brief was to develop group intelligence testing . <p> Robert Yerkes , a psychologist and army major , assembled a staff of 40 psychologists including Terman to develop a group intelligence test . This resulted in the Army Alpha and Army Beta tests . The Beta was a version of the Alpha specifically for use with non-English-speaking and illiterate persons . Instructions to those taking the Beta were given by demonstration or pantomime , rather than orally or in writing . <p> In the end , over a million people were tested , but not until late in the war . Thus the work actually had little effect on the war , but did a great deal to enhance the status of psychology . After the war , industry , business and education saw potential value of psychological testing <p> Note that the validity of the Beta test , in particular , has since been questioned rather damningly by Gould ( 1981 ) . <h> 6 . Charles Spearman : " g " ( 1920s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been very pragmatic - i.e. tests were developed for particular needs . However , another approach to understanding intelligence , involved analysing data that was already collected . <p> Charles Spearman ( 1927 ) analysed the relations among experimental intelligence tests using ' factor analysis ' . He argued that , as a rule , people who do well on some intelligence tests also do well on a variety of intellectual tasks vocabulary and mathematical and spatial abilities . And if people did poorly on an intelligence test , then they also tended to do poorly on other intellectual tests . That is , he observed correlations among performance on a variety of intellectual tasks . <p> Thus , he proposed , a ' two-factor ' theory of intelligence : <p> - General Ability ( g ) : which was required for performance of mental tests of all kinds ; he called this a kind of ' mental energy ' that underlies the specific factors - Special Abilities : which were required for performance on just one kind of mental test . - e.g. Scores on a verbal comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are also affected by ones specific ability to perform verbal comprehension tasks . <p> But the main thrust of Spearman 's analysis was this idea of a general intellectual capacity . This formed a major theoretical platform for many subsequent approaches to intelligence . <p> It might be also noted , however , that Spearman was perhaps excessively enthusiastic about g . For example , he advocated restricting voting rights to people whose g exceeded a certain level , and he was a eugenicist ( eugenics comes from the Greek " eugenes " meaning well-born ) - arguing that only people with a certain level of g should be allowed to have offspring . <p> Another test designer was David Wechsler . Wechsler felt that the Binet scales were too verbally loaded for use with adults , so he designed an instrument with sub-tests to measure both verbal and nonverbal abilities , largely borrowing from many other tests , such as the US Army Alpha test . He adopted a mean score of 100 , since the Stanford-Binet metric had become universally accepted . The original Weschsler-Bellevue test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In 1949 , Wechsler produced the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ( WISC ) , which competed with the Stanford-Binet test . In 1955 , he produced a revision of the adult scales named the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( WAIS ) . And later he produced a scale which could be used with pre-primary children . These scales have all been revised , but still show a distinct resemblance to the original 1939 scale . <h> 8 . Thurstone : Primary Mental Abilities ( 1930s ) <p> Another ' factor analyst ' , Thurstone ( 1938 ) , accepted Spearman 's hypothesis of a general factor . But he disputed its importance . He argued that g is in fact a second order factor or phenomenon - one which arises only because the primary or ' first-order ' factors are related to one another . Thus , Thurstone identified 7 ' primary mental abilities ' which he judged to be more important . These were : <p> So , Thurstone 's approach constituted the first multi-factor approach to intelligence . <p> Thurstone 's tests have largely dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to more accurately predict academic or occupational performance than general intelligence was not fulfilled . <p> Nevertheless , the main argument and findings are important : that intelligence is better described and measured by considering distinct primary mental abilities , rather than a single factor g which does not provide specific information about specific intelligences. ( see Flanagan , Genshaft &amp; Harrison , 1997 ; Murphy &amp; Davidshofer , 1998 ) . <h> 9 . Raymond Cattell : Fluid &amp; Crystallised Intelligence ( 1960s ) <p> Raymond Cattell ( 1963 ) not to be confused with James McKeen Cattell , a contemporary of Galton 's who was also significantly involved in early attempts at psychological measurement suggested that there are two related but distinct components of g : fluid and crystallised intelligence . <p> Fluid : ability to see relationships , as in analogies and letter and number series = primary reasoning ability <p> Crystallised : acquired knowledge and skills = factual knowledge <p> Fluid intelligence decreases with age and crystallised intelligence increases with age . Thus mathematicians and scientists , who need fluid intelligence , produce their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of history , philosophy and literature produce their best work in their 40s , 50s and beyond as they have accumulated more knowledge . Interestingly , poets , who depend more on fluid than crystallised intelligence , produce their best work earlier than prose authors : this has been observed in all cultures , languages and throughout history . <h> 10 . Guilford : many , many factors ! ( 1960s - present ) <p> Guilford ( 1967 ; 1988 ) parted company from the majority of factorial theorists by refusing to acknowledge the existence of any general factor at all . Instead , he proposed that intelligence comprises 180 elementary abilities . The 180 elementary abilities are made up of a combination of three dimensions which he calls : - operations : what a person does ( 6-types ) - contents : the material on which operations are performed ( 5-types ) - products : the form in which the information is stored and processes ( 6-types ) . Guilford proposed that each combination of a specific operation , a specific type of content and a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6x5x6 = 180 ) . In later versions of his theory he proposed even more types of intelligence . <p> Due largely to the practical implications of such a model , Guilford 's theory has not significantly influenced psychological testing of intelligence . <h> 11 &amp; 12 . Vernon &amp; Carroll : Hierarchical Approaches ( 1960s - present ) <p> Probably the most widely accepted factorial description of intelligence is a hierarchical one , e.g. Vernon ( 1960 , 1965 , 1971 ) and Carroll ( 1993 ) . Vernon accepted , in a sense , that both Spearman ( single g factor ) and Thurstone ( multiple primary mental abilities ) were right . Vernon suggested that intelligence can be described as comprising abilities at varying levels of generality : - at the highest level of generality ( i.e. top of the hierarchy ) is g as defined by Spearman ) ; - at the next level are ' major group ' factors , such as : - verbal-educational ability the kind of ability needed for successful performance in courses such as English , history , and social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance in courses such as draughtsmanship and car mechanics ; - at the next level are ' minor group ' factors , which can obtained by subdividing the major group factors ; - and at the lowest ( the bottom of the hierarchy ) are specific factors again of the kind identified by Spearman . <p> So , Vernon inserted 2 further levels between Spearman 's g and specific factors relevant to only one test . <p> These hierarchical descriptions of intelligence may be viewed as filling in the gaps between the extreme approaches of Spearman and Thurstone. <h> 13 . Howard Gardner : Multiple intelligences ( 1980s to the present ) <p> Howard Gardner ( 1983 ; 1993 ) supports Thurstones notion that intelligence comes in different packages . The most widely cited version of Gardners concept of intelligence is that there are seven different types of intelligence . Gardner has played around with this number and suggested a possible one or two more or even ( in 1999 ) the possibility of a smaller number of intelligences . He argues that the seven intelligences are : verbal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social skills ) and intrapersonal ( self-understanding ) functioning . He argues that these different intelligences are independent of one another . Critics argue : not all these things are intelligence : More next week . <h> 14 . Robert Sternberg ( 1970s to present ) <p> Robert Sternberg ( 1977 , 1985 ) together with his colleague Richard Wagner ( 1993 , 1995 ) argues that there are three intelligences :

Although this " scale of experientiality " is often cited , the model appears to have some serious flaws , among them that the model seems inconsistent with Dewey 's more widely accepted theory of experience . <p> Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) contended that there was such a wide range of different programs referred to as experiential that the term " experiential " lacked meaning . In order to clarify what was meant by experience-based education , Gibbons and Hopkins created a " scale of experientiality " . This was a ladder-like or continuum model , illustrating how activities could be seen as varying in their degree of experientiality . <p> The scale of experientiality proposed by Gibbons and Hopkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 100% experiential , a point made powerfully in John Dewey 's theory of experience . One is experientially engaged in every moment , whatever type of experience we may deem that to e . Experientality is n't switched off and on like a light switch . Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1986 ) attempt to grade human activity seems doomed because its of what are ultimately artificial categorizations . Gibbons and Hopkins ' scale also falls prey to Westernized hierarchical thinking in its metaphorical " ladder " promoting " active " experiences as inherently more valuable than " passive " experiences . As Dewey pointed out , experiences are not inherently good or bad , it depends very much on the individual circumstances . <p> Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) desire was to point the different kinds of engagements a person may have with educational experiences . Gibbons and Hopkins demonstrate a preference for activities in which the study is heavily engaged in the planning and process . These are seen are more active , whereas they imply that there are significant limitations and lack of experientiality for education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , even a brief excursion into , for example , post-modern literary analysis reveals that , for reading , reading of texts or watching images , is far from passive -- there is very active construction of meaning and experience by the participant . <p> I first took exception to Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) scale of experientiality when I was passionate about studying films . I had found that film-watching was at times very deeply engaging with the very core of human existence . I knew from psychological studies of films that they could potentially change attitudes , raise heart-beats , sexually arouse , alter emotions , etc . And yet , on Gibbons and Hopkins ' scale of experientiality , watching a film seems is dubbed as low experientiality and implied to be of little experiential value . <p> Thus its a brave and perhaps naive theorist who dares demark certain categories of experience as inherently preferable over others . At the very least , unique individual differences must be recognized . In the world of experience , one woman 's meat is another woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to make ( e.g. , Eastern vs . Western values ) . Experience is a vast playing field . Nevertheless , Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) scale of experientiality was a promising effort to map the territory of experientiality , an issue that has n't attracted much attention . Hopefully more flexible and widely usable maps will be developed that go beyond Gibbons and Hopkins artificial hierarchical arrangement of " passive versus active " experience . <p> Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) suggest five major modes of experiential learning , with each mode have the features of the previous mode , plus a major increase in the supposed " fullness of experience involved " . <p> Psychosocial mode <p> 10 - Social Growth <p> Becomes exemplary community member <p> 9 - Personal Growth <p> Pursues excellence and maturity <p> Development mode <p> 8 - Mastery <p> Develops high standard of quality performance <p> 7 - Competence <p> Strives to become skilful in important activities <p> Productive mode <p> 6 - Challenge <p> Sets difficult but desirable tasks to accomplish <p> 5 - Generative <p> Creates , builds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode <p> 4 - Analytical <p> Studies the setting and experience systematically <p> 3 - Exploratory <p> Plays , experiments , explores , and probes the setting <p> Receptive mode <p> 2 - Spectator <p> Sees the real thing in normal setting <p> 1 - Stimulated <p> Sees motives , TV , and slides <p> Figure 1 . Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) scale of experientiality <p> A good summary of the Gibbons and Hopkin 's model is provided by Priest and Gass ( 1997 , pp. 143-144 ) : <p> In an attempt to avoid increasing confusion surrounding the definition and applications of experiential education , Gibbons and Hopkins ( 1980 ) developed a scale of experientiality that outlined various degrees of experiential programming . Their scale refers to the among of actual experience in the learning situation . Five criteria determine this amount , including the degree to which : <p> experience was mediated , that is , the more " direct " the experience , the more experiential , <p> client was involved in the planning and execution of the experience <p> client was responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mastering the experience to fullest extent possible , and <p> experience enabled clients to grow in directions that were helpful to them <p> Based on these five criteria , the authors identified five increasing modes of experientiality : receptive , analytic ( examination ) , productive , developmental , and psychosocial . With two submodes for each mode , a total of ten submodes represented a continuum of experientiality from least to most experiential ... Each of these mode and submode experiences has a cumulative effect , with the more experiential modes possessing the elements of less experiential modes beneath them ( see Figure ) . <p> In the receptive mode , experiences , or representatives of them , are presented to learners who remain a passive audience throughout . In these simulated experiences , learners passive experience slides , pictures , films , or other simulations of reality . In the spectator experience , learners experience the objects of the study , but only as an observer . <p> In the analytic ( examination ) mode , learners conduct field studies in which they apply theoretical knowledge and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the environment , or solve a practical problem . The exploratory experience exposes learners to interesting sites and encourages them to explore the possibilities of materials at hand . In the analytical experience , learners study systematically , often applying theory to solve problems in practical situations . <p> In the productive mode , learners generate products , activities , and services that have been assigned by you or that they have devised themselves . The generative paradigm allows people to learn by building , creating , composing , organizing , or otherwise generating products in appropriate settings . Naturally , the challenge experience challenges them or allows them to challenge themselves as they pursue goals of productivity or accomplishment that they must struggle to achieve . <p> In the developmental mode , learners pursue excellent in a particularly field by designing and implementing long-term programs of study , activity , and patience . The competence experience encouragers learners to focus on a particular field , to practice skills involved , to become absorbed in the activity , and to achieve recognized competence in it . The mastery experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set high personal standards in their pursuit of excellence in a field of activity , and to become a master of their chosen area . <p> In the psychosocial mode , learners understand themselves and their relationships with others . They accomplish tasks presented by their particular stage of development towards maturity and make contributions to the lives of others . The personal growth experience enables learns to gain understanding of themselves as unique individuals and to gain knowledge of effectively and responsibility directing their own activities . The social growth experience enables learners to become more socially competent with people of all ages and to act in more socially-responsible ways , using their accomplishments in service to the community . <p> Criteria for Selecting Level of Experience . When designing educational experiences , it is important to consider not only the level of involvement for each experience , but also the standards of quality for the experience and the learners ' ability to respond . For example , observing a live presentation by " Bill Nye the Science Guy " might rank low on a scale of experientiality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if learners are not prepared for or capable of responding to Nye 's presentation , the experience will be low on a scale of readiness to learn . The same can be said for the environment in which the experience is facilitated . Watching the presentation on television will have a much different effect on the learner than watching it live on stage . <p> When matching experiences with content , one must begin by establishing a range of experientiality for the unit . To facilitate the process , Gibbons ( 1980 ) has adapted this aspect of decision-making to the following hierarchy of experiences : <p> Receptive mode . Experiences , or representations of them , are presented to learners , who remain a passive audience throughout . <p> Spectator experience . Learners experience the object of study with all senses , but as observers . <p> Analytical mode . Learners conduct field studies in which they apply theoretical knowledge and skill in order to study some event , analyze some aspect of the environment , or solve some practical problem . <p> Exploratory experience . Learners are exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials at hand . <p> Challenge experience . Learners are challenged to pursue goals of productivity and accomplishment . <p> Developmental mode . Learners pursue excellence in a particular field by designing and implementing long-term programs of study , activity , and practice . <p> Competence experience . Learners focus on a particular field , practice the skills involved , become absorbed in the activity , and achieve recognized competence . <p> Mastery experience . Learners go beyond competence , developing commitment to a set of high personal standards of excellence . <p> Psychological Mode . Learners learn to understand themselves and their relationships with others . They accomplish the tasks presented by their stage of development toward maturity and make contributions to the lives of others . <p> Personal growth experience . Learners gain understanding of themselves as unique individuals and learn to direct their own activities effectively and responsibly . <p> Social growth experience . Learners become more socially competent with people of all ages and act in more socially responsible ways , using their accomplishments in service to the community . <p> According to Gibbons ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience increases , the learner takes on more responsibility for learning . At an introductory level , an experience at the lower end of the scale may be quite appropriate . On the other hand , if a unit builds on previous knowledge gains and is designed for highly motivated and competent learners , experiences should be at the higher end of the scale . <p> Gibbons ( 1990 ) cautions curriculum designers to view his hierarchy in relative terms rather than absolutes . In the real world , learning does not take place at just one level of experience . Rather , it functions as a range of experiences that reflect the interests and expertise of the learners . The same is true for an instructional unit . If it is to be truly experiential , it should present a range of activities that reflect the level at which the content is addressed , the interests and abilities of the learners , and the environment in which the learning will take place . <p> Elements of Experience . Gibbons ( 1990 ) defines the elements of experience as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the nature of the activities selected , the skills to be applied through the activities , and the way in which the activities are facilitated ... Gibbons illustrates how higher levels of experience require a more sustained number of defining elements ( activities and skills ) . <p> The stages of Mastery and Competence mark degrees of expertise in the application of a selected set of skills through a sustained and facilitated pattern of experience . Learning to function as an expert has traditionally been accomplished through apprenticeship . In such a system , the beginner , faced with clearly defined content that comprises a craft or trade , is guided through a clearly defined set of skill-building activities leading from apprenticeship to journeyman to mastery . The lower level Exploratory stage may call for nothing more than , for example , a career exploration day for ninth grade students .

" - Richard Dawkins , The Evolutionary Future of Man , ( go to Future Psychological Evolution ) <h> Introduction <p> Evolutionary perspectives on human psychology form part of the more general theory of natural selection . To understand evolutionary psychology , it is necessary to have a basic understanding of genes , inheritance , and the principles of natural selection ( go to the 4 principles of natural selection ) . Using these basic concepts , more complex explanations can be constructed about how different aspects of human psychology have come about . Such insights and understandings can be found in a range of diverse , but related fields , including : <p> evolutionary psychology ( evolutionary understandings of human psychology ; some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a concept which has sparked considerable intellectual controversy ; for more , go to the Evolution of Evolutionary Psychology ) <p> anthropology ( the study of human societies ) <p> paleo-psychology ( the psychology of prehistorical human beings ) <p> ethnobotany ( the use of plants in primitive societies ) <p> behavioral genetics ( compare similarities in personality between individuals who are and are not genetically related , or related to a different degree ) <p> Whilst it has been long recognized that human morphology is a function of evolutionary selection , it is only more recently that human behavior and consciousness have come to be examined in light of their evolutionary adaptivity ( Panksepp &amp; Panksepp , 2000 ) . <p> Such understandings , however , can be quite profound and consequently also quite controversial . The kinds of questions that fall within the province of evolutionary psychology include : <p> How , why , and when did human consciousness evolve ? <p> Why are there notable differences between the psychology of men and women ? ( such as greater outward hostility by males and greater neuroticism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly negative , destructive human behaviors such as aggression , self-harm , etc. ? <p> What are the adaptive explanations for human behaviors which seem , at least on the surface , somewhat at odds with " survival of the fittest " notions , e.g. , altruism , anorexia , etc . <p> Is human consciousness evolving ? What can be learned from past patterns of evolution in the human psyche and what can we expect for the future of human consciousness ? <p> Are there real psychological differences between the races ? If so , what are they ? <p> To what extent is human intelligence inherited and to what extent is it influenced by the environment ? <p> What are the evolutionary psychological explanations for the common human phobias ? <p> Note that many psychologists , sociologists , anthropologists , and others are wary of evolutionary perspectives on the human mind and behavior ( e.g. , see Panksepp &amp; Panksepp , 2000 ) . The main criticism seems to be that evolutionary psychological theories generalized too much from studies of animals and the general principles of evolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also political , social , and religious criticims ( not to mention personal ones ! ) - essentially they amount to a rejection of a perceived neo-Darwinianism in evolutionary psychology . What does this mean ? Basically , it seems there is a fear that it is harmful to society for humans to be understood as creatures whose behavior can be understood as at least partially the result of genetic and biological causes . <p> These debates exist at least in part because it is incredibly difficult to actually test out many evolutionary psychological ideas in a conventional , scientific , experimental sense . Evidence comes from a range of sources , including fossils ( e.g. , brain size ) , genetics , animal studies , and paleo-anthropological research ( e.g. , study of human artificacts , including tools and art ) and related evidence about climate , plant and animal evolution . Conventional psychological research in evolutionary psychology , however , is often necessarily correlational , which is generally not as strong as experimental research . Exciting new evidence . For example , recent modern forms of forensic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-preserved human remains . Read about the remarkable recent find of " Otzi " , a 5,300 year body of a man frozen in ice in the European alps . <p> The evolutionary evidence for human psychology , then , is necessarily based on an incomplete jig-saw puzzle , which inevitably includes conjecture and somewhat circumstantial evidence , mixed with scientific findings , as well as more esoteric psychological insights and speculations . <p> The real potential , I think , of evolutionary psychology is when it is explored in a multi-disciplinary sense . For example , the work by Jung on collective unconsciousness and archetypal theory , which was extended in a social and cultural sense by Joseph Campbell 's work on cross-cultural mythic similarities , provide rich material for integration with evolutionary psychological principles . This idea is consistent with a comment by Richard Dawkins ( in the Evolutionary Future of Man ) that " it may be that brain hardware has co-evolved with the internal virtual worlds that it creates . This can be called hardware-software co-evolution . " Thus , viewed as a platform for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of understanding a long history of the species , into which can be situated more specific , micro-theories , such as from cognitive psychology , behavioral psychology , etc . <p> Nevertheless , we must not lose sight of the many alternative explanations , such as social psychological principles ( e.g. , social learning ) for explaining behaviors such as aggression . There are many aspects of personality and behavior which are often best understood , at least from a practical , , functional , or clinical perspective , as caused by biological , cognitive learning , or humanistic forces . Equally , however , we must examine in a fair light , the extensive , eclectic evidence and rather all-encompassing explanations suggested by the greatest scientific theory of all time - natural selection . The forces of nature , expressed over time in the genetic code , according many evolutionary psychologists , play ( and continue to play ) a fundamental and often underestimated role in the shaping the human psyche and human behavior . <p> The major assumption in evolutionary psychology is that psychological adaptations are not qualitatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to argue for mind-body dualism , this assumption can be readily accepted . <p> Psychological adaptations basically refer to human 's methods of inputting information , processing and analyzing information , the making of decisions , and the execution of behavior . Behavior , remember , includes all actions , including acts of language and communication , reproductive behaviors , food-seeking behavior , and so on . <h> Examples of important aspects of human psychology which are unique &amp; have evolutionary explanations <p> There are several aspects of human psychology which make homo sapiens stand apart from the other animals , and which attract much of the focus of those interested in evolutionary psychology : <p> human intellectual capacity - overall brain size , large frontal cortex , more convolutions , etc. all imply that a greater capacity to process information have been arguably the most dominant psychological characteristic selected for during the evolution of the human species <p> the sophisticated use of language - interestingly , humans seem to come pre-wired to learn language , but not with a pre-set language . During the remarkable period of neural plasticity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater capacity for acquiring language that at any other period of his/her life . <p> capacity for emotion and affect - humans are fundamentally emotional animals , experiencing great heights of ecstasy and depths of depression . Compared to other animals , humans are both more likely to have excesses of joy ( e.g. manic depression ) and excesses of sadness ( e.g. , unipolar depression ) . No other animals are known to intentionally kill themselves . Humans are the only animals known to exhibit such destructive tendencies towards their surrounding environment and fellow members of their species . On the other hand , humans also display at times some remarkably altruistic behaviors which , on the surface , may not seem particularly adaptive . <p> complex courting &amp; sexual behaviors - humans are the only animal , it seems , which are so addicted to sex , even when it does n't seem to be for reproductive purposes ; human females are the only primates to have permanently engorged breasts , and the male penis is proportionately larger than in any other species . Did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " sex " , closely followed by " porn " and other related words ( to see a full list , go to www.wordtracker.com ) . It seems that the sexual drive in humans interacts with the large intellectual capacity , the sophisticated use of language ( think of all the love poetry out there ) , the drive to care ( and the need to care for offspring for a long-time ) , and the capacity for emotion . No other animals exhibit the complex sexual disorders and deviations evident in humans . There is considerable examination of human aggression &amp; violence , including sexual aggression such as rape , within evolutionary psychology . <h> How can we understand the phenomenon of obesity in Western society ? <p> Obesity in western society is quite readily explained by evolutionary principles .

Likewise Australia is one of the most obese countries in the world , with obesity in children increasing by 100% in the past 10 years ; 25% of Australian children are overweight or obese . Obviously obesity is not particularly adaptive , but cultural evolution has outstripped genetic evolution , giving rise to this phenomenon ( Feist &amp; Feist , 2002 ) . <h> How can we understand the phenomenon of anorexia nervosa in Western society ? <p> The evolutionary explanation for obesity seems obvious and straightforward . However , a greater challenge for evolutionary psychology would be to account for anorexia nervosa , seemingly the opposite problem . <p> During human evolution it would not have been adaptive to always eat everything in site , but rather it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as eating up during more abundant times . Thus , the capacity to " go without food " would have been important for survival . This is a difficult proposition , because it implies the development of a higher instinct than the immediate instinct to gratify hunger . <p> Given that humans are creatures that evolved in social groups , presumably the capacity to " go without food " for the sake of the group would have been socially reinforced . Those who did n't possess this capacity would have been punished by the group , if they had sufficient power . Thus , it can seen that eating food would have evolved with a complex individual and social psychology associated . The immediate pleasure and gratification associated with eating would have been tempered by higher faculties and social norms emphasizing eating a minimum for current survival in order to help maximize longer likelihood of survival . <p> In the modern human , if there is an overactive super-ego or over susceptibility to social messages about " eating less " , then maladaptive behavior behavior patterns such anorexia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food despite hunger " disposition which has evolved in humans . <p> Human Behavior &amp; Evolution Society - an interdisciplinary , international society of researchers , primarily from the social and biological sciences , who use evolutionary theory to discover human nature - including evolved cognitive , behavioral , emotional and sexual adaptations . <p> Future Psychological Evolution - John Stewart - virtually all other evolutionary psychology theories focus on what happened in the past that can explain modern humans ; this paper argues that we need to look more closely at the future and the possible paths for human evolution

Personality Debate <h> Introduction <p> Is people 's behavior best explained by the circumstances and situation they find themselves in , or by their personality , which guides behavior no matter what the situtation is ? <p> Does the personality of an individual transcend the immediate situation and moment to provide a consistent guide to his or her actions or is what a person does completely dependent upon the situation he or she is in at the time ? <p> For example , if you were placed on the sport field or in militiary combat , you would probably behave more aggressively than normal . In fact , even quite passive and submissive people become aggressive given sufficient provocation . This suggests that behavior may be explained by understanding not only the personality , but how also how we react to the environment and circumstances . We term this emphasis on the role of situation circumstances , a " situational " view of personality . <p> The dispositional approach to personality , by definition , tries to identify those psychological characteristics which remain relatively stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have blinded personality theorists and researchers to the role that changing situational circumstances plays . <p> The question provoked by the situation vs. person debate is to what extent to which behavior can be predicted by personality vs. the extent to which behavior arises from the dynamics of the situation and to what extent from the inherent characteristics of the person themselves . <p> The person vs. situation debate has been hotly contested topic since the late 1960 's . Perhaps not suprisingly , the answer is that behavior is best understood and both situation and person . Thus , as with the nature versus nurture debate , we may be better off studying the interaction more closely , to better understand the phenonmena of human behavior and experience . <h> Mischel ( 1968 ) sparks personality vs. situation debate <p> In 1968 , Walter Mischel challenged the assumption that personality determined behavior , and instead claimed that people 's behavior from situation to situation was variable and depended on the situational circumstances . In other words , the " situation " view is that behavior depends on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on long-held characteristic personality styles and is consistently displayed no matter the situation . <p> Mischel reviewed the research literature and concluded that the correlation between personality and behavior was .20 to .40 - overall .30 , which is small . This was used to argue that since there was only a small correlation between personality and behavior , then the role of personality was not all that important and the variability of behavior must be due to the situational demands ( and to error ) . <p> Another prominent situationist , Richard Nisbett ( 1980 , cited in Funder , 2001 ) revised the personality-behaviour correlation upwards to .40 , but this is still a small relationship . If you use the common squared correlation method there is an upper limit of only 16% i.e. only 16% of a persons behaviour can be explained by personality . Using the Binomial effect size its 20% , so the implication is that personality does n't explain much of behavior . <p> However , those on the side of personality argue that : <p> the low personality-behavior correlations do not prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmeasured personality variable ; i.e. stronger proof would be a high correlation between situational variable and behaviour ) . <p> the real relationship between personality and behavior is higher than .40 ; i.e. , .4 is a lower-bound estimate due to error in research instruments , etc. , <p> .40 is not small ; this can be translated ( using effect sizes ) to saying that knowing someone 's personality characteristics allows prediction of behavior about 70% of the time ( assuming we could predict behavior 50% of the time by chance ) ( Funder , 2001 ) <p> that personality is a strong predictor of behavior across all situations ( i.e. , of someone 's overall trends ) , but is not a strong predictor of an individual 's behavior at a specific time in a specific situation ; e.g. , personality more accurately predicts how happy you will be over the next year than it will predict how happy you are today <p> people choose their situations , and these choices reflect personality ; e.g. , an introvert may choose to work in a library <p> there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personality traits ; so even though the correlations may seem low , personality traits are still the most useful psychological tools <p> personality research has improved considerably since the research reviewed by Mischel ; this helped Nisbett to upwardly revise the relationship to .40 . That was over 20 years ago , and quite possibly the figure could be revised upwards further based on more recent research ; however this view can be contrasted by the publication bias in research journals towards results which show significant relationships ! <h> Interactionism : The interactionist perspective on the situation vs. person debate <p> Traits and Situations interact to influence behaviour - how else could it be ? .

So anxiety may show up as a predictor of behavior some situations , and not others . Also , some situations allow expression of personality , others provoke narrower range of behaviour . <p> In summary : <p> Some individuals show more consistent behavior <p> Traits may only emerge in some situations ; traits do not have a constant influence on behavior , their influence waxes and wanes <p> Some situations allow expression of personal , whilst others provoke a narrow range of behavior ( e.g. , situation is strongly predictive of behavior of people hostage during a hijacking of a plane , whereas personality is strongly predictive of behavior during an exploratory art therapy session ) <p> People display their traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , e.g. , choice of career , choice of relationship , choice of lifestyle , etc . <p> In conclusion , the person-situation debate has lead to more dynamic approach to understanding how personality traits and situations interact to produce a persons behaviour

Is using an empirical tool even the most appropriate method for examining your research question ? You may wish to consider a qualitative or mixed mode approach . In the past , outdoor education research has , arguably , over-emphasized measurement of self-esteem and self-concept outcomes and under-emphasized potentially interesting outcomes such as quality of relationships and personal skills . <p> On outdoor and experience-based programs , instruments are often administered in field settings ( e.g. in the bush , on board a boat , in various weather conditions ) , on multiple occasions ( e.g. pre-program , first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followup ) and to a wide range of participants ( e.g. people with learning disabilities , people without English as their first language , school children , corporate managers ) .

In fact , many of the studies do not utilize such basic design considerations as random assignment and appropriate comparison groups.In addition , no studies have been conducted comparing AT to other established forms of treatment.There are also very limited data available on client characteristics and of those which are available , none are based on clinically relevant diagnostic criteria.The theoretical basis of AT is also in the early developmental stages and is unsupported by any empirical data . <p> While this type of treatment , its claims of efficacy , and its theoretical basis are as yet scientifically unsupported , it is a treatment whose use is clearly on the rise.In fact , in 1993 , the Association for Experiential Education ( AEE ) published a Directory of Experiential Therapy and Adventure-based Counseling Programs which included 257 programs nationwide which were self-identified as adventure-based therapy programs.This number has almost certainly expanded since that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Annual International Adventure Therapy Conference in Munich , Germany ( March , 2000 ) , there were presenters from 43 different countries.This is indicative of the expansion of adventure-based therapy internationally as well . <p> Given the increasingly widespread use of such interventions , and its particular use as a government funded alternative to juvenile incarceration , it is important to subject the field to informed critical analysis.The AT field is early in its development and as such , the methodologies and theories are still rudimentary in their development and usage.However , with the relatively recent growth of such treatment programs this type of scientific scrutiny is vital and can potentially contribute towards an overall movement in AT research toward the direction of scientific rigor . Such an increase in rigor is necessary given the state of the literature , and will be thoroughly addressed in later sections . <p> Beyond the lack of solid empirical data , one additional problem with much of the AT literature that must be noted early in this discussion is that the intended audience for the literature has often been practicing adventure therapists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as laypersons who are attempting to gain a basic understanding of adventure-based therapy.Rarely , if ever , has writing in AT been targeted at an audience highly trained and versed in both clinical theories and empirically-based research , and there are very few published articles addressing adventure-based therapy in the well-respected APA journals . <p> In some ways , this has resulted in much of the literature specific to AT having been developed in a type of vacuum.This literature has rarely been subjected to close scrutiny and a portion of it can be thought of in some ways as analogous to " preaching to the choir " . As such , much of the language used and the concepts put forward by may seem overly simplistic to an audience highly skilled in the aforementioned areas of clinical theory and empirical social science.With this in mind , the reader is cautioned to recognize that the early developmental context referred to above has provided the environment for much of this published writing.Unfortunately , this is simply reflective of the state of the field . <p> To complete this overview , it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articulating both the proposed theoretical basis of AT and the empirical studies that have been conducted in this area , it is important to note that this articulation is not intended as a statement of support for adventure-based therapy as an independent therapeutic modality unsupported by other forms of treatment.It is also important to note that is this discussion is in no way intended to advocate for the usage of such treatment without ongoing empirical examination . <p> Chapter 2 <p> ADVENTURE-BASED THERAPY <p> This chapter will first focus on examining the history , the theory , and the definition of AT.In an attempt at further characterizing the field , the next section is compares some AT practices to standard mental health practices.This contributes to defining AT by briefly focusing on one specific area that AT may fall short of standard practice , in a sense defining AT by what it is not.The final two sections will focus on the goals of AT and the specific characteristics of AT . <p> History of Adventure-Based Therapy <p> Kurt Hahn , the founder of Outward Bound , is credited as being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context.In the 1920s , Hahn , a German educator , founded the Salem school in Germany ; teaching his students to discover their own strengths and identities through examination of their own personal experience.After being imprisoned and later deported from Germany by the Nazis in the late 1930s , he immigrated to England where , in 1942 , he established a program to " prepare young British seamen to survive the rigors of sailing the North Atlantic during World War II " ( Bacon &amp; Kimball , 1989 , p. 117 ) . Through this program , he noted that while it appeared that older sailors were able to survive extreme levels of stress and trauma , many of the younger and stronger sailors would die under the same conditions.From this observation , Hahn concluded that mental aspects were equally as important as physical fitness in survival situations . <p> Hahn combined his educational philosophies , wilderness and rescue training , and principles of social cooperation into an expanded program designed to help the seamen increase their resilience when experiencing the demands of war and seamanship.Hahn later utilized these same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of which the first US branch opened in the early 1960s.The program spread rapidly and by the 1970s there were numerous agencies using Outward Bound based approaches in various forms and environments ( Bacon &amp; Kimball , 1989 ) . Since that time , Outward Bound has evolved into an international corporation serving a wide variety of populations including youth at risk , cancer victims , sexual abuse survivors , and persons with eating disorders.Many other populations have been served , as well as the general public . <p> Theoretical Background <p> Experiential Education <p> AT is rooted tradition of " experiential education " philosophies ( Kraft &amp; Sakofs , 1985 ) , defined as " learning by doing , with reflection " ( Gass , 1993 ) . Early roots of experiential education can be traced to the educational writings of Dewey ( Kraft &amp; Sakofs , 1985 ) . This experiential learning tradition is based on the belief that learning is a result of direct experience , and includes the premise that persons learn best when they have multiple senses actively involved in learning.By increasing the intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant " engages all sensory systems in a learning and change process " ( Crisp , 1998 ) . Psychological research on information processing provides some support of this premise , indicating that multi-sensory processing accounts for a higher level of cognitive activity and increased memory.Applied specifically to the context of AT , the multi-sensory level of the therapeutic experience inherent in adventure activities may accountfor the high level of changereported by practitioners ( Crisp , 1998 ) , thereby suggesting that " integration of experience may be more deeply anchored for the client because of this broad sensory base . " ( Crisp , 1998 , p. 67 ) . <p> Experiential education theory also postulates that active learning is often more valuable for the learner because the participant is directly responsible for and involved in the process.In addition , experiential learning theory is based on the belief that individuals learn when placed outside of their comfort zones and into a state of dissonance.Learning is then assumed to occur through the necessary changes required to achieve personal equilibrium ( i.e. , modern dissonance theory ) . Kraft and Sakofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education process : <p> " 1 . The learner is a participant rather than a spectator in learning . <p> 2 .

" ( cited in Gass , 1993 , p. 4 ) . <p> In experiential classrooms , individuals are placed in " real life " situations in which it is necessary to employ problem-solving or otherwise creative methods of working with the environment or context at hand.Therefore , effective experiential activities involve the participant in situations in which they must take some form of action to successfully cope with their surroundings.Such activities may take the form of outdoor pursuits such as hiking , rock climbing , or kayaking , but also include team-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the advent of Outward Bound , these types of experiential education programs have been expanded into therapeutic settings.Gass ( 1993 ) has reworked the above experiential education principles and discusses how these principles can be applied to therapy . <p> " 1 .

Functional change must have present as well as future relevance for clients and their society . " ( Gass , 1993 , p. 5 ) <p> It is interesting that when examining the ideas stated above by Gass ( 1993 ) it is clear to the critical reader that these are not unique to AT.In actuality , one can see even from these most basic statements that the theory of AT builds on the foundations and well-established premises of cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interpersonal aspects of object relations theory.Therefore , it appears from this definition that what AT may offer is a potentially unique medium for the implementation of therapeutic processes assumed to be present in many therapeutic orientations . <p> Definition of Adventure-Based Therapy <p> Also referred to as " wilderness therapy , " " therapeutic adventure , " " adventure therapy , " and " adventure-based counseling , " AT is a therapeutic modality combining presumed therapeutic benefits of the adventure experiences and activities with those of more traditional modes of therapy.AT utilizes a therapeutic focus and integrates group level processing and individual psychotherapy sessions as part of an overall therapeutic milieu.While specific types of facilitation occur directly related to the activities ( see section on facilitation ) , this processing is not associated exclusively with the activities alone.Rather , the activities can also be conceptualized as a catalyst for the processing which occurs before , during , and after activities ; a catalyst which provides concrete examples of the immediate consequences associated with individual and group actions that can be referred to by both the client and the therapist.Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and branch into other areas of relevance for clients . <p> As such , AT lends itself well to multimodal treatment and can be utilized as an intervention independent from other treatments or as an adjunct to other well-established treatments.Importantly , therapists are able to use any type of therapeutic orientation they adhere to in the processing that occurs around the activities . This view contrasts with the commonly held assumption that the postulated change which may occur in AT is singularly related to the activity participation . <p> Ringer ( 1994 ) defines AT as a generic term referring to a class of change-oriented , group-based experiential learning processes that occur in the context of a contractual , empowering , and empathic professional relationship.Elements of this definition are not unique to AT and can be assumed generally in many therapeutic traditions.However , the emphasis on " group-based experiential learning processes " in a typically outdoor and active setting is clearly a combination differentiating AT from other forms of therapy . <p> Interestingly , Ringers definition does not mention " adventure . " This purposeful omission challenges one common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish their goals , clients must necessarily subject themselves to adrenaline-fueled feats of daring and technical skill.The fact that " adventure " is not seen as an end unto itself distinguishes it from other types of outdoor programs devoid of therapeutic focus . In line with this definition , adventure or outdoor experiences alone are not assumed to be sufficient to facilitate deep-level therapeutic growth and change.Instead , it is the processing of the actual experience with the client that promotes the therapeutic process . Therefore , the use of the word " adventure " may in fact be misleading and terms such as " activity-based psychotherapy " may be more appropriate ( Gillis , 1992 ) . Unfortunately however , this term has not become one of common usage in the literature and adventure-based therapy , with all of its connotations , is the name that has become standard . <p> In examining this discussion , it can be seen that there are problems with delineating distinct and defining parameters of AT.To address this problem , professionals within the field have been involved in an ongoing debate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique to AT as a treatment modality.Such a definition must necessarily incorporate widely accepted therapeutic principles while also differentiating AT from other therapies and from other types of outdoor adventure programs.In an attempt to focus such definitions , Simon Crisp ( 1997 ) has stated on the Association for Experiential Education listserve what he believes to be a succinct and viable definition : <p> " 1 ) Wilderness and/or Adventure methods are utilized in the service oftherapeutic practice.Therapeutic practice involves ; <p> a ) the identification of a problem the client presents with , <p> b ) application of a theoretical framework based on a theory ofpersonality , behavioral and psychological problems and process of change that explains the origin and nature of the problem , <p> c ) selection of strategies of client management and method(s) of intervention which logically relate to b ) , <p> d ) strategies and methods are routinely reviewed and modified according to client need . <p> 2 ) Professional relationship between therapist and client with the following characteristics ; <p> a ) therapist brings to the relationship training and experience necessary and appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to manage any potentially competing needs of the therapist , <p> b ) a contract is formed between therapist and client about the aims , limits , methods and expected outcomes of therapy , <p> c ) therapist works towards the best interests of the client and holds this at all times the over-riding principle in determining the actions of the therapist , <p> Once again , the singularly unique aspect of this definition is the emphasis on activities as a means of accomplishing the other common therapeutic goals.Again , it is also this focus on the use of activities to accomplish said goals which seems to differentiate AT from most other therapeutic orientations . <p> Based on this , perhaps AT can be best be seen as an activity-based approach to treatment that attempts to meet similar goals as do other treatments.Therefore , what must be parceled out as theoretically unique to AT is the mechanism by which AT can accomplish these goals in ways that are more efficacious than other treatments for particular clients.This is a question that remains as yet unanswered.Simply put , it is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answering the questions posed to all other treatments : Is this treatment effective ? For whom , and under what circumstances ? <p> Thought of in this way , AT can begin to be seen as more similar to other types of treatments than different.The logical assumption should follow then that AT is assumed to operate under the same scientific and clinical umbrella as other mental health treatments , and obviously practitioners of AT shouldbe held accountable to the same standards as other practicing mental health **27;458;TOOLONG , in reality this is not always the case.For reasons that remain unclear , AT is often presented by its proponents as though it is a unique and separate entity , an entity somehow not responsible for upholding such standards.This presents a clear contradiction between established standards of mental health practice and AT . <p> Discrepancies between AT and standard mental health practices can seen through an examination of the training levels of adventure-based practitioners in therapeutic skills , the required adherence to ethical standards in the AT field , and the level of theoretical knowledge of adventure-based practitioners . <p> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training levels of adventure therapists themselves.Given that AT does focus on therapeutic goals similar to other mental health treatments , it seems necessary that persons employed in the role of adventure therapists are skilled not only in " hard skills " ( i.e. , wilderness experience , climbing , hiking , team initiatives ) , but are also skilled in the techniques and applications of psychological intervention ( soft skills ) . <p> Unfortunately , it appears that reality may not reflect this combined necessity.Berman ( 1995 ) conducted a straightforward survey asking about the training of adventure-based therapy practitioners.Bermans results show that many adventure-based therapy programs in the United States employ persons to facilitate adventure-based programming who are lacking in such " soft skill " areas.This is clearly a concern for the continued use of AT treatments , and could potentially open such programs to the possibility of serious ethical violations . <p> While such concerns are currently being addressed by the leaders within the field ( for further information , the reader is urged to contact the Therapeutic Adventure Professional Group(TAPG)of the Association for Experiential Education ( AEE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to well-justified criticism.Given the fact that the AT field is in its early developmental stages , such issues undoubtedly will continue to arise until a solid set of mandates and guidelines regarding such competencies are established . <p> Related to this , another discrepancy between AT and mental health is that while at present such a set of ethical guidelines for AT do exist , they are not actually enforceable.Unlike the APA ethical standards , an AT professional can not be held accountable to maintain these ethical principles in their practice , nor is there any governing body which limits which types of programs can call themselves " adventure-based therapy " . If it can be assumed that AT should be thought of as similar to other types of mental health treatment , it is logical to wonder why the AT field is not held to such standards.Presently however , this question remains to be answered.The area of ethics in AT will be further discussed later in this paper . <p> Another seemingly obvious standard of mental health treatment commonly overlooked in the AT field is the assumption that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological theory and application.However , a survey of 31 wilderness programs specializing in adventure-based therapy found that very few of the programs contacted were able to identify what type of therapeutic process they were utilizing with their clients and tended to have little or no research to support their programs ( Davis-Berman , Berman , &amp; Capone , 1994 ) . This is another clear problem within the field.While there are numerous attempts being made currently to delineate the theories and processes of AT , it appears that much of this information is not reaching the actual practitioners.It seems possible , therefore , that there are many people working within the AT field who may be operating outside of the realm of accepted clinical practice . <p> It is of note that while AT defines itself as meeting the same therapeutic goals as other treatment modalities , the above two studies provide evidence suggesting that there may be an underlying belief in the field that AT is unique enough that it is unnecessary for adventure-based practitioners to be held to the same standards of expertise as other therapists.Not only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a fairly naive claim.The informed reader obviously wonders how is it that adventure therapists can be expected to work effectively with clients and meet stated therapeutic goals at least as well as other treatments when many of the therapists themselves are simply not as well grounded in the theories and practice of **27;487;TOOLONG , leading members of the AT field are involved in an ongoing debate regarding this issue , with some advocating for a required level of competency as reflected by a specified level of training , and others who advocate " training through experience " . This discussion may reflect a presently existing division one finds between those AT practitioners who have followed the more established route of academic and clinical training and those who have learned their clinical skills through direct experience . <p> From the standpoint of clinical psychology , this appears to be simply a moot point.The eventual outcome to such a debate obviously must involve holding AT to the same standards of care as are other mental health treatments.Simply put , while AT may have some unique elements , to be instituted as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established therapeutic standards as do all other treatments.However , in order for this change to occur there must be further efforts made to establish a sense that AT shares more similarities with other mental health treatments than was previously assumed.It is only with the establishment of such a belief , as well as a clear semantic and theoretical link , that AT will in actuality operate under the aforementioned umbrella of scientific and clinical practice . <p> As the discussion in this and the preceding section illustrate , the AT field has not reached consensus on what constitutes an adventure therapy program in definition , theory , or in application.In addition , there appears to be an underlying assumption that while AT may involve working towards therapeutic goals and may endorse therapeutic principles , AT is somehow uniquely different enough to not be held accountable to the same standards as are other mental health treatments . <p> To add to the confusion on this level , a wide variety of organizations and agencies consider themselves to fall within the realm of adventure-based therapy.Such organizations employ widely differing levels and types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact sense of what is meant by the term " adventure-based therapy.Therefore , it may be helpful to focus the discussion on the goals of AT.The reader will also be given increased knowledge and understanding of the goals of AT in the following section which delineates the specific characteristics of AT . <p> Goals of Adventure-Based Therapy <p> AT proponents have articulated a variety of goals that may be associated with the approach . While recognizably unsupported by solid empirical data , as well as not clearly linked to the reduction of pathological symptomatology , the following section will broadly summarize these interconnected goals . First , clients are thought to generally increase in self-awareness , leading to an increased recognition of behavioral consequences and available choices ; second , clients are thought to learn healthier coping strategies leading to increased environmental control ; third , through AT , clients are thought to be provided tangible evidence of success , thereby disproving negative self-conceptions and leading to a more positive self-concept ; fourth , clients are thought to learn creative problem-solving , communication , and cooperation skills ; and fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths , weaknesses , and self-imposed limitations.Ultimately , this increased awareness is thought to lead to better decision-making . <p> Overall , AT programs have the overriding goal of an increasing self-awareness in a variety of domains.In line with this , it is thought by AT theorists that connections between behavior and the results of such behavior become more apparent.Therefore , clients can be provided with concrete examples of dysfunctional behavior and shown that alternative behavioral and interpersonal choices can lead to success.Relatedly , Bandoroff ( 1989 ) argues that adventure activities , with the feedback and consequences available through such experiences , provide learning that enables participants to begin regulating their own behavior.Amesberger ( 1998 ) expands on this goal , noting that AT involves : <p> " . the reflection on internalized norms and values with the aim to support a person to find new and more suitable structures for his or her life.Destructive and dysfunctional behaviors or emotions should be recognized in their effects , as well as helpful and effective ones . " ( p.29 ) . <p> Of note is the fact that these tenets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor ( 1989 ) postulates that that the exposure to uncertainty or ambiguity accompanied by increases in levels of confidence and skill that can be achieved through the AT process will facilitate a healthier coping response . It is believed that as clients learn and use new modes of coping they gain greater control of their environment ( Nadler &amp; Luckner , 1992 ) . It is hoped that by coping with the treatment environment in new ways , clients can learn to achieve increased personal and environmental control outside of the treatment.This is an experience which may be novel for many clients . <p> According to Herbert ( 1996 ) , through AT " persons challenge themselves , and in doing so , ( re ) learn something about themselves . " ( p.5 ) . To accomplish this , mastery tasks , or initial successes , associated with the activities counteract and disprove internally focused negative self-evaluations , learned helplessness , and dependency ( Kimball &amp; Bacon , 1993 ) at a time when such processes may be intensely activated.This heightened activation combined with concrete evidence of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also associated with the mastery tasks can then serve as additional reinforcers to support changed behaviors.Thus , it is a circular process of interpersonal and intrapersonal activation , success , and reinforcement . <p> Priest and Baillie ( 1987 ) discuss additional possibilities for client change , stating that " The aim of adventure education is to create astute adventurers : people who are correct in their perceptions of individual competence and situational risk " ( p. 18 ) . ) . Relatedly , through AT , clients can learn skills related to problem-solving , cooperation , communication , and facing challenge ( Herbert , 1996 ) . It is thought that through this process , clients learn to more realistically appraise their own personal strengths and weaknesses , both on a personal and an interpersonal level . <p> Through this process , clients begin to recognize their own self-imposed limitations and increase in their awareness of available choices , thus becoming better able to accept responsibility for their level of success or failure . As clients increase in this self-knowledge and self-awareness , it is believed that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important skills many clients lack . Moreover , Taylor ( 1989 ) notes that the increased levels of confidence , skill , and self-awareness that participants may gain through AT encourages clients to see uncertainty as a challenge and not a threat , a change with potentially far-reaching positive consequences for clients . <p> Ultimately , these proposed changes can perhaps be summarized in this inherent underlying assumption embedded within the adventure-based therapy literature : the assumption that by becoming aware of available choices , and by experimenting with different behaviors in a novel environment where one is receiving immediate and realistic feedback , clients can learn to actively influence their probability of success.Furthermore , through AT clients learn to demonstrate personal competencies , build upon skills , accept personal responsibility , more accurately assess themselves , and maintain a higher degree of control over their environment.It is also believed that having an increased capacity to regulate ones own behavior will facilitate further increases in levels of self-awareness , competence and a more internal sense of control of ones own world . <p> It is important to note once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , statements such as above with their emphasis on self-awareness and the interpretations of challenge vs. threat carry clear elements of humanistic theory , and the focus on self-knowledge and the increased awareness of available choices directly parallels the humanistic tradition ( Csikszentmihaly , 1990 ; Raskin , &amp; Rogers , 1989 ; Maslow , 1971 ) . In addition , one can see elements of cognitive , behavioral , and object relations theory embedded in this discussion of the goals of AT.Such similarities will be summarized in detail in a later section . <p> It is also important to point out that the discussion of the goals of AT involves sweeping and unsubstantiated claims with little empirical support.In addition , in the examination of such goals one can see very little that is focused on the alleviation symptomatology specifically relevant to psychopathology.In some ways this parallels the state of the literature , as it will be seen that no studies have utilized measures of clinically relevant symptom reduction.However , given the possibility of parallels between AT and such well-established therapeutic orientations , it may have potential therapeutic benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT and other therapeutic traditions will be seen in throughout the discussion of the specific characteristics of AT . <p> First , adventure programs range in scope from those which incorporate adventure-based techniques with more traditional modes of therapy to those that utilize full-scale extended expeditioning as their therapeutic medium.These types of programs are differentiated based on where the therapy is taking place , for what length of time the client <p> is involved , and what types of programming are being utilized ( Gillis , 1995 ) . As Gass ( 1993 ) suggests , three main areas exist within the adventure-based therapy field.These include ( a ) activity-based psychotherapy , ( b ) wilderness therapy , and ( c ) long-term residential camping <p> Given the diversity of programs , it is important to be clear as to what type of program is being referred to under this broad rubric of " adventure-based therapy " when considering AT from a scientific **25;516;TOOLONG , this distinction is not always clearly noted and can be difficult to determine when examining the literature . <p> Activity-based psychotherapy <p> Activity-based psychotherapy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the client or at another nearby facility designed for such interventions.This type of therapy utilizes adventure activities as one type of intervention in the clients overall treatment plan.The AT intervention is typically one day in duration and is used an adjunct to concurrent inpatient or outpatient treatment , although the client may participate in more than one such program ( Banaka &amp; Young , 1985 ; Witman , 1987 ; Witman &amp; Preskanis , 1996 ) . <p> This type of format is often used in inpatient settings , but can also be used in combination with outpatient psychotherapy.The experiences tend to be contrived ( i.e. the facility and initiatives are developed specifically for such an intervention ) , and focus on team games and problem-solving.These types of activities can also be used in conjunction with high or low challenge ropes courses . <p> Crisp ( 1997 ) more fully defines this type of adventure-based therapy by its " emphasis on the contrived nature of the task , the artificiality of the environment and the structure and parameters of the activity being determined by the therapist. " ( p.58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the particular activities are often a specific outcome.These outcomes are typically planned for , and influence the choosing of the activities by the therapist . <p> While the activities chosen in this type of intervention may indeed be quite unique to AT , the conscious use of therapeutic technique designed to work towards a specific outcome is obviously not unique to this type of therapy . In addition , it can be noted that potentially all therapeutic situations can be thought of as contrived , again leading one to wonder how AT is unique in this way . <p> With regards to research design , this type of treatment has been utilized in efficacy studies of adventure-based therapy with participants from typically higher risk groups , ( e.g. , psychiatric populations ( Banaka &amp; Young , 1985 ; Witman , 1987 ; Witman &amp; Preskanis , 1996 ) ) . Comparisons can be made between groups who participate in an adventure-based intervention as an adjunct to other treatment vs. those who participate in the standard treatment alone . Statements such as these are provided at this point in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader.A complete discussion ofthe research-based literature will follow in a later section . <p> Wilderness therapy <p> The second format discussed by Gass ( 1993 ) is wilderness therapy , and this type of program is most typically associated with the general term " adventure-based therapy " . Such programs can be easily utilized as an independent treatment and are commonly seen in the efficacy literature for AT . <p> In wilderness therapy , programs utilize an expedition-oriented format in remote settings and treatment traditionally lasts anywhere from 7 to 31 days , although programs also utilize alternative lengths . These programs typically follow an Outward Bound type model , and the teaching and practicing of wilderness skills is an important aspect.Not only is the learning of these skills necessary for the clients survival and comfort , but it is also believed that this learning provides an opportunity for clients to increase their skill base and thus their own individual level of perceived competence ( i.e. , self-efficacy theory ) . This format also provides experiences that may have more personal and concrete consequences for the participant , i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as allowing for full and extended immersion in the experience . <p> The learning of such skills is thought to combine with the interpersonal learning achieved through the group interaction.Activity outcomes are often related to patterns of behaving within the group and the reenactment of social roles seen in such a group situation.Change is seen to emerge from interpersonal and intrapersonal insight , increases in perceived self-efficacy , and the process of the group over time . Because of the nature of the intervention , groups remain intact , thereby potentially fostering an intensification of the group experience . <p> One problem with these types of programs is that follow-up tends to be limited and conducted by professionals who have not been involved in the wilderness experience.Such professionals may be unfamiliar with the clients experience and therefore less able to build on the treatment gains experienced by the client . From both a research and a clinical standpoint , this lack of follow-up provides significant problems when evaluating long-term treatment gains associated with this type of program ( Wichman , 1991 ) . <p> Long-term residential <p> The third type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tended to be used primarily with youth at risk and adjudicated adolescents.Program length varies , ranging from several months to over a year.Such programs are characterized by Buie(1996) as utilizing considerable acreage , having a permanent base camp , and temporary camp sites built by campers ( typically tent-covered wood platforms ) . Clients are responsible for providing for their own survival needs and , according to Gass ( 1993 ) " the client change is seen to be associated with the development of a positive peer culture , confronting the problems associated with day-to day living , and dealing with existing natural consequences " ( p. 10 ) . Education in traditional school subjects is also provided during such programs . <p> If left without further explanation , this definition suggests that while these programs may operate in a different setting than typical non-therapeutic residential facilities for children ( e.g. , boarding schools ) , there may be no clear difference between such programs and any other type of residential atmosphere.However , again it must be made clear that such programs have a stated therapeutic emphasis and therefore attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and change.As can be assumed , however , it is often unclear to what degree and in what way this emphasis is adhered to . <p> Research designs based on both of the latter programs typically compare persons who have been involved in an adventure program with those who have been involved in some otherrestricted setting for similar lengths of time , i.e. , incarceration , probation or juvenile detention ( Castellano &amp; Soderstrom , 1992 ; Kelley &amp; Baer ; 1971 ; Willman &amp; Chun , 1973 ) . Given the high levels of criminal involvement and societal dysfunction often found with the clientele typically referred to such programs , objective outcomes measures such as recidivism rates , academic success or employment rates have been used as a basis of comparison . <p> Group Focus <p> The second characteristic of AT is group focus , and AT is almost exclusively a group process.As in many therapeutic settings groups typically range from 6 to 14 people ( Kimball &amp; Bacon , 1993 ) and the clients tend to be somewhat heterogeneous in terms of therapeutic issue or diagnostic category @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ component is a vital part of the overall therapeutic aspect of the intervention . Similar to any therapy group , the group in AT provides support , feedback , and a potent interpersonal context.Uniquely , however , in AT specific activities are presented to the group as challenges to be overcome , and success depends on each individual member participating in their completion ( e.g. , by standing on a platform , scaling a rock face , or negotiating unmarked terrain to a specified destination ) . In order to master any of the challenges , the group must cooperate , apply skills , creatively problem solve , and rely upon each other . <p> Herbert ( 1996 ) discusses more completely the issue of creative problem solving as it relates to AT.He notes that each activity is concrete and has a clear beginning and a clear ending.Problems can typically be solved in a number of ways , and there are also a number of ways that groups and individual clients tend to approach a problem unsuccessfully , thereby increasing the level of perceived difficulty of the activity.What is expressly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for the tasks to be completed , all participants must play a role in order for the group to succeed ( i.e. , utilization of superordinate goals ) . Therefore , activities require the group to discuss and decide on different strategies , implement such strategies , modify those that are unsuccessful , or implement new strategies ; all potentially important skills for clients to practice.Not only does this process involve the completion of the task , but group dynamics involved in the decision making process are closely followed and the interpersonal aspects of the activity are then processed by the therapist in a similar fashion as any other type of group therapy . <p> Drawing from the theory of interpersonal group psychotherapy ( Yalom , 1995 ) , it is further thought that group focus leads to the intensive activation of a clients interpersonal patterns , which , in conjunction with appropriate therapeutic processing , facilitates therapeutic change.This assumption also echoes Yaloms " social microcosm " theory of group functioning in which it is assumed that " patients will , over time , automatically and inevitably begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yalom , 1995 , p. 28 ) . Therefore , this group context provides an environment for the enactment of individual pathology and the problem-solving associated with the group process may lead to further concrete representations of this , as well as provide an opportunity for the practice of new behaviors . <p> Also similar to interpersonal group psychotherapy , it is not just WHAT happens during this problem-solving process but HOW it happens in the group that is of interest.For example , how did the group decide on which strategy to use ? Who was the leader ? Did some clients participate in the decision making process more fully than others ? Is this a common response for them or a new behavior ? What was it like to work through this problem ? How did it feel ? Each of these components , along with others that can lead into deeper level therapeutic processing , provide a rich opportunity to observe and process a clients relational processes . <p> Finally , it is also thought that the more active and concrete nature of the " task " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does traditional group **25;543;TOOLONG , such higher levels of involvement have been shown to be a significant predictor of psychotherapy outcome ( Gomes-Schwartz , 1978 ) While these same principles operate in traditional group psychotherapy , realistically certain members in a traditional therapy group can achieve " success " regardless of the level of participation of others.While it can recognizably be argued that a skilled group therapist in any therapy setting can involve the entire group , or in fact involve the entire group around any individuals clients lack of participation , it may be that this type of " non-participation " with its impact on the group is less likely to occur in an AT setting.Simply put , it is thought to be more difficult for a client to remain unengaged as the activities themselves necessitate participation.There are no data , however to support such a statement . <p> Processing <p> Another descriptor of AT programs is that a great deal of time is spent processing the experience with clients and facilitating the transfer of learning into a clients daily life . It must be noted again that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned in the introduction , the activities can be conceptualized as a catalyst for the processing which occurs before , during , and after activities , a catalyst which alsoprovides concrete examples of the consequences associated with individual and group actions.It must also be noted once again that this processing is not necessarily associated exclusively with the activities ; a statement made as a direct contrast to the view that any change which may occur is theoretically associated with the activities themselves . <p> To engage in this processing , tools such as individual psychotherapy , group psychotherapy therapy , journal writing , individual time for reflection , modeling , self-disclosure , and metaphoric processing ( Gass , 1993 ) may be utilized throughout the course of an AT program.While the techniques listed above may be familiar to clinicians , the extensive use of metaphoric processing is an aspect of AT which may be fairly unique in its application and thus warrants further discussion <p> Metaphors are used with the client to link the learning and growth provided through the adventure-based experience to situations found in his or her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the maintenance of any gains that may be achieved through the adventure-based intervention.It is important to recognize that this perceived lack of relevance to realistic situations the client may encounter is one of the most commonly put forth criticisms of AT.Advocates of AT claim that this metaphoric processing provides the necessary link between the AT experience and the " real-world " , however there is no data available as to the efficacy of such processing in generalizing treatment gains . <p> When using metaphor in AT , the therapist takes on the role of conduit , actively helping the client to build such **25;570;TOOLONG practitioners postulate that the use of metaphor helps the client to continue utilizing the learning and growth provided through the adventure experience in ongoing andproductive ways.It is believed that through this use of metaphor , adventure-based experiences can help provide clients with concrete tools designed to help them to successfully negotiate their own personal challenges upon completion of the **26;597;TOOLONG , this belief that therapy can functionto provide the mechanism for clients to continue their own change process outside of the therapeutic context mirrors cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in cognitive therapy , " Patients are told that the a goal of therapy is for them to learn to be their own therapists . " ( p. 305 ) . <p> Processing in AT will be revisited in the discussion of AT facilitation occurring later in this paper . <p> Applicability to Multimodal Treatment <p> Another characteristic of AT is its applicability to multimodal treatment.As aforementioned , AT can be used either as an independent intervention or as an adjunct treatment.Importantly , the focus on group level processing in combination with the individual psychotherapy which takes place around the activities does not preclude a therapist from utilizing standard and accepted treatment orientations and practices in the therapy associated with the activities . <p> Sequencing of activities <p> Fourth , in order to allow for the group to develop the skills and the level of cohesion necessary to achieve success in the activities , such activities are incrementally sequenced in difficulty.This sequencing also provides initial successes , or " mastery tasks " , fostering feelings of capability while counteracting internal negative self-evaluations , learned helplessness , and dependency ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mastery task ( success ) concurrent with the activation of negative self-evaluations is an important component for the therapeutic change thought to be associated with AT , as the mastery task is thought to provide an opportunity to tangibly disprove such evaluations.It is the therapists role to facilitate such a transfer as such connections are not believed to be an automatic reaction to the activities . <p> Conversely , activities presented with inappropriate sequencing can be counter-productive and reinforce negative self-conceptions for individual participants . The activation of such negative internal processes for a client without the opportunity to counteract such feelings with success can further reinforce existing beliefs in personal ineffectiveness.In addition , such negative conceptions can also permeate the development of a group identity.Therefore , it is vital that the therapist not create a situation in which the group repeatedly experiences failure as it can be recognized that this dynamic can carry the highest potential for emotional harm and would be likely to limit therapeutic potential.As with other types of therapy groups , it is recognized that success is often dependent on the facilitator remaining aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 ) and taking this into consideration when planning . <p> Perceived Risk <p> While sequencing is extremely important and requires the therapists clinical judgment and acumen to choose activities wisely , on the surface challenges are often structured so as to appear to be impossible or dangerous to the group . In actuality , the challenges are in fact low in actual risk but high in perceived risk , with the term " risk " referring to not only physical risk , but also intra- and interpersonal risk as well.For example , standing on a platform and falling backwards into the arms of others requires more trust than utilizing another persons support to cross a log.However , at earlier points in a groups development this need to be supported ( i.e. , depend or rely on someone else ) , could be perceived as carrying as high a level of interpersonal risk , along with the associated intrapersonal risk , as any physical activity for some clients . <p> Conceptually , perceived risk is thought to create tension and disequlibrium within the individual , ultimately leading him or her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . With regard to this conviction , Herbert ( 1996 ) notes that " In order for a person to achieve equilibrium , persons are challenged to make necessary adaptations. " ( 1996 , p. 5 ) . He goes on to state that " Adventure-based work recognizes that it is the effort to overcome obstacles and , in effect , overcoming ones own fears that is critical . " ( p. 5 ) . Through this combined of process of relieving dissonance and overcoming fears , it is commonly believed in AT that clients are shown that old patterns are destructive and new choices can lead to more successful behaviors . <p> So central to AT is this perception of risk , that Amesberger ( 1998 ) notes " The most striking difference between adventure-based therapy and traditional psychotherapy is the clients strong involvement in a reality that is neither harmless nor perfectly safe " ( p. 29 ) . One could argue however , that this belief also permeates traditional psychotherapy as well.For many clients , the deep level of emotional sharing found in a traditional therapy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early sharing of basic information with a therapist may be as threatening as later sharing of seemingly much more personal information.Therefore , it seems this difference may be much less apparent than Amesberger believes . <p> Unfamiliar Environment <p> Another core characteristic of AT is that it is usually conducted in an environment unfamiliar to the client . This use of an unfamiliar and novel environment is thought to unbalance the client , further activating their underlying inter- and intrapersonal processes.It is hypothesized that the client has no familiar template from which to draw their reactions to the new situation , and thus it is the conviction of AT practitioners that the client must eventually rely on potentially new and ideally healthier ways of behaving in order to achieve success ( Gass , 1993 ) and equilibrium.In a sense , this can be perhaps be conceptualized as providing an opportunity for clients to be free of past determinism . <p> This conception appears , however , to overlook an important intermediate step.While this unfamiliarity with the environment may ultimately result in new ways of behaving for a client , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 ) implies that prior to engaging in new behaviors , the client will first begin utilizing earlier learned and more dysfunctional ways of behaving.It can be assumed that only through this activation of dysfunctional ways of behaving will more functional ways become apparent to the client . <p> To link AT with the social microcosm theory , the assumption underlying the unfamiliar environment in AT theory is that by taking a person out of their normal context , the client is exposed to new situations where old patterns of coping probably will not work.If this does result in dysfunctional behavior being evidenced first ( social microcosm theory ) , it is possible that through the AT activities the client may be provided with more tangible evidence of the consequences of dysfunctional behavior than is typically provided in group psychotherapy.These concrete consequences of dysfunctional behavior in combination with a novel environment , an environment which may necessitate new ways of behaving , could provide an impetus for change.In addition , the group can also provide reinforcement for new ways of behaving.Theoretically , this can also be seen as similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental unfamiliarity in AT is also thought to allow for the client to experience the therapy not only without drawing from their standard template of behaviors , but also without drawing from their typical expectations and defenses.Therefore , it is thought that this unfamiliarity may allow for a client to approach the therapeutic experience with less of a defensive posture.Golins ( 1978 ) contrasts AT to traditional therapy methods on this issue of defensive posturing , noting that " traditional individual or group therapy methods may be particularly threatening for persons who have difficulty expressing themselves and/or establishing new relationships . " ( cited in Herbert , 1996 , p. 6 ) . To compare this with traditional psychotherapy research , Orlinsky and Howard ( 1986 ) have found " the dimension of the patients openness vs. defensiveness to be related to outcome " ( p. 219 ) . If in fact AT does work to lower defenses , this finding suggests that lowered defensiveness may contribute to a more positive outcome for clients.As with other claims of AT however , this premise is purely speculative in nature . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that when a clients defenses do inevitably become activated , the therapist and the client may be provided with tangible examples through the activities and the interpersonal interactions around the activities of the ways in which defenses operate in a clients life.In addition , the unfamiliar and novel AT setting may then provide a situation that is less threatening for some clients to experiment with new and less defensive behavioral and relational patterns . <p> While such opportunities are available in traditional settings based on interactions with the therapist or other group members , the examples and outcomes of behaviors and defenses may be more concrete for the client in the AT setting , particularly for those with a low level of insight capability.In this sense the activities can be perhaps again be best conceptualized as the catalyst for such defensive reactions with the therapist and the group providing the medium for the activation , the recognition , and the processing of such defenses . Viewed in this way , AT parallels many of the principles of interpersonally-oriented individual and group psychotherapy.Given this relationship , it is possible that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the achievement of similar goals as group psychotherapy which may work better for some clients.As with all of these theoretical postulations , however , this is purely suppositional as there are no data to provide support for this contention . <p> Finally , while it could be argued that the atmosphere of a traditional therapy session may be completely alien to one unfamiliar with the process , this unfamiliarity is realistically based on the relationship between the therapist and the client as opposed to the actual office setting.AT settings , in contrast , are typically unfamiliar physically as well.It is thought that these multiple levels of unfamiliarity add an additional level of noveltyto the AT experience beyond that found in the standard therapy room.In addition , the AT setting often changes , either literally or through the choice of activities , and therefore is felt to remain somewhat more novel throughout the process than traditional psychotherapy . <p> The Relationship between perceivedrisk and environmental unfamiliarity <p> Herbert ( 1996 ) discusses how the unfamiliarity of the environment and the high level of perceived risk interact and how this combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interaction as " challenge/stress " , and reviews how it is believed by AT proponents that the dissonance created by the unfamiliar environment , in combination with a high level of perceived risk , results in an increased intensity of the activation of interpersonal and intrapersonal processes . Herbert goes on to discuss this interaction and subsequent activation as a potential change mechanism , noting that " Stressful experiences that are likely to occur throughout an adventure based program serve as impetus for individual change " ( p.5 ) . Gass ( 1993 ) also discusses this phenomena , referring to this type of stress as positive stress , or " eustress " <p> It is this belief in client dissonance and the associated intensive activation of intra- and interpersonal processes , the unbalancing based on the lack of familiar " templates " , the opportunity for new behavioral choices , the reinforcement provided by the activities , and the associated processing that moves AT most completely away from outdoor adventure programs and into the realm of therapy . Again it should be noted that while the form this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this may found in any type of therapeutic setting . <p> Nevertheless , it is thought in the AT literature that clients who make new behavioral choices in order to complete a novel challenge they had interpreted as carrying a high level of risk , particularly one they had previously thought themselves incapable of , are thought to see themselves differently with the ultimate goal being the recognition of their own self-imposed limitations.Through seeing themselves differently , clients gain in self- esteem , and such gains which have been linked to decreases in anxiety and depression ( Gilbert , 1992 ) . Relatedly , Priest ( 1993 ) has suggested that participants will be able to influence their probability of success in an adventure experience if they have realistic perceptions of risk involved in the choices they make , as well as a realistic sense of their own competence . In addition , on the intrapersonal level the client is presented with concrete examples of whether their typically negative self-evaluations and self-expectations triggered through the interaction of perceived risk and environmental unfamiliarity have been proven or disproven . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk is the recognition that clients are given the option of " challenge by choice " . This allows for a client to choose not to participate in an activity with which they are not personally comfortable.It is important to recognize that the choice to not participate in an activity is not necessarily negative and may have as many therapeutic implications as participation ( i.e. , choosing not to participate is still a choice ) . Such an instance may potentially reflect positive steps toward clients asserting their personal boundaries by recognizing and acting on personal discomfort , a potentially important issue for many clients.In such a situation , the therapist should make every effort to include the client in some way , such as spotting or observing . According to Royce ( 1987 ) , " The key to growth in any situation is that the participants should choose to confront their fear rather than being forced to engage in fearful activities.This allows for the individual to take control of their life instead of being other-directed. " ( p.28 ) . <p> As one can perhaps infer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be based not only on the recognition of risk involved in activities and related boundary issues , but also to an extent on the construct of learned helplessness ( Seligman , 1975 ) . Groff and Datillo ( 1998 ) discuss learned helplessness theory as it relates to AT , noting that past experiences leading to attributions which result in feelings of helplessness can generalize to other areas of a persons life , potentially resulting in a decreased motivation to engage in activities of which he or she is unsure of the outcome.As learned helplessness has also been espoused as a causal element in depression , this may be an important link to explore regarding ATs potential for therapeutic change . <p> It is believed that " challenge by choice " can help lead to the recognition of the power of individual choice that can perhaps begin mitigating learned helplessness ( Groff &amp; Dattilo , 1998 ) , thus contributing to the development of a greater sense of control for the client and more realistic cognitive attributions for events.Should such a decrease in learned helplessness occur , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no evidence based on AT to support such a statement , if this proposed phenomena were to occur it seems the theory would predict that through increased recognition of alternative choices ( e.g. , choosing non-participation ) in combination with alterations in attribution styles that may be developed through the processing of such choices , clients may develop an increased sense that their level of personal control can be related to external , specific and unstable causes , as opposed to internal , global and stable causes associated with feelings of lack of control ( Comer , 1998 ) . <p> Schoel et al . ( 1988 ) share this example to illustrate the power of challenge by choice : <p> " A short-term patient from the Institute of Pennsylvania Hospital , a lawyer , was very depressed , denying his problems , not involved in anything , complaining of a bad back , etc. , reluctant to do anything.He eventually tried some of the activities , and on the last day got up on a high element ropes course and completed it.According to the therapist , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all if we had pushed him.The important thing is that we gave him the decision-making power . " ( p. 132 ) . <p> Provision of Concrete Consequences <p> An additional descriptor of the AT approach is that the activities provide an opportunity for positive and negative concrete consequences of a clients behavior to be readily apparent.Beyond those aspects mentioned previously , another important aspect of this characteristic is that individual actions have consequences for both the group as a whole and the individual in relation to the group.A client who is unable to , or chooses not to , work successfully with the group is impacting the entire groups functioning.Therefore , he or she may find his or her place within the group altered , may miss out on the group accomplishment , or even more concretely may have a wet sleeping bag due to not setting up a tent correctly.Conversely , clients also experience the impact of positive behavior as well within the group.Such consequences at the group level mayprovide an opportunity for important developmental learning for individual clients . <p> As a hypothetical example , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participants to pack rain gear on the top of the pack.The group leader is aware that there is potential for a rain storm during the course of the day and hopes to help the participants learn better packing skills . " Jeff " refuses to listen and acts in defiance of the leader , packing all of his rain gear on the bottom of the pack.Later in the pouring rain , Jeff is forced to remove all of the other items from his pack in order to reach his rain gear.The other gear , and Jeff himself , becomes soaked in the process.This gear included some of the dry food that was planned for the groups meal that evening.Justifiably , group members become angry with Jeff and he becomes temporarily ostracized , leading to conflict in the group and consequences for Jeff as a group member.The rainstorm also provided a natural individual consequence to Jeff for not heeding the advice of the group leader . <p> Goal Setting <p> Goal setting in AT involves identifying for each client the objectives of program participation , with the ultimate goal being to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not related to the activities , rather , as with any psychotherapeutic treatment , goals are focused on specific problem areas for individual clients.As with any therapeutic intervention , these goals are developed after consultation with the client and/or the referral source and must be held in the therapists awareness throughout the scope of the intervention.In addition , group goals are also established and often a " full value contract " is decided upon , specifying the parameters of acceptable behavior within the group.This type of contracting maintains that all participants work together as a group to achieve both individual and group goals , adhere to necessary safety guidelines , and give and receive feedback when appropriate ( Schoel et al. , 1988 ) . These guidelines are also set to promote physical and psychological safety for all participants . <p> Trust Building <p> As in any therapeutic process , trust building is a crucial characteristic of AT.Clients must learn not only to trust their therapist , but also to trust and depend on other members of the group , allowing for the closer examination of interpersonal processes related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique to AT but rather mirrors the theory of interpersonally oriented group psychotherapy , and most specifically relates to the stages of therapeutic group development ( Yalom , 1995 ) . <p> The process of building trust is accomplished through the aforementioned sequencing of activities involving an increasing level of cooperation and group interaction . Most adventure-based therapy begins this gradual trust building process by learning basic level information about each participant , allowing for the trust building process to begin in a way that may feel more natural for clients than does traditional group psychotherapy.As the activities progress , a higher level of self-disclosure is required and participants share deeper level experiences and emotions . As previously mentioned in the discussion of defenses , the activity focus of the group may allow an alternate medium for individuals to gradually share parts of themselves without the fear of being ridiculed or laughed at ( Rohnke , 1995 ) . Thereby it is speculated that the activities could provide a vehicle for emotional sharing and closeness for those to whom the more direct approach found in traditional psychotherapy may be overly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptualized as a gateway to interpersonal trust ( Schoel et al. , 1988 ) , with the assumption being that as clients increasingly entrust other group members with their physical safety , they will gradually begin to entrust the group with their emotional safety as well.As overall trust increases , the group becomes more autonomous and self-reliant , as well as more willing to openly communicate.As with a traditional therapy group , it is felt that when the group reaches this level of autonomy that it is the most powerful vehicle for lasting change ( Yalom , 1995 ) . <p> Enjoyment <p> Enjoyment is also a component thought to be inherent in AT , and this is one aspect of AT that may be fairly unique.Simply put , it is felt by supporters of AT that people are more invested in their treatment when it has positive reinforcement , and allowing for parts of therapy simply to be fun may be one way to provide an opportunity for such reinforcement.An increased level of enjoyment may also help in increasing attention levels and is believed potentially to take some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics lightly , this may be a positive step in that it might reduce a clients reluctance to discuss such areas and allow for the discussion of such topics to be initiated more indirectly , leading ultimately to more open discussion of such often avoided topics.This can be seen in some ways as similar to systematic desensitization , where aversive stimuli are paired with relaxation in order to decrease anxiety levels ( i.e. , relaxation during imaginal phobic exposure facilitates emotional processing and thus the extinction rate of the phobic response ) . While this statement is lacking empirical support , in AT this type of enjoyable interaction may function similarly as does relaxation in facilitating therapeutic change . <p> To create such an atmosphere , many activities in the early phases of an adventure-based intervention are designed for the sole purpose of increasing group cohesion through sharing laughter.These activities break the ice and are thought to move the group more quickly and efficiently into the " working phases " of a groups development.Golins ( 1978 ) also suggests that the gamelike atmosphere of such initiatives allows for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reveal themselves.In addition , one can speculate that clients who may process experience in a less verbally oriented manner may participate more fully in this type of intervention.If this were the case , it would perhaps allow for greater growth among those clients for whom traditionally psychotherapy feels too threatening or invasive.Again , however , this statement is purely conjecture , as there are no studies examining this hypothesized phenomena . <p> Peak Experience <p> The final characteristic of adventure-based therapy is peak experience.Herbert states that " the purpose of the peak experience is to provide an opportunity to practice all of the learning that has occurred and apply it to this one intensive challenge . " ( 1996 , p.6 ) . These experiences can consist of an actual " peak ascent " or similar wilderness experience , or can take the form of a group activity utilizing a high degree of cooperation and trust.In both types of experiences , clients experience the challenge as more intense and complex , and these types of experiences are often used as the culmination of the group experience , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the above characteristics , this is the one which may vary the most based in which type of programming format is utilized . <p> While possibly being unique to the actual therapy setting , this search for a peak experience is clearly not unique theoretically to AT.As mentioned above , the emphasis on peak experience as a part of self-actualization is a crucial underlying assumption of humanistic theory ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 ; Maslow , 1971 ) . Maslow discuses the power for growth embedded in such peak experiences at length , noting that " in a fair number of peak experiences , there ensues what I have called the " cognition of being " ( p. 173 ) , noting that this refers to " a technology of happiness " and the avenue to " pure joy " ( p. 174 ) . <p> Again it can be seen throughout this discussion of the characteristics of AT that while AT follows parallel therapeutic principles other forms of treatment , it is clear that the belief in the power of the activities themselves and the context in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illustrative Example <p> To illustrate , Jane is a hypothetical 32 year-old woman who typically blames others for her problems and often uses threats to get her way.Jane has come to therapy because she " has trouble in relationships " and her ultimate goal in therapy is to both understand and change this problem.Imagine Jane , 30-feet up in the air on a high ropes course element.Her heart is pumping , her fears and anxieties are increasing , and she is beginning to become frustrated because she believes that she can not proceed.It is likely that if Jane approaches the situation in her " standard way " , by yelling at others and blaming them for her inability to complete the task , she will remain where she is and only become more entrenched in her spiraling negativity.This behavior will inevitably alienate members of the group , making it unlikely that they will come to her aid and support her in succeeding . <p> The level of risk which Jane perceives in the situation has led to an experience of disequlibrium , or feeling unbalanced , leading to Janes reenactment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no further therapeutic intervention , Jane remains stuck on the ropes course and there is tangible evidence of the consequences for her continued maintenance of old ways of behaving.Should she manage to simply get down off the course , she may have learned something but it is unlikely that the learning will provide lasting characterological change.In fact , an equally likely scenario is that the intervention may be harmful for Jane by reinforcing her negative self-conceptions . <p> However , if the therapist processes this experience with Jane and the group in a way that helps her to recognize her dysfunctional ways of behaving , as well as assisting her to achieve some level of control and an increased willingness to work with others , she is much more likely to complete the activity successfully . This processing may take place later in individual sessions as well.On the group level , other members also provide Jane feedback as to the consequences of her actions , also both while such actions are occurring and after they are completed . <p> Should Jane succeed , such a success will ideally reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as illustrate for her the negative aspects of behaving in her old patterns.If the therapist the therapist were to expand this processing to an exploration of where these dysfunctional patterns originated ( using a psychodynamic orientation ) , Jane could potentially gain insight into these origins and perhaps begin establishing more functional ways of relating to both herself and to others on a level beyond that provided by the activity alone.Should the therapist continue his or her relationship with Jane upon her completion of the AT intervention , such concrete examples provided by the activities could perhaps be referred to as points of reference by both Jane and the therapist.In such an instance , the process of changebeginning for Jane during the course of her AT treatment component could potentially be continued and deepened through this ongoing relationship . <p> What can be seen here is a direct parallel to traditional psychotherapy , with the activity itself simply providing both the catalyst and a concrete external representation of pre-existing issues for Jane.Janes behavior can be explored , as well as her cognitions , affect , and interpersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Jane an opportunity to practice different ways of behaving , thinking , feeling relating , again with tangible and easily seen results . . Over time , the illustrations provided by the activity can be referenced by both Jane and her therapist.Ideally , a skilled therapist builds upon this learning process , allowing for the activities themselves and the processing associated with them become an inextricably linked and circular process.This type of model can be used in any of the aforementioned settings when the actives are processed in a therapeutic manner . <p> Facilitation in Adventure-Based Therapy <p> Facilitation found in AT programs specific to the activities themselves ( i.e. , aside from the group and individual psychotherapy which occurs separately ) , takes a somewhat unique form.As an aside , the reader is again reminded that the individual and group psychotherapy that occurs can also be conducted using therapeutic approaches associated with any orientation . <p> Gass ( 1995 ) notes that there are six different styles of facilitation for adventure-based activities , each of which results in differing levels of emotional processing for clients.As with much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence supporting any advantages or disadvantages associated with any of these styles.The above example will be utilized to illustrate each of the forms . <p> Gass ( 1995 ) notes that the first three styles which will be discussed are primarily characteristic of adventure/outdoor education programs , while the following three are more commonly found in adventure-based therapy programs.In line with this contention , critical readers are likely to see limited therapeutic benefit in the first three styles , but it is important to note that they do in fact exist in some AT programs and therefore must be included in this discussion of facilitation . <p> Gass ( 1995 ) believes there to be significant differences between these first three styles and the following three facilitation styles , stating that the latter styles employ proactive techniques enabling the facilitator to " enhance a clients adventure experience and its future applications " ( p. 2 ) . In addition , he notes that these latter styles have in common a focus on behavior change , and the belief that the experience itself and the processing of the experience is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ( i.e. , debriefing ) . <p> Facilitation Styles in Basic Outdoor Programs <p> Letting the experience speak for itself <p> The first style is " letting the experience speak for itself " . This approach characterizes many adventure programs where the goal of the facilitators is to provide a well-run and meaningful wilderness experience for the participant.Personal insights and understandings are left to the client to recognize individually , and it appears as though the belief is that the inherent value in any AT experience is so powerful that such value will be clear to all participants.The premise is that clients will " learn by doing " and that well-designed and well-sequenced activities will " lead clients to their own insights " ( Gass , 1995 , p. 2 ) . Gass notes that with this type of facilitation , clients may have a positive experience and increase their skill base , but are less likely to learn about themselves or the way in which they interact with others.Referring to the example of Jane , a therapist utilizing this type of facilitation would have let Jane work through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning will naturally occur.This type of facilitation seems to suggest an increased potential for emotional harm to the client.In addition , it clearly overlooks any therapeutic benefit associated with processing.Therefore , it seems as though this type of facilitation would be of limited therapeutic benefit . <p> Speaking for the experience <p> In the second style " speaking for the experience " , the facilitator aids the client in interpretation of the experience.Examples of this may include informing the client of what they may have learned and how they can apply this to their future.Gass ( 1995 ) notes , however , that he believes that telling clients what they have learned may be " disempowering , hamper future opportunities for growth , and alienate the facilitator from the clients . " ( p. 3 ) . In this instance , the therapist would have pointed out to Jane her dysfunctional ways of behaving and told her directly what the implications of such behavior may be . <p> Debriefing the experience <p> Attempts to resolve such issues have led to the third style of facilitation , " debriefing the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of personal issues can lead clients to personalizing and following through on changes they may have recognized a need for , and this method is an attempt to build on this principle . With this style of facilitation , clients are asked to actively reflect on their experience , openly discussing the learning that may have occurred for them.This process is assisted by facilitators who design questions to help clients through this process , and has beenreferred to in the AT literature as the " Outward Bound Plus " model ( Bacon , 1988 ) . Should Jane have been working with a therapist utilizing this facilitation style , she would have been asked a series of questions designed to highlight specific issues and situations that Jane encountered during the activity . <p> Facilitation in Adventure-Based Therapy Programs <p> Directly frontloading the experience <p> Moving into the more therapeutic facilitation approaches , the fourth approach , " directly frontloading the experience " is based on the belief of some practitioners that there may be some benefit in directing the client prior to beginning an activity.The emphasis is on additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debriefing in which the facilitator typically highlights key areas.Gass ( 1995 ) lists five topics which the facilitator may address at this point:1 ) Revisiting the last activity , <p> objectives of the activity , 3 ) motivation for the activity , 4 ) function of specific behaviors they relate to success , and 5 ) dysfunctional behaviors that may hinder success.Through this extra debriefing , the facilitator directs clients towards specific objectives that are based in the facilitators assessment of the groups needs , helping to create a cognitive set for clients to approach the activity with in order to facilitate further change . <p> With this style of facilitation , Jane would have been told about the activity in advance , been given information on what to expect , and discussed actions that may best lead to success.The therapist may also have connected the ropes course activity she was to be involved to prior activities Jane had engaged in during the course of her treatment . <p> Framing the experience <p> Gass ( 1995 ) believes the fifth approach , " Framing the experience " , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , defining isomorphs as " parallel structures proactively introduced by the facilitator so clients can make relevant metaphoric connections to the activity.When these connections are motivating and relevant to the client , the transfer of learning to the clients daily life is enhanced . " ( p. 4 ) . When utilizing this style , prior to the activity the therapist frames the experience in a way that serves as a mirror image to the clients daily life , making connections between the activity and the clients present-life experiences.Therefore , the post-activity debriefing serves primarily as a reinforcer as opposed to the vehicle for change.During this segment of debriefing , clients discuss within the group the connections that they recognized to their daily life.This type of processing introduces the use of metaphor , referred to early in this discourse as the primary means to connect AT activities to a clients " real-life " , and is thought to be most effective when specific changes are sought ( Gass , 1995 ) . <p> A therapist utilizing this type of style may have linked the challenge of the ropes course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for greater relevance and learning associated with the connection to Janes life outside of treatment . <p> Indirectly frontloading the experience <p> The rarest of the facilitations styles discussed by Gass ( 1995 ) is " indirectly frontloading the experience " . This type of facilitation involves an indirect approach to frontloading and may be most useful when facilitators are working with clients who continually re-experience and struggle with difficult issues.Although Gass description of this type of style is somewhat unclear and ambiguous , it appears that what may occur with such a facilitation style is the deliberate creation of situations through the activities to highlight specific areas of dysfunction . <p> In Janes case , the therapist may have first provided a metaphor for Jane linking the activity to her real life , but also used the activity to specifically create a situation for Jane is which she may find her areas of difficulty ( i.e. , interpersonal relationships ) , expressly highlighted . <p> As has been made clear at this point in the discussion , there are many similarities between AT and other types of therapy.The similarities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coping and behavior regulation , a recognition of defenses , an emphasis on actualization through peak experience and self-awareness , the recognition of self-imposed limitations , realistic evaluations of negative self-conceptions , potential cognitive restructuring through changes in attributions , an emphasis on behavior change and the use of concrete consequences and reinforcement , and possible activation of internalized object representations.In addition , the theoretical basis for AT appears to have in fact borrowed heavily from other psychological traditions.While recognizing that the activity focus potentially differentiates AT from psychodynamic , cognitive or cognitive-behavioral , and humanistic , it has been noted in thisdiscussion that the clear differentiating features on the theoretical level appear to be less apparent.The following section will focus further on delineating these similarities in order to begin exploring the mechanism of change that may exist in AT . <p> Within the above discussion of the characteristics of AT can be seen elements of well-established psychological theories.To date , however , there have been no attempts to articulate the change mechanisms of AT in the language of psychological theory . The discussion now turns to connections between AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories.In addition , the power for change which could be associated with the unique therapeutic relationship found in AT is explored.The reader is asked to recognize the acknowledgment that empirical research is clearly necessary in order to validate and further expand any of these ideas.As such , it is known that these comparisons are only speculative and thus they are fairly basic at the present time . <p> Object relations theory <p> There are important parallels between AT and object relations.First , both modalities seek to modify clients internal representations , with object relations targeting " introjects " and AT striving for a new " template " of behavior.Second , both argue that in " unbalancing " clients , there is an important opportunity for change.Third , both frameworks allow for a corrective emotional experience within the context of the therapeutic relationship . Fourth , both provide the opportunity for " practicing " new modes of relating , with object relations heavily utilizing the context of therapeutic relationship itself and AT utilizing the challenges , whose interpersonal and behavioral contexts extend beyond the therapeutic relationship . <p> This is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AT proponents claim that with no familiar template to draw from clients will have to create new ways of behaving.This may , however , be an oversimplification.While indeed clients may ultimately try new behaviors when their old behaviors result in negative consequences , object relations theory would predict an intermediate step in that involvement in a stressful physical and interpersonal situation , without a familiar template to draw from , would be more likely to lead clients to draw from their more primitive and potentially most maladaptive internalized **25;625;TOOLONG , the use of the activities may in actuality result first in movement by clients towards their most well-defended and/or dysfunctional states . The resulting behavioral and emotional manifestations of this would potentially be different depending on the form of an individuals internal representations.Object relations theory then postulates that what is necessary for therapeutic change is corrective emotional experience . <p> To take the AT model an additional step , it may be however that through the combination of activities involving therapeutic goals , challenge and success , group-level processing , interpersonal interactions with both the group and the therapist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after the activities , the client is being provided with increased opportunities for relating to others.These increased opportunities may in actuality lead to opportunities for corrective emotional experience on multiple phenomenological levels.Such opportunities could therefore potentially result in the creation of new internal representations . <p> It is also possible that the combination of behavior , cognition , and affect associated with participation in the activities could more fully engage the client in this therapeutic process , potentially resulting in any corrective emotional experience becoming more anchored for the client through the activation of multiple processes concurrently.The ongoing activities and related therapeutic processing may then provide an opportunity to reinforce the corrective emotional experience over a more continuous period of time , thereby providing a similar opportunity for such change as is theorized to occur as in object relations based therapy . <p> As opposed to the well-articulated change mechanisms that can be found in object relations however , the definitive mechanism of change found in AT is less clear.While object relations theory may echo the AT belief that " unbalancing " is important for growth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic relationship as the change agent.While in object relations based therapy , this relationship provides both the " unbalancer " and the new template for interpersonal behavior and relationships , the existing AT literature does not clearly delineate the change process beyond discussing the power of new learning associated with both the activities and the group process.Indeed , from the perspective of object relations theory it could be argued that the process of replacing such " templates " , or internalized representations , is one that must take place over an extended period of time and involve extensive processing of such representations with a therapist in order to provide the client with a corrective emotional experience and lasting therapeutic change . <p> While this may well be a valid criticism of the AT approach , one is urged to consider the power of combining the two approaches during the AT intervention.As noted , one can speculate that AT activities , both with their unfamiliarity and interpersonal group dynamic , may activate dysfunctional relational patterns towards the self and others based on maladaptive internal **29;652;TOOLONG , however , if in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object relations based processing model which focuses on the relational aspects of the intervention ( activities ) , as well as on the processing of the internalized objects associated with such relational patterns , could potentially provide a way to facilitate lasting change through AT.Such a model could also help facilitate understanding of themechanism of change which may underlie AT . <p> To add an additional perspective to this proposed model , if it is possible that the activities do in fact activate dysfunctional relational patterns ( a goal of object relations ) , then , as aforementioned , tangible evidence of these dysfunctional ways of behaving can be derived from the activities.Object relations based therapists would argue , however , that this evidence is available already through the analysis of the therapeutic relationship.However , what may be lacking in an analysis of the traditional therapeutic relationship is the opportunity to practice in a therapeutic setting new ways of behaving in interpersonal and behavioral contexts that extend beyond this relationship.It also may be difficult in object relations based therapy , especially for more concrete clients , for them to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context . <p> AT may provide such an opportunity for more comprehensive practice , with the additional benefits of tangible consequences , group level feedback , and the opportunity for personal success and triumph.Therefore , the combination of the two approaches may combine the best of both , potentially allowing the client an experience that reaches beyond any confines of either one.Again , the reader is cautioned to view this as speculative in that there is no data available to support such a contention.At the present time this is the first attempt to make such a connection . <p> One still logically questions however : is this AT experience enough to facilitate a shift in maladaptive internal representations , or is it necessary to supplement any proposed treatment gains with ongoing psychotherapy upon completion of the treatment ? Simply put , is the AT experience enough to provide lasting change ? One challenge among the many which remain as yet unmet in the AT literature is whether it is necessary to further extend and deepen the therapeutic process upon completion of the treatment to facilitate any such change process which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combine AT with ongoing follow-up therapy , object relations based , that could work in conjunction with the potential gains associated with the AT intervention in order to more fully process and internalize any new representations of self and others that may have begun during the AT.Such ongoing treatment could potentially provide a more complete basis for deep level therapeutic change , possibly resulting in greater treatment efficacy and efficiency for both treatment approaches with some types of clients.Empirical investigation , however , is necessary to explore such a possibility . <p> Cognitive therapy <p> AT also shares similarities with cognitive therapy.First , both are concerned with examining distorted beliefs and attempting to replace such beliefs with different , more empirically-rooted views and assumptions . In this sense , " cognitive restructuring " takes place in both modalities.Second , AT provides an opportunity for practicing new ways of thinking and behaving , in line with this pattern of cognitive restructuring.Third , by targeting self concepts , AT moves into the realm of Banduras ( 1977 ) " self-efficacy " theory , which argues that the internal and external information individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will feel efficacious.This cognitive conceptualization is also related to the previously mentioned construct of learned helplessness , and therefore potentially to decreases in anxiety and depression . <p> Clearly , there may be potential for AT activities to activate distorted beliefs and the cognitions associated with them.One can also perhaps conceptualize the goals of AT as changing the automatic thought of " I cant " to " I can " ( Blanchard , 1992 ) . By examining a clients cognitive responses to the activities and the emotions associated with such cognitions there may be a perfect opportunity to integrate principles of cognitive restructuring by linking this process to a concrete and immediate example as it occurs . In addition , AT activities could also provide an opportunity for the practice of new ways of thinking and behaving , also in line with cognitive principles . <p> In this sense an activity may provide a perfect example of an activating event , an associated belief , and a consequence for some clients ( cognitive ABCs ) . Through processing the AT experience in this fashion , the therapist may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a therapeutic approach found to be effective in reducing depression ( Gilbert , 1992 ) As has been mentioned , in this type of instance the activity can perhaps be best thought of as the catalyst to begin such a discussion which can then be grounded in concrete experience.It must be noted that this statement is in no way meant to imply that such opportunities are not presented in " traditional " cognitive or cognitive-behavioral therapy situations , rather this is simply being put forth to illustrate a commonality , one which might also underlie any change mechanisms in AT.As above , this model is presented as a possibility as there is no supportive evidence for such a statement . <p> In addition , the activities provide an immediate opportunity for success and this success could also be processed cognitively as well.Such successes can perhaps also be viewed through the lens of Banduras ( 1977 ) theory of self-efficacy.Bandura notes that the internal and external information one gains that is linked to actual evidence regarding ones abilities and skills is the most influential in determining feelings of self-efficacy.Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater sense of self-efficacy for clients . <p> To continue on this speculative path , perhaps linking both object relations theory and cognitive theory to AT could provide an expanded semantic framework for discussing any change mechanisms in AT.Unfortunately however , these are novel ideas that remain unexamined in the AT literature , and ideas currently lacking the support of any empirical evidence.As such , models such as these remain simply potentially interesting and undeveloped theoretical formulations . <p> Humanistic theory <p> In addition , elements of humanistic theory are embedded in AT.As noted , the humanistic construct of peak experience ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 ; Maslow , 1971 ) is a characteristic of AT.Second , both modalities target overall self awareness.Third , both frameworks are concerned with awareness of available choices , including a need for realistic appraisal of challenge versus threat . Fourth , ATs emphasis on therapist integrity , one of its stated ethical principles , parallels the humanistic emphasis on therapist authenticity ( Raskin &amp; Rogers , 1989 ) . Fifth , both inherently involve " presence " in experiencing ( May , 1969 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing ( Raskin &amp; Rogers , 1989 ) . Finally , ATs overarching context of encouraging individuals to become aware of previously unrealized potential and self-imposed limitations can be seen as the very process of self actualization . <p> While ATs emphasis on self-awareness , recognition of available choices , realistic appraisals of challenge vs. threat , and peak experience have been previously noted as paralleling to the humanistic tradition , there are two additional areas meriting further discussion that are congruent with this tradition found in AT:therapist integrity and an emphasis on being fully present in the moment or " experiencing " ( Raskin &amp; Rogers , 1989 , p. 157 ) . <p> The emphasis in AT on therapist integrity is actually one the stated ethical principle for AT ( such principles are further discussed in a later section of this paper ) . To highlight , as part of the AT ethical principle of integrity it is stated that " Professionals strive to be aware of their own belief system , values , needs , and limitations , and the effect of these on their work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 453 ) . This can be seen to parallel the emphasis in humanistic psychotherapy on therapist authenticity ( Raskin &amp; Rogers , 1989 ) . <p> The stated emphasis on " experiencing " can be found through the activity focus of the intervention.It can be hypothesized that there is potential in AT for helping clients to achieve a more fully present form of consciousness , as active participation in AT activities may lead to a greater awareness of being present in the moment.By focusing on participation , a client may be able to partially move away from internally focused negative self- evaluations that separate a person from present focused experience , ultimately leading to participation in such activities that is freer and more complete.The focus on the activities as opposed to self-conceptions may allow for the client to practice immediacy without such practice being the stated focus , perhaps paradoxically removing the " need " for such an internal focus on evaluation . <p> In addition , the activities may allow for the client to experience interpersonal relationships without such relating being the focus of the interaction.This may also allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an activation of their defensive processes . Again paradoxically , they may therefore eventually achieve the goal of immediacy without conscious awareness.Of course , it is recognized that skillful processing would necessarily be a component in such a movement as conversely , participating in activities could also further activate such negative evaluations , effectively removing a persons further from conscious experience . <p> Simplistically put , by participating in activities the client may spontaneously be more immediate , more present , and be " experiencing " more without being aware of the fact . This can perhaps be thought of as the ultimate goal of immediacy . It may be then possible that through processing , this more immediate self-awareness could facilitate greater awareness of formerly denied aspects of the self , helping to facilitate what Raskin and Rogers note as a " shifting away from a rigid mode of experiencing self and world to a mode characterized by openness and flexibility . " ( 1989 , p. 157 ) . Through continued processing , such an increase in self-awareness could perhaps become a more central part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious experiencing is an important general focus of humanism ( Raskin &amp; Rogers , 1989 ) . <p> Royce ( 1987 ) notes that " The key to growth in any situation is that the participants should choose to confront their fear " ( p. 10 ) . Herbert also discussed the confrontation of fear , stating that " Adventure-based work recognizes that it is the effort to overcome obstacles and , in effect , overcoming ones own fears that is critical . " ( 1996 , p. 5 ) . These statements reflect the essence of the behavioral method of " in vivo exposure , " in which clients extinguish phobic reactions by gradual , repeated contact with aversive stimuli . However , as an aside , it is also of note that a clinically oriented reader can also see the possibility for potentially damaging flooding to occur <p> The activities in AT provide an opportunity for altering behavior patterns via the interaction of external events , reinforcement , and cognitive mediation that Bandura ( 1977 ) has articulated in his model of social learning theory.To expand on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reinforcement , while the processing can potentially alter the cognitive processes.Therefore , an alternative behavioral explanation for any change that may occur in AT could be related to the provision of reinforcement and the potential for perceptual alterations of experience based on a shift in cognition ( CBT ) . In addition , the activities also provide an opportunity for unique modeling to occur . <p> In addition the basic emphasis in AT on concrete consequences and reinforcement is clearly in line with principles of operant conditioning.In addition , the importance in AT of having enjoyment associated with the activities can be seen in some ways as parallel to systematic desensitization , and thus classical conditioning . <p> Again however , it must be noted that as this is the first articulated relationships between AT and behavior therapy , or in fact any of these models , there is no empirical evidence available to substantiate any such theoretical statements . <p> The therapeutic relationship <p> To finalize the discussion of similarities between AT and other therapeutic orientations , as well as the change mechanisms that may be operating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of the therapeutic relationship and its potential for change in AT.Given that the strongest predictor of outcome in psychotherapy research has been shown to be the therapeutic relationship ( Orlinsky , Grawe , &amp; Parks , 1994 ) , it is worthwhile to consider the implications of the extended and intensive relationship that is found uniquely in the AT experience , particularly in wilderness programs that last for at least one week and beyond where the clients and the therapist/s live together in the wilderness.Specifically , it is interesting to consider the potential effects for the client of continuous involvement with the therapist , as well as the group , that lasts for an extended period of time on a round-the clock basis . <p> It can be speculated that for some clients this may be immensely threatening.For such clients this may result in their being unable to form positive relationships as their defensive reactions may become intensely activated and further entrenched , essentially making it impossible for them to engage in therapy.However , it may be that just the opposite is true- that such intensive relationships developed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact facilitate the creation of more positive internal representations based on this all encompassing level of relationship . <p> Consider the fact that if client and therapist are together for twenty-one days on a twenty-four hour basis , this translates into 504 hours of therapeutic contact , an approximate time equivalent of ten years of weekly psychotherapy . Even excluding the hours spent sleeping , that still is roughly 330 hours of contact , an equivalent of approximately six and one-half years of weekly psychotherapy . Realistically however , while it could perhaps be argued that sleeping is not relevant contact , the reverse could also be argued- that learning to sleep in close proximity and waking up together is in fact quite relevant . <p> Regardless , obviously a 21-day experience with no follow-up is not the equivalent of 6 or 10 years of weekly psychotherapy.Such a comparison of the numbers is provided merely to illustrate the potential potency of this amount of time between therapist and client spent continuously.Given this however , it is possible that the opportunity for the development of therapeutic relationships in the different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AT experience may facilitate growth in clients based in this relational bond.It also possible that there may be an effect based on this twenty-four hour contact that is inaccessible in traditional forms of psychotherapy.Of course , one can not overlook the fact that the reverse may also be true , and that this type of round-the-clock relationship may lessen the power of the therapeutic relationship as well . <p> Without empirical data we have no scientific basis for either of these statements.It is simply intriguing to consider the power of such relationships as change agents in a different setting than that which is typically associated with therapy.It can be speculated that it may well be that the development of this type of relationship alone could be an active change agent in AT.If so , it may be that case that the activities and the processing associated with AT may simply be a vehicle for the development of the relationship.If this is the case , philosophically it then leads one to wonder if this is negative-that if AT provides an opportunity for such relationships to develop , and such relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of anything else associated with such relationships ( i.e. , activities or therapeutic processing ) , does this then mean AT is therefore not therapeutically effective ? <p> Taking it a step further , if the opportunity for such relationship formation , recognizing that this alone may be the primary agent of change in AT , resulted in equivalent change as other equivalent forms of therapy on clinically relevant measures , does that mean AT is therapeutically ineffective because " therapy " is not being conducted ? If equivalent change is found , is it not therapy regardless of technique ? It then follows to wonder , if this were the case would it then be appropriate to utilize such an intervention style without any knowledge of therapeutic factors that may be at work beyond the relationship ? Again , as has been stated previously , such a statement is not meant as implying direct support for such a contention , this discourse is simply presented as an additional element for examination and it may be that the power of this relationship is an area worthy of further investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2000 ) , when faced with this type of equivalence in therapeutic change , the decision as to what type of intervention to use becomes a matter of cost effectiveness ( personal communication , March 17 , 2000 ) , or therapeutic efficiency.Therefore if AT , regardless of the change agent , was somehow shown at some point to result in equivalent change on relevant measures as other forms of therapy , then the ultimate decision as to which form of therapy to use comes down to such financial considerations.Returning to the matter of time equivalence , it may well be that AT is in fact more efficient.Realistically , however , a more relevant comparison is found in inpatient treatment.In such a comparison however , once again AT may be found to be more cost effective . <p> Referring back to the discussion of AT in an object relations framework , the development of such a potentially unique relationship in AT may provide greater opportunity for corrective emotional experience to occur.If so , such occurrences may become more firmly anchored for the client based on the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of time and thus is anchored in " real experience " . <p> In addition , this type of situation may provide greater opportunity for the client to engage in more positive interpersonal relationships with others and practice such relationships in settings which are not typically part of the therapeutic environment ( e.g. cooking , eating , setting up and breaking camp ) . To draw specifically from interpersonal theory , such opportunities for interaction that encompass the clients overall experience ( at least during the program ) in its entirely , may help the client to develop more positive self-conceptions as there are greater opportunities for the self to be reflected by others in such an intensive and longer-term situation . <p> Related to this is the potential power of modeling ( Bandura , 1986 ) , referred to previously in the discussion of behavioral theory , that could occur in such a situation.Such modeling can come not only from observing and imitating the therapists , but also the other clients as well.The involvement in the activities could provides a tremendous opportunity for modeling of appropriate communication , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is speculated may be a less threatening format to defensive clients.Thus , such clients may be better able to attend to and utilize such modeling.Conversely , however , it can also be imagined how a client could be exposed to detrimental modeling in such a situation as well.Unfortunately , ss is every portion of this proposition , this discussion of the potential power of the therapeutic relationship associated with AT is again pure conjecture at this point as this is no data available on with the process of change claimed to occur in AT . <p> The above discussion focused on the similarities of object relations , cognitive , humanistic , and behavioral theory that can be seen as potentially underlying AT , ending with a discussion of the possibility for change that can be found in the unique therapeutic relationships that may develop in AT . <p> While there is no empirical support underlying such statements , it is nevertheless interesting to consider the stated benefits of group- level experience and problem-solving , activities with tangible outcomes , the unfamiliar environment , immediacy , opportunity to disprove negative self-evaluations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in AT combined with object relations- based processing , cognitively-based processing , or a combination of both over a period of time as potentially contributing to development of a unique model for therapeutic change.To expand further , combining these psychodynamic , cognitive , and behavioral principles with a meta-therapeutic orientation that integrates concepts of humanistic theory into the model , all of which are subsumed into the unique context of a potentially uninterrupted and continuous therapeutic relationship , could be a combination worthy of further exploration from the perspective of psychotherapy integration . <p> While such similarities appear to be at least possible , it continues however to be difficult to articulate what factors beyond the setting and the activity focus may differentiate AT from other type of therapy.Nevertheless , AT theorists have attempted this task , seemingly declaring that AT is in fact notably different from other types of psychotherapy . <p> Proposed Differences <p> AT theorists have proposed several ways in which they believe AT differs significantly from traditional therapeutic methods.These proposed differences of AT include first , a focus on strength as opposed to dysfunction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity for clearly recognizable results ; and fourth , the opportunity for therapeutic assessment found in the activities.As will be seen , however , these are still not clear differentiating features . <p> Gass ( 1993 ) discusses several tenets of therapy utilizing adventure-based activities he believes differentiate it from traditional psychotherapy methods.Gass feels that traditionally , psychotherapy has tended to be oriented to discussing problems and areas of poor functioning.Therefore , he notes that through " talk therapy " , the focus is often on the areas where the client is experiencing failure.In contrast , with adventure-based therapy he believes the general focus to be on a clients strengths rather than on their weaknesses , with the utilization of activities allowing a concrete identification of strengths each client contributed to the completion of the task.It appears therefore that the focus is on the process of therapy , rather than the specific content . <p> In this sense , adventure-based therapy perhaps mirrors the goals of process-oriented psychotherapy.However , once again it is not clear how this is such a striking difference.The emphasis on strength as opposed to dysfunction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the psychoanalytic tradition , as the humanistic tradition is clearly oriented towards a strength focus.In addition , as was noted early in this paper , these types of statements reflect a simplistic analysis of the psychotherapy process , perhaps aimed at an audience lacking in clinical training . <p> As a further contrast , Gass ( 1993 ) believes there to be a profound difference between " talking the talk " and walking the walk " . Proponents of AT believe that traditional " talk-oriented " psychotherapy tends to be passive and often does not allow for the client to practice those necessary changes discussed in therapy.They feel it is likely that clients may retain dysfunctional patterns of behavior because often they merely speak of changes and there is limited opportunity to demonstrate and practice such changes in a one hour per week therapy session ( Gass , 1993 ) . This is obviously an arguable point as clinicians of any orientation could refute any such statement with examples of clients practicing new behaviors in a therapy session.Gass ( 1993 ) also discusses how many traditional therapists have experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without actually seeing any functional differences in their lives.Aside from the therapists encouragement , he feels in traditional therapy that clients may receive little reinforcement for change , see few results , and thus may have little motivation to practice such changes.Therefore , it is believed that there may be much opportunity for " talking the talk " without actually having to " walk the walk " . <p> While in fact it may be true that obviously some clients show little change , this can not be specific to traditional psychotherapy.In addition , statements such as this blatantly overlook the potential for change espoused by the object relations perspective , a perspective which believes that the power to change comes from the therapeutic relationship itself.Unfortunately , by making contradictory statements such as this with no empirical evidence to provide support , the field of AT is left wide open to criticism from anyone exposed to the established theories of clinical psychology . <p> To continue this discussion , Gass ( 1993 ) feels that adventure-based therapy is a direct contrast to the seemingly eternal focus on dysfunction with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with AT , clients are put in a position where they have to utilize and actively practice the changes that they have claim to have been making.Again , these statements can be shown as being in direct opposition to the principles of object relations therapy , which makes specific note of the fact that it is the therapeutic relationship itself that provides the medium for such practice and utilization of changed patterns of behavior . <p> Gass ( 1993 ) also discusses how results can be clearly recognized in AT.As has been discussed previously , it is felt by AT practitioners that the concrete experience found in adventure-based therapy can highlight dysfunctional patterns and give the client an opportunity to directly experience the consequences of new ways of behaving.If in fact these claims could be substantiated , it could obviously be very reinforcing for the person to make changes in order to reduce tension or needs that occur during the course of the activities . In support of this claim , Bandura ( 1977 ) has noted that learning to meet challenges successfully and accomplish desired goals can increase a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control over relevant outcomes , which can then improve their overall mood state . <p> Nevertheless , once again it must be made clear that AT is not the only type of treatment where a client can experience clear and recognizable consequences and results.In defense of AT , however as has been noted AT activities do appear to have the unique potential for providing a fairly concrete example of consequences.Therefore , this may be in fact one differentiating factor of AT . <p> A brief example may help to better illustrate the features AT supporters believe differentiate AT from other therapies.For instance , on a wilderness trip it may be necessary that one participant help carry some weight of another participant who is i 'll so that all participants can make it to the resupply stop without missing a meal . How to accomplish this is something that must be negotiated and each participant must help , a seemingly simplistic but very intricate interpersonal issue.Examining this example within the AT framework discussed by Gass ( 1993 ) , the " talk " of psychotherapy is translated into immediate action with real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully meet the groups goals of helping a sick group member and also making it to dinner is felt to make adventure-based therapy a particularly powerful vehicle for change . <p> Gass ( 1993 ) also discusses how he finds opportunities for therapeutic assessment embedded within the adventure experience.Given the high degree of ambiguity inherent in the adventure-based therapy situation , it is suggested that clients project their behaviors onto the activity ( Gillis &amp; Simpson , 1998 ) . Thus , the therapist is presented with the unique opportunity to observe and process such behaviors . However , it can be argued that clients will do this with any type of therapeutic situation , or in fact any interpersonally oriented situation at all . <p> Regarding the issue of therapeutic assessment , Kimball and Bacon ( 1993 ) actually liken adventure-based therapy to a Rorschach test , noting that the client must interpret the situation and respond to the task.They state that this information is indicative of a clients " life-long behavioral patterns , dysfunctional ways of coping with stress , intellectual processes , conflicts , needs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client will approach each task and activity in a way that is consistent with their personality , and values , and motivations.Therefore , a skilled therapist can utilize adventure-based activities in order to observe and detect personality patterns and behaviors that participants may have been unwilling or unable to reveal during traditional forms of verbal and written assessment.In addition , Kimball and Bacon ( 1993 ) note that adventure-based activities increase the level of non-verbal interaction , giving the therapist a more multi-dimensional and complete view of a persons functioning . <p> Once again , however , elements of the social microcosm theory ( Yalom , 1995 ) and interpersonally oriented psychodynamic theory can be seen in these statements , as both theories assume that the client will act with the therapist and group members in similar ways as they act with significant others in their life.Therefore , this is not distinctive and this " opportunity for assessment " can be found in other orientations as well <p> In addition , while the latter statement involving non-verbal interaction may have some merit , clearly the other statements made by Kimball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately statements made again with no empirical substantiation.In addition , there is little to differentiate the underlying mechanisms of AT from other types of therapy in the above statements.Once again , these statements fall short of capturing what is unique about the mechanisms of AT as compared to other types of therapy <p> It is through this type of discussion that the rudimentary , overly simplistic , and broadly generalistic foundations of the field become most apparent.Unfortunately , it appears that the experts in the field of AT have overlooked key clinical concepts in their attempts to delineate the uniqueness of the AT process.It seems over and again that AT is potentially more similar than different to other types of therapeutic approaches.Furthermore , when subjected a critical analysis , many of the clinically-oriented claims espoused by AT practitioners do not withstand the scrutiny.It is clear that continued exploration of these mechanisms of change , combined with empirical studies , is necessary before such claims can be supported . <p> To finalize this theoretical comparison , it appears that the action-oriented approach of adventure-based therapy may most closely parallel the here-and-now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object relations/psychodynamic , cognitive or cognitive-behavioral , humanism , and interpersonal group psychotherapy ) . Thus , similar to these types of psychotherapy , the here-and-now orientation of adventure-based therapy may well provide an opportunity for the therapist to access previously repressed affective material through processing the experience in the moment rather than focusing on past issues.For well-defended and resistant clients , this more activity-focused processing may provide an additional domain in which a client may experience previously buried affective responses , perhaps with a less defensive posture . <p> In addition , one important and as yet unmentioned factor of AT that does not appear to fit into any clear category is that it could be providing an additional and unique medium , via the physical , to help identify affective responses in those clients who may be unable to identify and label emotions , an important part of traditional psychotherapy as well.Empirical examination , however , is necessary in order to support this or any of the above claims.Additional parallels to psychotherapy traditions can be found in a discussion of ethical issues in AT . <p> Chapter 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of similarity between adventure-based therapy and other forms of psychotherapy is in the utilization of a set of formalized ethical principles to guide the actions and decisions of therapists.Though similar to the APA principles , the ethical principles for adventure-based therapy must address a unique set of circumstances particular to the adventure field and such circumstances must be considered in the discussion of ethics . <p> It was determined by the Therapeutic Adventure Professional Group ( TAPG ) of the Association for Experiential Education ( AEE ) that it was necessary to develop formal ethical guidelines to guide professionals affiliated with TAPG.Through consultation with the American Psychological Association ( APA ) , the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapists ( AAMFT ) , and several noted experts in the field , as well as examination of the ethics code of therapeutic recreation specialists and the significant writings in this area , TAPG developed such guidelines in 1991 . The complete version of these ethical standards can be found in Gass ( 1993 ) . <p> It is of note that many of the principles are similar to those found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the APA ethical standards for psychologists , members of TAPG are held accountable to this code.However , unlike the APA code which pertains to all practicing psychologists in the US , it is only members of TAPG , as opposed to the entire profession of adventure therapists , who are actuallybound by this code.Additionally , while the APA ethical principles require that psychologists be familiar with the code ( Principle 8.01 ) , there is no such requirement in the TAPG code . Also , at the present time TAPG unfortunately has no ethical jurisdiction over those professionals who consider themselves adventure therapists but are not TAPG members.Similarly , TAPG has very little power to enact consequences for individuals who engage in ethical violations . Therefore , although the TAPG ethical code exists there is little external motivation for adventure professionals to practice the code.Given that , the TAPG ethical principles in actuality exist primarily as an ethical guide . In contrast , the APA ethical code is enforceable , and the American Psychological Association , state psychology boards , courts , and other public bodies can use violations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing psychologist who may be in violation of the code . <p> Similar as this ethical code may be to APA principles however , it is also necessary to look beyond this code in order to fully encompass the realm of adventure-based therapy.The use of novel situations , the element of inherent risk involved in many of the activities , and the dynamic created by multi-day trips creates a set of ethical circumstances that may be unique to adventure-based therapy.In addition , many of the people employed in the adventure-based therapy field are trained primarily in the skills required to lead a wilderness expedition , and have minimal training in issues specific to therapeutic applications of such activities . This leads to a unique ethical situation , as many AT practitioners are not considered psychologists and thus are likely to fall outside of the jurisdiction of the APA.As such , it is necessary for the AT field to build on the standard ethical code for therapists delineated by APA , encompassing these ethical principles while also providing ethical guidance for situations that may be unique to the AT setting.It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concentrating heavily on the work of Michael Gass ( 1993 , 1995 ) and Jasper Hunt ( 1994 ) , both noted experts in the field.In addition , I will discuss the recommended ways for practitioners to deal with such ethical situations as they arise . <p> It must be noted that the activity focus of adventure-based therapy and the potential use of multi-day trips may preclude the possibility of immediate consultation with other professionals , one strongly recommended course for therapists facing difficult ethical decisions.In addition , ethical decisions made during the course of an activity in adventure-based therapy situations may also have implications for an entire group , as opposed to just the individual and the therapist.As such , it is recommended by Hunt ( 1994 ) that professionals in the field thoroughly familiarize themselves with the ethical standards which follow.In addition , Hunt recommends that professionals actively envision the ethical problems which may arise specific to the set of activities they have planned.While the ethical standards may not provide the answers for all potential situations , being both intimately familiar with and having thought through such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they may draw in order to make appropriate ethical decisions should the occasion arise.This parallels the APAs recommendation that the development of their ethical standards " requires a personal commitment to lifelong efforts to act ethically " ( APA , 1992 ; Introduction ) <p> Informed Consent <p> One ethical principle , informed consent , seems to provide the simplest and most comprehensive solution to many of these ethical dilemmas faced by professionals in the field.Jasper Hunt ( 1994 ) , a noted expert in the area of adventure education/therapy and ethics , is a strong advocate of the use of informed consent.As such , it underlies much of the discussion to follow.Related to informed consent is the aforementioned technique of " Challenge by Choice " , a way to allow for individuals to abstain from such activities they do not feel comfortable participating in.However , it is important to note that making an informed choice as to whether or not to participate requires having been thoroughly informed as to the nature of the activity . <p> The primary mandate of the principle of informed consent for AT is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , benefits , risks , and responsibilities associated with these services and activities prior to participation . " ( Gass , 1993 , p.455 ) . Informed consent is considered to have been obtained from a participant after they are instructed specifically as to the risks involved in the planned activities , the postulated ratio of risk-to-benefit which can be obtained from the experience , and the ratio of risk-to-benefit as compared to alternative treatments or no treatment.In addition , participants must be informed of the element of emotional risk that may be involved.Often the level of emotional risk involved may be much less apparent to the client.While similar , the APA code of informed consent also requires that psychologists use language that is reasonably understandable to participants.Therefore , using specific jargon or theoretical terms may be inappropriate when procuring consent.In addition , the APA recommends documentation of such informed consent . <p> The complexity of informed consent with adventure-based activities becomes apparent when , as a professional , it is recognizable that it is impossible to predict all situations that may occur and obtain informed consent for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to predict the reactions to perceived risk that participants may experience.What may be a minimal level of perceived risk to a seasoned outdoor professional may be overwhelming risk to a neophyte participant.Related to this , it potentially requires psychological expertise and experience to anticipate the effects of such activities on a less psychologically stable participant . <p> In addition , it is also difficult to inform someone of the benefits that they may receive , as these benefits may differ between participants.Therefore , Hunt ( 1994 ) notes that informed consent is based upon possibilities as opposed to certainties.Participants must be informed of the possible events that may occur , both positive and negative.Participants must also be informed that other exigencies may occur of which they have not been informed.Importantly , this uncertainty is a vital component of adventure-based therapy.Attempting to remove all uncertainty on the part of participants negates a large potential for growth and change.Therefore , it is important for practitioners to strive for a balance in these areas . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) recommends that professionals obtain full informed consent from participants prior to beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to commencing each specific activity.Therefore , informed consent provides the foundation upon which professionals base difficult ethical decisions.By having been clear with participants as to what they may experience and by receiving their informed consent , professionals can be more confident that they are acting within the realm of appropriate ethical decision-making . Specific areas in which informed consent is necessary will continue to be discussed in the context of other ethical principles . <p> Gass ( 1995 ) outlines seven overriding ethical principles which encompass the specific areas of the TAPG ethical code.Of note is that these principles almost directly parallel the APA general principles in meaning as well as in wording . <p> Competence <p> The first principle is that staff conduct experiences with an appropriate level of competence.Gass states that this principle involves professionals providing services within the boundaries of such areas in which they have experience , training , education , and appropriate supervision ; that professionals take actions to ensure that their work is competent ; that professionals stay abreast of current knowledge within the field ; that professionals participate in efforts to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid situations where personal problems or issues may impair their work performance.Similar to this , it is stated in the TAPG ethical code that if defined standards of competence do not yet exist for a specific area , that " professionals take all steps reasonable to ensure the competence of their work " . <p> Clearly , however , this principle is somewhat vague in its interpretation . Unfortunately , given the lack of ethical enforcement , the relatively small number of accredited adventure-based therapy programs , and the ongoing debate in the field as to what competencies are required of an adventure therapist , this principle is not always adhered to in its intended form . In fact , previously mentioned research indicates that many practitioners of adventure-based therapy may be lacking in some of the skills necessary to be a competent adventure therapist ( Berman , 1995 ) . <p> This particular area presents a potential conundrum for a practicing psychologist who engages in or supervises adventure-based therapy.It appears from the above mentioned survey that many persons who are practicing in the AT area may not meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists provide only those services and use only those techniques for which they are qualified by education , training or experience . " The ethical question is this : if the practitioners of AT , i.e. , field staff , do not appear to have the essential training and qualifications to be providing psychological services , yet have experience and supervision from a professional who does , is this in line with the APA ethical standards ? Put another way , if psychological care on a round-the-clock basis is being entrusted to individuals who may not have the necessary level of training or experience to deal with psychological exigencies that may arise , is this acting in accordance with the APA ethical standards ? <p> One can see commonalties with a teaching situation , in which psychologists in training receive supervision from licensed psychologists , and where there is typically supervision available if an emergency arises during the session.However , the reality of the AT situation in which those people who may in charge of providing these services may not have access to other better-trained professionals for supervision due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are likely to not be psychologists in training and , in fact , may not have any formal training whatsoever.In this type of situation , who is ultimately responsible ? What is the potential for psychological harm for the clients ? If services are appearing to be provided by unqualified individuals or individuals with a lack of training , is the psychologist ultimately responsible for enforcing this type of ethical principle ? This is a question that appears to be commonly overlooked by the AT field , and no specific guidelines have been delineated about the particular role of the clinical psychologist in AT . <p> The APA ( 1992 ) does , however , provide provisions for new practices , specifically stating that " in those emerging areas in which generally recognized standards for preparatory training do not yet exist , psychologists nevertheless take reasonable steps to ensure the competence of there work and to protect patients , clients , students , research participants and others from harm . " ( Principle 1.04c ) . Therefore , since there are no formal standards for required competencies in AT , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions about required staff competencies and potential for harm based on their informed judgment . <p> The APA standards do address this issue specifically in standard 1.22:Delegation to and Supervisions of Subordinates.To summarize , this principle states that psychologists are responsible for delegating only those responsibilities that subordinates can be expected to perform competently based on their level of training , education , and experience.This competency can also be maintained in the context of appropriate supervision . <p> In addition , psychologists are also responsible for providing training in order to achieve such competency , as well as taking reasonable steps to assure that duties are actually being performed to necessary standards.In addition , the APA standards note that psychologists are expected to correct any situations at the institutional level that are feasible to do so.Therefore , it would appear that any psychologist practicing in the AT field has an ethical responsibility mandated by APA to make certain that all staff have the necessary level of competence to practice in ways that are in line with the accepted standards of therapeutic practice.All psychologists in the AT field must be aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with staff who may have widely diverse levels of training and experience . <p> As has been noted , those professionals who are not considered to be psychologists are not under the jurisdiction of APA and may not be subject to the same regulations and potential consequences , However , when considering such ethical principles at the organizational level it may be if an organization is to be considered a provider of psychological services , they are potentially open to such ethical charges should unfortunate circumstances lead to insinuations of psychological , as well as physical , harm.As such , it may be important for all service providers , regardless of title , to be aware of this potential area of ethical violation and take appropriate steps to ensure that staff have an adequate level of training and expertise in the provision of therapeutic services . <p> Integrity <p> The second principle which Gass ( 1995 ) discusses is that staff conduct experiences with integrity.He notes that this entails conducting activities with honesty , respect and fairness , and that these principles be applied to both participants and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ones own personal beliefs and values may impact both their work and their participants . APA ( 1992 ) adds a caution about statements that may potentially be misleading as well.Hunt ( 1994 ) , discusses several of the specifics which may fall under this broad category including the use of deception and secrecy as educational/therapeutic tools . APA also addresses the issue of deception , noting that it is unethical for psychologists to make deceptive , false or misleading statements about their credentials , expertise , training , fees , research , professional affiliations , or services ( principle 3.03 ) . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) notes that secrecy is different from deception , in that " deception is an act that is specifically designed to get people to believe that what is false is true , while a secretive act is simply the withholding of information and not the distortion of information.Deception is active by nature and secrecy is passive by nature . " ( p. 61 ) . <p> Given the more active nature of deception , he believes that deception can result in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels strongly that this trust can be difficult to restore.An example he puts forth involves students/clients who had been involved in learning wilderness first aid.The group had been somewhat uncooperative and not taking the lessons seriously.In order to illustrate the importance of the lesson , one of the instructors hid in the woods and feigned a serious injury.In order to deal with the " injury " , the participants had to utilize their first aid training.After several minutes of providing care , the group realized that they had been deceived.One member of the group was extremely angry at the deception , however , the importance of the first aid training was clearly emphasized to the group.As such , the intentions of the instructors were realized , but not without cost for the group.Therefore , Hunt ( 1994 ) raises the question of positive vs. negative outcome.Is it acceptable to use deception in order to obtain positive educational/therapeutic aims ? Is it OK to deceive when the outcome is positive ? How can such a positive outcome be defined when the deception itself causes a negative outcome ? <p> APA ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research.While obviously not pertaining specifically to a therapeutic situation , these principles seem to provide the best formalized guidance available in situations where deception is deemed necessary.Principal 6.15a states that " Psychologists do not conduct a study involving deception unless they have determined that the use if deceptive techniques is justified by the studies prospective scientific , educational , or applied value and that equally effective alternative procedures that did not use deception are not feasible . " APA also notes in 6.15c that " Any other deception that is an integral feature of the design and conduct of an experiment must be explained to participants as early as is feasible . " . According to these principles , a psychologist in the above situation must make a decision that such deception was clearly warranted and beneficial , and was also the best possible alternative available.In addition , is required that they inform the clients as soon as it is possible as to the nature and the rationale of the deception . <p> The solution proposed by Hunt ( 1994 ) to such questions is informed consent.He believes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be deceived and have , in that sense , agreed to the deception prior to its use . Hunt also notes , however , that there are difficulties associated with this , namely the potential loss of power involved when participants know such circumstances as above may not be real.The recognition that they may at any time be experiencing deception lends itself to less than full immersion in the experience , thereby potentially minimizing the impact . As a final issue , Hunt emphasizes that deception must always be used with positive intentionality , and never for reasons of power or harm . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) believes the use of secrecy to also be an ethical issue , but one with potentially less damaging consequences to the relationship between professional and participant.Hunt notes that when the withholding of information is used as a teaching tool , designed to " remove the state of ignorance in which the student participant already exists . " ( p. 65 ) , it results in less loss of trust than does deception ( i.e. , the instructor is not creating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deception Hunt notes , however , it is particularly important that the use of secrecy must only be used for the achievement of a potentially positive end.APA provides no guidance for the use of such secrecy in a therapeutic situation . <p> Specific examples of the use of secrecy discussed by Hunt include one in which the instructor is encouraging a participant to attempt a climb , a climb which the instructor knows he/she is incapable of , in order to utilize the learning which may occur under such circumstances.A second example involves a situation in which a participant shares information with the instructor and then asks the instructor to keep such information secret.Such a circumstance may seems straightforward enough , however , imagine that participant is asking the instructor to keep secret information that the instructor knows could endanger the participant or others in the group ? Does such a situation warrant the violation of secrecy ? <p> As with deception , Hunt ( 1994 ) believes that the solution to difficulties created by secrecy involves the use of informed consent.He believes that if participants are forewarned that secrecy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an issue.Also related , he notes that if participants are informed that secrecy between instructors and participants will be maintained unless to do so may lead to harm for the participant or others , they can then make an informed choice whether or not to share such information . <p> Responsibility <p> The third principle outlined by Gass ( 1995 ) is that staff conduct experiences in a responsible manner.To expand on this , he notes that professionals must uphold the ethical principles of their work . Specifically , Gass notes that the following are necessary : being clear with participants as to what the roles and obligations as a professional are in each situation , adapting the methods of treatment to the needs of different populations , possessing adequate knowledge and experience to make appropriate professional judgments , not initiating services with participants if limited contact will be a significant issue , and also conducting services with minimal impact to the environment.While almost identical to the APA principle of the same name , the APA includes a statement that psychologists " accept appropriate responsibility for their own behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the TAPG principles . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) discusses the unique AT aspect of environmental impact , raising the question of when should concern for the environment outweigh concern for individuals ? ( It is important to note that the " do no harm " principle is assumed to override this at all times ) . He discusses how at times it can be a " conflict of values " , and feels it is important that professionals be able to adequately conduct a cost-benefit analysis in each situation that may arise.In addition , he believes that it is important for professionals to decide where they stand personally on environmental issues , being aware beforehand what values they may be willing to compromise on.One suggested avenue for this exploration may be that staff members discuss ethical issues as a team both prior to an activity or course , as well as debriefing at the conclusion . <p> For example , Hunt ( 1994 ) discusses an instance of instructors working in the wilderness with disabled persons.One such person , a paraplegic , has lost bladder control during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a nearby stream.The question specific to this situation is this:is it acceptable for you as an instructor to compromise minimal impact values in order to help meet this individuals personal needs ? Hunt outlines two potentialities for instructors who may be involved in such situations:1 ) inform a group beforehand that there will be no compromising on environmental minimal impact values , regardless of the circumstances , and 2 ) inform participants beforehand that attempts will be made to maintain the dignity of the participants , even if it involves compromising minimal impact standards.It may be desirable for participants to sign a contract making explicit what the stated policies are as a means of gaining active support for such policies.Therefore , the principles of informed consent are once more in operation.Participants who view the stated policy as unacceptable may choose not to participate . <p> Respect <p> Gass ( 1995 ) fourth principle is that staff conduct experiences with respect for the rights and dignity of participants.Gass includes under this principle the right to privacy , confidentiality and self-determination , sensitivity to cultural and sexual orientation issues , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallels this almost directly . Differently , however , Gass also includes basic informed consent and the accurate representation of professional competencies in this area . <p> Related to this , Hunt ( 1994 ) discusses the particular ethical dilemmas created for professional working with " captive populations " , defined as " any person who is participating in a program because of being ordered or coerced to do so , rather than through their own free initiative " . ( p.71 ) . He notes that research increasingly shows adventure-based therapy to be a viable treatment option for these types of populations , and thus justification for the use of such activities becomes stronger.Arguably this may not , however , actually be the case at the current time.This will be further discussed in later portions of this paper . <p> The important question Hunt ( 1994 ) raises , however , is this:Is it possible for a person who is not autonomous or free to give informed consent ? Hunt believes the solution to this lies in the evaluation of the possible alternative choices.If the consequences of participation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no actual choice involved , then Hunt does not believe that this is truly a free-choice situation.Ideally , Hunt advocates giving captive individuals a choice of participation , but providingreasonable alternatives.An individual may be required by law to participate in the program , but may choose to not participate in an activity.Therefore , it is necessary to provide viable alternatives.The creation of such alternatives which meet the stated goals of the program can require considerable expertise on the part of the facilitator.Importantly , however , choosing to not participate is thought to carry considerable value as a therapeutic issues and should be treated as such ( See Challenge by Choice principles ) . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) raises similar issues when considering times a participant may be an " activity captive " , times when it is very difficult to leave an activity once the activity had begun.For example , once a person has committed themselves to begin rock climbing , it is impossible for them to leave the activity without having to belay off the rock.Once again , Hunt advocates informed consent for each activity in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well-Being <p> Principle five is staff are concerned for the well-being of participants ( Gass , 1995 ) . Simply put , this principle states that professionals be sensitive to participants needs and well-being , as well as providing for the physical needs of participants and monitoring the appropriate use of risk.In addition , it is noted that professionals must provide appropriate referral when necessary and to plan experiences in the best interest of the participants . This is also a parallel to the APA ethical principle E:Concern for Others Welfare , with an adaptation made to encompass the unique aspects of AT based on the setting and the different activity base.Gass ( 1995 ) formulation is expanded upon in the TAPG ethical code , stating that " participants will be provided with the necessary food , water , shelter and other essential needs suited to the environment in which they are living in , unless there is prior mutual consent that this will serve a valid purpose " . The code also states that " At no time shall the withholding of these needs be used as a punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique issues to AT which fall under this principle , including risk-benefit analysis , individual vs. group benefit , and paternalism.Risk-benefit analysis is the ethical principle most specific to adventure-based therapy.There is no parallel within traditional therapies which raises similar issues.Specifically , the TAPG code states that " the amount of actual physical and emotional risk participants experience in adventure activities will be appropriate to the objectives and competence level of the **26;683;TOOLONG will use appropriate judgment when choosing activities that expose participants to actual or perceived physical or emotional risk . " Related to this , the code also states that " professionals have an adequate basis for their professional judgments and actions that is derived from professional knowledge . " Once again , this is a rather vague principle as the use of " appropriate judgment " is very difficult to objectively define . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) notes that there are significant difference between objective risk and subjective risk , and that a professional must be aware that both are inherent in many activities.Subjective risk is defined as perceived element of risk that a client feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or physical risk.Importantly , it is this element of subjective risk which creates the disequlibrium necessary for the facilitation of therapeutic change.However , it is difficult to estimate subjective risk as participants may perceive this level differently- what is risky to one participant may not be perceived as risky to another . Therefore , the instructor has a vital responsibility to make informed and knowledgeable judgments , judgments guided by experience , as to the level of subjective risk which participants will experience . <p> Objective risk on the other hand , is the element of risk inherent in activities based on the environment in which they are conducted , including the aspects of nature which are beyond human control.For example , a person who is rock climbing may be securely fastened into a harness and wearing a very expensive and effective helmet.During the course of a climb , however , a rock could potentially become dislodged and fall on him or her , causing injury , or a snake lurking between the rocks may become disturbed and bite the participant.Neither of these could have been foreseen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an activity.It is important to note , however , that this risk is not to be confused with any risk based on instructor error or poor decision-making.It is a key assumption in this type of situation that everything objectively possible is done to prevent harm of this type . As with subjective risk , instructors are responsible for making knowledgeable decisions as to what is an appropriate of objective risk , as well as adhering to standard operating procedures required for each activity.Adhering to such procedures helps to inform decision-making by instructors that may be necessary while in the field . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) recommends that professionals clearly evaluate the level of risk , both objective and subjective , involved in an activity and proceed with a cost-benefit analysis.He notes that it is crucial that instructors be aware of all levels of risk involved.If one activity has a higher level of risk that another , is there an increased benefit as well ? Is the present environment such that it can safely support activities which carry increased risk ? If added benefits do not exceed the added level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chosen.He also recommends that instructors always hold the goals of the group in mind when deciding on appropriate risks.The goals of a group who simply wishes to participate in adventure activities for fun as compared to those who desire personal growth as compared to those of a therapy group are significantly different.Moving the growth-oriented group into the realm of therapy introduces an unnecessary level of emotional risk and is to be avoided.Finally , Hunt recommends that instructors remain aware that they may be held accountable for explaining why an activity with a higher level of risk was chosen.In remaining cognizant of this fact , professionals must be able to clearly understand and be able to articulate the added benefits which come from an increased level of risk.Clearly , this is a subjective process , and one which is open to a wide range of variability . <p> Related to risk levels , instructors must also make ethical decisions at times regarding whether an activity may be more or less positive for the individual vs. the group.There are times during the course of activities when , for example , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this may include situations in which a participant may be violent , abusive , or for a variety of potential reasons is requiring an excessive amount of staff energy at the expense of other participants . Hunt ( 1994 ) raises the questions of whether or not the group should proceed without the individual.Could the individual receive benefit from not participating in the activity ? Is it possible to frame non-participation in a way that facilitates growth ? Should the group be responsible for making sure that all members successfully complete an activity ? What if the individual is adamant that they be able to participate in the activity , but the instructor feels that this may jeopardize the success of the entire group ? <p> Through processing this dilemma , the group may reach its own solution to such difficulties , and thus processing is one choice open to instructors in such a situation . However , Hunt cautions that there are times when processing the issue will not ultimately solve the problem and the instructor must make a decision between the individual benefit or the group benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this problem , but rather explores the rationale behind each choice.One possibility is to consider the overall level of benefit--by allowing the group to proceed without the individual , is there increased benefit to more people ? Conversely , by allowing the individual to participate , will this person as an individual receive a greater level of good , regardless of outcome , than would the group succeeding without this individual ? Will the group achieve greater good and learn compassion and sacrifice if the individual is encouraged to participate ? Hunt also considers the question of fairness.Is it fair to not allow an individual to participate for whatever reason , even is the possibility of success is minimal ? Is it fair to the group to hinder their possibility of success ? Are there institutional rules governing these situations ? Can rules possibly made which provide solutions to all situations which may arise ? <p> One solution espoused by Hunt ( 1994 ) involves clearly knowing what the goals of the program are.Therefore , it is important to know whether the activities are a means or an end.If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities themselves are simply vehicles to reach other goals.If an activity is thought of as an end in itself however , then the doing of the activity , and therefore the completion of the activity , is the ultimate goal.He notes that knowing which of these is primary will influence your ethical **29;711;TOOLONG , as with the above risk-benefit analysis , Hunt recommends that professionals be aware of the ethical standards from which they are drawing and be prepared to offer rational arguments in support of their judgments.Again , the overriding principle must be " do no harm " and a psychologist bound by both APA principles and TAPG principles must be aware of these overriding ethical responsibilities and not lose sight of the ethical obligation one has to above all do no harm to participants.Decisions about group vs. individual benefit must be made in such a context , and solutions must provide the maximum benefit to all participants while bringing harm to none . <p> Finally , the issue of paternalism also falls under principle number five.Paternalism refers to when " an action is taken towards another person without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interest , and/or needs of that person " . ( Hunt , 1994 , p. 129 ) . For example , suppose a participant , of legal age and self-referred , believes they are receiving no benefit from a 10- day wilderness experience and feels he/she wishes to hike out and return home.The instructor believes that , in fact , the participant is receiving a significant benefit from the experience , but is unable to see this benefit clearly at the present time.Does the instructor have the right to attempt to force the participant to stay with the group ? <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) lays forth five guidelines for paternalism taken from medical ethics ( Vanderpool &amp; Weiss , cited in Hunt , 1994 ) : 1 ) paternalistic actions are taken toward the participant without their knowledge or their permission , 2 ) actions are justified for the benefit or the good of others , 3 ) the Doctor is benevolent and will perform only those actions which are likely to provide more benefit than harm , 4 ) those who undertake paternalistic acts without consent feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) the paternalistic acts are undertaken after obtaining as accurate of an assessment of outcomes or consequences as is possible.Hunt believes that it in order to make such decisions , professionals must determine whether or not the paternalistic acts are taking place within the context of these five guidelines.In addition , he recommends that it is up to the practitioners informed judgment to know what is truly in the best interest of the participant.As with previous ethical dilemmas , Hunt recommends that professionals utilize full informed consent prior to commencing the activities in order to best avoid such situations . <p> Social Responsibility <p> The sixth principle delineated by Gass ( 1995 ) is that staff recognize their level of social responsibility.As such , professionals need to remain aware of their responsibility to community and society along with respecting property and developing appropriate agency policies.This parallels the APA principle F:Social Responsibility , while deleting the additional APA mandate of a psychologist making public their knowledge psychology to contribute to increased human welfare.Including this mandate within this principle would increase the responsibility of psychologists using AT to provide a solid empirical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1994 ) cautions professionals in the field to continually remain aware of the fact that they operate within the realm of a larger social context and are not isolated from social issues.He raises the specific question of whether professionals have the right and responsibility to choose whether to provide services to groups or individuals who do not share the same social commitment ( e.g. , supremacist groups or groups who do not share environmentally based ethics ) . Hunt once again refers to knowing the goals of the programs as one solution , determining beforehand whether such social issues are a influential factor in the policies of the program.As a blanket statement , he cautions professionals to remain aware of the social implications of their work and their actions , warning that this may be an area in which to proceed with caution , as the implications for actions done in the AT context may extend beyond the setting . <p> Dual Relationships <p> The final principle discussed by Gass ( 1995 ) is that staff avoid dual relationships with participants that impair professional judgment . This involves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as intentionally avoiding dual relationships that may impair judgment.Gass notes possible examples of these types of relationships , including business or professional relationships , sexual relationships and inappropriate physical contact within the context of an activity.The APA devotes several specific ethical standards particular to these important issues , namely 1.17:Multiple Relationships , 1.19:Exploitive Relationships , 1.13:Personal Problems and Conflicts , 1.15:Misuse of Psychologists Influence , and standards 4.05-4.07 , principles involving the restrictions involved with engaging in sexual activity with current or former clients and therapy with former sexual partners . <p> Hunt ( 1994 ) discusses this as well , focusing more specifically on issues regarding sexual contact.As with APA guidelines , contact between a therapist and a participant is prohibited and the TAPG code states that " sexual intimacy is prohibited during the time of the professional **26;742;TOOLONG engaging in sexual intimacy with past participants bear the burden of proving that no exploitation is occurring . " ( Gass , 1993 ) . The APA code is more specific to this issue , stating specific time limits of waiting least two years beyond the termination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued responsibility to prove a lack of exploitation beyond the two year limit.Psychologists must remain aware that they are bound to the more restrictive APA code with regards to this issue . <p> In this instance of sexual activity between therapist and client , there is a clear boundary.However , given the instance of multi-day trips , as well as the high level of interaction involved in such activities , sexual situations between participants can and do arise.Such situations may arise not only between participants , but also between two instructors or therapists as well.According to Hunt , any type of sexual activity has the potential to greatly affect the overall functioning of the group.He notes clearly that he believes it to be rare that any type of sexual intimacy can occur between members of the group , including between the instructors , and not have an impact on the group . <p> One solution to this problem discussed by Hunt ( 1994 ) which he feels is overused is denial : by denying that any type of sexual energy will be present one can assume that it is not.Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like denial and will not work.By denying the presence of sexual energy or activity , the presence of such phenomena is likely to have an even greater impact on the group . <p> A therapist has the responsibility to prevent harm to the group , and must make decisions based on the premise that there may be possible detrimental effects on the group if members are engaging in such activity.However , conversely , Hunt ( 1994 ) discusses certain instances where potentially the effects on the group may be positive.If we are speaking of contact between participants , and we are assuming legal age , what if the sexual relationship has contributed to the better overall functioning of the participants and therefore contributes more positively to the group as a whole ? Should such contact be prohibited ? The same principles may hold true for sexual relationship between instructors.Clearly , if such a relationship has a negative impact it must be prohibited , but if the outcome is positive the answer is much less clear.It is important to note , however , that in reality such a situation is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunt ( 1994 ) promotes two solutions to such issues.The first falls , once again , into the realm of informed consent.By deciding upon the rules beforehand and making those rules clear to participants , instructors are able to make decisions which are more clear cut.Depending on a multitude of different variables , the rules may vary from group to group.However , through informed consent the guidelines will have been made as clear as is possible.Should , however , a situation arise which has not been made clear , Hunt recommends that professionals think critically beforehand about what the implications of sexual relationships are.In addition , the anticipation of situations which may arise beforehand between clients is also an effective way to prepare for such exigencies . <p> As has been discussed , adventure activities carry with them a unique set of situational variables . Also , as has been noted , the ethical principles are somewhat vague and open to interpretation , perhaps necessarily in order to allow for flexibility in programming.Many ethical difficulties are situation specific and therefore it is impossible in this discussion to address each type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to rely on standardized solutions to guide all ethical decisions . Therefore , it is difficult , if not impossible , to provide an ethical code to apply to every potential situation . Given that uncertainty , Schoel , Prouty , and Radcliffe ( 1988 ) recommend that each adventure therapist develop their own personalized ethical code , noting that " the most accurate measure of professionalism is the design and development of a personalized code of conduct " ( p. 45 ) . Although this statement was written prior to the formalized development of the TAPG code in 1991 , it still appears to hold true as a meta-principle in the area of ethical decision-making . Given the ambiguity andunpredictability inherent in the use of adventure-based activities as a therapeutic modality , this powerful statement remains at the core of what is essential in guiding the ethical decisions of present day adventure therapists . <p> Practicing psychologists using AT treatments and bound by the APA ethical standards carry the dual responsibility of being held accountable to both the TAPG ethical code and the APA ethical code.While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologists , the TAPG code carries with it more specifics related to AT.Therefore , psychologists in this area must be familiar with both and be prepared to act ethically at all times , as well as provide supervision in this area to those who may not be held accountable to both bodies.In this way , psychologists are in a unique position to serve the AT community and potentially contribute to an overall increase in the effectiveness of this type of treatment . <p> Chapter 4 <p> ADVENTURE-BASED THERAPY OUTCOME RESEARCH <p> The following discussion will be devoted to a review and detailed methodological critique of the outcome-based literature on AT.This will begin with a discussion of the evaluation required before a treatment can receive the designation of empirically supported ( EST ) . The discussion will then turn to a review of three meta-analyses , moving into a focus on outcome literature with adult populations , outcome literature with adolescent populations , and outcome as it relates to client characteristics . <p> Evaluation Criteria for Empirically Supported Treatments ( ESTs ) <p> Adventure therapy has been used with many different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally i 'll , PTSD sufferers , the disabled , substance abusers , eating disordered individuals , sexual abuse survivors , as well as normal populations ) , and it proponents claim it to be an efficacious treatment.In reality , however , the literature shows a range of discrepant findings.One potential explanation for discrepant findings among the existing research is the wide range of methodologies employed and the clear lack of scientific rigor with which many studies were conducted.Thus , the conclusions and insights which can be gained are limited . As will be seen , there have been a number of studies which suffer from severe methodological difficulties , therefore effectively rendering them scientifically useless in the evaluation of adventure-based therapy . <p> Gillis ( 1992 ) discusses common methodological errors found in the adventure-based therapy research , errors occurring at the most basic level of research design.Such fundamental design considerations as equivalent control groups , randomization , psychometrically sound outcome measures , clearly defined methodologies , appropriate statistical procedures , and follow-up are often overlooked.He also notes that many studies utilize quasi-experimental designs and thus the results have limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are diverse , which also limits the generalizability of results ( Kelley , 1993 ) . Unfortunately , as noted earlier there is no clear method of conducting adventure-based therapy ( Gillis , 1992 ) and it seems this confusion may be reflected in the research . <p> With the 1995 publication of the APA Division 12 Task Force on Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures came an increased awareness of the necessity for specific psychotherapeutic treatments to establish proven efficacy.The psychological community responded to this call for empirical validation , and a list of empirically supported treatments emerged.This list continues to grow in length ( Dobson &amp; Craig , 1998 ) . <p> Guidelines have been established for determining whether or not a treatment has received the empirical validation necessary to support claims of efficacy.Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) provide a specific structure designed to guide this evaluation , defining empirically supported treatments ( ESTs ) as " clearly specified psychological treatments shown to be efficacious in controlled research with a delineated population . " ( p. 7 ) . In addition they ask researchers to " consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> a ) Has the treatment been shown to be beneficial in controlled <p> research ? <p> b ) Is the treatment useful in applied setting and , if so , with what patients and under what circumstances ? <p> c ) Is the treatment efficient in the sense of being cost-effective relative to other alternative interventions ? " ( p.7 ) . <p> Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) also provide specific criteria necessary to be met in order for a treatment to receive the designation of EST.While such criteria have been published elsewhere ( Crits-Cristoph , 1998 ) and are discussed in detail by Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) , they will be listed here to provide background context for the discussion of the research specific to adventure-based therapy.The criteria are as follows : <p> 1 ) " Comparisons with a no-treatment control-group , alternative treatment group of placebo ( a ) in a randomized clinical trial , controlled single case experiment , or equivalent time samples design and ( b ) in which the EST is statistically significantly superior to no treatment , placebo , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment already established in efficacy and power is sufficient to detect moderate differences . <p> 2 ) These studies must have been conducted with ( a ) a treatment manual or its logical equivalent ; ( b ) a population treated for specified problems , for whom inclusion criteria have been delineated in a reliable , valid manner ; ( c ) reliable and valid outcome assessment measures which tap at minimum problems targeted for change ; and ( d ) appropriate data analysis . <p> 3 ) For a designation of efficacious , the superiority of the EST must have been shown in at least 2 independent research settings ( sample size of three or more in the case of single-case experiments ) . If there is conflicting evidence , the preponderance of the well-controlled data must support the ESTs efficacy . <p> 4 ) For a designation of possibly efficacious , one study with similar characteristics as above suffices in the absence of conflicting evidence . <p> 5 ) For a designation of efficacious and specific , the EST must have been shown to be statistically superior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preponderance of the well-controlled data must support the ESTs efficacy and specificity . " ( Chambless &amp; Hollon , 1998 ) . <p> While solid research design is assumed in this listing , Borkovec ( 1994 ) discusses in more detail additional important aspects of design which are relevant to a critique of any treatment , specifically client considerations , therapist considerations , and dependent variable considerations.Such aspects will be discussed further in the next chapter.Importantly , as will be seen in the following review , much of the AT research contains flaws such that criterion specific to all psychotherapy research are threatened , deficient , or as yet have not been considered . <p> Meta-Analyses <p> In order to consolidate the work of numerous researchers utilizing varying methodologies and diverse diagnostic categories , there have been three meta-analyses conducted in the overall area of adventure programming.While none of these analyses were conducted exclusively in the area of AT ( AT program results were often collapsed with other outdoor adventure programs ) , a review of these findings may she 'd light on important AT-related methodological issues.However , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimal overlap with the body of literature which is reviewed following a discussion of the meta-analyses . <p> There appear to be several reasons for this lack of overlap.Cason &amp; Gillis ( 1994 ) do not include in their list of references those studies reviewed in the meta-analysis , including only citations from their preliminary introduction.Therefore , any overlap can not be determined.Hans ( 1997 ) analysis focused specifically on adventure programming and locus of control.Thus , such studies were not included in the analysis which follows of the outcome research evaluating the efficacy of AT as a treatment modality.Hattie , Marsh , Neill , and Richards ( 1997 ) review focused specifically on studies with Outward Bound programs.As previously noted , while utilizing similar formats , Outward Bound does not expressly pursue therapeutic goals in their programs.Thus , outcomes studied from Outward Bound programs have only limited relevance to a therapeutic context . Note-those studies reviewed in the following sections which examine outcome in Outward Bound programming are included in the review as they are the best of what research is presently available.While Hattie et al.s study does contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reviewed separately due to questions of validity in Hattie et al.s analysis.Furthermore , many of the studies reviewed in the meta-analyses are unpublished.Finally , all focus generally on outdoor adventure programming instead of specifically on AT , subsuming AT into this broad category . <p> Cason and Gillis <p> Cason &amp; Gillis ( 1994 ) conducted the first meta-analysis , examining the adventure programming literature with adolescents.While suffering from serious methodological concerns , this study is commonly cited as supportive evidence for the efficacy of AT with adolescents and thus warrants close scrutiny.In this first attempt at consolidation , Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) examined all of the available literature on adventure programming with adolescents.They reviewed 79 published studies were reviewed and out of these 36 were excluded for lack of sufficient statistical information , a non-empirical basis , or utilization of a sample not of the appropriate age . Unique " researcher-designed " outcome measures were also excluded from the analysis , as were outcome measures used less than five times due to difficulties interpreting average effect size of such a small group.Such detail is included to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literature . <p> Ultimately , 43 published studies were reviewed and effect sizes examined based on 19 outcome measures and 11,238 adolescent participants.Quality of studies was ranked by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) on a scale of 1-6 . This rating consisted of a composite score based on utilization of random assignment , timing of measurement ( i.e. , pre , post and/or follow-up ) , employment of a control group and if so , whether this group was included in any follow-up.Studies receiving a ranking of one were noted as " requiring only pre-and posttesting without a control group " and those receiving a ranking of six employing " a control group with random assignment and pre-post and follow-up testing for both experimental and control groups " ( Cason &amp; Gillis , p. 45 ) . <p> Of note is that only five studies examined received a ranking of five or six in their analysis.Unfortunately , studies with serious methodological errors ( e.g. , lack of control group ) were included in this analysis and there was no differentiation made between those studiesin the summary scores , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only designs were considered to be among the most acceptable of those available , limiting further any conclusions based on this analysis . <p> Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) also examined the relationship between design ranking and effect size , reporting that 70.6% of the effect sizes were found in studies without randomly assigned control groups.They reported a significant negative correlation between research design and effect size , indicating that effect size went down as the methodology employed increased in rigor.Seemingly in contrast to this , however , Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) report that there were significantly higher effect sizes in those studies that were published as compared to those that were not ( e.g. , dissertations ) . Importantly however , the majority of studies included in the meta-analysis were unpublished . <p> Overall , they found a summary effect size of .314 , which potentially suggests a moderate improvement overall.However , more important information is found in the variation of the effect sizes , which ranged from -1.48 to 4.26 , with a standard deviation of .62 . One explanation for these discrepant findings is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores on a math achievement test ( 4.26 effect size ) to movement toward and external locus of control ( -1.48 effect size ) . One must wonder at the theoretical rational for including such diverse outcome measures in the same overall summary score.While each may reflect some sort of change , there may be no relationship between such variables.Therefore , simply comparing change , change seemingly occurring in any domain at all , is meaningless.This diversity in outcome measures also reflects the clear lack of existing standards for evaluating such programs . <p> Program variables studied included program length and participant characteristics ( e.g. , delinquency status , mean age , presence of physical or emotional disabilities , referral source ) . This list of variables provides further insight into the amount of methodological difficulties which plague the literature . Given that participants from such diverse backgrounds as school settings and judicial involvement ( i.e. , delinquents are included within the same sample as other participant groups ) are included in the same sample , it is assumed that the impact of such participant characteristics has not yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these variables leads to even greater concern with regards to the findings.Program length was considered , and longer programs were found to have greater effect sizes.However , closer scrutiny of such programs leaves no doubt as to the lack of validity in this finding.Longer programs typically involve an experience where participants live with their leaders or therapists and the other group members around the clock for some period of time.These types of programs were included in the same analysis with those that were one day in length.There is no way to rule out any alternative explanations for reported change based on setting , client characteristics , therapist/leader variables , relationships between participants and the leader , or any other multitude of possibilities.Without greater control for such variables , there can be no such comparison between effect sizes.Therefore , this can not be considered as a valid finding . <p> As noted above , widely differingadolescent population groups were collapsed together in the study.Although participant characteristics beyond those listed were not considered , Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) claim no difference in effect size based on identified populations.However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across populations , and that this may impact the results.For example , they report that treatment populations were often given a battery of clinically-based evaluation measures while " normal " adolescents often completed non-clinical measures such as self-esteem and locus of control.Given the entirely different rationale behind this array of measures , there can be no true basis of comparison.Finally , there is no differentiation made between adventure-based therapy programs and basic outdoor adventure programs , further confounding this comparison of effect sizes . <p> Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) note specifically that their study is in no way able to answer questions regarding potential differences in outcome based on client characteristics , referral source , therapist variables , or differences in instrumentation.They note that these such variables are not actually reported often enough in the literature to allow for coding at the meta-analytic level , and state that this is necessary for future research.They also remark that differences in programming and activities utilized needs to be more closely examined in order to determine what types of program characteristics might impact change , noting that without such descriptions replication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 ) . <p> Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) further comment that " in order to determine a more meaningful estimate of the effectiveness of adventure programming , empirically based research must develop in a more logical and consistent direction . " ( p. 43 ) . They also state that programs which report no more than program length , and average scores of participants on a particular measure are nor longer useful , a statement that seems clearly obvious to anyone informed by the EST literatureUnfortunately , it is not clear whether such studies were utilized in their meta-analysis , although based on the design considerations it seems likely that in fact some were . <p> Clearly , the findings of this meta-analysis must be viewed as invalid and no conclusions can be drawn based on the results . However , as the first attempt to consolidate such findings , it can be used to stress important considerations in conducting such future meta-analytic studies . <p> Han <p> Han ( 1997 ) , in an unpublished masters thesis , also conducted a meta-analysis , focusing specifically on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control.While locus of control may be of limited clinical utility , given the lack of such meta-analytic studies it is important to explore Hans findings . She examined 24 studies which utilized locus of control as an outcome measure which included 1632 participants.Mean ages were not reported , and there is very limited information regarding participant characteristics . <p> In this analysis Han ( 1997 ) included only those studies utilizing a pre and post-test assessment of locus of control and reporting what was deemed by Han to be " an appropriate level " of statistical **25;770;TOOLONG , there is no operational definition given for " appropriate " . In addition , there was no examination or discussion of study design in Hans analysis and thus there is no information available on which to evaluate the strength of the findings.Therefore , the results are relatively **28;797;TOOLONG , I will continue with this discussion of Hans findings on order to continue exploring the relevant literature . <p> Han found an overall mean effect size of .36 for locus of control , reporting this as an shift towards intenality across conditions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shown to be associated with increased self-confidence , decreased anxiety , and higher levels of adjustment and self-esteem ( Deery , 1983 ; Shasby , Heuchert &amp; Gansneder , 1984 ; Langsner &amp; Anderson , 1987 ) . Standard deviations were not reported.Given that we have no information as to the methodological quality of those studies included in Hans analysis , unfortunately there is no basis by which to evaluate the validity of either of these claims . <p> Attempting to build on the findings of Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) , Han coded her studies based on program and population characteristics.The populations were identified by Han ( 1997 ) as:a ) clinical , participants who carried some sort of DSM-related diagnosis ; b ) adjudicated , court referred ; c ) non-clinical , including school groups , outward bound participants , and volunteers ; and d ) non-clinical referred , which included " special populations who were referred but did not carry a diagnosis . " ( p. 21 ) . There were no differences regarding changes in locus of control between populations.Of note , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populations as compared to 13 non-clinical.Given the inequality of the sample populations , we can make no generalizations based on this data with regards to effects of programs on specific populations in the area of locus of control , particularly clinical populations . <p> Program characteristics reported included the goals of the program , the type of program , and the daily duration of the program.Program goals included four categories : 1 ) recreation , 2 ) **34;827;TOOLONG , 3 ) adjunctive therapy , and 4 ) primary therapy ( PRIM ) . Programs reporting a primary goal of therapy had a significantly higher mean effect size for locus of control ( .64 ) then did those reporting a goals of education , development or prevention ( .35 ) , and adjunctive therapy ( .30 ) . <p> Types of program examined included 1 ) wilderness/expedition format , 2 ) camping , or base camp based model , and 3 ) activity-based model . ( The reader is referred to the earlier discussion of such program types for more information . ) Programs were then categorized on " daily duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and included a pure residential setting where participants were together for the entire duration of the program , a semi-residential designation where the program consisted of daily meetings with the participants returning to their respective homes combined with some overnights.In addition , this category included those participants involved in inpatient hospitals who remained in this setting throughout but for whom the AT intervention was utilized as an adjunct modality.This appears to be a serious confound , and it is unclear why this was not a separate designation . The third category included those participants involved in outpatient treatment . <p> Outpatient populations showed a significantly lower shift towards internality than did those in the semi-residential or the residential programs . As this is of limited clinical utility , what could have potentially provided more relevant information would have been the analysis of the interaction between program goal and participant group.Unfortunately , while the data were available to make such comparisons , this step was overlooked by Han ( 1997 ) . While any conclusions would have been limited by the aforementioned methodological constraints , such an analysis may have provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least as related to locus of control . <p> This level of detail is included in this discussion to show Hans ( 1997 ) attempts at a somewhat more rigorous delineation of client and program characteristics.While is still lacking in such specifics as other clients characteristics , therapist/leader variables , and a clear operationalization of types of programs , when compared to Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) this suggests movement in that direction.Unfortunately , however , Hans ( 1997 ) study suffers from many of the same methodological errors as does Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) . Aside from the lack of information regarding quality of studies , there is no mention of the utilization of randomization or appropriate control groups , participant or therapist/leader characteristics , or the use of appropriate statistical methods ( beyond Hans ( 1997 ) personal designation ) . In addition , identified populations were not mutually exclusive , nor were designations of program duration clearly specified.Furthermore , only 3 of the studies reviewed involved clinical populations , as compared to 13 non-clinical.Related to this , locus of contort lacks clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) , Hans ( 1997 ) study should not be cited as support for AT efficacy . <p> Hattie , March , Neill , and Richards <p> Hattie , Marsh , Nell , and Richards ( 1997 ) conducted the third meta-analysis to date , with a mean sample age of 22.28 , and an age range of 11 to 42 years . They analyzed effect sizes in 96 studies of exclusively Outward Bound programs.The mean length of program is reported to be 24 days with a standard deviation of 16 , indicating wide variability.Participants were coded as normal , delinquent , or business managers , reflecting the target populations for Outward Bound programs.No further information was given about the participants . <p> As an aside , it is important to note that while Outward Bound programs may achieve some therapeutic goals , the primary focus is not on therapeutic level processing.In addition , a backcountry setting was a necessary element of those Outward Bound experiences included in their analysis.Therefore , the results may not be generalizable to programs that are primarily therapeutic in nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the similarities in history and modality between Outward Bound and AT programs , this study may provide relevant background information to the study of AT . <p> Their meta-analysis also contained a portion of studies that included preliminary testing and follow-up , indicating that 18% of the studies involved responses collected one month prior to beginning the program and 18% contained studies which assessed follow-up effects.Given the impact of excitement and anticipation immediately preceding a program and the potential for inflated scores immediately following a program , this is an important difference between this meta-analysis and those prior.Interestingly , however , there were no systematic effects found for prior testing . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) found a summary effect size of .34 , very close to that found by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) . In addition , they reported an increase in effect size of .17 for assessments conducted up to 18 months after the program ended ( mean= 5.5 months ) , translating to an overall improvement effect size of .51 . They believe that this finding suggests that participants continue to experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrasted to most forms of intervention which show steady losses in treatment gains with the passage of time ( Neill &amp; Richards , 1998 ) . <p> As discussed in the reviews prior , however , one can not be sure of the quality of such follow-up.There are no data available as to attrition rates in follow-up , nor are there any data available as to the setting that participants were released into . Therefore , it is impossible to separate the effects of self-selection in the follow-up ( i.e. , those with unfavorable outcomes may have dropped out of the study ) , as well as the effects of environmental considerations upon release.There are also no data available on what types of outcomes were examined for follow-up and who gathered this data.Important future considerations when examining such data include knowing how improvement was defined and in what domains was it evaluated , as well as knowing whether there was any experimenter bias associated with the data . <p> Hattie , et al ( 1997 ) did conduct an analysis of study quality and excluded from their meta-analysis those studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in mean effect sizes for those studies coded as high vs. medium quality , therefore they did not separate the **25;863;TOOLONG , the definitions of what constitutes low , medium and high quality studies are overly vague.Low quality studies were defined as there being " no information available on the quality of the test " ( p. 58 ) . Studies rated as medium quality included those where " some attempt was made to reference psychometric qualities of the test " ( p. 58 ) , and studies rated as high quality were based on the study being " published and/or norms available in publications " ( p. 58 ) . <p> While this is a positive attempt at deleting those studies of poor quality from any sort of scientific consideration , there needs to be further information available as to the quality of the data included in the analysis before a truly informed decision can be rendered regarding the conclusions of the meta-analysis.The limited information provided by Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) is imprecise and relatively **28;890;TOOLONG , this is clearly a positive step when taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In addition , related to problems related to ratings of study quality , Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) noted that small sample sizes for most of the studies reviewed led to low power , estimating that the average power of the studies they included in their analysis was .65 for medium effect sizes , pointing out that therefore these studies contain statistical power below the accepted level of .80 . They discuss this finding in the context of the literature in this area , noting that " it is perhaps no surprise ( given the low sample sizes ) that evaluators sense major change but are frustrated at not detecting statistical significance " ( Hattie et al. , 1997 , p. 49 ) . They report that by using meta-analytic techniques , they were able to use an " alternative methodology " that " avoids the pitfalls of using small samples , capitalizes on the diversity of outcomes and programs , and is not as concerned with statistical significance " ( p. 49 ) . However , this statement is questionable when considered in the context of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies reviewed . <p> Hattie et al ( 1997 ) found no immediate differences between effect sizes for participants based on background ( i.e. , " normal " , delinquent , or business managers ) They report , however , that the mean effect size at follow-up is greater for delinquents than the other two groups ( mean =.34 ) , and it is possible that this increased mean may be due to the wide range in reported follow-up effect sizes for this group ( range =-.05 to .74 ) . Standard deviations were not available.Age and gender were examined for the first time in these meta-analyses as potential moderating variables.Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) noted difficulties in examining age as a moderator variable of effect size , indicating that there was too little information available about the ages of participants in the studies included in their analysis.As an attempt at examining these effects , they split the studies into two groups , one utilizing school age participants and one using adult participants ( including university students ) . They found a greater effect size for adults with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both groups.The authors note , however , that this may be an effect related more to self-selection due to motivation rather than an actual increased change mechanism for adults , and discuss the need for reported participant motivations in future research.It may be that school-age participants are referred unwillingly by parents or school staff , whereas adults are much more likely to be volunteers . Gender was also examined and while Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) note there are confounds in that most studies utilize mixed-gender groups , they claim it appears as though there are no differences in effect sizes for male female participants . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) also broke the program type into specific categories , differentiating between wilderness/expedition programs and adventure programs utilizing less extreme physical challenges.They report that wilderness programs appear to have the highest effect , but claim that the success of these programs with delinquents skews these results.In addition , they examined the length of the program and concluded that longer programs ( those greater than 20 days in duration ) have higher effect sizes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding , age of participants and country of origin ( Australia vs. the United States ) . They state that for student-age participants the effects were similar regardless of length of program or country of origin and that for adults the results were more marked for longer programs in Australia as compared to the United States , perhaps indicating an underlying and unexplored difference in those participants from different countries in their response to the program.This examination of the interactive effects is much applauded , given that such a potentially important avenue was overlooked in the previous analyses . <p> Outcome was coded into six dimensions which encompassed a listing of different subcategories subsumed under these major dimensions , and separate effect sizes were computed for each dimension and specific subcategory ( note-in the interest of brevity , the reader is referred to the original article for individual subcategory effect sizes ) : leadership ( effect size=.38 , subcategory range of .46-.05 ) , self-concept ( effect size=.28 , subcategory range of .47-.08 ) , academic ( effect size=.24 , subcategory range of .50-.45 ) personality ( effect size= .37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size=.32 , subcategory range of .55-.13 ) and adventuresomeness ( effect size =.38 , subcategory range of .39-.24 ) . Of note is that there are no clinically-related outcomes , which may be understandable given that the programs examined were not specifically therapeutic in nature . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) report that " the effects across these six dimensions are systematically high " ( p. 66 ) . Follow-up effect sizes for each outcome dimension are also considered and they report that these effects are maintained over time for all categories but adventuresomness.While an outstanding finding , this appears to be a fairly sweeping assertion and it may be important to expand on such claims.Unfortunately , as noted the necessary information on study quality required to truly evaluate such claims is unavailable . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) were also the first of the meta-analytic reviewers to employ statistical techniques beyond effect size comparisons when analyzing their data.Reportedly using setwise regression , they claimed that 36% of the variance in effect sizes could be explained by the program effects , background effects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least amount of variance could be attributed to study variables , although this may be reflective of their limited definition of what constituted study quality.Interestingly , this finding is in contrast to Cason &amp; Gilliss ( 1994 ) finding that effect size increased as study quality went down.However , this could potentially also be a function of the fact that Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) excluded those studies they deemed of poor quality from their analysis.Also based on the regression analysis , on the participant level they claimed that the most variance was explained by participant age , length of program ( two categories , longer or shorter ) , and country of origin . This appears to be one of the first attempts at examining the interaction between program effects and participant effects . <p> Clearly , this meta-analysis has moved beyond many of the criticisms leveled at the previously addressed studies.However , the overall validity of any meta-analytic review is based on the quality of the studies included and this study leaves this question unanswered.The definitions given were not specific enough to allow for any true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be no conclusions with clear validity drawn from the results.While it can be used to guide further analyses that examine the issue of study quality much more closely , the results of this study remain **25;920;TOOLONG , given the increase in methodological sophistication found in this study as compared to those reviewed previously , it is worthwhile to provide a summary of the methodological improvements . <p> The continued inclusion of statistical procedures beyond simple comparisons of effect size ( i.e. , regression analysis ) , utilized by Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) and the examination of interactions between variables could potentially provide us with a much greater understanding of the relationships between variables.Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) also attempted to further define client characteristics , even at the most simplistic level ( i.e. , participant age ) and examined the interactions of this characteristic with other variables.While the lack of information given regarding client characteristics in the studies they reviewed precluded any analysis beyond the breaking of participants into basic groupings , this was an important step was overlooked in the previous two analyses.In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate that the state of the literature in AT is such that additional characteristics are rarely available . <p> The detailed analysis of the outcome data was also more thorough in this study.It appeared that the groupings of the outcome measures were well thought out and information about the specific sub-categories was given when relevant to achieving greater understanding . Such information was also unavailable in the previously reviewed studies.In addition , the detailed analysis of the follow-up data related to specific outcome gives us insight into the importance of such data for future evaluations.Further information could have been provided about the format of the programs examined.While the programs were broken into two groups , expedition and adventure , there is limited information to be gained from this distinction and a further break-down of program characteristics would have been useful . <p> Given that the meta-analysis conducted by Cason and Gills ( 1994 ) as well as Han ( 1997 ) both suffer from similar methodological flaws , it unfortunately appears that we can reach no solid conclusions about adventure programming based on any of these reviews.Chambless and Hollon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " We think it is unwise to rely on meta-analyses unless something is known about the quality of the studies that have been included and there is confidence in the data . " ( p. 13 ) . Unfortunately , for these three meta-analyses such is not the case.Sadly , this seems to reflect the current state of the AT literature , and while such efforts to consolidate the AT literature are laudable , they may perhaps be premature.Such reviews may be better conducted when the field overall has reached a state where there is enough high quality literature available to conduct truly meaningful meta-analyses.Further insight into this problematic issue may be gained in the examination of the studies which follow . <p> Use of Adventure-Based Therapywith Adults <p> There have been four studies that have recognizably added significant contributions to the literature relating to AT with adult populations.In this section , studies by Kelley ( 1993 ) , Banaka and Young ( 1985 ) , Kelley , Coursey , and Selby ( 1997 ) , and Herbert ( 1998 ) will be reviewed in detail.The section will end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kelley <p> In an review of the AT literature with mentally i 'll adults , Kelley ( 1993 ) similarly notes that the methodology employed in the studies he reviews is inadequate due to lack of rigorous controls and psychometrically adequate comparisons.Kelley reviewed 17 studies in this area which involved both adventure-based therapy alone as a treatment modality and adventure-based therapy as an adjunct treatment.Of the studies he reviewed , he notes that only one of those came close to reaching methodological adequacy.In fact , the majority of the studies simply base their conclusions on anecdotal evidence . <p> Similar to those included in the meta-analyses , problems with the studies Kelley ( 1993 ) reviewed included lack of a control group or a lack of equivalent testing of the control group , lack of post-test data , use of unstructured interviews or instruments with no reported reliability or validity data , a lacking of statistical analyses or inadequate documentation of reported analyses , and the use of anecdotal reports as evidence of improvement.In addition , Kelley discusses such confounds with this population as novelty effects and effects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no interpretation of the data in this area regarding the efficacy of such adventure-based interventions for mentally i 'll adults.Given these severe methodological errors , the flawed studies will not be reviewed here in detail and reported outcomes will be listed only to provide illustration of the types of outcomes examined as the data is not considered to be valid . <p> Echoing the earlier critical discussion , Kelley ( 1993 ) suggests that future research is necessary in this area which employs such standard research designs as control group comparisons , randomization , and the use of appropriate psychological measures with demonstrated validity for mentally i 'll populations.In addition , he also discusses how few studies have utilized long-term follow-up data and that data of this sort is necessary to address the long-term utility of such interventions . <p> Banaka and Young <p> As noted , there is one study discussed by Kelley ( 1993 ) which employed more appropriate methodologies.Therefore , this study will be reviewed in detail.Banaka and Young ( 1985 ) reported the effects of a two-week wilderness camp on skills related to community coping for chronically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most diagnosed as schizophrenic , from two state hospitals were nominated by hospital staff based on chronicity and staff perceived adaptability to the program.Mean age of participants was 30 . Participants were screened by interview to further determine eligibility and were randomly assigned to the control or the experimental group.However , 20 of this group chose to not participate and were replaced by controls , leaving a total number of 48 participants and 31 controls.Therefore , while there were solid attempts at random assignment there was still no rigorous way to control for selection bias in the groupings . <p> The staff for the camp included 12 hospital volunteers and 12 professional guides , six of whom had no association with the hospital.There is no further information available on the staff.Two staff involved in the program and the participants themselves filled out rating forms covering five domains : personal care , formal social system , informal social contacts , social acceptability , and task orientation.Measures were taken at pre-test , one time during the two-week intervention , at post-test , and three weeks post-completion.The control group participated in the standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the control group for time 1 to time 2 , therefore there was no additional data collected for controls and these early scores were used as comparisons.Results showed that the experimental group was significantly improved on seven of the ten scales at the camps close and that those changes were maintained for three weeks post completion on four of the seven scales at follow-up . <p> A six month follow-up showed a significant difference in discharge rates for the experimental groups ( 92.7% as compared to 55% ) , although variability information was not provided.The experimental group spent significantly more time in thecommunity following discharge , and rehospitalization costs of controls were twice that of the experimental group.This suggests the possibility of cost effectiveness for such a treatment.Regression models were employed , and the experimental group change scores on 4 of the 10 scales frompre-testing to three week follow-up were predictive of community-based success ( Banaka &amp; Young , 1985 ) . <p> This study is one of the better conducted to date , employing attempts at randomization , an adequate control group , and appropriate follow-up , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first study reviewed which made any attempt at assessing the impact of individual differences in change scores on successful outcome.However , it still suffers from methodological inadequacies . <p> To elaborate , the measures used by Banaka and Young ( 1985 ) were devised for the purposes of the study and therefore there is no psychometric data available for the measures.The staff conducting the ratings were also participant-observers , and therefore the ratings themselves were subject to experimenter bias.The lack of testing of controls at post-test and follow-up leaves open the possibility of maturation effects , Although the one month that elapsed is a fairly short amount of time , this amount of time elapsing may have greater relevance when considering the effects of such time for psychiatric inpatients . The statistical procedures utilized were also somewhat inadequate.In addition , there is minimal information available on the participants , and such information as length of time spent prior to the program in the hospital and further diagnostic information would have been helpful in evaluating generalizability.As aforementioned , there is also the problem of selection bias . Finally , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness camp , specifically regarding their expertise or familiarity with therapeutic principles , nor is there any specific information available on the program itself.Information such as this is necessary in order for such findings to be compared to the effects of other similar programs in the future . <p> Kelley , Coursey , and Selby <p> Kelley , Coursey , and Selby ( 1997 ) conducted one of the most well thought out and clinically relevant studies to date , utilizing a chronically mentally i 'll population and stating expressly therapeutic goals.Participants involved in outpatient psychosocial rehabilitation programs were recruited to participate in an adventure program which consisted of nine weekly day-long outings focusing on sequentially more challenging adventure activities ( e.g. , hiking , rock climbing , caving , and canoeing ) in groups of 8-12 . In addition , this program also integrated a self-instructional training ( Meichenbaum &amp; Cameron , 1973 ) component into the activities , thus integrating specific cognitive-behavioral techniques . <p> Staff included clinical psychology master and doctoral level students with extensive outdoor experience , as well as other experienced student leaders.Some groups included agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in leadership throughout the program . <p> Participants were separated into two diagnostic groups , schizophrenic ( N=36 ) or affective or schizoaffective disorders ( N=33 ) . The experimental group consisted of 50 mixed gender participants and the control group consisted of 19 participants.Mean age of participants was 31 and participants had been in treatment for an average of ten years.All participants attended the same rehabilitation center and volunteered for the program.The control group was provided by those participants who were unable to participate due to scheduling conflicts , as well as those who had to drop-out of the program due to later arising conflicts ( e.g. , procured employment , scheduling difficulties ) . Participants were screened for psychological and physical suitability for the program prior to admission . <p> Pre-test self-report measures were completed while waiting for admission to the program and also just prior to beginning the program.Controls completed such measures at an equivalent interval.There were no differences found between the experimental group and the control group on such measures , nor were there any reported changes for either group during the wait-list period ( approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measures upon finishing the program , while the controls completed the measures at an equivalent nine week interval.Unfortunately , there were no follow-up data available . <p> Clinically relevant dependent measures were used to assess the following areas:self-esteem and self-efficacy , using several self-efficacy scales and one self-esteem scale ( Rosenberg , 1965 ) ; anxiety and depression , using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , Trait Version ( STAI ; Speilberger , Gorusch , Lushene , Vagg , &amp; Jacobs , 1977 ) ; the Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ; Beck &amp; Sterr , 1987 ) , and the Anxiety and Depression subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory ( BSI ; Derogatis &amp; Melisantros , 1982 ) ; trust vs. , paranoid tendencies ; and locus of control.Additional psychiatric symptoms were also measured using the remaining subscales of the BSI ( Kelley , et al , 1997 ) . <p> The data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of covariance ( MANCOVA ) techniques , with pre-test scores as covariates and post-test scores as the dependent variables . Results showed significant increases in self-esteem and self-efficacy for the experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases were found for both groups on the BSI anxiety and depression subscales . Kelley et al ( 1997 ) report that the differences were larger for the experimental group , although it is unclear if this is a statistically significant difference.No differences were found on the BDI.There was no main effect for the intervention in the trust vs. paranoia domain , but a significant interaction emerged for group by diagnosis in this area.Examination of this interaction revealed that on the Trust and Cooperation scale , experimental participants with affective or schizoaffective disorders showed significant increases in these areas.For schizophrenic participants the results were moderately reversed.For the BSI subscales of Interpersonal Sensitivity and Hostility , decreased symptoms were shown for all experimental participants , while schizophrenic controls showed increases and controls showed decreases.No differences were found in locus of control or other psychiatric symptoms.This finding with regards to locus of control seems to contradict other studies in this review.Overall , results suggest that there may be an immediate effect for adventure participants in the areas of self-efficacy , self-esteem , anxiety , depression and trust.In addition , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the intervention . <p> This study is noteworthy as it is the only study to date that utilizes a battery of measures addressing changes in specific pathological symptoms , and the only study that examines differences in AT outcome across such groups.In addition , it is also the only studythat specifically delineates a clearly recognizable use of a specific therapeutic orientation ( self-instructional training ) , along with other more common AT therapeutic principles such as group level processing , challenge , sequencing , etc .. The use of clinically trained staff is also worthy of mention , as is the use of statistical procedures of appropriate sophistication.Future studies employing similar methodologies could employ regression techniques as well in order to analyze any utility of pre-test measures or change scores as predictors of change . <p> While noteworthy for all of these reasons , this study still suffers from problems with standardization that raise questions of validity.There were particular problems with standardization of groups.The control and experimental groups contained differing numbers of participants , as well as differences in their diagnostic composition , thus leading to a lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differ **26;947;TOOLONG were only required to participate in three of the adventure groups , and therefore attendance fluctuated.This may have potentially impacted the nature of the group experience and also may have contributed to individual differences in the experience.Such differences in participation may have led to differences in level of change reported , thereby impacting the overall group mean.The sequencing and choice of activities was also different for groups based on the time of year and instructor expertise.Furthermore , the composition of instructors/therapists for each groups varied , with different training levels and numbers of staff across groups.This may have led to differences in the dependent variables based on therapist effects . <p> The use of drop-outs as controls is also questionable , although wait-list measures indicated no between group differences and no differences between those that were unable to participate for scheduling reasons vs. those who dropped out for comparable reasons . Differences in motivation between groups , however , may have indirectly impacted the results . <p> Nevertheless , this study is the most clinically relevant of all available studies to date.While suffering from methodological inadequacies related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an AT intervention with a population such asthis is worthy of further investigation which attempts to control for those factors mentioned . Future research should also attempt to employ standardization of training levels , experience , etc. of staff.It is worth noting , however , that difficulties in standardization of client experience plague all psychotherapy researchers . In addition , further delineation of the use of such therapeutic techniques as self-instructional training should be provided in order to begin considering the potential impact of such techniques on the overall intervention.Finally , follow-up must be implemented to determine if such therapeutic gains are maintained over time.This is of particular importance when evaluating an AT intervention due to potential effects based on novelty or exercise.These and other methodological issues will be further addressed it the later chapter focusing on methodological considerations in AT . <p> Herbert <p> Herbert ( 1998 ) conducted another study in this area which employs appropriate scientific rigor , examining the effects of an adventure-based therapy program on sustaining employment for disabled adults.Thirty-eight participants were recruited from community based rehabilitation programs and randomly assigned to the no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved backpacking , canoeing , rock climbing , ropes course activities , camping , and team initiatives . In an attempt to provide an element of control to the treatment , the activities were identically sequenced and the facilitators remained the same for each group.Initially Herbert planned three groups , one group receiving the eight- day intervention alone , one receiving the eight-day intervention plus a three-day follow-up intervention at three months post-completion , and a control group.Unfortunately , the follow-up was canceled due to inclement weather ( flooding ) and the scores of the two experimental groups were collapsed . <p> Pre and post-test measures of locus of control scale and self-esteem were administered to the experimental group and the control group at a comparable eight- day interval . Dependent measures and qualitative interviews were completed at three months follow-up and the dependent measures were again administered at one- year follow-up.Employment records were also examined for one year following the intervention . <p> Adult participants included both males and females carrying the diagnosis of schizophrenia , moderate metal retardation , personality disorder , orthopedic disabilities or multiple disabilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for controls.The adventure facilitators included experienced adventure facilitators unknown to the participants , as well as two volunteers from the supported employment program with whom the participants were familiar . <p> Results showed that participants had increases in self-esteem and locus of control immediately following the intervention.However , this change dissipated in the year following the treatment.No impact was found on sustained employment.Participants responses to the qualitative interviews revealed that participants felt the treatment helped them to feel better about themselves , helped them to recognize they had greater abilities than they thought , and helped them to acquire better skills in handling interpersonal situations . <p> While this study did follow such crucial design considerations as appropriate control group comparisons and randomization , as well as attempts at standardization through the use of similarly sequenced activities for each group and the same facilitators , it still leaves open the question of whether the treatment itself led to the increases in self-esteem and locus of control.While the sequencing of such activities was in fact documented and attempts were made to follow a planned curriculum , there is still the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider this a well-controlled experiment.It is possible that any results were simply due to novelty effects.It is also possible that the relationships made with the facilitators over the eight-day period may have contributed to such an increase.Indeed , there may have been a significant effect associated with the fact that two of the staff members from the sustained employment program were also facilitators , leaving the study open to bias due to therapist effects.Unfortunately , however , given the populations included , it is may be necessary to always include such staff on such an excursion in order to help maintain the psychological stability of the patients and to help them attend to any special needs.This may be a difficulty inherent in conducting such a study , and leads to the long-term necessity of possibly creating and examining more integrated programs ( Herbert , 1998 ) <p> In addition , there is also self-selection bias inherent in such a voluntary treatment . There may be individual differences impacting those who chose to participate in ways that may be different from those who choose to abstain.Therefore , the results may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such activities . Perhaps further qualitative analysis , while being unable to lead to solid empirical conclusions , could help to further elucidate the mechanisms leading to such increases in outcome measures.This type of analysis may give us insight into whether it is actually the treatment that effects change , or whether there are other variables which may be systematically effecting the results . <p> Herberts ( 1998 ) results also point to the need for follow-up in such programs to attempt to facilitate the maintenance of treatment gains over time.In addition , there needs to be information given as to concurrent treatment of participants in order to potentially address the impact of such treatment and how this can interact with the effects of a specific adventure-based intervention.Perhaps treatment could be integrated into the follow-up program such that those care-givers involved with the participants upon completion of the program could work to build-on the learning and growth that occurred in the intervention in order to maintain such gains in ways that may have lasting impact on the participants . <p> Herberts ( 1998 ) study , while showing some methodological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may impact participants views of themselves in a positive way.While it is impossible to make any interpretations as to the mechanisms of such change , it seems that such a program may have some immediate effect.Further research examining the process of change and the impact of individuals differences on such change is necessary in order to draw any further conclusions . <p> Other Studies <p> AT is also commonly used as treatment for substance abusers , both adults and adolescents . Bennett , Cardone , and Jarcyzk ( 1997 ) conducted a study of 13 individuals involved in an integrative relapse prevention program that included a three day team building intervention.Controls participated in a similar relapse program which did not include thethree day AT intervention.Data immediately upon completion of the AT intervention suggested that the experimental groups scored significantly lower on measures of autonomic arousal , frequency of negative thoughts , and alcohol cravings.At ten month follow-up , there were no statistically significant differences in abstinence rates , although they report that the experimental groups rate of abstinence was higher ( 69% for the experimental group as compared to 42% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is no way to separate the effects of the AT part of the intervention from the other components.While perhaps one can infer that the AT program may have reduced stress levels immediately upon completion of the three day program , there can be no conclusions drawn due to the lack of control.In addition , importantly there were no long term significant difference between groups . <p> Interestingly , while there is no empirical data is available to support any claims of efficacy , it is illustrative of the widespread use and diversity of such programs to look at the results of a survey conduced by Gass and McPhee ( 1990 ) . In a survey of all recognized AT programs in the United States , of those that participated in the survey 61 programs were identified as working with substance abuse populations.Of those programs , 40% worked with adolescents . Single day experiences were used by 64% of the programs ( no information was provided as to adjunct treatment ) and 10% of the programs were over 15 days in length.70% of programs , however , were affiliated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of clients served per program was 50 individuals per year , and no information was available on variability of responses.If we take this as a valid number , that translates to these AT programs serving approximately 3000 clients per year.It is striking to consider the widespread use of such programs considering the lack of empirical data supporting such an intervention . <p> Other reports of AT efficacy with adults , albeit not empirical , can be found as well.Anecdotal reports exist advocating the use of adventure-based therapy with persons suffering from bulimia nervosa ( MacGuire &amp; Priest , 1994 ) and Borderline Personality Disorder ( Nurenberg , 1986 ) , antisocial offenders ( Reid &amp; Matthews , 1980 ) , as well as severe body image disturbance ( Arnold , 1994 ) . Similar reports have been written for the use of AT with victims of rape , sexual assault , and incest ( Asher , Huffaker , &amp; McNally , 1994 ; Levine , 1994 ) . These reports include specific considerations for using AT with these populations.However , no data is presented to support their claims of efficacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive benefits of adventure activities in a qualitative case study of a 37 year-old man with Dissociative Identity Disorder.The man was involved in concurrent inpatient psychiatric treatment and was monitored closely for signs of psychological distress throughout . Prior to the involvement in the adventure challenge group , this man had been described as being particularly withdrawn from other groups and social contacts , as well as experiencing frequent suicidal ideation and identity issues.Upon completion of the eight- week intervention , it was reported that this man increased in trust , leadership ability , and problem-solving , and decreased in social withdrawal.The authors report that the man attributed these changes primarily to the adventure challenge group . <p> While the utilization of the case study method allows for no generalization and no interpretation of the data presented , this opens the possibility that such an intervention may be useful as an adjunct treatment for other mentally i 'll patients.Importantly , however , the authors of this case study caution that such an intervention is not to be utilized with all psychiatric patients and that patents must be screened for suitability prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which they are involved in order to prevent psychological harm ( Whitman &amp; Preskenis , 1996 ) . Given the severity of DID , such results must be viewed with extreme caution and substantial further research is necessary in order to draw any conclusions about the usefulness of adventure-based interventions for this or any mentally i 'll population . <p> Of the literature reviewed here , only the studies by Kelley , Coursey , and Selby ( 1997 ) ; Banaka and Young ( 1985 ) ; and Herbert ( 1998 ) came close to approximating the methodological rigor necessary in order to draw solid conclusions based on the data.While still lacking in the controls necessary to make clear scientific inference , there appears to be enough evidence to suggest the possibility that such interventions may yield immediate positive results in the area of self-esteem , depression and anxiety , and trust , and also that gains in community-based coping skills may be maintained over time.Results with locus of control were mixed.However , further well-controlled research is necessary in order to verify and expand such claims and at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific data available to either accept or reject the null hypothesis . <p> Use of Adventure-Based Therapy with Adolescents <p> Along with adults , AT has been commonly used with adolescents and there are several studies which claim to have found positive results.The following section will focus first on general findings based on a review by Bandoroff ( 1989 ) . It will then focus on findings for adolescents with regards to recidivism , first in those studies that compare recidivism rates of adolescent juveniles who participate in an AT program with those of institutionalized juvenile delinquents and next for those that compare recidivism rates for delinquent AT participants with those on probation.This section will then review those studies with adolescents court-referred to an AT program.Finally , this section will review of those studies with adolescents focusing on self-concept change through AT participation , and end with a review of other studies that do not fit specifically in these categories . <p> General Findings <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) in an extensive but unpublished review of the literature with delinquent and pre-delinquent adolescents reported lower recidivism rates , more realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with an increase in an individuals sense of belonging.From this review , Bandoroff concludes , perhaps prematurely , that " It seems clear from this review of the literature that the field of adventure programming has succeeded in justifying itself as a viable therapeutic intervention for delinquent youth . " ( p. 55 ) . <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) breaks his review down specifically into design categories.In the first category of one group pre- and post-test designs and non-equivalent control group designs , Bandoroff reports significant improvement in self-esteem , social adjustment , and social attitudes , as well as other areas more specific to each outcome measure utilized.However once again the conclusions that can be drawn are limited by the lack of appropriate comparison groups and therefore will not be expanded upon.Of note , however , is that Bandoroff reports that some of these studies did employ follow-up procedures and this follow-up data suggested that perhaps some of these gains may be maintained over time.Such follow-up designs may be worthwhile to pursue in the future in order to determine whether or not any reported gains can in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control group designs.Interestingly , these studies found similar conclusions regarding increases in self-concept and related constructs , although Bandoroff ( 1989 ) notes that " these results are not as conclusive in their findings regarding self-perceptions as those studies previously discussed " ( p.31 ) . It is interesting to note that there is a suggestion here that as methodological rigor is increased , strength of findings are decreased , parallelingfindings of Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) . Bandoroff discusses further methodological difficulties in these studies such as lack of equivalency in sample sizes between the experimental and the control group and wait-list attrition when using wait-list controls . <p> Importantly , Bandoroff ( 1989 ) also cites a study in this category which found no differences in self-esteem between a group participating in an AT program and a control group that remained institutionalized , with both groups showing improvements.Not surprisingly , however , a six month follow-up interview reported those participating in the AT experience had more positive views of their experience than did those who remained institutionalized ( Birkenmayer &amp; Polonski , 1976 ; cited in Bandoroff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutionalization <p> The third category of studies reviewed by Bandoroff ( 1989 ) used recidivism rates as an objective outcome measure.These studies will be reviewed in detail.Kelley and Baer ( 1971 ) conducted a two year study of 120 adjudicated male adolescents between the ages of 15-17 matched on IQ , race , religion , offense , area of residence , and number of previous commitments . History of violent assault or sexually related offenses were exclusionary criteria.While randomly assigned to an experimental group or a control group , participation in the program was dependent on a stated willingness to participate if selected for the experimental group.No data are available on the numbers who chose non-participation and therefore we can make no inferences as to possible effects of selection bias . <p> Control subjects were treated in the standard manner , including institutionalization in juvenile facilities and parole.Experimental participants were referred to one of three Outward Bound programs involving heterogeneous groups of delinquents and non-delinquents . At one year follow-up , 20% of the experimental group had recidivated as compared to 42% of the controls . Of note is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reported to be 40% , directly in line with that of the controls . <p> Importantly , however , one of the Outward Bound schools had substantially higher recidivism rates than the other two schools . The authors note that this program had lower levels of physical challenge and excitement than did the other two , emphasizing endurance and personal challenge more.However , there are also many additional possibilities to explain such results related to program variables , instructor variables , or the interaction of participant characteristics with the program.This points to a potentially serious lack of standardization across programs.Kelley and Baer ( 1971 ) note that importantly , however , without this program included in the analysis , the results may have been even more striking as statistically this high number would have altered the mean effects of the other two programs . <p> One final noteworthy point is that those juveniles whose offenses occurred in the " stubborn-runaway " category were three times as likely to recidivate in both groups.When this group is removed from this analysis , differences in recidivism rates between the experimental and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speculate that these differences may relate more to the nature of home environment that the participants were released into ( i.e. , one can speculate that there may have been increased problems in the home environment that led to running away ) , and thatfollow-up programs should perhaps be specifically targeted to such individuals . <p> A five year follow-up by Kelley ( 1974 ; cited in Bandoroff , 1989 ) showed that after five years there were no more significant differences in recidivism , but that it appeared that the experimental group overall cost the state less money in treatment , spent less time in holding facilities , and committed less serious crimes , suggesting the possibility of increased treatment efficiency for the AT approach . <p> These studies show that it is likely that adventure programs may have some impact on recidivism , albeit short-term , although again we are unclear as to the mechanisms of that impact.It is also important to note that the programs did not appear to impact all participants in the area of recidivism.However , there is no data available on the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thus we can not be sure if any follow-up data simply reflect a subset of these individuals . <p> Willman and Chun ( 1973 ) replicated the results of Kelley and Baer ( 1971 ) , evaluating a program developed by the State of Massachusetts in response to Kelley and Baers ( 1971 ) results.Attempting to control for possible grouping effects related to Kelley and Baers ( 1971 ) use of heterogeneous groups , Willman and Chun used homogeneous groups of delinquent adolescents and tracked 300 boys for the one year period following completion of the program . <p> While finding similar recidivism rates similar to Kelley and Baer ( 1971 ) of 20.8% for the experimental group and 42.7 % for the control group , they also found that the experimental group remained uninvolved with the legal system for longer , noting that only 38% of the experimental group re-offended in the first six months as opposed to 72% of the control group.They also found that older participants and those who had completed a higher grade level in school had higher success rates . <p> Additional important findings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Chun ( 1973 ) are that variables such as age of first court appearance , presence of both parents in the home , age of first institutionalization , and type of offense were factors which were related to recidivism ( Bandoroff , 1989 ) . Therefore , these factors should be included in future studies as variables of interest.It was also noted that the adventure intervention appeared to be more effective for persons who committed a crime against person or property ( Bandoroff , 1989 ) . <p> Further information as to the environment the individuals were released into and treatment upon completion of the AT program is necessary in order to determine whether or not such recidivism data can in fact be attributable to the intervention . In addition , further information is necessary on the variability of such recidivism rates in order to make global claims as to effectiveness.It is possible that such an intervention may have been very effective for some and ineffective for others.If this is the case , then such effects may be hidden by looking at group averages.In such future studies it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program on individuals and determine whether there are individual variables related to program effects which impact such outcomes ( e.g. , change scores on specific outcome measures ) . <p> Adventure-based therapy vs. probation <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) reviews two other studies he views as employing true experimental designs.These studies compared adolescents involved in standard probation programs with those involved in an AT program.Employing similar designs as Kelley and Baer ( 1971 ) and Wilman and Chun ( 1974 ) , trends towards improvement were noted , but there were no significant differences between groups ( Boudette , 1989 ; Winterdyk , 1980 ; cited in Bandoroff , 1989 ) . Each included follow-up data as well.Therefore , Bandoroff ( 1989 ) states that neither of these studies were able to produce conclusive results as to the effectiveness of a wilderness intervention for delinquent youth , and it may be that there are minimal differences in recidivism found between participants in an AT program and a standard probation program.This premise needs further **25;975;TOOLONG , however , Boudette ( 1989 , cited in Bandoroff , 1989 ) discusses qualitative data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program ( i.e. , interviews with parents ) . <p> Unfortunately , each of these studies remains an unpublished doctoral dissertation , and thus the results have not been subjected to the same extensive peer review processes as are those studies published in well-established journals.Nonetheless , according to Bandoroff ( 1989 ) , these studies employed " excellent methodologies utilizing multi-modal and multi-method assessment with good convergent validity " ( p. 39 ) . <p> Castellano and Soderstrom ( 1992 ) also attempted to evaluate the impact of an adventure program on juvenile recidivism.Thirty- six adolescents participated in a standard wilderness program and a comparison group matched on gender , age , ethnicity , date of first court referral , and the offense class was selected from the country probation office.Analysis of the matching criteria indicated matches on all characteristics except for seriousness of offense , with program participants engaging in more serious offenses than their otherwise matched controls . <p> Results of this evaluation showed that there were no differences in overall first re-arrest rates between those that participated in the adventure program and those who did not.However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the program was significantly less as compared to controls.This is in contrast to the reported greater severity of crimes for this group prior to program participation.Any differences found , however , appear to be obscured after two years . <p> Multiple measures of recidivism were used in this study including overall recidivism , crime specific recidivism , arrest rates , and a frequency/seriousness index of recidivism.While analysis of these different categories for recidivism showed trends towards positive effects for program participation , there are no clear findings and the possibility remains that there were no effects on recidivism based on program participation . <p> One important difference in this study reported by Castellano and Soderstrom ( 1992 ) may relate to the county of referral for the participants.It is noted that the county is fairly affluent and a wide range of services are available to these adolescents . In fact , 77% of the participants were engaged in other services in the three-month period before and after the program.While concurrent services may often be a reality of those involved in the juvenile justice system , in this particular county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rehabilitative services that may not be available in less affluent counties.Such services may have significantly impacted the results.In addition , there may be other factors related to the SES level of the community that impact such results as well ( e.g. , educational and vocational opportunities ) , perhaps leading again to better outcomes for those who are in the probation program than may be found in other less well-off areas . <p> Minor and Elrod ( 1990 , 1992 , 1994 ) conducted several studies examining the effects of a three month intervention for juvenile probationers that included job preparation , outdoor experiential programming ( three days ) , and the practice of family skills.The program was not residential in nature.Experimental participants were compared to probation controls on self-concept , locus of control , and perceptions of juvenile justice , as well as recidivism at 18-month follow-up.Participants were classified by previous offense severity as being on " intensive probation or " moderate " probation . <p> Overall , finding indicated there were no significant differences between the experimental and the control groups on any of the dependent measures or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of the program or at 18- month follow-up.However , Minor and Elrod ( 1990 ) report that it appeared the program may have had some impact on recidivism , noting that " select probationers in the experimental-intensive and the experimental-moderate groups who displayed relatively lengthy criminal backgrounds before the intervention began had significantly fewer criminal offenses over the 18-month follow-up period " ( p. 101 ) . This suggests that such a program may differentially impact individual participants . <p> Given that it is impossible to examine independently the effects of the adventure component , it is recognized that this is not a scientifically valid finding . As such , further methodological analysis of the data will not be provided.Of note however , is that the program was non-residential in nature and the adventure component was only three days in duration.A different format with a longer period of participation in adventure activities may have led to somewhat different results . <p> Interestingly however , such a multifaceted intervention could perhaps led itself well to future investigation using component control or additive designs.Such an investigation need not be limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential benefits of using AT as an adjunct treatment , it would also allow for a potential examination of any synergistic effects that may exist when utilizing AT with another form of established intervention.Such an approach could also potentially circumvent ethical issues that may be involved in utilizing AT as a primary treatment when AT lacks empirical support by allowing for the provision of established treatment as well . <p> Court Referred Adolescents <p> Other studies have utilized adolescents court referred to an AT program as their sample.Sakofs ( 1991 ) examined the effects of a wilderness program on court-referred adolescents . After an extensive screening process , 115 adolescents between the ages of 14-17 were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group.The experimental program was a 24-day wilderness trek , which included a post-completion follow-up of two contacts per month for three months.The control group , also on probation , engaged in a half day ropes course experience.Data gathered included self-reports , collateral measures administered to parents , teachers , and counselors , school and court records , and qualitative analysis.The assessment measure showed significant positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientation , manifest aggression , values orientation , immaturity , withdrawal , social anxiety , repression , and peer relations.The results of the follow-up were unclear , and there were no difference on the behavioral measures between groups.Sakofs reported that the qualitative analysis revealed further improvements . <p> Unfortunately , this analysis also suffers from some of the same inadequacies.While employing a control group , there are no data available as to the equivalence of such a control group and there are far too many differences among the experiences of the experimental group and the controls to attribute any differences to the treatment alone.There is no further data available on the participants , nor is there any inclusion of program or therapist variables.There is also no reliability or validity data available for the measures employed and there is no detailed analysis of the results available.Thus , there is no basis for a reader to draw informed conclusions beyond those delineated by Sakoffs ( 1991 ) . Interestingly , it appears that this study may have had some potential for overcoming previously reported methodological inadequacies , however , this is unclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfect example of the problems in the AT literature of " not learning from others mistakes " ( Bandoroff , 1989 ) . <p> Wichmann ( 1991 ) conducted a somewhat more rigorous study.Seventy-two " at-risk " males and females between the ages of 13-18 participated in a 30 day wilderness program in groups numbering 8-11 . Of those participants , 90 % were court referred , thus there was a lack of standard random assignment as all court-referred participants were required to participate in the wilderness program.However , there was an opportunity for a control group offered by an " advocacy program " , which provided a surrogate " big brother or big sister " from the community to spend up to ten hours per week with participant while they waited for the one time per month admission to the program.This program component was designed as a " holding program for youth who would later participate in a wilderness program " ( p. 45 ) . <p> Mean age of participants was 14.9 years old , and the sample included 22 participants of both genders ( 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control and the experimental groups were similar.Experience of instructors ranged from 5-15 courses worked and there is no information available as to the clinical training of any such instructors . <p> Measures included the Means-End Problem Solving Procedure ( MEPS ) , a self-report standardized measure of interpersonal problem-solving ability , an instructor checklist of expectations for youth-at-risk , and an unpublished checklist of specific asocial behaviors.While unpublished , Wichmann ( 1991 ) did report limited reliabilityand validity data for this checklist . While a seemingly obvious necessity , this again is an improvement from some earlier studies.Unfortunately , this checklist was completed by the senior instructor of the course at pre and post-testing.Therefore , it is subject to strong experimenter bias . The checklist measures were given at pre-test and post-test , and the control group was assessed at a similar 25 -day interval.The MEPS , on the other hand , was only administered to participants one time on day ten of the intervention.It was unclear as to the rationale behind this discrepancy . <p> Using analysis of covariance ( ANCOVA ) to control for level of asocial behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed significantly lower levels of asocial behavior upon completion of the program than did the control group.The control group showed no changes and gender differences were not found.Regression analyses showed that post-treatment asocial behavior was predicted by pre-asocial behavior , interpersonal problem-solving , instructor experience , and instructor role expectations.This total model accounts for 61% of the variance in asocial behavior.The authors note that obviously they can not control for pre-course asocial behavior , but discuss how perhaps the other variables ( e.g. , interpersonal problem-solving , instructor experience , and instructor role expectations ) show promise for further well-controlled **25;1002;TOOLONG , there was no analysis of change scores as predictors , a potentially important individual difference variable , and there is no follow-up data available . <p> This study shows solid attempts at providing an equivalent control group for comparison.Although the measures used could be improved upon , specifically including more clinically relevant measures and measures with more clearly delineated psychometric properties , the experiment appears to have achieved some of the basic level control necessary to draw some limited **25;1029;TOOLONG , however , there is no program information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine whether or not there was any attempt made at standardization between groups.In addition , without such information there is no basis by which to determine if the program follows similar procedures as do other programs and thus there can be no basis for generalization . <p> A further methodological issue relates to the equivalency of the control group.Unfortunately , with the current design it is impossible to determine the effects of the advocacy program on controls.The relationship with the big brother " or " big sister " provided by the program may have had a systematic impact in the individuals in the control group.Moreover , this impact may have been widely variable across control group participants.Therefore , this severely limits conclusions that can be made on the comparisons . Additionally , echoing Bandoroff ( 1989 ) , we can not be sure as to whether or not change scores simply reflect participant states upon entering and completing the program , and not the effects of the intervention at all . <p> However , this study does employ more advanced statistical techniques and shows some promise for the technique of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make no determinations as to the long-term impact of such an intervention , the results of this study suggest that there may potentially be an immediate impact of such program . <p> Self-Concept <p> In another Outward Bound based study , Marsh , Richards , and Barnes ( 1986 ) examined changes and stability over time of self-concept for 361 participants ranging in age from 16-31 ( mean age= 21 ) participating in one of ten 26-day Outward Bound programs.Participants completed the Self-Description Questionnaire ( SDQ ; Shavelson , Hubner , &amp; Stanton , 1976 ) which measures 13 differing aspects of self-concept , and the Rotter Locus of Control scale ( LOC ; Rotter , 1966 ) . TheSDQ was completed at one month prior to beginning the course ( time 1 ) , at the beginning of the course ( time 2 ) and at completion of the program ( time 3 ) . The LOC was completed at time 2 and 3 . The authors report there was no control group provided due to the nature of course participation , and therefore they conceptualize their design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were small decreases in self-concept from time 1 to time 2 , and these are attributed by Marsh et al . ( 1986 ) to pre-course anxiety.This contradicts earlier findings by Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) that found no systematic effects for prior testing , There were significant increases in all facets of self-concept for time 2 to time 3 , as well as significant shifts towards internality on the LOC.Marsh et al ( 1997 ) report that the largest shifts in self-concept were found on the subscales predicted a priori to be theoretically associated with Outward Bound programs.This is discussed by the authors as providing support for the theoretical basis of such programs.Comparisons across different programs showed no significant differences in scores on dependent measures . <p> This study suffers , however , from the same lack of scientific control extensively delineated previously.Therefore , such flaws will not be reviewed in detail.Notably , the lack of a control group provides no basis for comparison and there is no detail provided as to program , participant , or instructor characteristics in order to evaluate standardization across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , while extensive analytic techniques were applied to the data , ANOVA models were used primarily in the analysis to examine change in pre-and post-test measures.Given the lack of a control group it may have been theoretically more useful to employ other techniques ( i.e. , regression models ) in the examination of the data.Simple analysis of change scores provides limited useful information without a comparison group . <p> Marsh et al . ( 1998 ) are , however , the first to attempt to provide validation at the theoretical level by using a priori predictions.In addition , their use of a multidimensional self-concept measure examines self-concept in a broader framework ; one that can perhaps be applied to future empirical research . Finally , they include an extensive and useful discussion of the possible effects of post-trip euphoria , and provide suggestions for future methodological considerations in this area.While not specifically relevant to the scientific interpretation of their results , such effects are important to consider in future studies . <p> Hazelworth and Wilson ( 1990 ) found positive effects on adolescent self-concept , which they report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee Self-Concept Scale ( TSCS : Fitts , 1964 ) . However , the severity of the methodological inadequacies in the study , including the lack of a control group , the confounding effects of a general summer camp experience on the adventure component , and a six-day pre-post evaluation period render this study scientifically useless.In order to avoid redundancy further discussion will not be provided . <p> Others <p> Davis-Berman and Berman ( 1992 ) conducted a two-year follow-up study to evaluate stability over time of reported therapeutic gains from a previous study . Originally , Davis-Berman and Berman ( 1989 , cited in Davis-Berman &amp; Berman , 1992 ) conducted a study of 23 adolescents involved in outpatient psychotherapy who participated in a two- week therapeutically-focused backpacking trip.During this trip , individual and group psychotherapy were provided on a daily basis by a participating psychologist and individualized treatment plans were followed.Measures of the dependent variable included pre- and post-test measures of self-esteem , self-efficacy , locus of control , and behavioral symptoms.Reported findings included significant change in the area of self-esteem , self-efficacy , and behavioral symptomatology.No further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original 23 participants were contacted by mail at four months , one-year , and two- years follow-up.Standardized measures utilized in the follow-up included the Behavioral SymptomsInventory ( BSI , Derogatis , 1975 ) , the General Self-Efficacy Inventory ( Sherer , Maddux , Mercandante , Prentice-Dunn , Jacobs , &amp; Rogers , 1982 ) , and the Locus of Control Scale ( LOC : Rotter , 1966 ) . In addition , participants were asked to complete a qualitative questionnaire asking about current life situation and any impact of the backpacking experience.Response rates were 83% at four months and 65% at two years.Thus , the sample size was quite small and inferential statistics were not conducted . <p> Descriptive statistics showed expected positive results on these measures at post-test.Interestingly , findings show that negative symptoms on all measures returned somewhat at four month follow-up , but had again dissipated at one year , stabilizing and maintaining after two years ( albeit not to post-test levels ) . In addition , the qualitative questionnaire revealed that participants felt the trip was a significant life-changing experience . <p> Davis-Berman and Berman ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have resulted in a return of negative symptoms.However , they relate the one and two year follow-up to clinically significant change , noting that " over time , changes may become more meaningful and long-lived " ( p. 4 ) . They also discuss how this data highlights the importance of follow-up to help facilitate transfer of changes based on the AT experience to daily life , as such changes are often found to decrease upon completion of this program . <p> Given the lack of a control group , the small sample size , and the lack of statistical analysis , this study can perhaps be viewed best as a case study.Therefore , any postulated results are not scientifically generalizable and Davis-Berman and Berman ( 1992 ) note that they recommend their study be used to stimulate further exploration of possible trends in this direction . Maturation effects , particularly among adolescents over two years , may have accounted for any reported changes.Aside from this , this group may have had a unique experience based on any number of factors , both during the intervention and after.Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects may also have significantly altered the results , as those adolescents who participating in the program were also involved in treatment with the participating psychologist prior to participating in the adventure experience . Thus , the effects of concurrent treatment can not be ruled out . <p> While , as noted above in the theoretical discussion of AT , such a model may have clinical utility , it does not lend itself well to scientific conclusion.However , similar to the multifaceted program evaluated by Minor and Elrod ( 1990 , 1994 ) , such a program could be used in the future to component control or additive designs . <p> One final study by Witman ( 1987 ) also appeared to add some relevant insight to the literature related to adolescent adventure activities and cooperation and trust.Witman compared 15-19 year-old adolescents in a psychiatric hospital who were involved in a social recreation group , an adventure-based therapy group , or a control group.The control group participated in the regularly scheduled program.The social recreation group and the adventure group each received five additional hours of programming , but the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group participated in team initiatives and games , trust building exercises , and low ropes course participation.The leaders for both activity groups were the same and were familiar to both groups prior to the intervention . Sample sizes unfortunately were small , with five controls and six in each treatment condition.Participants completed a cooperation and trust scale ( CATS ) , measuring both attitudes and behaviors in these domains , and their counselors completed a behavior rating scale focused on trust and cooperation.Minimal data were available for the reliability and validity of these scales.These measures were completed pre and post-test for all groups . <p> Results showed that the adventure group scored significantly higher than both the control group and the social recreation group on measures of cooperation and trust , both self-report and counselor report.There was no follow-up . <p> This study suffers from small sample size and inadequate instrumentation , however it is the first that compared an adventure group to a basic recreation group.As such , it is the first of its kind that attempted to control for effects due to novelty or simply any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences in participant variables and therapist effects , it attempts to examine factors previously overlooked.As such , it suggests that there may perhaps be differences between AT activities and other activities in a similar setting.It may be worthwhile to include such recreational groups in future design considerations <p> Once again , this review of the adolescent literature provides us with minimal basis for interpretation of the AT data due to divergent findings and a lack of methodological control.While it may be that there is some immediate impact of such programs , it is still unclear as to whether such gains are maintained over time.While the recidivism data presented may be the most interesting data suggesting that there may be an impact of AT programs beyond the immediate post-program testing period , it is clearly mixed with only two studies findings results.Furthermore , there is also the suggestion found in the literature that AT program may not facilitate lower recidivism rates than does standard probation . In addition , all the studies contain similar methodological flaws.Therefore , there may be other unexamined factors impacting these results and again these studies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions . <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) discusses problems with inconsistency in the research , noting that researchers continue to make the same design errors repeatedly.Instead of " learning from each others mistakes " ( p 46 ) , he discusses how few researchers attempt to improve on what has been done before , instead often " performing yet another study , each with the purpose of being the definitive study " ( p.46 ) . He also discusses problems with standardization and replication , and discusses the difficulties associated with conducting research in a field that is still developing and lacking in a clear theoretical base . <p> Another important point of critique is the lack of clinically validated and clinically relevant measures in these studies.There appears to be no studies using any measures of diagnosable pathology or any measures commonly utilized in clinical studies.Using more appropriate instrumentation , as well as measures that can be linked more clearly to the process and outcome psychotherapy literature , may help to provide some beginning insight into what differentiates the mechanism of change in AT as compared to other treatments.In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where eventual comparisons with other established treatments can occur . <p> Given the methodological inadequacies overall and the lack of well-controlled studies , any conclusions in this area are preliminary and further research is necessary to build on these ideas.It is interesting to note again the wide diversity in programs studied.This makes meaningful comparisons between such programs impossible and thus there is no generalizability.Without standardization across programs and increased control over the experimental conditions , the only conclusions we may ever be able to draw are thatsome programs may have some immediate impact and some specific programs also may impact recidivism . Specifically regarding such adjudicated adolescents , Bandoroff ( 1989 ) asserts that " the field can no longer responsibly assume that any adventure program is good for all delinquents. " ( p.56 ) . Although this seems to contradict his earlier statement supporting of the overall effectiveness of AT with adolescents , it lends support to the idea that any of the results we may find are also limited to the specific program being evaluated and do not generalize to other programs.Unfortunately , this may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Client Characteristics in Adventure-Based Therapy <p> The following section will examine the importance of research into the effects of client characteristics on AT , and then focus specifically on existing research into such characteristics as they relate to outcome in AT . <p> The Need for Client Characteristics Research in Adventure-Based Therapy <p> Client characteristics and how they relate to outcome is an important topic in the area of psychotherapy research , and findings in the psychotherapy literature may be applicable to AT as well.Studies suggest that clients who are resistant or reactant may receive less benefit from standard cognitive-behavioral or behavioral treatments and may benefit more from nondirective therapy ( Beutler , Engle , Mohr , Daldrup , Bergan , Meredith , &amp; Merry , 1991 ; Shoham , Bootzin , Rohrbaugh , &amp; Urry , 1995 ) , Generally , this shows that indeed different types of therapy may be more beneficial for some types of clients than others.More specifically , it can be speculated that a less directive treatment such as AT may be beneficial for just such resistant clients.As noted , however , this is purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a contention.Indeed , one might question whether the structure provided by the AT experience might be perceived as directive by some clients.Process research in AT is necessary to explore such a possibility . <p> Other relevant psychotherapy studies have shown that hostile clients have increased difficulties in establishing an alliance with a therapist ( Arnkoff , Vicotr , &amp; Glass , 1993 ) . In addition such clients have been found to be less successful in psychodynamic and cognitive-behavioral treatments than other clients ( Horowitz , Rosenberg , &amp; Bartholomew , 1993 , cited in Castonguay &amp; Schut , 2000 ) . <p> Given these findings it is interesting to speculate that there may be individual differences in participants which may have an impact on outcome of the AT treatment for specific individuals . In addition , given the lack of a complete and accepted theoretical base in AT , it may be extremely difficult to establish sound outcome studies in this area without first attempting some additional study into the effect of such basic variables as individual differences in participants and how these may interact with the intervention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome ) . Therefore , one way of starting a preliminary look at process is by examining whether or not client characteristics have any impact on how specific people respond to the treatment , moving out of the realm of process and into the realm of client characteristics which may impact outcome.Stated another way , does adventure-based therapy affect some people differently than for others ? <p> Focusing on individual differences may also be a way to potentially minimize some of the variance between experimental and control groups.For instance , if one was able to design a well-controlled experiment in AT , it may be important to know whether certain participant variables may effect whether or not a person is impacted by the treatment.If an experimenter were to have some idea as to what these factors might be , utilizing such factors as selection criteria would perhaps aid in the establishment of more appropriately selected and tightly controlled experimental groups.With greater care paid to selection , perhaps there may be more of clear distinction in results <p> Neill and Richards ( 1998 ) suggest this as well , noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be related to the nature of the individuals involved in such programs . Ewert ( 1989 ) also echoes this idea , discussing the fact that he prefers a change model for adventure-based therapy that includes a consideration of predisposing factors , a model including such variables as personality , propensity for risk-taking , beliefs , and intentions . <p> It is certainly possible that different types of individuals respond in a more positive way to adventure-based programs.It may follow then that if others respond much less positively , the combination of these two groups statistically may result in a moderate effect size ( i.e. , mean group differences may be eliminated or obscured ) . Simplistically put , adventure-based therapy may work for some participants very well and not work at all for others.McLean and Anderson ( 1998 ) echo this statement in a consideration of ESTs for depression , noting that " It has been argued that the modest effect sizes in psychotherapy research are diluted due to mismatches between clients and treatments . " ( p. 126 ) . It follows then that prior to focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin asking the question of " For whom is adventure-based therapy most effective ? " <p> As mentioned much earlier , a simple recognition of the fact that this treatment is increasing in use may justify such an individual difference-based line of questioning prior to the provision of solid empirical support of efficacy.To explain further , if in fact client characteristics may be impacting outcome , regardless of overall proven treatment effectiveness , this could therefore be important information to bring to bear on those programs which currently use AT as a treatment.This is not to imply that efficacy studies are unnecessary , rather this statement is provided to highlight the need for such research.The remainder of this section will focus on the discussion of those studies which have examined client characteristics in AT . <p> Existing Individual Differences Research in Adventure-Based Therapy <p> Drebing , Willis , and Genet ( 1987 ) conducted a study in which they attempted to examine the role of anxiety in impacting the effects of an Outward Bound program ( note-while Outward Bound programs have established the model upon which many AT programs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapeutic goals and thus do not expressly utilize therapeutic techniques beyond the adventure activities and debriefing ) . As noted earlier in the theoretical discussion of AT , anxiety has long been considered an important part of the experiential and therapeutic learning process , both through the element of perceived risk and personal disequlibrium or dissonance.The important question of interest in this study is of how much anxiety is beneficial . <p> Drebing , et al . ( 1987 ) note the curvilinear relationship of learning and anxiety ; that learning is best facilitated when anxiety is at a moderate level while high levels of anxiety can negatively impact a persons ability to learn effectively and low anxiety can impact a persons motivation.Thus , they hypothesized that those participants with a moderate anxiety level would be most impacted by their experience and that this moderate level of anxiety would lead to optimal learning.They also hypothesized that one of the mechanisms by which this increased learning would occur was an enhanced relationship with the leaders and postulated that those with a moderate level of anxiety would be impelled to seek such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be less likely to establish such relationships . <p> Thirty-nine incoming freshman students ( 27 males and 13 females ) were enrolled in a three- week Outward Bound course.Activities for the course included backpacking , rock climbing , rappelling , and a solo three-day expedition.Participants were administered the State-trait anxiety inventory ( STAI ) . While the authors note that there is reliability and validity data available , such data is not presented.Trait anxiety was believed to be the more relevant of the two in impacting outcome , as the authors felt that this would more accurately reflect an overall propensity towards being anxious instead of situation-based anxiety.Students were rated as low , medium , or high anxiety based on their scores to the STAI . <p> Upon completion of the course , the students were administered a questionnaire rating their satisfaction with the course , perceived " stressfullness " of the course , perceived level of learning from the course , and their relationships with the leader.In addition , students were asked about previous experience with the activities of the course ( e.g. , rock climbing ) . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor is there any further information provided as to program variables or participant variables.Group leaders also ranked students on performance , level of learning , and the relationship they felt they had established with the student . <p> The moderate anxiety group showed the highest levels of learning ( understanding the meaning of their experience ) during the trip , but two days post-completion these differences were no longer significant . Thus the hypothesis that moderate levels of anxiety would lead to the highest levels of learning was generally not supported by students self-reports of perceived learning.Drebring et al . ( 1987 ) note that substantial debriefing and reflection occurred during this two- day period . It may be that this debriefing period facilitated additional understanding for those participants in the high and low anxious group.This could have implications for further exploration into the impact of such time spent processing after an activity.Importantly , Drebing et al.s ( 1987 ) use of an ANOVA model as opposed to a regression model reduced their statistical power , thereby increasing the likelihood of Type II error . <p> Interestingly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships with those students of moderate anxiety , but the student ratings showed that as anxiety increased so did their ratings of their relationships with the leader.For these students it appeared that anxiety and leader relationships had a more direct linear relationship.Finally , those students with previous experience were significantly less anxious than those with little or no prior experience , a potential moderator of the AT experience to consider inthe future . <p> It appears from this examination that while the hypotheses of Drebing et al . ( 1987 ) were not clearly supported , there were some differences on the outcome measures studied based on differences in anxiety level.If anxiety is an integral part of the theoretical basis of AT , then this may have implications for individuals who participate in such programs.This finding regarding the participants relationships with the leaders is of note , and further examination is necessary in order to examine factors impacting such important relationships which may be important vehicles for change.However , the leaders themselves completed the rating forms , and thus there is the potential for bias.Results such as these may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those students of moderate anxiety.One way to circumvent this bias in the future would be to have an objective observer rate these relationships and compare them to the leaders and the students ratings . <p> While there are no definitive conclusions coming for this study about anxiety as a moderator on the effects of adventure experiences , it is a step towards examining the impact of client characteristics on outcome in AT and indicates that such further explanation may prove fruitful.Designing a well-controlled experiment with a multidimensional assessment of anxiety levels and additional assessment throughout the intervention to determine if perhaps fluctuations in anxiety levels may have further impacted these variables may yield interesting results.In addition , using a regression model of statistical analysis to examine the effects of anxiety on outcome as opposed to an analysis of variance model would also have improved the statistical power of the study , thus increasing the likelihood of finding existing effects . <p> Such a further assessment of the impact of anxiety is important in order to determine if there is potentially an anxiety threshold beyond which such an intervention may in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relevant in making such determinations.Of note also is that this study was done on a normal population and any results found with such a population may not be generalizable to populations with diagnosable levels of pathology or significant dysfunction.Once again the caution must be raised , that without such an examination there may be undiscovered potential for harm with such clients.Further research is necessary into the role of anxiety in AT before such ideas can be fully explored however . <p> Fry and Heubeck ( 1998 ) conducted a study looking at the relationship of personality variables and mood states during an Outward Bound course.Participants completed the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire ( EPQ , Eysenck &amp; Eysenck , 1975 ; cited in Fry &amp; Heubeck , 1998 ) and were split into high and low groups on the extraversion and neuroticism dimensions.Of note is that fact that a median split was used to determine these groups and therefore there may be less clear distinctions between groups than could have been found if another method were usedIn addition to the EPQ , participants completed the Trait and State version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clark , and Tellegen , 1988 ; cited in Fry &amp; Hubeck , 1998 ) in order to assess for level of positive and negative affect.The Trait version was used prior to the course and the State version was used during the course <p> Participants had signed up for a standard Outward Bound course and ranged in age from 16-35 with a mean age of 20.7Means and standard deviations were reported on all scores , and it was noted that the overall sample mean for extraversion was higher than normative means , while the overall sample mean for neuroticism was lower.This may reflect a difference in the overall population of self-selected Outward Bound participants.Such a sample may well be a unique subset of the population , and surprisingly this is the first reported data that suggests such a difference.This difference may well have impacted the results of this study , as well as the results of additional studies with self-selected individuals engaged in programs of this type . <p> In order to control for emotionality related to pre-trip tensions , the pre-test ESQ and PANAS measures were given one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given after the first segment of the trip ( day 13 ) , on day two and three of the solo expedition ( days 16 and 17 ) , and just prior to the completion of the expedition on day 24 . Given that the goal of this study was not to study outcome , there was no follow-up.These measures were used to test for levels of positive ( PA ) and negative ( NA ) affect . <p> The programs effects on mood throughout were significantly different for introverts and extroverts , with extroverts reporting a higher level of positive affect overall.Interestingly , however , introverts did not conversely report a higher level of negative affect.As might be expected , differences in state PA were found at different points in the course for both introverts and extroverts , with the lowest level of state PA found during the solo experience.This is to be expected given that the primary goal at this time is solitary introspection and reflection . <p> Fry and Heubeck ( 1998 ) note that overall levels of state NA were lower during the course than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a greater change from pre-trip level of NA for those participants in the neurotic condition , with the neurotic groups showing the greatest change from pre-test NA at each time of measurement.While again we have no basis of generalization to a clinical population , this indicates that there may be greater effects for individuals who are more neurotic.If further exploration revealed support for this supposition , this may ultimately have implications for the use AT with other than normal populations . As of yet , however , this is purely speculative in nature and may simply indicate that neurotics have more negativeaffect at the beginning of the course and would return to this negative state upon completion . <p> This study makes solid attempts to improve on the methodological inadequacies that have come before it and also add a unique contribution to the literature.Fry and Heubeck ( 1998 ) used appropriate statistical analyses in order to answer their questions , and included enough detail in their reporting of the data in order to allow for the reader to make evaluations of the data and not simply rely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month prior to the program may have helped to minimize any effects of pre-trip anxiety on the testing.In addition , they used well-known measures with established psychometric properties.They also followed a theoretical rationale , both in choosing the measures that they did and in the stating of their hypotheses.It remains to be seen , however , what may be the implications of their findings.Finally , one of the biggest improvements was the simple fact that this study was published in a reputable journal.While this is said somewhat tongue in cheek , it does echo the reality of the AT literature . However , using other than a median split to determine their groups may have been a more valid grouping if the construct of interest is based on high and low levels . <p> In another study , Neill and Heubeck ( 1998 ) examined the effect of an individuals coping style in an adventure experience , hypothesizing that this style may perhaps be a mediate of the effect.Participants were Australian 14-15 year old male and female students who attended a nine- day Outward Bound course.Participants were required to attend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this particular study there was no selection bias present.The Adolescent Coping Scale ( ACS ; Frydenberg , 1989 ; cited in Neill and Heubeck , 1998 ) was used to assess different coping strategies used by individuals.There is no reliability and validity data reported for this measure . <p> Adolescents in the program reported using productive coping strategies more than the normative data for the instrument indicates is standard for persons of that age.This would be consistent with the theory of adventure programs ; that individuals will be moved outside of their comfort zone and have to rely on more productive coping strategies to negotiate the activities successfully.It is important to note , however that the outdoor setting restricted such commonly accessible coping activities as drug use , intimate relationships and friendships and traditional sports.Therefore , they may have chosen to use such coping strategies by default . <p> Neill and Heubeck ( 1998 ) also found that students who reported using more typically non-productive coping skills ( i.e. , " self-blame " , " worrying " , " ignoring the problem " ) , received less psychological benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using more positive coping mechanisms ( i.e. , " positive focus " , " active problem-solving " , " working hard " ) ( p.12 ) . Frustratingly , however , there is no mention of the instrument used to determine " psychological benefit " and therefore there can be no conclusions about such benefits based on this study.What is suggested , however , is that further research into coping styles , both in the use of alternative coping styles when involved in the program and how these can interact with the program to influence outcome may be necessary.Although we have no data to support whether or not the use of such positive coping styles existed prior to involvement in the program , nor whether they diminished upon completion of the program , there is evidence presented in previous studies that suggests that program gains may diminish over time.This suggests that if indeed individuals involved in such a program are utilizing more positive coping mechanisms , future programs should incorporate a follow-up element designed to facilitate and support the continued use of those positive coping styles.This is speculative , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation for such statements . <p> Generalizability of this study , however , is clearly limited.The sample is from Australia and there may be cultural differences in attitudes towards such activities between Australia and the US.The simple fact that such a program is part of a required academic curriculum points towards the fact that there may be differences in such attitudes.Students know that they will be faced with such a component and therefore may be psychologically prepared in a different manner than are US students.In addition , the program is only nine days in length as opposed to the standard three week length that most program that have been examined employ.Therefore , we can not make adequate comparisons across groups as the activity sequences are of necessity different . <p> It may also be that adding this additional two weeks onto the program may have led to differences seen in the patterns of coping.Nine days is a short enough time for individuals to remain on their best behavior and there may not have been enough opportunity for the students to reach the desired state of disequlibrium.Also , as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to differences in performance or in accuracy of self-report as the students may have felt they were being evaluated.Finally , as is noted for all programs that are not expressly therapeutic in nature , any results can not necessarily be generalized to program that do employ adhere to therapeutic goals . <p> Other studies discussed in the previous review also examined client characteristic variables.To highlight , the study conducted by Wichman ( 1991 ) discussed previously found that individual differences of clients in interpersonal problem solving behavior , as well as other variables more specifically related to process ( e.g. , instructor experience predicted 7% of the variance , instructor expectations also predicted 7% ) had some impact on asocial behavior of participants upon completion of an adventure program.Of note in this however is that pre-asocial behavior accounted for the majority of the measured variance ( 64% ) and there was still quite a bit of variance unaccounted for by the measures variables , indicating a large amount of error or overlooked factors impacting those results . <p> Kelley and Baer(1971) and Willman and Chun ( 1974 ) also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first court appearance , number of parents in the home , age of first institutionalization , and type of offense had an impact on recidivism.The specific impact is unclear from their results.It was also unclear whether they looked at these effects across controls and program participants or whether they examined the interaction of program type and these variables.Such examination may lead to potential insight into how persons with different backgrounds may react differently to such a program . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1998 ) also found differing results based on client characteristics such as age of participant and country of origin.In addition , they examined the process variable of program length and found that longer programs had greater effects than shorter programs.Although there were methodological issues with their meta-analysis , this does provide us again with fuel for future explorations . <p> Generally , the limited research reviewed here that examines any effects on outcome of individual differences shows some very preliminary results , results upon which we can make no solid conclusions other than that further research is necessary in order to examine the possibilities suggested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall we may not be able to conclude that anxiety is a specific moderator of experience , it may potentially impact participant relationships with the leaders.This could have implications for therapeutic programs where such a relationship may be a key factor in facilitating therapeutic change.We can also see from this review of the client characteristics research that perhaps there may be differences between Outward Bound participants and the general population in the area of extraversion and neuroticism.This leads to distinct cautions in generalizing any data from such programs , where self-selection is an inherent part of the process , to the general population who may not be interested in such activities.Interestingly , however , there is some suggestion that it is worthwhile to look at these client characteristics more closely as it is suggested thatpersons with high levels of neuroticism may report greater changes on those variables studied . <p> We have also seen that outside variables more related to the external environment , such as number of parents in the home , age of first institutionalization , etc. may also impact overall outcome ( i.e. , recidivism ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderating factor of the success of different types of programs for different individuals . As has been noted , however , these conclusions are preliminary and unsubstantiated.Further research is necessary to make any solid conclusions about any individual difference variables and how they relate to AT outcome . <p> Summary of Adult and Adolescent Outcome Research <p> To review the adult and adolescent outcome research , it appears that based on the quality of the studies examined that the meta-analytic reviews were inconclusive , although if further information was provided as to the quality of studies in Hattie et als ( 1997 ) review there may be further insight gained.The only conclusions that can be drawn at this pointare that participant and program characteristics may be a relevant area for further studies and employing designs with follow-up may also yield important information . <p> Overall , it is suggested that there may be an immediate effect from program participation on self-esteem , depression , anxiety , and trust , while there is contradictory evidence of changes in locus of control.There is also the possibility that participation in an AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community for the chronically mentally ill.What can not be said is what the impact of the program of an AT program may be for an individual upon leaving the program or how long such effects may last . <p> The recidivism data yielded mixed results , and thus we can draw no conclusions from these studies.What is suggested is that there may be a difference in recidivism between those adolescents who are institutionalized as compared to those who participate in an adventure program , but there may be no differences between adventure program participants and persons who are on standard probation.Future research is necessary into this important question.Future designs in this area should attempt to incorporate information as to the environment individuals are released into and the services provided to such individuals upon release in order to assess for the impact of such additional treatments.Without such information we can not be sure to what degree any amount of change seen can be attributed to the treatment . <p> Given the overall lack of controlled research in the AT area , as well as the lack of standardization across treatments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made from the review of the literature is that any conclusions that can be drawn are based only on the characteristics of the program where the study was conducted and therefore the results can not be generalized beyond the particular setting.Unfortunately , overall this leaves us with a body of research with very limited validity , if any , and no generalizability . <p> Chapter 5 <p> METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN ADVENTURE-BASED THERAPY <p> This chapter will first focus on a discussion of the methodological considerations in the existing AT research , and compare the existing research to the standards for EST designation.The second section of this chapter will focus on methodological considerations for future studies , ending with a call for further individual difference based research.Finally , this chapter will end with a conclusion . <p> Present Methodological Considerations <p> As has been shown , the existing AT research employs a wide range of methodologies along with a clear lack of scientific rigor.Thus , as previously stated , the conclusions and insights which may be gained are seriously limited . The vast majority of studies suffer from severe methodological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation of adventure-based therapy.Unfortunately , even the few that attempted to employ an appropriate level of control were still subject to bias , primarily selection bias and bias introduced by the utilization of participant-observers.In addition , several of the studies remain unpublished and thus are not subjected to a peer review process . <p> Gillis ( 1992 ) discusses common methodological errors found in the adventure-based therapy research , errors occurring at the most basic level of research design.Such fundamental design considerations as equivalent control groups , randomization , psychometrically sound outcome measures , clearly defined methodologies , appropriate statistical procedures , and follow-up are often overlooked.He also notes that many studies utilize quasi-experimental designs and thus the results have limited generalizability . In addition , both settings and treatment methods are diverse , and this also limits the generalizability of results ( Kelley , 1993 ) . Unfortunately , as noted earlier in this analysis there is no clear method of conducting adventure-based therapy ( Gillis , 1992 ) and it seems this confusion is potentially reflected in the research . <p> Additional overall critiques leveled by Bandoroff(1989) include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must volunteer for such an experience.In addition , he urges researchers to consider the need for well-thought out and related variables and measures of interest.Indeed , when reviewing the literature it seems clear that there are numerous studies utilizing self-esteem and locus of control , but very few utilizing measures of demonstrated clinical utility.Relatedly , Bandoroff also discusses the need for multi-level assessment and suggests moving away from self-report and more into the realm of objective and behavioral outcome measures . <p> Problems associated with the utilization of pre-testing upon arrival at a program are also discussed by Bandoroff ( 1989 ) , and he notes that upon arrival many participants are angry and resentful , thus perhaps contributing to lower scores on such measures and inflating the change scores.Such reports may not be representative in an AT program.In addition , administering post-test measures immediately upon graduation from a program may reflect an inflated sense of accomplishment , a type of " treatment high " that may not reflect the realities of change . <p> Bandoroff(1989) also notes that there is a serious lack of process research ( e.g. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variables ) , and that this may have contributed to the lack of a developed theory of change in the field.He also discusses the difficulties involved in conducting controlled research in the field and notes how such fluctuating factors as weather conditions and group dynamics may cause even further difficulties . <p> Herbert ( 1998 ) discusses the additional impact of self-selection , noting that self-selection bias may greatly impact results.In referring to the study he conducted looking at the effects of an adventure program for disabled persons in maintaining supported employment , Herbert notes that there may be important differences between those who did participate and those who chose not to participate.He concludes that the results may not be generalizable to persons who did not participate , noting that " To what extent results from this study generalize to individuals who do not desire to participate in adventure activities is not known.Subsequent research may investigate attitudinal , motivational , and/or perceptual differences between persons who participate from those who do not participate in adventure programs . " ( p. 17 ) . This contention lends support to the assertion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adventure-based programs . <p> Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) discuss the difficulties involved with reviewing the research in a field as broad as adventure-based therapy , citing problems in the following areas:1 ) language : numerous terms have been used to define what has been commonly referred to as adventure-based therapy , 2 ) variability:the process of conducting research in a field this diverse is tremendously difficult , 3 ) clinical significance : the issues with regard to moving a client away from a position of pathology to one of health , and 4 ) clarity:the field needs to be more clear with what exactly is the process of adventure-based therapy.Of note is that many of these concerns parallel those in the psychotherapy outcome literature . <p> This brings us back to the identified criteria necessary to merit classification as an empirically supported treatment ( Chambless &amp; Hollon , 1998 ) . Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) summarize this process , noting that " we use as our starting point in the discussion of ESTs the position that treatment efficacy must be demonstrated in controlled research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the effects of the treatment and not to chance or confounding factors such as the passage of time , the effects of psychological assessment , or the presence of different types of clients in the various treatment conditions . " ( p. 7 ) . <p> It can be seen from the above review that AT does not meet such a criteria.Well-controlled research is virtually non-existent in the field of AT and without such controls confounding factors can not be ruled out . In re-examining the EST criteria listed in the beginning of the efficacy section of this paper , one can see that AT does not meet any of the stated criteria.While it would be repetitive to review all of the ways in which AT does not meet such criteria , it may be informative to compare the AT research to several of the key points embedded in these requirements . <p> The first most basic design consideration is random assignment , and as has been seen , many of the AT studies do not employ this basic design necessity and often they do not employ appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across programs and more tightly controlled samples , such replication may be impossible to achieve . <p> Other considerations put forth by Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) are based on sample characteristics and measurement considerations.They note that it is essential that samples be clearly defined in order to achieve tighter control.Unfortunately , there is no data available on AT with specific diagnostic groups , and in fact often studies do not report such basic information as sample means and standard deviations on fundamental characteristics such as ageIt is important that the research in this area begin assessing pre-participation levels of pathology and other relevant characteristics and make more specific designations of sample characteristics in order to being answering the relevant question of what client is this type of treatment effective for .. <p> Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) also caution that researchers must consider the negative aspects of treatment.It is an important part of scientific inquiry that research must be approached from a disconfirmatory stance.In all of the studies reviewed , there was no suggestion of negative impact of treatments , and this subject is rarely broached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential negative effects of AT , it remains a distinct possibility that such a treatment has the potential for psychological harm . <p> Finally , Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) discuss the idea of cost-effectiveness , noting that if there are no differences in outcome , treatments that cost the least are likely to be preferred.As of this writing , there is no published data available on cost-effectiveness for AT as compared to other treatments . <p> Accordingly , AT is nowhere near reaching an EST designation and without concerted and well-controlled efforts in this area , adventure-based therapy is likely to never reach such status.In this era of managed care , and in the growing context of the movement towards empirical validation of specific treatments for specific disorders , AT as a treatment modality may be shortly extinct except perhaps as a novel treatment modality for those who can afford to pay directly . <p> Paralleling this lack of EST designation is the contention that psychotherapists have an ethical responsibility to use treatments that work.While there is plenty of anecdotal evidence in support of AT , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , therapists using such adventure-based treatments could ultimately be held accountable in presenting a justification for their continued use of such an unproven treatment modality.Realistically , such a time may not be far off.Chambless and Hollon ( 1998 ) , in speaking generally of the need for controlled clinical trials of specific forms of treatment , caution that " the time is rapidly approaching when unsystematic clinical impressions will no longer suffice to document a treatments value , particularly when alternative treatments such as the pharmacotherapies exist that have been subjected to more rigorous empirical scrutiny . " ( p. 16 ) . <p> It is important , therefore , to consider whether AT may ever show potential for ever establishing proven successful outcomes . Simplistically put , is AT simply a unique entity and perhaps a passing trend ? An examination of potential commonalties between AT and other ESTsmay provide further information to inform such a consideration . <p> McLean and Anderson ( 1998 ) describe several features common to cognitive ( CT ) , behavioral ( BT ) , and interpersonal ( IPT ) treatments , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depression.It is encouraging to consider that AT may potentially contain some of these same features.McLean and Anderson ( 1998 ) discuss the commonalties of CT , IPT , and BT treatments being as follows:The treatment is collaborative , the focus is almost exclusively on present and future , the therapist is active and not passive , there is a high level of treatment structure , there is a development of personal competencies , use of detailed treatment protocols , ongoing empirical assessment , homework assignments used to help facilitate generalization of treatment gains to more naturalist settings , and time limited treatment . <p> Referring back to the earlier theoretical description of AT , it can be seen that AT shares many of these same features.It can be speculated that , based on these similarities , there is the possibility for AT to eventually be proven as efficacious.To illustrate , in AT the therapist and the client collaborate very much as a team and the focus is primarily on problems that are occurring in the moment , with metaphors used to link these problems to problems which the individuals experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning and the transfer of such learning , and there is a high level of structure in the activities , yet the client has responsibility for outcome.The development of personal competencies is clearly emphasized in AT and the treatment is typically time-limited . While AT clearly falls short in the area of treatment protocols , and ongoing rigorous empirical , these areas are related to questions of methodology as opposed to the potential for therapeutic efficacy . However , it is also important to highlight again that the structure in AT may be perceived as directive by some , a perception which may result in decreased effectiveness for resistant clients ( Beutler et al. , 1991 ; Shoham , Bootzin , Rohrbaugh , &amp; Urry , 1995 ) . Process research into the mechanisms of AT is necessary in order to answer such a question . <p> Finally , as yet unmentioned , in order to prove itself as an efficacious approach to treatment , AT must prove itself effective in ways that go beyond common factors.In discussing common factors among different psychotherapeutic orientations , Lambert and Bergin ( 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative working endeavor in which the patients increased sense of trust , security and safety , along with decreases in tension , threat , and anxiety , leads to changes in conceptualizing his or her problems and ultimately in acting differently by refacing fears , taking risks , and working through problems in interpersonal relationships . " ( p164-165 ) . <p> Clearly , elements of such common factors can be seen throughout AT.If in fact , AT is identified as containing such common factors , the task for the future is then to prove ATs efficacy beyond that of other therapies that also contain these common factors . Alternatively , AT must show itself to be more efficient than such other treatments in accomplishing therapeutic change . <p> Future Directions in Adventure Therapy Research <p> Given the methodological inadequacies in the literature , there are many things necessary in order to begin this process of proving AT to be an efficacious approach to psychotherapy.This section will first focus on delineating specific considerations for conducting outcome studies in AT utilizing a psychotherapy research framework.Next , potential for process research will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential for a future study in the area of client characteristics and outcome will be offered .. <p> Outcome Research <p> Borkovec ( 1994 ) and Kazdin ( 1992 ) provide excellent summaries of the important considerations to be recognized when conducting psychotherapy research.I will briefly discuss several of these points as they relate to research in AT , including some of the difficulties involved in meeting basic controls . <p> As with any psychotherapy research , there are significant difficulties involved in considering standardization of the independent variable in AT research . This consideration of standardization is of supreme importance , for as Borkovec ( 1994 ) notes " Standardization of procedures across all subjects and the matching of treatment and control conditions on all procedures except the crucial manipulation are ways of holding constant aspects of the environment and the experience of the subjects in that environment . " ( p. 249 ) . Borkovec also notes that " Each of the known and unknown ways in which conditions do , in fact , differ represents a rival hypothesis that could just as likely explain any observed difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique aspects of AT which lead to difficulties with standardization . It is difficult to standardize a treatment while allowing for the flexibility to account for factors such as inclement weather or accidents , and currently we have no assessment of the impact of such factors on outcome . Therefore , manualized approaches may be difficult to implement successfully . <p> The changing nature of the outdoor environment also present a difficult challenge in controlling for historical differences across groups.This may lead to difficulties in comparing and consolidating results of different groups.While we could hope that large enough sample sizes with the inclusion of multiple groups would randomize such differences , it may be difficult to identify such impacts and such potential differences in history must be considered when determining group equivalence in AT research . <p> Therapist considerations are another variable all but overlooked in the AT literature.Borkovec ( 1994 ) notes that therapists who participate in treatment outcome studies must be described in terms of background , training and experience.Any such differences can lead to a diffusion of the treatment.Presently , differences in training , experience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AT programs impossible . In fact , many programs utilize staff that are not formally trained in psychotherapeutic techniques and thus one questions whether such programs are in fact therapeutic in nature.Such information needs to be presented in AT outcome studies and attempts must be made to hold such factors constant across groups . <p> Other considerations are related to assessment of the dependent variable . Maturation effects and regression towards the mean are difficult to control for , particularly when conducting research on more long-term AT programs.Repeated testing may have also have an effect on the dependent variable , and often studies utilize designs where participants are tested on multiple occasions over the length of the program.Repeated exposure to the instruments may well impact the way participants respond . <p> Multiple domain assessment is also necessary.Borkovec ( 1994 ) notes that " multiple measures from different domains of assessment ( e.g. , cognitive , affective , physiological , and behavioral ) and from different methods of assessment ( e.g. , pre-and post-assessment questionnaires , daily diaries , assessor ratings from interviews , observational measures , significant-other reports , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single domain measurement by a single instrument for the sake of providing converging and valid improvement indices . " ( p. 278 ) . It is obviously necessary to use instruments with proven reliability and validity , as well as clinical and diagnostic utility.In addition , these measures must be chosen to answer specific theoretically-based questions . <p> Dependent measures must also be analyzed using appropriate statistical techniques.Researchers must be informed of such techniques , and thus be able to make informed choices of particular statistical procedures deigned to answer specific questions of interest.Relatedly , sample sizes must be big enough to provide enough power to detect group differences . <p> Another dependent variable consideration is the time of testing.Often measures are taken just prior to beginning an AT program and immediately upon completion.AS noted by Bandoroff ( 1989 ) , such scores may be impacted by pre-trip emotionality or post-trip euphoria and may not be representative of an individuals normal state.A better design would be to follow the example of Fry and Huebeck ( 1998 ) and administer pre-test measures sometime prior to beginning the treatment.Post-test measures must then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-term effects of the treatment.Such follow-up must include information about additional treatment or social services received , as well as the environment an individual enters upon completing the AT program.There may be largely differential long-term effects for an individual based on these factors , and conclusions about the long-term effects of any treatment can not be made without information about such potential confounds.Borkovec ( 1994 ) notes that " a thorough follow-up with its relatively small cost is more than just recommendable ; it should be required . " ( p. 278 ) . <p> Related to follow-up testing is the consideration of follow-up interventions after completion of an AT program in order to attempt to facilitate maintenance of treatment gains over time.Herbert ( 1998 ) provided the only attempt to empirically examine such a design , however , this attempt was unfortunately unsuccessful due to external circumstances.This is a consideration worthy of revisiting in the future . <p> Other dependent variable considerations involve the use of participant-observers as assessors.In the AT literature , often field staff or therapists who have been actively involved in conducting the treatment are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is widely subject to bias based on existing relationships.In addition , any information that the therapist/staff member has about the participantsbackground , may also potentially introduce bias into the assessment.Future designs must consider ways to have independent assessors of participant change or utilize more objective indices along with staff ratings . <p> Borkovec ( 1994 ) also refers to clinically significant change , and ways to define such change.Unfortunately , this discussion may be well beyond the range of the current empirical AT literature.As has been seen , the vast majority of studies employ such conceptual measures as self-esteem.When using such inconclusive measurement devices there is no way to define clinical significance and thus there can be no real informed discussion of the topic . <p> Borkovec ( 1994 ) also discusses design considerations.Although the lack of sophistication in the AT research precludes such a complete discussion at the present time , it is important to highlight some of Borkovecs comments on the utility of purely comparative designs in order for researchers to avoid the temptation to compare AT in a simplistic manner to another established therapy.While it may appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examining the efficacy of AT , Borkovec notes that " Most comparative studies are of such limited value for both applied and theoretical purposes that they should not be conducted " ( p. 260 ) , and states that he believes such research to be incapable of providing answers to questions of treatment efficacy due to the lack of validity associated with such designs.Borkovec discusses the impossibility of holding the clients experience constant across conditions and states that " differential outcome may be due to many , many differences in procedure.Thus , the investigators ability to rule out rival hypotheses is extremely limited . " ( p. 260 ) . <p> To add to Borkovecs ( 1994 ) comments , in considering a comparison of AT to any other type of psychotherapy which utilizes a standard weekly psychotherapy format , insurmountable confounds are found in considering equivalency of client time spent in therapy.Even in considering a comparison of AT and inpatient therapy , there are still similar confounds as inpatient therapists do not spend all of their time with the patients.Major confounds are also inherently associated with the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is referred to the previous section on the therapeutic relationship in the discussion of AT as compared to other forms of therapy ) . <p> What Borkovec ( 1994 ) recommends in place of such comparative designs is an overall approach that goes " deeply into one therapy technique , using increasingly sophisticated designs , methods and measures that explicitly provide basic knowledge about the pathology and the therapeutic change mechanisms of that therapy from which to devise hypotheses about increasingly effective modifications of that therapy ( p. 262 ) . Therefore , instead of simply comparing AT to another type of therapy , it may be important to examine closely the mechanisms of change in AT so that the treatment can be modified if necessary to incorporate the most effective elements of all treatment , both AT and the effective elements of other treatments . <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) discusses how researchers can use AT as part of a larger treatment plan and how under these circumstances it is impossible to draw conclusions about the impact of the AT portion of such a treatment ( Minor &amp; Elrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is that this type of treatment could easily be subjected to a dismantling ( component control ) approach.Such an approach would allow for comparisons between those individuals who received the treatment package with the adventure component and those who received the package without adventure activities . Therefore , the dismantling approach could allow for the determination of differential outcomes across components , or between specific components and the overall treatment package.This approach would also circumvent ethical and methodological issues involved with attempting to provide an equivalent control group . <p> Relatedly , such an integrative treatment approach could also easily be subjected to evaluation using an additive design in which " two or more therapy techniques are combined into one package " ( Borkovec , 1994 ) . Additive designs also have the same ethical benefits as does the dismantling approach , and both the dismantling and additive designs meet Borkovecs suggestions for a comprehensive analysis of one treatment as opposed to a direct comparison of treatmentsGiven the above-noted difficulties in comparing other treatments to AT , it may be more efficacious to approach future AT research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1994 ) also discusses methodological issues related to client considerations . While client characteristics may be used as selection criteria , sample characteristics must be also provided in order to allow for an evaluation of **25;1056;TOOLONG and important information about participants should include information about the severity and duration of the problems they are experiencing and diagnostic information . In order to achieve tighter control in this area , it is important that AT researchers use solid diagnostic tools and outcome measures that tap specific dimensions in identified problem areas . Kelley , Cousey , and Selby ( 1997 ) provide the only study to date utilizing clinically relevant measures . <p> In addition , client attrition rates must be provided and available characteristics of those who atrit must be analyzed separately in order to determine if there are differences.According to Borkovec ( 1994 ) , " The important requirements are that all criteria be specified , that they are reliably determined , and that they are based on a valid rationale related to the nature of the disorder and the nature of the questions being asked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to considerations such as these may well have a circular effect , for by forcing AT researchers to consider the theoretical basis of the questions that they are asking for the clients that are specified , the results of such inquiry can then be used to potentially expand the theory.In order for this to occur , AT researchers need to ask themselves such basic questions as " Do we have an identified problem ? " and " Are our measures linked specifically to that problem ? " ( Chambless &amp; Hollon , 1998 ) . <p> Borkovec ( 1994 ) also notes that it is important to consider the referral source of clients , and that separate analyses of participants from different referral sources may be initially useful in determining if differences in referral sources may be impacting results.This is particularly relevant for AT participants , who commonly come from such diverse referral sources as mental health providers , schools , justice system referrals , self-referrals , or parents.Differences in such referral sources may suggest widely diverse client backgrounds . <p> Finally , there is a need fordiscussion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Borkovec , 1994 ) . The range of potential referral sources suggest the possibility that at least some of the clients were potentially involved in earlier treatment , or may perhaps be involved in ongoing treatment to which they will return.Such effects of concurrent or earlier treatment must be evaluated in order to determine the impact of such treatment on any evaluation of the results of AT.As was earlier discussed , one can speculate that perhaps the best model of all may be one in which a person participates in an adventure-based treatment and then continues in another form of community-based treatment that can build on gains potentially achieved through the AT experience.As we have no data available to evaluate this model , such remarks are purely speculative at this point.However , the first step towards building such a model is to begin evaluating potential effects of other treatments on the AT experience . <p> McLean and Anderson ( 1998 ) propose a four step model for psychotherapy research that may provide a useful heuristic for approaching the establishment of empirical support for AT.The first and second steps involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can be further evaluated empirically.Proven validity of these mechanisms then allows for the experimental manipulation of the mechanismin order to compare these mechanisms to other treatments under strict experimental conditions in an attempt to establish efficacy , the third step . Through this ongoing establishment of efficacy , the final step of addressing questions of treatment efficiency can be addressed.It appears that currently AT research is more in the process of working through the first two steps as opposed to the latter . <p> Ultimately , these methodological criticisms and considerations involve overarching questions of validity.Without the implementation of tighter research control , we have neither internal nor external validity , and the best we can say is that some AT programs may have some effects at a particular moment in time with no basis for generalizability.We must begin tightening controls so that we can find out what works and who it works for so that we can begin to reach some conclusions . <p> Without tighter control we will never be able to say definitively that AT is a causal agent of change.There are currently a seemingly unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients considerations , expectancies , placebo effects , contact hours , relationship factors , changes in the environment , novelty effects , post- treatment environmental conditions and many others which could greatlyimpact any results that we have seen.In order to maximize our ability to detect such important relationships as the effect of AT on outcome , we must minimize these threats.In order to minimize these threats , we must hold such extraneous factors constant across conditions . <p> While it may appear be a monumental task to take such a large number of factors into consideration when designing and conducting research into AT , it is a necessary step in order to make any conclusions about any type of treatment.It is possible to accomplish , however , using the best of our accumulated scientific acumen and ability.To begin , researchers must make every effort to establish the highest level of control possible in their experimental context.Kazdin ( 1992 ) provides researchers with hopeful words of guidance regarding this issue , noting that : <p> " Ideal methodological practices ( e.g. random assignment ) are not always available.Also , restrictions ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small sample sizes are available ) may limit the researchers options.In clinical psychology and other related areas of research , the options on methodology , design , and statistics must be greater to permit the investigator to select and identify creative solutions.Clinical research is not in any way soft science ; indeed the processes involved in clinical research reflect science at its best precisely because of the thinking and methodological ingenuity required to force nature to reveal its secrets . " ( p. 8 ) . <p> It also must be noted that the establishment of documented empirical support is a long process , and questions as to the efficacy and change mechanisms of AT will not be answered by one definitive study . <p> Ultimately , the research in AT needs to start from the beginning , at the most basic level of research design.Simplistically , the AT research needs to use random assignment , utilize control groups , employ an appropriate level of standardization , create homogeneous groups with large enough sample sizes , engage competent therapists , utilize valid and relevant pre- and post-test measures , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant change be found , this change needs to be replicated in a different setting.Should that study be significant as well , to be classified as an empirically supported treatment , two more similar studies with similar findings are required.Only then will AT be able to claim treatment efficacy . <p> Process Research <p> The traditional psychotherapy literature has put a large emphasis on process-related research in the last two decades.Kazdin ( 1992 ) provides a simplistic way of defining process research , noting that the primary question process research tries to answer is " What processes occur in treatment that affect within session performance and may contribute to treatment outcome ? " ( p. 142 ) . Castonguay and Schut ( 2000 ) contrast process research to outcome research , noting that " Whereas outcome research focuses on whether or not psychotherapy research works , process research investigates how it works ( or why it fails to work for everyone ) . ( p. 3 ) . Ultimately , a process approach moves away from looking strictly at outcome and begins to examine the mechanisms of change in therapy.Kazdin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertaining to the mechanisms of change of therapy by addressing manifold concerns of what transpires between the delivery of an interventions and the ultimate impact on the client . " ( p. 147 ) . <p> There has been very little process research in the area of AT . Such important factors as client and therapist considerations referred to earlier by Borkovec ( 1994 ) fall into this realm.Specifically , Wichmann ( 1991 ) found that instructor experience and instructor expectancies somewhat impacted post-treatment asocial behaviors in adolescent participants.Hattie et al ( 1997 ) also found that length of program impacted outcome , with longer programs showing greater results . Other additional process variables of importance in AT could be specific program , therapist , and setting variables . <p> Kazdin ( 1992 ) notes , however , that a line of questioning into process variables is necessarily based on prior studies that demonstrate treatment effectiveness when compared to alternative treatments.Obviously it has been seen that the AT field is nowhere near demonstrating treatment effectiveness , and in fact , good comparisons of AT with other forms of treatment are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion of process related variables , and a complete discussion of psychotherapy process research and how it relates empirically and methodologically to AT is beyond the scope of this paper.Following a scientifically-based exploration into AT efficacy , such an area is recognized as being ripe for future exploration . <p> Castonguay and Schut ( 2000 ) provide an excellent summary of the psychotherapy process research . In order to highlight such areas for future AT research , the relevant aspects of this review will be briefly summarized here.Casonguay and Schut ( 2000 ) discuss the goals of process research as 1 ) to describe the specific processes that occur during therapy , and 2 ) to identify what factors may impact a clients improvement , either positively or negatively.In order to accomplish this goal , researchers have attempted to evaluate empirically process variables related to the therapists , the client , the client-therapist relationship , and the structure of treatment.Of these , the clienttherapist relationship has been the most potent predictor of change.Given this , it is necessary to consider an examination of the impact of this relationship in AT.As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in AT settings , such exploration may yield interesting results . <p> It also must be understood in any consideration of process research that specific factors related to standardization and control in the above methodological discussion of outcome research apply to process research as well.Therefore , AT researchers must firstmove towards establishing basic level scientific control before beginning any valid evaluation of process or outcome.The challenge of the future for AT research is how to deal with the concurrent issues of establishing such basic level controls while staying within the specific framework of scientific therapy research . <p> Need for Change in the Adventure-Based Therapy Literature <p> Echoing those concerns of " mainstream " psychotherapy researchers , leading researchers in the AT field have also echoed a need for change in the way AT research is being conducted , and have voiced similar methodological concerns as those above . Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) vehemently advocate the need for change in AT research , especially in the face of growing external pressures ( e.g. , third-party payers ) , stating " Do we have any other choice ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will benefit most from our services just because we have not done the work needed to make our case known ? " ( p. 12 ) . <p> They go on to list several examples of what types of studies need to be conducted , including further meta-analyses , program surveys in order to examine what adventure-based programs are actually doing , an examination of facilitator effects and competencies , and consumer surveys designed to examine what aspects of the interventions that they found most helpful . <p> Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) also note that in order for the field to begin focusing on what type of intervention works best with which population , the field must more clearly define what exactly adventure-based interventions consist of ; including program variables , demographic information , etc. as part of this description.They assert that without access to this kind of data , clear comparisons between studies and programs themselves are not possible.Finally , they discuss that it is necessary for the field to attempt to create some sort of homogeneity of method and diagnostic populations to allow for research and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties in involved with the development of such designs due to the dynamic nature of the AT environment . <p> Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) also provide suggestions as to how to best share information with clinicians in more " mainstream " therapeutic areas , noting that this is important in furthering evaluation of the field.These suggestions include 1 ) creating a collective web-based document , 2 ) close examination of clinically significant events in adventure-based therapy , particularly those with a consumer perspective , 3 ) communicating the theories and results of adventure-based therapy in the language of mainstream clinicians in order to achieve greater credibility outside of the adventure-based therapy realm , and 4 ) the continuation of efficacy studies . <p> To accomplish these goals , Gillis ( 1992 ) suggests that what is most essential in the field of adventure-based therapy research is " one clearly defined and researched method of conducting psychotherapy in outdoor learning experiences , in wilderness-adventure settings , or inadventure-based activities that can be assessed for effectiveness . " ( p. 18 ) . He suggests researchers attempt to do protocol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to gain the control necessary to truly examine the effectiveness of adventure-based therapy utilizing multiple measures and predictor models.In addition , he also discusses the necessity of using homogeneous diagnostic populations in order to increase the element of control that can be achieved . <p> Han ( 1997 ) echoes some of Gillis ( 1992 ) suggestions , noting that it is important for future research to incorporate a greater level of detail , specifically in regard to the types of activities conducted and definitions of program components.She also suggested the use of more specific assessments and constructs . <p> Bandoroff ( 1989 ) maintains that it is important for the field to begin moving away from the same constructs and begin examining other variables . It appears that the field seems to suffer from a lack of new ideas in research , focusing primarily on the same constructs of locus of control , self-esteem , and problem-solving ability.While established as acceptable outcome measures in adventure-based therapy , these constructs may have been over-examined at the expense of investigating other variables that may be related to outcome.While having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and replication , it is clearly limiting to continue to examine these same variables in different settings . <p> Hattie et al . ( 1997 ) also provide suggestions to guide future research.Many of their suggestions echo those of Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) , offering such basic design specific recommendations as the use of reliable and valid dependable measures , reasonable sample sizes , and dependent variables related to the outcome of interest.Also similar to Gillis and Thomsen , they argue for clear documentation of background variables , such as demographic and therapist variables.They also recommend examining more client characteristic variables , noting that examining variables such as motivations and behavior in outdoor settings , and their interaction can provide us valuable data.As an additional proposition , they recommend considering alternate research designs , designs moving beyond traditional pre- and post- test designs . <p> Herbert ( 1998 ) espouses a need for studies which utilize of follow-up procedures.He also advocates the use of qualitative research in conjunction with quantitative research in order to understand more about the impact of the AT experience for the individual , noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " paled in comparison to the information one learns about each participant through an interview " . ( p. 15 ) . Regarding this issue , he recommends the use of more indirect methods of qualitative analysis , such as the examination of participants daily logs.He notes that such an analysis could provide important and valuable insights into the impact of an adventure-based therapy programs for the individual.Neill and Richards ( 1998 ) also call for the need to understand more about AT from an individual perspective . <p> In line with Herberts ( 1998 ) suggestion as to the need to more completely understand the impact of adventure-based therapy for the individual , Hattie et . al . ( 1997 ) , Bandoroff ( 1989 ) , Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) , and Gillis ( 1992 ) all strongly advocate the shift from outcome specific studies to focusing on more process-oriented variables , arguing that future research must examine the relationship of outcome with such process related variables as therapist factors , program elements , and participant characteristics.This call for process research parallels that of more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting , asking questions as to what causes client change.As noted , however , it may be necessary for AT to prove itself as an efficacious approach to treatment prior to such an exploration . <p> Related to the shift towards process research is a call for regression techniques to more closely examine client variables which may impact the therapeutic process.Gillis and Thomsen ( 1996 ) also recommend the use of predictor models for future analyses . <p> These suggestions , particularly the call for alternative designs , the need to further understand the process of change , the need to understand the impact on the individual , the need to use predictor models , and the need for research on client characteristics and how they relate to outcome lend themselves to the earlier contention that it may be useful to approach future research from a more individual difference- based perspective.This is also in line with a proposed model for psychotherapy research delineating that theory and mechanisms of change must be established prior to the establishment of treatment efficacy ( McLean &amp; Anderson , 1998 ) , a statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kazdin ( 1992 ) . Nevertheless , one way to begin the scientifically rigorous exploration of the therapeutic efficacy and process of AT is to focus on client characteristic variables and their relationship to outcome . <p> A research approach based on individual **25;1083;TOOLONG models may be warranted in order to move towards answering the above proposed question , " For whom is adventure-based therapy more successful ? " , as opposed to " Is adventure-based therapy successful ? " <p> Future Study <p> To re-visit an earlier contention , it is interesting to consider for a moment the assumption that there may be differential effects of outcome based on client variables.Should there indeed be a significant effect for such variables , this may have an impact on the interpretation of the results of AT research.Again the statement potentially may hold true-if some individuals are greatly impacted and others are not at all impacted , statistically this could impact any analysis of group differences , thus obscuring the effect of such individual-differences on mean group measures of outcome . It seems to make logical sense then that along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is most likely to change.If we can begin to make some empirically-based statements regarding individual differences which impact outcome , we can then include such results in our ongoing consideration of outcome , client characteristics , and process . <p> One way to begin looking at such variables is offered in the juvenile justice system , where a number of adolescents are court-ordered to participate in adventure-based therapy programs as a result of committing a crime.Given that these adjudicated individuals have no choice but to participate in such a program ( thus eliminating self-selection bias ) , a program with court-ordered participants provides a unique laboratory in which to begin to clarify the effects of client characteristics on outcome.In addition , the utilization of such a sample allows for follow-up data related to recidivism not commonly available in such studies . <p> There has been no research to date in the AT literature that has looked at the effect of measured client characteristics on the recidivism rates of juvenile offenders.Given that it has been suggested that some adventure-based therapy programs may have positive impacts onrecidivism , one logical next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may impact the outcome of such a program at the individual level . <p> It is interesting to consider the implications of such a study.By examining such factors , we may be able to begin developing models which help us to channel individuals more appropriately into the most effective treatments . According to McLean and Anderson ( 1998 ) " Treatment matching based on patient attributes promises to providebetter fit between moderators ( i.e. , client characteristics ) and choice of psychotherapy approach . " ( p. 126 ) . Therefore , the examination of client characteristic variables as they relate to outcome in an AT program with court-referred adolescents may be an excellent and useful way to being approaching AT from a more scientific perspective . <p> This contention will be explored in later document . <p> Conclusion <p> This paper examined the theoretical , clinical , and empirical basis of AT , as well as provided a methodological summary of the present AT research and future directions in AT research.This analysis is offered in an attempt to provide a foundation for future empirical analysis that can more closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an efficacious approach to psychotherapy . <p> As has been seen , AT is a therapeutic modality being used increasingly with a wide variety of populations.While promoted as an efficacious approach to therapy , when subjected to close scrutiny the empirical data available is unable to support such claims and thus we can make no definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of AT as a treatment , either positive or negative.Completion of well-controlled research in this area is necessary to help facilitate such conclusions.For the field to continue to move forward , particularly in a time of increased pressure from HMOs , government funding agencies , and third-party payees , as well as a growing push towards empirically supported treatments , such efforts are increasingly important and necessary.In addition , solid empirical research may help to provide a necessary link to traditional psychotherapy , allowing the field to achieve greater attention from " mainstream " clinicians . <p> At the present time , however , the theories and techniques of this rapidly growing field continue to remain a mystery to most " mainstream " clinicians , and thus this intervention style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm.Indeed , without a solid research base , there is no basis for the field to establish any type of credibility.Gillis ( 1992 ) notes that " adventure-based therapy may need to develop a strong sense of identity and autonomy that is not dependent on others and is yet , at the same time , connected to others in adventure programming or mental health . " ( p. 15 ) . <p> It is only through developing a coherent body of research delineating theory , process , and outcome of adventure-based therapy treatment programs that the AT field can begin to establish credibility and these connections with other mental health professionals.In fact , it is our ethical responsibility to establish this base in order to justify the continued use of such treatment.Not only must we build a body of empirical data that allows us to make determinations about the efficacy of this treatment for particular populations , we must also conduct research with an eye to those for whom it may be harmful.On a more pragmatic side , if researchers are able to establish AT as an efficacious approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased referrals and third-party payment.In the current mental health climate related to managed care , this is a very important consideration . <p> One important piece of this process is research focusing on client characteristics that may impact outcome.By focusing on the preliminary question of " For whom is adventure-based therapy most successful ? " , we can start developing models that allow us to begin concentrating on other issues related to the establishment of empirical support for AT.Questions such as this are not specific to adventure-based therapy alone , rather they are questions that all clinicians and researchers need to be asking with regard to intervention , including such issues as " what type of treatment is most effective for whom under what circumstances ? " Perhaps by beginning to answer such questions , researchers in the area of adventure-based therapy can add a potentially unique contribution to the vital question of what it is that helps people to change .

Small but unusual acts of physical movement also hold promise for bringing specific benefits . For example , exercise promotes learning by bringing more blood and oxygen to the brain . And just as physical movement and exercise have clear impacts on the mind , so too the mind can have surprising effects on the body . For example Hendricks and Fadiman ( 1976 , pp. 108-109 ) describe one of Feldenkrais ' ( 1972 ) ingenious exercises which demonstrate that : <p> by practicing unusual movements we send new messages to the nervous system that allow the nervous system to send new messages to the body to release some of the built-in restrictions and allow the body more freedom and mobility . Along with the new body freedom many subjects report a feeling of psychological loosening . <p> Here is an example of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right arm extended straight out in front of you at shoulder level . Look at your hand and turn your arm , head , and eyes together to the right as far as they will go without strain . Note a point on the wall corresponding to that distance . Now come to the front position . Let your arm down . Relax . Put it up again to the front position . Move your arm to the right as before but simultaneously move your head to the left . Move both head and arm as far as you can go without strain . Do this five times , returning the center position between trials . Be aware of the feeling in your neck , shoulders , and waist during these five movements . Put your arm down and relax . Now once again try the original motion of looking at your hand and moving your arm , head , and eyes to rhe right as far as they can go without strain . Compare it with the original point on the wall Come back to center position . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front position . Now move your arm to the right and your and hip ( pelvis ) to the left , all as far as they can go without strain . Do this five times , returning to the center position between trials . Again be very ware of all your movement . Put your arm down and relax . Again try the original movement , moving to the right as far as you can go without strain . Compare this with the original points . It is probably that your arm how turns noticeably farther to the right than it did originally . <p> Now hold your left arm straight out to front , look at your hand and turn your head , trunk , and arm to the left as far as you can without strain and note the point on the wall . Come back to the front . Put your arm down . Relax . Put it up again in the front position . Now only in imagination repeat the movement made for right arm , three times each ; that is , imagine your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . Then imagine your arm going left and your head and hips going right three times . While you do this concentrate on the muscle feelings . After the imagined movement open your eyes , and your arm down and relax . Now put your left out in front as before , looking at your hand , and move arm , trunk , and head to the left and note the different in the points on the wall . There will probably be about as large an increment as with the right side , although it was all done without movement . <p> Recent work on the Involuntary Nervous System proves an explanation for this ideational part of this exercise and for the body/mind view generally . Miller ( 1969 ) says : <p> Cellular electric current can be made to occur in protoplasm by the very act of thinking .

@@41691552 @1691552/ <h> Designing Questions to Be Good Measures <p> In surveys , answers are of interest not intrinsically but because of their relationship to something they are supposed to measure . Good questions are reliable , providing consistent measures In comparable situations , and valid ; answers correspond to what they are Intended to measure . <p> This chapter discusses theory and practical approaches to designing questions to be reliable and valid measures . <p> It is always important to remember that designing a question for a survey instrument is designing a measure , not a conversational inquiry . In general , an answer given to a survey question is of no intrinsic interest . Rather the answer is valuable to the extent that it can be shown to have a predictable relationship to facts or subjective states that are of interest . Good questionnaires maximise the relationship between the answers recorded and what the researcher is trying to measure . <p> In one sense , survey answers are simply responses evoked in an artificial situation contrived by the researcher . What does an answer tell us about some reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at a few specific kinds of answers and their meanings : <p> A respondent tells us that he voted for Nixon rather than McGovem for president in 1972 . The reality in which we are interested is which lever , if any , he pulled in the voting booth . The answer given in the survey may differ from what happened in the voting booth for any number of reasons . The respondent may have pulled the wrong lever and , therefore , not know for whom he voted . The respondent could have forgotten for whom he voted . The respondent could have altered his answer for some reason on purpose . The interviewer accidentally could have checked the wrong box even after an " accurate " answer was given . <p> A respondent tells us how many times he went to the doctor for medical care during the past year . Is that the same number that the researcher would have come up with had he followed the respondent around for 24 hours a day for 365 days , during the past year ? Problems of recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor , and problems of willingness to report accurately may affect the correspondence between the number the respondent gives and the count the researcher would have arrived at independently . <p> When a respondent rates her public school system as " good " rather than " fair " or " poor , " the researcher will want to interpret that answer as reflecting evaluations and perceptions of that school system . If the respondent rated only one school rather than the whole school system , or tilted the answer to please the interviewer , or understood the question differently from others , her answer may not reflect the feelings the researcher tried to measure . <p> Although many surveys are analysed and interpreted as if the researcher " knows " what the answer means , that , in fact , is very risky . Studies designed to evaluate the correspondence between respondents ' answers and " true values " show that many respondents answer many questions very well . However , there also is a considerable amount of lack of correspondence . To assume perfect correspondence between the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is true , it is usually the result of careful design . In the following sections , we discuss many specific ways researchers can improve the correspondence between respondents ' answers and the " true " state of affairs . <p> One goal of a good measure is to increase question reliability . When two respondents are in the same situation , they should answer the question in the same way . To the extent that there is inconsistency across respondents , random error is introduced and the measurement is less precise . The first part of this chapter deals with how to increase the reliability of questions . <p> There is also the issue of what a given answer " means " in relation to what a researcher is trying to measure : How well does the answer correspond ? The later two sections of this chapter are devoted to validity - the correspondence between answers and " true values " - and ways to improve that correspondence ( compare Cronbach &amp; Meehl , 1955 ) . <h> Designing a reliable instrument <p> One step toward ensuring consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same set of questions . Answers to these questions are recorded . The researcher would like to be able to make the assumption that differences in answers stem from differences among respondents rather than from differences in the stimuli to which respondents are exposed . <p> A survey data collection is an interaction between a researcher and a respondent . In a self-administered survey , the researcher speaks directly to the respondent through a written questionnaire . In other surveys , an interviewer reads the researcher 's words to the respondent . In either case , the questionnaire is the protocol for one side of the interaction . In order to provide a consistent data collection experience for all respondents , a good questionnaire has the following properties : <p> The researcher 's side of the question and answer process is fully scripted so that the questions as written fully prepare a respondent to answer questions . <p> The question means the same thing to every respondent . <p> The kinds of answers that constitute an appropriate response to the question are communicated consistently to all respondents . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is when , somehow , the researcher 's words do not constitute a complete question . <h> Incomplete wording <p> Bad <p> Better <p> 5.1 Age ? <p> What was your age on your last birthday ? <p> 5.2 Reason last saw doctor ? <p> What was the medical problem or reason for which you most recently went to a doctor ? <p> Interviewers ( or respondents ) will have to add words or change words in order to make an answerable question . If the goal is to have respondents all answering the same questions , then it is best if the researcher writes the questions fully . <p> Sometimes optional wording is required to fit differing respondent circumstances . However , that does not mean that the researcher has to give up writing the questions . A common convention is to put optional wording in parentheses . These words will be used by the interviewer when they are appropriate to the situation and omitted when they are not needed . <h> Examples of optional wording <p> 5.3 Were you ( or anyone living here with you ) attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 5.4 Did ( he/she ) report the attack to the police ? <p> 5.5 How old was ( EACH PERSON ) on ( his/her ) last birthday ' ? <p> In 5.3 , the parenthetical phrase would be omitted if the interviewer already knew that the respondent lived alone . However , if more than one person lived in the household , the interviewer and would include it . <p> The parenthetical choice offered in 5.4 may seem minor . However , the parentheses alerts the interviewer to the fact that a choice must be made ; the proper pronoun is used , and the principle is maintained that the interviewer need read only the questions exactly as written in order to present a satisfactory stimulus . <p> A variation that accomplishes the same thing is illustrated in 5.5 . A format such as that might be used if the same question were to be asked for each person in a household . Rather than repeat the identical words endlessly , a single question is written instructing the interviewer to substitute an appropriate designation ( your husband/your son/your oldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask questions that makes sense and take advantage of knowledge previously gained in the interview to tailor the questions to the respondent 's individual circumstances . There is another kind of optional wording that is seen occasionally in questionnaire that is not acceptable . <h> Example of unacceptable optional wording <p> 5.6 What do you like best about this neighbourhood ? ( We 're interested in anything like houses , the people , the parks , or whatever . ) <p> Presumably , the parenthetical probe was thought to be helpful to respondents who were having difficulty in answering the question . However , from a measurement point of view , it undermines the principle of standardized interviewing . If interviewers use the parenthetical probe when a respondent does not readily come up with an answer , then a subset of respondents will have answered a different question . Such optional probes usually are introduced when the researcher does not think the initial question is a very good one . The proper approach is to write a good question in the first place . Interviewers should never be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read them except , as in the examples above , to make the questions fit the circumstances of a particular respondent in a standardized way . The following is a different example of incomplete question wording . There are three errors embedded in the example . <h> Poor example of standardized wording <p> 5.7 I would like you to rate different features of your neighbourhood as very good , good , fair , or poor . Please think carefully about each item as I read it . <p> ( a ) Public schools <p> ( b ) Parks and services <p> ( c ) Other <p> The first problem . with 5.7 is the order of the main stem . The response alternatives are read prior to an instruction to think carefully about the questions . The respondent probably will forget the question . The interviewer likely will have to do some explaining or rewording . Second , the words the interviewer needs to ask about the second item on the list , " parks , " are not provided in 5.7 . A much better question would he the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask you to rate different features of your neighbourhood . I want you to think carefully about your answers . How would you rate ( FEATURE ) -would you say very good , good , fair , or poor ? <p> This gives the interviewer the wording needed for asking the first and all subsequent items on the list . <p> The third problem with the example is the alternative " other " . What is the interviewer to say ? It is not uncommon to see " other " on a list of questions in a form similar to the example . Although occasionally there may be a worthwhile question objective involved , most often the questionnaire will benefit from dropping the item . <p> The above examples illustrate questions that could not he presented consistently to all respondents due to incomplete wording . Another step needed to increase consistency is to create a set of questions that flows smoothly and easily . It can be shown that if questions have awkward or confusing wording , if there are words that are difficult to pronounce , or combinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words to make the questions sound better or to make them easier to read . It may be possible to train and supervise interviewers to keep such changes to a minimum . However , good design of the questionnaire will raise the odds of a standardized interview . <h> Ensuring consistent meaning to all respondents <p> If all respondents are asked exactly the same questions , one step has been taken to ensure that differences in answers can be attributed to differences in respondents . However , there is a further consideration . The questions should all mean the same thing to all respondents . If two respondents understand the question to mean different things , their answers may be different for that reason alone . <p> One potential problem is using words that are not understood universally . In general samples , it is important to remember that a range of educational experiences and cultural backgrounds will be represented . Even with well-educated samples , using simple words that are short and widely understood is a sound approach to questionnaire design . <p> Undoubtedly , a much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms or concepts that can have multiple meanings . It is impossible to give an exhaustive list of ambiguous terms used in surveys , but the prevalence of misunderstanding of common terms has been well documented by those who have studied the problem ( e.g. , Belson , 1981 ) . <h> Poorly defined terms <p> 5.8 How many times in the past year have you seen or talked with a doctor about your health ? <p> Problem . There are two ambiguous terms or concepts in this question . First , there is basis for uncertainty about what constitutes a doctor . Are only people practicing medicine with M. D. degrees included ? If so , then psychiatrists are included , but psychologists , chiropractors , osteopaths , and podiatrists are not included . What about physicians , assistants or nurses who work directly for doctors in doctors ' offices ? If a person goes to a doctor 's office for an innoculation , that is given by a nurse , does it count ? <p> Second , what constitutes seeing or talking with a doctor ? Do telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor is not seen count ? <p> Solutions . Often the best approach is to provide respondents and interviewers with the definitions they need . <p> 5.8a We are going to ask about visits to doctors and getting medical advice from doctors . In this case we are interested in all professional personnel who have M.D. degrees or work directly for an M.D. in the office such as a nurse or medical assistant . <p> When the definition of what is wanted is extremely complicated and would take a very long time to define , as may be the case in this question , an additional constructive approach may be to ask supplementary questions about desired events that particularly are likely to be omitted . For example , visits to psychiatrists , visits for inoculations , and telephone consultations often are under reported and may warrant specific follow-up questions . <h> Poorly defined terms <p> 5.9 Did you eat breakfast yesterday ? <p> The difficulty is that the definition of breakfast varies widely . Some people consider coffee and a donut anytime before noon to be " breakfast " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast unless it includes a major entree , such as bacon and eggs , and is consumed before 8:00 A.M. <p> Solutions . There are two approaches to the solution . On the one hand , one might choose to define breakfast : <p> 5.9a For our purposes , let us consider breakfast to be a meal eaten before 10:00 in the morning , which includes some protein such as eggs , meat or milk , some grain such as toast or cereal , and some fruit or vegetable . Using that definition , did you have breakfast yesterday ? <p> While that often is a very good approach , in this case it is very complicated . Instead of trying to communicate a common definition to respondents , the researcher may simply ask people to report what they consumed before 10:00 a.m . At the coding stage , the " quality " of what was eaten can be evaluated consistently without requiring each respondent to share the same definition . <h> Poorly defined terms <p> 5.10 Do you favour or oppose gun control legislation ? <p> Problem . Gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds of guns , asking people to register their guns , limiting the number or kinds of guns that people may possess , or which people may possess them . Answers can not be interpreted without assumptions about what respondents think the question means . Respondents will undoubtedly interpret the question differently . <p> 5.10a One proposal for the control of guns is that no person who ever had been convicted of a violent crime would be allowed to purchase or own a pistol , rifle . or shotgun . Would you oppose or support legislation like that ? <p> One could argue that it is only one of a variety of proposals for gun control . That is exactly the point . If one wants to ask multiple questions about different possible responses to a gun control problem , one should ask separate specific questions that can be understood commonly by all respondents and interpreted by researchers . One does not solve the problem of a complex issue by leaving it to the respondents to decide what questions they want to answer . <p> The worst , way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to define terms if they are asked . Only respondents who ask will receive the definition ; interviewers will not give consistently worded definitions if they are not written in the questionnaire . Thus the researcher will never know what question any particular respondent answered . If a complex term that may require definition must be used , interviewers should be required to read a common definition to all respondents . <h> The " Do n't Know " Option <p> When respondents are being asked questions about their own lives , feelings , or experiences , a " do n't know " response is often a statement that they are unwilling to do the work required to give an answer . On the other hand , sometimes we ask respondents questions about things about which they legitimately do not know . As the object of the questions gets further from their immediate lives , the more plausible and reasonable it is that some respondents will not have adequate knowledge on which to base an answer or will not have formed an opinion or feeling . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply can ask the questions of all respondents , relying on the respondent to volunteer a " do n't know . " The alternative is to ask respondents whether or not they feel familiar enough with a topic to have an opinion or feeling about it . <p> When a researcher is dealing with a topic about which familiarity is high , whether or not a screening question for knowledge is asked is probably not important . However , when there is reason to think that a notable number of respondents will not be familiar with whatever the question is dealing with , it probably is best to ask a screening question about familiarity with the topic . People differ in their willingness to volunteer a " do n't know " . A screening question for familiarity helps to produce a kind of standardisation ; most people answering the question then will have at least some minimal familiarity with what they are responding to ( Schuman &amp; Presser , 1981 ) . <h> Specialised Wording for Special Subgroups <p> Researchers have wrestled with the fact that the vocabularies in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could argue that standardised measurement actually would require different questions for different subgroups . <p> Designing different forms of questionnaires for different sub- groups almost is never done . Rather methodologists tend to work very hard to attempt to find wording for questions that has consistent meaning across an entire population . Even though there are situations where a question wording is more typical of the speech of one segment of a community than another ( most often the better-educated segment ) , finding exactly comparable words for some ' other group of the population and then giving interviewers reliable rules for deciding when to ask which version is so difficult that it is likely to produce more unreliability than it reduces . <h> Standardized expectations for type of response <p> Thus far we have said it is important to give interviewers a good script so that they can read the questions exactly as worded , and it is important to design questions that mean the same thing to all respondents . The other component of a good question that sometimes is overlooked is that respondents should have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The simplest way to give respondents the same perceptions of what constitutes an adequate answer is to provide them with a list of acceptable answers . Such questions are called closed questions . The respondent has to choose one , or sometimes more than one , of a set of alternatives provided by the researcher . <p> Closed questions are not suitable in all instances . The range of possible answers may be more extensive than it is reasonable to provide . The researcher may not feel that all reasonable answers can be anticipated . For such reasons , the researcher may prefer not to provide a list of alternatives to the respondent . However , that does not free the researcher from structuring the focus of the question and the kind of response wanted as carefully as possible . <p> 5.11 Why did you vote for Candidate A ? <p> Problems . Almost all " why " questions have problems . The reason is that one 's sense of causality or frame of references can influence what one talks about . In the particular instance above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Candidate A , the weaknesses of Candidate B , or the reasons the respondent uses certain criteria ( " My mother was a lifelong Democrat " ) . Hence respondents who see things exactly the same way may answer differently . <p> Solution . Specify the focus of the answer : <p> 5.1a What characteristics of Candidate A led you to vote for ( him/her ) over Candidate B ? <p> Such a question explains to respondents that we want them to talk about Candidate A , the person for whom they voted . If all respondents answer with that same frame of reference , we then will be able to compare responses from different respondents in a direct fashion . ' <p> 5.12 What are some of the things about this neighbourhood that you like best ? <p> Problems . In response to a question like that , some people will only make one or two points , while others will make many . It is possible that such differences reflect important differences in respondent perceptions or feelings . However , research has shown pretty clearly that education is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions . Interviewers also affect the number of such answers . <p> Solution . Specify the number of points to be made : <p> 5. 12a What is the feature of this neighbourhood that you would single out as the one you like most ? <p> 5. 2b Tell me the three things about this neighbourhood that you like most about living here . <p> Although that may not be a satisfactory solution for all questions , for many such questions it is an effective way of reducing unwanted variation in answers across respondents . <p> The basic point is that answers can vary because respondents have a different understanding of the kind of responses that are appropriate . Better specification of the properties of the answer de- sired can remove a needless source of unreliability in the measurement process . <h> Types of measures / types of questions <h> Introduction <p> The above procedures are designed to maximise reliability - the extent to which people in comparable situations will answer questions in similar ways . However , one can measure with perfect reliability and still not be measuring what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer given is a true measure and means what the researcher wants it to mean or expects it to mean is called validity . In this section , we discuss other aspects of the design of questionnaires , in addition to steps to maximise the reliability of questions , that can increase the validity of survey measures . <p> For this discussion , it is necessary to differentiate questions designed to measure facts or objectively measurable events from questions designed to measure subjective states such as attitudes , opinions , and feelings . Even though there are questions that fall in a murky area on the borders of these two categories , the idea of validity is somewhat different for subjective and objective measures for several reasons . If it is possible to cheek the accuracy of an answer by some independent observation , then the measure of validity becomes the similarity of the survey report to the value of some " true " measure . In theory one could obtain an independent , accurate count of the number of times that an individual obtained medical services from a physician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very difficult to obtain such an independent measure ( e.g. , records also contain errors ) , the understanding of validity can be consistent for objective situations . <p> In contrast , when people are asked about subjective states , feelings , attitudes , and opinions , there is no objective way of validating the answers . Only the person has access to his or her feelings and opinions . Thus the only way of assessing the " validity " of reports of subjective states is the way in which they correlate either with other answers that a person gives or with other facts about the person 's life that one thinks should be related to what is being measured . For such measures , there is no truly independent direct measure possible ; the meaning of answers must be inferred from patterns of association . This fundamental difference in the meaning of validity requires sepa- rate discussions regarding ways of maximising validity . <h> Levels of Measurement <p> There are four different ways in which measurement is carried out in social sciences . This produces four different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analysis : <p> Nominal - people or events are sorted into unordered categories . ( " Are you male or female ? " ) <p> Ordinal - people or events are ordered or placed in ordered categories along a single dimension . ( " How would you rate your health - very good , good , fair , or poor ? " ) <p> Interval data - numbers are attached that provide meaningful information about the distance between ordered stimuli or classes . ( In fact , interval data are very rare . Fahrenheit temperature readings are among the few common examples . ) <p> Ratio data - numbers are assigned that have absolute meaning such as a count or measurement by an objective , physical scale such as distance , weight , or pressure . ( " How old were you on your last birthday ? " ) <p> Most often in surveys , when one is collecting factual data , respondents are asked to fit themselves or their experiences into a category , creating nominal data , or they are asked for a number , most often ratio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are you married ? " . and ' Do You have arthritis ? " are examples of questions that provide nominal data . " How many times have ' you seen a doctor ? " " How old are you ? " , and ' What is your income ? " are examples of questions to which respondents are asked to provide real numbers for ratio data . <p> When gathering factual data , respondents may be asked for ordinal answers . For example , they may be asked to report their incomes in relatively large categories or to describe their behavior in nonnumerical terms ( " usually . occasionally , seldom , or never " ) . When respondents are asked to report factual events in ordinal terms , it is because great precision is not required by the researcher or because the task of reporting an exact number was considered too difficult ; ordinal classification seemed a more realistic task for a respondent . However , there usually is a real numerical basis underlying an ordinal answer to a factual question . " <p> The situation is somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been efforts over the years , first in the work of a psychophysical psychologists ( eg. , Thurstone , 1929 ) , to have people assign numbers to subjective states that met the assumptions of interval and ratio data , for the most part respondents are asked to provide nominal and ordinal data about subjective states . The nominal question is , " Into which category do your feelings , opinions , or perceptions fall ? " The ordinal question is " Where along this continuum do your feelings , opinions , or perceptions fall ? " <p> When designing a questionnaire , a basic task of the researcher is to decide what kind of measurement is desired . When that decision is made , there are some clear implications for the form in which the question will be asked . <h> Types of Questions <p> Survey questions can be classified roughly into two groups : those for which a list of acceptable responses is provided to the respondent ( closed questions ) and those for which the acceptable responses are not provided exactly to the respondent ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put people in unordered categories ( nominal data ) , the researcher has a choice about whether to ask an open or closed question . Virtually identical questions can be designed in either form . <h> Examples of open and closed forms <p> 5.13 What health conditions do you have ? ( Open ) 5.13a Which of the following conditions do you currently have ? ( READ LIST ) ( Closed ) 5.14 What do you consider to be the most important problem facing our country today ? ( Open ) 5.14a Here is a list of problems that many people in the country are concerned about . Which do you consider to be the most important problem facing our country today ? ( Closed ) <p> There are advantages to open questions . They permit the researcher to obtain answers that were unanticipated . They also may describe more closely the real views of the respondent . Third , and this is not a trivial point , respondents like the opportunity to answer some questions in their own words . To answer only by choosing a provided response and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's mind can be a frustrating experience . Finally , open questions are appropriate when the list of possible answers is longer than it is feasible to present to respondents . <p> Having said all this , closed questions are usually a more satisfactory way of creating data . There are three reasons for this : <p> The respondent can perform more reliably the task of answering the question when response alternatives are given . <p> The researcher can perform more reliably the task of interpreting the meaning of answers when the alternatives are given to the respondent ( Schuman &amp; Presser , 1981 ) . <p> When a completely open question is asked , many people give relatively rare answers that are not analytically useful . Providing respondents with a constrained number of categories increases the likelihood that there will be enough people in any given category to be analytically interesting . <p> Finally , if the researcher wants ordinal data , the categories must be provided to the respondent . One can not order responses reliably along a single continuum unless a set of permissible ordered answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task that is given to respondents when they are asked to perform an ordinal task is appropriate , since it is probably the most prevalent kind of measurement in survey research . <p> Figure 5.1 shows a continuum . In this case we are talking about having respondents make a rating of some sort , but the general approach applies to all ordinal questions . There is a dimension that is assumed by the researcher that goes from the most negative feelings possible to the most positive feelings possible . The way survey researchers get respondents into ordered categories is to put designations or labels on such a continuum . Respondents then are asked to consider the labels , consider their own feelings or opinions , and place themselves in the proper category . <p> There are two points worth making about the kinds of data that result from such questions . First , respondents will differ one from the other in their understanding of what the labels or categories mean . However , the only assumption that is necessary in order to make meaningful analyses is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " good " feel more positively than those who rate their feelings as " fair . " To the extent that people differ some in their understanding of and criteria for " good " and " fair , " there is unreliability in the measurement , but the measurement still may have meaning ( i.e. , correlate with the underlying feeling state that the researcher wants to measure ) . <p> Second , an ordinal scale measurement like this is relative . The distribution of people choosing a particular label or category depends on the particular scale that is presented . Consider the rating scale in Figure 5.1 again and consider two approaches to creating ordinal scales . In one case , the researcher used a three-point scale , " good , fair , or poor " . In the second case , the researcher used five descriptive words , " excellent , very good , good , fair , and poor " . When one compares the two scales , one can see that adding " excellent " and " very good " in all probability does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . Rather it changes the whole sense of the scale . People respond to the ' ordinal position of categories as well as to the descriptors . " Fair " almost certainly is further to the negative side of the continuum when it is the fourth point on the scale than when it is the second . Thus one would expect considerably more people to give a rating of " good " or better with the five-point scale than with the three-point scale . <p> Such scales are meaningful if used as they are supposed to be used : to order people . However , by itself a statement that some percentage of the population feels something is " good or better " is not appropriate because it implies that the population is being described in some absolute sense . The percentage would change if the question were different . Only comparative statements ( or statements about relationships ) are justifiable when one is using ordinal measures : <p> ( a ) Comparing answers to the same question across groups ; e.g. , 20 percent more of those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " good " or better ; or <p> ( b ) Comparing answers from comparable samples over time , e.g. , 10 percent more rate the candidate ' good ' or better in January than did so in November . <p> The same general comments apply to data obtained by having respondents order items . ( " Consider the schools , police services , and trash collection . Which is the most important city Service to you ? " ) The percentage giving any item top ranking , or the average ranking of an item , is completely dependent on the particular list provided . Comparisons between distributions when the alternatives have been changed at all are not meaningful . <h> Agree-Disagree Items : A Special Case <p> Agree-disagree items are very prevalent in the survey research field and therefore deserve special attention . One can see that the task that respondents are given in such items is different from that of placing themselves in an ordered category . The usual approach is to read a statement to respondents and ask them if they agree or disagree with that statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that portrayed in Figure 5.1 . Respondents locations on that continuum are calculated by figuring out whether they say they are very close to that statement ( by agreeing ) or saying their feelings are very far from where that statement is located ( by disagreeing ) . <p> The use of agree-disagree questions to order respondents has two main potential limits . <p> First , a statement , in order to he interpretable , must be located at the end of a continuum . For example , if a statement was to be rated that said " The schools are fair , " presumably a point in the middle of a continuum , a respondent could disagree either because he rated the schools as " good " or because he rated them as " poor " . The similar limitation is that it is very common for the statements used as stimuli for agree-disagree questions to have more than one dimension , ( i.e. , to be double-barrelled ) , in which case the answer can not be interpreted . The two statements below provide examples of double- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this country will probably be strong and prosperous . <p> Problems . It obviously is possible for someone to have the view that the country will be strong but not prosperous or vice-versa . Since prosperity and strength do not go together necessarily , a respondent may have trouble knowing what to do . <p> 5.16 With economic conditions the way they are these days , it really is n't fair to have more than one or two children . <p> Problems . If a person does not happen to think that economic conditions are terrible ( which the question imposes as an assumption person does not believe that economic conditions of whatever kind have any implications for family size , but if that person happens to think one or two children is a good target for a family , it is not easy to answer the question . <p> FEELING ABOUT SOMETHING <p> EXTREMELY POSITIVE EXTREMELY NEGATIVE <p> TWO-CATEGORY SCALE <p> GOOD NOT GOOD <p> THREE-CATEGORY SCALE <p> GOOD FAIR POOR <p> ' <p> FOUR-CATEGORY SCALE <p> VERY GOOD GOOD FAIR POOR <p> FIVE-CATEGORY SCALE <p> EXCELLENT VERY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The problem then is knowing what the respondent agreed to , if he or she agreed . Asking two or three questions at once and having imbedded assumptions in questions are very common problems with the agree-disagree format . The agree-disagree format appears to he a rather simple way to construct questionnaires . In fact , to use this form to provide reliable , useful measures is not easy and requires a great deal of care and attention . In many cases , researchers would have more reliable and interpretable measures if they used a different question form . <h> Increasing the validity of factual reporting <p> When a researcher asks a factual question of a respondent , the goal is to have the respondent report with perfect accuracy , that is , give the same answer that the researcher would have given if the researcher had access to the information needed to answer the question . There is a rich methodological literature on the reporting of factual material . Reporting has been compared against records in a variety of areas , in particular the reporting of economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good summary ) . <p> Respondents answer many questions accurately . For example , over 90 percent of overnight hospital stays within six months of an interview are reported ( Cannell &amp; Fowler , 1965 ) . However , how well people report depends on both what they are being asked and how the question is asked . There are four basic reasons why respondents report events with less than perfect accuracy : <p> They do not know the information . <p> They can not recall it , although they do know it . <p> They do not understand the question . <p> They do not want to report the answer in the interview context . <p> There are several steps that the researcher can take to combat each of these potential problems . Let us review these . <h> Lack of Knowledge <p> Since the main point of doing a survey is to get information from respondents that is not available in other ways , most surveys deal with questions to which respondents know the answers . The main reason that a researcher would get inaccurate reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is asking one household member for information that another household member has . In health surveys , for example , it is common to use a household informant to report on visits to the doctor , hospitalisations. and illnesses for all household members . Economic and housing surveys often ask for a household respondent to report information for the household as a whole . <p> If the information exists in the household , but simply not with the person that the researcher wants to be the main respondent , the solutions are either to eliminate proxy reporting or to provide an opportunity for respondents to consult with other family members . For example , the National Crime Survey conducted by the Census Bureau obtains reports of household crimes from a single household informant , but in addition asks each household adult directly about personal crimes such as robbery . If the basic interview is to be carried out in person , costs for interviews with other members of the household can be reduced - administered forms are left to be filled out by absent household members , or if secondary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the main respondent to report the desired information as fully as possible for all household members . Then mail the respondent a summary for verification , permitting consultation with other family members ( see Cannell &amp; Fowler , 1965 ) . <p> Finally , it sometimes is worth asking household members to designate the best informed person to answer the questions . The house-wife is not always the most knowledgeable about health , and the husband is not always the most knowledgeable about finances . People themselves often can do a better job of choosing the best respondent for a particular topic than can the researcher . <h> Recall <p> Studies of the reporting of known hospital stays clearly show the significance of memory in the reporting of events . As the time between the interview and a hospitalisation event increases , the probability of it being reported in an interview decreases . In a like way , short hospitalisations are less likely to be reported than long ones . Memory decays in predictable ways ; the minor and distant events are more difficult to conjure up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to reduce the impact of memory decay on the reporting of factual events . Five possible methods are as follows : <p> Reduce the period of time about which respondents are asked to report . There is great value in having respondents report for as long a period of time as possible , because there is more information obtained in that way . However . the longer the reporting period , the less accurate the reporting ( Cannell &amp; Fowler , 1965 ) . <p> Memory is improved by asking more questions . By asking more than one question about events , more time will elapse for the respondent to think . In addition , questions can be designed that will stimulate associations , thereby helping the recall process . Thus the number of health conditions reported is increased by asking about visits to doctors , taking medications , and missing work ( Madow , 1963 ) . <p> A second chance to think about the answers given also can stimulate memory . The technique suggested above of sending the respondent a summary of answers for verification has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for the same information twice in the same interview can help recall . <p> A reinterview procedure , interviewing the same respondent twice or even more times , is another good way to deal with problems of recall . One key problem with recalling events over time is setting them in the proper time period . An initial interview can serve as an anchorpoint for people 's recall . The previous interview serves as a boundary in their minds . In addition , the researcher can check to make sure that events reported in Interview 1 were not repeated in Interview 2 . A final advantage of the panel approach is that respondents are sensitised to the kinds of events that will be asked about , thereby further improving their recall . <p> Carrying that last point a step further , one way that researchers have dealt with the reporting of minor events that are hard to remember is by asking people to keep a diary . Consumption pat- terns , minor deviations from good health , and patterns of expenditure are all difficult for people to recall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents who do not keep their diaries up to date conscientiously report considerably better than they would have had they not been keeping a diary ( Sudman &amp; Bradburn , 1974 ) . <p> It should be noted that a trade-off with both the reinterview and diary strategies is that it is more difficult to convince people to keep a diary or be interviewed several times than it is to get them to agree to a one-time interview . Hence the values of improved reporting have to be weighed against the possible biases resulting from sample attrition . <h> Social Desirability <p> There are certain facts or events that respondents rather would not report accurately in an interview . Conditions that have some degree of social undesirability such as mental illness and venereal disease are underreported significantly more than other conditions ( Madow , 1963 . , Densen et al. , 1963 ) . Hospitalisation associated with conditions that are particularly threatening , either because of the possible stigmas that may be attached to them or due to their life threatening nature , are reported at a lower rate than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimates of alcohol consumption strongly suggest underreporting , although the reporting problems may be a combination of recall difficulties and respondents ' concerns about social norms regarding drinking . Arrest and bankruptcy are other events that have been found to he underreported consistently , but which seem unlikely to have been forgotten ( Locander et al. , 1976 ) . <p> There are probably limits to what people will report in a standard interview setting . If a researcher realistically expects someone to admit something that is very embarrassing or illegal , extraordinary efforts are needed to convince respondents that the risks are minimal and the reasons for taking a risk are substantial . The following are some of the steps that a researcher might particularly consider when sensitive questions are being asked ( also see Sudman &amp; Bradburn , 1982 ) . <p> Minimise a sense of judgment ; maximise the importance of accuracy . Careful attention to the introduction and vocabulary that might imply that the researcher would value negatively certain answers is important . Researchers always have to be aware of the fact that respondents are having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior of the interviewer if there is one , constitutes all the information the respondent has about the kind of interpretation the researcher will give to the answers . Therefore , the researcher needs to be very careful about the kind of cues the respondent is receiving and about the type of context in which respondents feel their answers will be interpreted . <p> Use self-administered questions . Although the data are not conclusive , there is evidence that telephone interviews are more subject to social-desirability bias than personal interviews ( e.g. , Hendon et al. , 1977 , Mangione et al. , 1982 ) , there is also evidence that having respondents answer questions in a self-administered form rather than having an interviewer ask the questions may produce less social-desirability bias for some items ( e.g. , Hochstim , 1967 ) . Such a consideration might lead one to think of a mail survey or group administration . A personal interview survey also can be combined usefully with self-administration : A respondent simply is given a set of questions to answer in a booklet as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all surveys promise respondents that answers will be treated confidentially and that no one outside the research staff will ever be able to associate individual respondents with their answers . Respondents usually are reassured of such facts by interviewers in the introduction and in advance letters , if there are any ; these may be reinforced by signed commitments from the researchers . For surveys on particularly sensitive or personal subjects , special steps to ensure that respondents can not be linked to their answers ( such as the random response techniques described by Greenberg et al. , 1969 ) may be used . Again it is important to emphasise that the limit of survey research is what people am willing to tell researchers under the conditions of data collection designed by the researcher . There are some questions that probably can not be asked of probability samples without extraordinary efforts ( e.g. , Kinsey et a. , 1948 ) . However , some of the procedures discussed in this section , such as trying to create a neutral context for answers and emphasising the importance of accuracy and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedures for the most innocuous of questions . Any question , no matter how innocent it may seem , may embarrass somebody in the sample . It is best to design all phases of a survey instrument with a sensitivity to reducing the effects of social desirability and embarrassment on any answers people may give . <h> Increasing validity of subjective questions <p> As discussed above , the validity of subjective questions has a different meaning than the validity of objective questions . There is no external criterion . One only can estimate the validity of a subjective measure by the extent to which answers are associated in expected ways with the answers to other questions or other characteristics of the individual to which it should be related ( see Turner &amp; Martin , 1984 , for an extensive discussion of issues affecting the validity of subjective measures ) . <p> There basically are only three steps to the improvement of validity of subjective measures : <p> Make the questions as reliable as possible . Review the sections on the reliability of questions , dealing with ambiguity of wording , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do everything possible to get questions that will mean the same thing to all respondents . To the extent that subjective measures are unreliable , their validity will be reduced . A special issue is the reliability of ordinal scales , which are dominant as measure of subjective states . The response alternatives offered must be unidimensional ( deal with only one issue ) and monotonic ( presented in order , without inversion ) . <h> Problematic scales <p> 5. 16 How would you rate your job-very rewarding , rewarding but stressful , not very rewarding but not stressful , or not rewarding at all ? <p> 5.17 How would you rate your job-very rewarding , somewhat rewarding , rewarding , or not rewarding at all ? <p> Question 5.16 has two scaled properties - rewardingness and stress - that need not be related . All the alternatives are not played out . Question 5.16 should be made into two questions if rewardingness and stress of jobs are both to be measured . In 5.17 , some would see " rewarding " as more positive than " somewhat rewarding " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both of these problems are common and should be avoided . <p> When putting people into ordered classes along a continuum , it probably is better to have more categories than fewer . There is a limit , however , in the precision of discrimination that respondents can exercise in giving ordered ratings . When the number of categories exceeds the respondents ' ability to discriminate their feelings , numerous categories simply produce unreliable " noise . " However , the validity of a measure will be increased to the extent that real variation among respondents is measured . <p> Ask multiple questions , with different question forms , that measure the same subjective state ; combine the answers into a scale . The answers to all questions potentially are influenced both by the subjective state to be measured and by specific features of the respondent or of the questions . Some respondents avoid extreme categories ; some tend to agree more than disagree ; others do just the opposite . Multiple questions help even out response idiosyncrasies and improve the validity of the measurement process ( Cronbach , 1951 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of subjective measures is their relativity . Distributions can be compared only when the stimulus situation is the same . Small changes in wording , changing the number of alternatives offered , and even changing the position of a question in a questionnaire can make a major difference in how people answer . ( See Turner &amp; Martin , 1984 ; Schuman &amp; Presser , 1981 ; and Sudman &amp; Bradburn , 1982 for numerous examples of factors that affect response distributions . ) The distribution of answers to a subjective question can not be interpreted directly ; it only has meaning when differences between samples exposed to the same questions are compared or when patterns of association among answers are studied . <h> Error in perspective <p> A defining property of social surveys is that answers to questions are used as measures . The extent to which those answers are good measures is obviously a critical dimension of the quality of survey estimates . <p> Questions can be poor measures because they are unreliable ( producing erratic results ) or because they are biased , producing estimates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as when drunk driving arrests are underreported ) . <p> We know quite a bit about how to make questions reliable . The principles outlined in this chapter to increase reliability are probably sound . Although other points might be added to the list , creating unambiguous questions that provide consistent measures across respondents is always a constructive step for good measurement . <p> The validity issue is more complex . In a sense , each variable to be measured requires research to identify the best set of questions to measure it and to produce estimates of how valid the resulting measure is . Many of the suggestions to improve reporting in this chapter emerged from a twenty-year program to evaluate and improve the measurement of health-related variables ( Cannell et al. , . 1977a , 1977b ) . There are many areas in which a great deal more work on validation is needed . <p> A third issue is the credibility of a question ( or series ) as a measure . It always is legitimate to ask researchers for their evidence about how well a question ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too often , researchers make little effort to evaluate their measures ; they assume , and ask their readers to assume , that answers mean what they ' look like " they mean and measure what the researcher thinks they are supposed to measure . To rely on so-called " face validity " of questions is not acceptable practice . <p> Researchers should build explicit efforts to assess the validity of their key measures into their analyses . As standard practice , patterns of association related to validity can be calculated and presented in an appendix . <p> Reducing measurement error through better question design is one of the least costly ways to improve survey estimates . For any survey , it is reasonable to attend to careful questionnaire design and pretesting ( which are discussed in Chapter 6 ) and making use of the existing research literature about how to measure what is to be measured . Also , building a literature over time in which the validity of measures has been evaluated and reported is much needed . Such evaluations are now the exception ; they should become routine .

In this way , these theories see internal states of being of real importance in the learning process . <p> Social learning theorists claim that they way that people think , plan , perceive and believe is an important part of learning . They also point out that many experiments are carried out on animals and that therefore the laws of learning they discover , whilst having some relevance to humans , are not complete or complex enough to account for more complex human behaviour and learning . Social learning theorists also claim that behaviourism ignores the social dimensions of learning , treating us as though we are individual animals . In humans , however , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal can not choose its environment and the environment does n't  changes as a result of the animals presence -as it does with humans . <p> Social Reinforcement : A particularly powerful form of reinforcement which shapes human personality and behaviour is social e.g. approval , touch , smiling , encouragement , etc . <p> Self Reinforcement : Refers to both the act of giving ones self actual real life rewards for certain acts ( e.g. If I study for one hour , I can have that piece of cake. ) , as well as giving oneself internal positive self-talk and feelings , etc. in response to a desired behaviour ( or likewise negative self-talk in response to non-desired behaviour ) <p> Vicarious Emotional Arousal : The experience of empathy when observing someone elses situation creates an opportunity for emotional conditioning based on the actual behavioural conditioning of the person being observed . <p> Vicarious Reinforcement : Observing other peoples behaviours being rewarded or punished leads to vicarious reinforcement of those behaviours in an observer , e.g. seeing people who train hard win gold medals at the olympics reinforces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not restricted to specific situations where semantic links or generalizations can be made to similar situations . e.g. having an unpleasant experience going to a football match may also make someone less likely to attend a cricket match <p> Rule-based Learning : People learn sets of principles or rules which can be applied across situations ( e.g. overregularisation or overgeneralisation ) . <h> Bandura ( 1971 ; 1977 ) <p> Bandura view of social learning builds directly upon Rotters work . Bandura does not give as much attention to individual differences as did Rotter but pays more attention to the social nature of learning and the way that people interact with situations in their lives . <p> Bandura called Rotters expectancies Efficacy Expectations = perceived nonconditional probability that you can do something . Rotters expectancy is a belief about the reinforcement/ Banduras is a belief about self , and is thus a step further from behaviourism . Bandura stresses a match between ability and efficacy expectation leads to a more productive , rational and fulfilling life . <p> e.g. Self efficacy has been found to be associated with positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavioural problems generally have a low self efficacy e.g. therapy works if it restores/creates a persons confidence in his/her ability to function . The individuals sense of self -efficacy <p> MOTIVATION : Is the observer motivated to perform the behaviour . What are the consequences associated with the behaviour for the model ? Vicarious reinforcement influences whether the behaviour performed ( in Bobo Doll case ( 1965 ) , particularly punishment of the model ) What are the likely outcomes for the observer ? <p> Attributes of the Observer : <p> * People are more like to imitate when they : <p> * lack self esteem <p> * are incompetent <p> * highly dependent <p> * have been rewarded previously for conforming <p> * are highly motivated to master a desired behaviour <p> * substantial short or long term rewards <p> Modelling &amp; sex role acquisition . Some studies have shown that children model same-sex parents/characters more than different sex parents/characters . <p> And of course there 's still a lot of social reinforcement for gender-specific behaviours . Little girls are often told how sweet they are when they comply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys are encouraged and praised to help dad with the car and go out and kick a football with dad.As with other learning , this sex-role acquisition can be strongly influenced by portrayals of males and females in the media . <p> Modelling &amp; Aggression : modelling of aggression occurs e.g.:via observing aggression within the home ; via observing aggression on TV . Of course on television this violence is often not just permitted but also rewarded ( video games ) and this results in the promotion of beliefs that aggression is an appropriate way to deal with conflict . It does n't  matter whether the model is in real life , on television and is a real person or an animated character ! <h> Intervention Approaches <p> Inappropriate and maladaptive behaviours can be be the result of prior reinforcement patterns i.e. inappropriate behaviour has been conditioned . Maladaptive behaviour can have been learned from models . People can have inappropriate or maladaptive expectancies for their behaviour e.g. always expecting to do badly in exams or always expecting to be REWARDED for bullying . People can suffer from skills deficits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate skills . <p> All these things can be reversed by the same processes . Thus new behaviour can be conditioned via reinforcing appropriate behaviour ; by modelling appropriate behaviour ( often used for teaching social skills and assertiveness for example ) . People can be helped to increase their expectancies via observational learning as well . When a model shows they can overcome fear for example this helps the observer overcome their fear . Furthermore self-instructions can help people change their expectancies about outcomes . Cognitive behaviour therapy works on the assumption that many problems stem from ineffective and disruptive thoughts that slip into peoples minds . People often tell themselves they ca n't cope ; they 're no good etc . They often expect bad things . The goal of CBT is to get the client to recognize instances of maladaptive thinking and to make suitable adjustments . ( Test anxiety : Prepare for the stressor : plan for the test , no negative self-statements , do n't  worry . Confront and cope with the stressor : Take it one step at a time break , remember to use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and keep focused on the bit at hand . After the coping attempt : pat yourself on the back for your progress . Tell yourself you can do it .

@@41691558 @1691558/ <h> Introduction to Cognitive Perspectives on Personality <p> Last updated : 21 Oct 2003 <p> The cognitive completes a return to the material focused on by introspectionists ( e.g. , Wundt , 1870 's ) , that is , the actual content of mind . The new cognitive psychology evolves most directly from social learning theory and extensions of behavioral theory . It also has clear links to humanistic psychology in its focus on the " information stored about the self " and in suggesting considerable capacity for change in personality and mental health by altering thinking patterns . <p> The cognitive perspective , interestingly , has evolved hand in hand in the development of computers over since the mid-1950 's and according to many in psychology has become the most significant paradigm in psychology . <p> Essentially , the cognitive perspective of personality is the idea that people are who they are because of the way they think , including how information is attended to , perceived , analyzed , interpreted , encoded and retrieved . People tend to have habitual thinking patterns which are characterized as as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic cognitive patterns . <p> The cognitive perspective is that personality is a person 's mental organization . In order to cope with all the information you receive from the world , including sensory information , you need to cope with , integrate and organise all the information the world throws at you . From this point of view , you are : <p> What you THINK <p> The way you PROCESS INFORMATION ( including attending to , perceiving , interpreting , encoding and retrieving of information ) ; <p> The way you SELF-REGULATE via cognitive monitoring and adjusting thoughts and behaviors . We are HOMEOSTATIC psychobiological creatures who try to self-regulate in order to progress towards GOALS . <p> The cognitive perspective is also often known as the information-processing model , with the computer serving as a convenient metaphor . Basically , the computer 's program is equivalent to the ways a human processes information . In cognitive psychology , these " programs " include methods for attending , perceiving , representing , encoding , retrieving , and decision-making and problem-solving . <p> A particular strength of cognitive theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspectives , thus there are also many hybrid cognitive theories , e.g. , cognitive-behavioral theory , social cognitive theory . <h> Further background to the cognitive perspective <p> The cognitive approach is the outgrowth of Rotters and Banduras social-learning perspectives . Recall that Banduras approach has come to be called social cognitive theory . Banduras beliefs about the environment and expectations about the self are essentially cognitive concepts . <p> Another important influence on the cognitive perspective is the phenomenological approach , especially George Kellys personal constructs theory . Kelly emphasised the way a persons concepts for thinking about the world shape his or her personality and behaviour ( Kelly greatly influenced Bandura ) . <p> The cognitive approach also draws on Freuds notions concerning levels of consciousness . The preconscious and the unconscious are receiving increasing attention from many proponents of the cognitive approach to personality . 
@@41691559 @1691559/ <h> Outdoor Education : Definition and Philosophy <p> There is no nationally standardized outdoor education curriculum and no nationally standardized measure of outdoor education competency or knowledge . Outdoor education programs are sponsored by elementary and secondary schools , colleges and universities , youth camps , municipal recreation departments , and private entrepreneurs . They exist in every geographic location and are administered by people of widely varied backgrounds . There is no single body of outdoor professionals in outdoor education because the field transcends school boundaries into recreation departments , youth-serving agencies , conservation organizations , resource management agencies , and many other facets of society . As a result , outdoor education is viewed from different perspectives . <p> WHAT IS A SUGGESTED DEFINITION OF OUTDOOR EDUCATION ? <p> While there are many definitions of outdoor education , the most comprehensive one seems to be , " Outdoor education is education ' in ' , ' about ' , and ' for ' the out-of-doors . " <p> This definition tells the place , the topic , and the purpose of outdoor education . ' In ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting from a school yard in an industrial neighborhood to a remote wilderness setting , in swamps , meadows , forests , shores , lakes , prairies , deserts , estuaries , and all other biomes . Outdoor education often takes place on a walk around the block , or on a visit to a cemetery , a gravel pit , or an urban renewal project . It can happen on the concrete of a playground , in the weeds of a vacant lot , on the fringe of a sewage treatment plant , at a city zoo , on a forest trail , or in a national park . These kinds of locations are conducive to first-hand experiences , to direct contact with the topic , and to participant interaction and socialization . <p> ' About ' explains that the topic is the outdoors itself and the cultural aspects related to the natural environment . You may teach about mathematics , biology , geology , communication , history , political science , art , physical skills , or endurance , but learning occurs through the context of the outdoors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the basic areas of study , but students may learn and practice the outdoor activities people pursue during leisure time , or may investigate human alterations of an ecosystem ; nevertheless , the educational topic is related to the natural environment . In the broadest terms , the topic is the interrelationship of the human being and the natural resources upon which societies depend , with the goal of stewardship in mind . <p> Cultural aspects include learning social movements and history through discovering abandoned farms or mills , by analyzing dates and inscriptions on tombstones and identifying the rocks from which they were quarried , or by comparing native plants with those introduced from the Old World as landscape or garden species around old homes . <p> Students can learn the influence of native people on the land , follow the trails and rivers of explorers and settlers , and develop knowledge and appreciation for cultural heritage as it relates to the land . Culture also includes social issues and decisions that alter or determine utilization of natural resources . <p> ' For ' tells us that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , psycho-motor , and affective domains of learning for the sake of the ecosystem itself . It means understanding , using , and appreciating the natural resources for their perpetuation . <p> ' Environmental Education ' refers to education about the total environment , including population growth , pollution , resource use and misuse , urban and rural planning , and modern technology with its demands upon natural resources . Environmental education is all-encompassing , while outdoor education is seen by some to relate to natural resources and not to include the wide sense of the world environment . Many people , however , think of outdoor education in its broadest sense and prefer the term outdoor/environmental education . <p> ' Conservation Education ' is the wise use of natural resources . It is not usually concerned with preservation , recreation , or human relations and as such is more narrow than outdoor education . The use of this term has decreased since the 1960s . <p> ' Resident Outdoor School ' is the process of taking children to a residential camp during school time for a period of usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum through learning in the outdoors . This process was originally called camping education . <p> ' Outdoor Education ' means a broad spectrum of outdoor activities participated in during leisure time purely for pleasure or some other intrinsic value . Included are hiking , swimming , boating , winter sports , cycling , and camping . <p> ' Adventure Education ' refers to activities into which are purposely built elements perceived by the participants as being dangerous . Adventure activities include such things as rope courses , white water rafting , mountaineering , and rock climbing ( under qualified instruction ) . <p> ' Experiential Education ' refers to learning by doing or experience . Many experiential education activities are synonymous with adventure activities and outdoor pursuits ; however , experiential education can also mean any form of pragmatic educational experience . <p> ' Environmental Interpretation ' is a term usually associated with visitor centers administered by national parks or forest service centers . The term refers to a technique used to help visitors understand the meanings of the phenomena on display , while simmultaneously whetting the curiosity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature Recreation ' are learning or leisure activities related to natural resources . The terms were used from the 1920s to the 1950s and were usually isolated , individual activities using natural resources for equipment and facilities , and involving knowledge of nature . <p> WHAT IS A RECOMMENDED PHILOSOPHY OF OUTDOOR EDUCATION ? <p> When analyzed , the philosophy for outdoor education may be based on four premises : <p> 1 . A prime goal of outdoor education is to teach a commitment to human responsibility for stewardship or care of the land , to treat the land and all its resources with respect at all times and on all occasions . 2 . Related to the goal of a land ethic or commitment to stewardship must be the belief in the importance of knowing certain facts or concepts . The cognitive purpose of outdoor education must be that of the interrelationship of all facets of the ecosystem . The understanding of basic ecological , sociological , and cultural principles is prerequisite to the commitment to an ethic of land stewardship . Concurrently , outdoor education does not mandate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make choices based on facts . It recognizes the difficulty in making choices relative to ecological matters , and prepares people to choose carefully after weighing the impact of the action on the environment , culture , and humanity . 3 . The third aspect of outdoor education philosophy relates to the perspective of the human being in the outdoor environment . Not only do we need to know the natural environment for the survival of the species , we need to know it as a medium through which we spend many hours of leisure . That leisure is enhanced when the quality of the outdoor recreation experience is directly related to the quantity of the knowledge about the out-of-doors. 4 . A fourth philosophical belief is that outdoor education is a continual educational experience . It is not just one field trip , one week at outdoor school , or even a once-a-year event . It must be taught at all levels and pursued throughout life . <p> WHERE CAN OUTDOOR EDUCATION PROGRAMS BE FOUND ? <p> Programs in learning about the outdoors occur at all levels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in elementary schools . There may be short or long field trips , or fifth and sixth graders may spend 5 days at a resident outdoor school . Some schools own and operate gardens , mini-farms , or wood lots . High school curricula may include natural resource-oriented programs , or programs involving use of the outdoors for leisure pursuits administered through physical education departments . <p> Municipal recreation departments and youth serving agencies include outdoor education in their offerings , and membership organizations such as the Audubon Society and National Wildlife Recreation administer 1-day to 2-week programs for youth and adults . Many colleges offer outdoor education courses through departments of education , or physical education and leisure studies , while resource managers sponsor workshops or seminars on natural resources . The government--through the U.S. Forest Service , National Park Service , and other agencies--sponsors outdoor education programs for leaders and for youth . <p> WHO CAN PROFIT FROM OUTDOOR EDUCATION ? <p> Like most learning , outdoor education can be a life-long endeavor . All ages , abilities , socio-economic sectors--all people , in short--can benefit from outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know about the world around them . Not only the learner but also society benefits . The informed voter and citizen can make a bigger impact on social issues involving natural resources if there has been careful education . Outdoor education can encompass many subjects and varied styles of learning . Through exposure to environmental awareness techniques , the right-brained learner can profit . Through learning ecological principles , the left-brained learner can benefit , and through combining the two , all children can acquire a holistic look at the subject utilizing learning styles of both hemispheres . <p> WHAT ARE SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT PEOPLE DO IN OUTDOOR EDUCATION ? <p> In a progressive manner , the following are a few outdoor education activities : <p> --Perceiving nature through the familiar ( color , shapes , patterns , lines ) --Using all five senses to become environmentally alert and aware --Learning ecological principles ( for example , that the sun is the source of all energy ) and where they are demonstrated --Studying plants , animals , soil , water , air , and their interdependence --Deciphering the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How many people can this stream serve ?

For example , if I invest my money , what is risk ( likelihood ) that I will lose my money ? If I go rockclimbing , what is the risk that I will lose my life or suffer pain ? We can refer to this " risk of loss " as R- . <p> But " risk " is also about gain ( R+ ) . Why do you gamble on the possibilities of life ?

Because you seek R+ possibilities , or positive aspects of risk , such as the thrill of speed or satisfaction of getting somewhere on time . Note : I initially learned about this useful R- and R+ conceptualization from an article by Rick Curtis , called " Building a Risk Management Machine : The SafeCon System " . <p> R- and R+ are intertwined , in a holistic fashion . One can not have R- without R+ , and vice-versa . And as one changes , the other changes . However , there is chaotic nature to R- and R+ , so it can seem at times that the balance is out of kilter . <p> Western society seems to have become increasingly obsessed with R- , the risk of loss , during the 20th century , particularly the last 10 to 20 years . The increasingly litigious nature of Western culture is a clear example , with many landmark cases shaping a new societal understanding of risk . For example , in a recent case in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sued a local council for negligence because he went to a natural beach , dived in and broke his neck . The court agreed that the council should have provided signage warning him of this danger . <p> Such cases are now tracked and , with a somewhat grim sense of humor , the most outrageous are given a " Stella Award " . The Stella Awards were inspired by Stella Liebeck . In 1992 , Stella , then 79 , spilled a cup of McDonald 's coffee onto her lap , burning herself . A New Mexico jury awarded her $2.9 million in damages , but that 's not the whole story . Stella has become an American icon . Rightly or wrongly , she is a symbol of the American Tort system gone wrong , and most have heard of her case -- and have an opinion on it . The Stella Awards reports real case stories to dramatically illustrate the extent to which litigation is rising to epidemic proportations . Fortunately , there is also a backlash . For example , recent law changes in New South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury more difficult -- as of November , 2003 , the changes have n't , however , been tested in court . <p> Much risk of loss is seemingly unavoidable or inherent in living -- e.g. , a lightening strike . Other risks -- e.g. , catching a disease , may or may not seem avoidable , depending on your locus of control , which is the extent to which you attribute what happens in your life to your own actions or other forces , e.g. , God , Fate , Others . ( Go to a tutorial about Locus of Control ) . <p> Less talked about are the risks associated with not taking risks . For example , many people looking back on their lives wish they 'd taken more rather than less risks , or at least wish they 'd been more wise in their selection of risks . Interestingly , people who survive a major encounter with the threat of death , often report increases in their quality of life , often including taking more risks to focus on what they genuinely feel is important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountaineer and Outward Bound pioneer , was once asked by a fearful mother if he could guarantee her son 's safety on an outdoor program .

But , he added , that by sheltering her son from risk , the mother would be guaranteeing the death of her son 's soul . <p> During the 20th century , industrialized society bred a culture of of increasing fear . For example , during the cold war and the build-up of nuclear arsenal , a whole generation was profoundly affected by the fear of nuclear annihiliation . Then since the World Trade Tower destruction on Sept. 11 , 2001 , a new wave of fear of terrorist attacks spread through the Western world . <p> But if we get scared off and succumb to anxiety , seeking retreat into the fantasy of safety , we forgo potential growth opportunities . <p> We pay a heavy price for our fear of failure .

The most profound knowledge about risk is personal understanding of how to use it to good effect in one 's life . <p> Psychological research has found that some people are inherently more risk-taking than others ( e.g. , those attracted to extreme sports ) . Unfortunately , in modern Western society , there is a currently a lack of readily available , healthy risk taking models and opportunities through which people can practice risk-taking .

This paper reviews the current state of research on a wide range of school outdoor education programs . The surprising lack of good quality studies prompted this paper to emphasize a rationale for research and evaluation and to provide strategies for implementing more systematic study of outdoor education programs . <h> Introduction <p> The original aim of this paper was to answer some fundamental questions , including : <p> What outcomes do students achieve through outdoor education programs ? <p> Do the outcomes justify the program costs ( compared to the outcomes achieved by other educational approaches ) ? <p> What are the critical factors which determine outcomes for individual students ? <p> How have outdoor educators applied research and evaluation to the ongoing improvement and development of outdoor education programs for school students ? <p> Unfortunately , there is a surprising paucity in the quality and variety of research and evaluation studies in this field . There are some notable exceptions , however these studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer the questions posed . Consequently , the focus of this paper is to : <p> provide an overview of the claims , aims , and evaluation practices used by outdoor education programs with school students ; <p> present the research trends and highlight some relevant studies which point towards the positive and negative potentials of outdoor education for school students , and <p> discuss some strategies for , and benefits of , overcoming the barriers to research and evaluation in outdoor education . <h> Claims , aims and evaluation practices <p> There is no shortage of literature which makes substantial claims for the educational achievements of experiential outdoor programs in schools ( e.g. , Keighley , 1985a , b ; Mitchell , 1992 ; Payne , 1993 ; Royce , 1987 ; Thomson , 1990 ) . These claims range from the global and comprehensive , for example " that outdoor education is a panacea for ills which pervade our contemporary educational and societal systems " ( Gray &amp; Perusco , 1993 , p.20 ) , to extensive lists of specific physical , social , intellectual , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoor education programs is self-evident and they require no further justification or proof . This position tends to be held by outdoor instructors and enthusiasts . For others , a systematic and rigorous approach is required to understand the processes and outcomes of outdoor education . This position tends to be taken by funding agencies , researchers , academics , some school principals , and a minority of outdoor educators . Clearly , it is also the point of view expressed in this paper . <p> In attempting to review the evaluation literature , it is important to establish a picture of the range of aims for outdoor education programs with school students . <p> McRae ( 1990b ) conducted a survey of outdoor educators in twenty-five schools in the Australian Capital Territory , reporting on their assumptions about outdoor education and the objectives of their programs . He ranked and categorized the stated objectives of the outdoor education programs ( see Table 1 ) . Three out of every five programs had objectives relating to the enhancement of personal qualities and capacities and of relations with other persons1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social objectives were intended even when they were not stated in curriculum documents . It was thought that many outdoor education teachers considered that " it was not necessary to state the obvious " ( McRae , 1990b , p.25 ) . <p> Given the range of objectives found by McRaes ( 1990b ) study of outdoor education programs , the next question is " How do outdoor education programs evaluate their objectives ? " <p> Chenery and Hammerman ( 1985 ) surveyed residential outdoor education centres in the United States about their evaluation practices . They found that " observation of the program " and " group discussions with participants " were used as evaluation tools in 90% and 79% of centres respectively . The predominant use of these evaluation methods is consistent with the lack of written research and evaluation . While sitting in a group discussing opinions and feelings play an important role for participants in most outdoor education programs , outdoor educators need to be wary of using the same methodology for the tasks of program evaluation and program development . This is an important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to confuse their medium with their method . The medium may well be experiential learning , but the method needs to be a carefully planned , delivered and evaluated educational process . <p> In 1990 , McIntyre made the optimistic observation that " the Australian ( and New Zealand ) scene is beginning to move from its previous fascination with program description , and exhortation , to an empirical stage which attempts to examine the process of outdoor education and its impact on participants " ( p.230 ) . Unfortunately the field is still characterised by a potted history of studies of varying quality and has yet to build a comprehensive and rigorous body of research-based knowledge . <p> Despite the lack of systematic evaluation , the prevalence of outdoor education programs in our schools appears to be flourishing . This state of affairs is , however , far from ideal . In an industry experiencing rapid increases in competition , outdoor education providers would do well to take it upon themselves to invest in research and evaluation practices , if only for the bottom line sake of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the onus upon themselves to evaluate their programs , the demand will soon come from their clients . Increasing pressure has been placed on schools in the 1990s to educate the " whole " student . As Beane ( 1991 ) observes , " the question is not whether schools should enhance students self-esteem , but how they propose to do so " ( p.25 ) . Not only are schools asked to improve self-esteem , but it is " only by evaluating the effectiveness of self-esteem activities that ... school personnel can be assured their interventions are on target " ( Scott , Murray , Mertens , &amp; Dustin , 19996 , p.293 ) . The lack of evaluation is starting to work against outdoor education , for example Whitehead ( 1992 ) observed that " while camping programs are entrenched in the fabric of most schools , a few are tentatively examining whether to have a camping program at all " ( p.25 ) . <p> School authorities are perfectly justified in applying pressures for results to outdoor education providers . It is the client-driven and funding-driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have largely motivated much larger bodies of research in these fields . The problem for outdoor education providers is that unless they take the initiative to introduce and use appropriate performance indicators , school authorities will soon impose their own evaluation agendas . <h> Trends and highlights <p> Barret and Greenaway ( 1995 , p.53 ) recently critiqued research on outdoor adventure for young peoples personal and social development . Commenting on research outside the United Kingdom , they reported the following weaknesses : <p> little attention is given to young peoples own accounts and perspectives ; <p> much research is of a one-off nature and there is a dearth of coordinated research programs ; <p> identified outcomes are assumed to be caused by the adventure ingredient of outdoor adventure with a consequent failure to recognise the significance of other ingredients ; <p> much of the research can not be generalized to other situations because it is focused on specific programs ; <p> there is a lack of long term studies ; <p> there is an absence of research examining the failure of particular outdoor adventure experiences ; <p> there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency among researchers to write for an academic audience <p> many studies are flawed by low questionnaire rates , small sample sizes , a lack of basic contextual or statistical information , or an absence of suitable control or comparison groups . <p> Bearing the harsh but fair criticisms of Barret and Greenaway ( 1995 ) in mind , we can examine trends and highlights in the research literature , and look towards a focus for future efforts . <p> Outcome studies on outdoor education programs for school students other than Outward Bound are more scarce , particularly in Australia . Of note are studies by McIntyre ( 1987 ) on primary school students , McRae ( 1990a ) and Cope ( 1995 ) on high school students , and Gray ( Gray &amp; Patterson , 1995 ; Gray , Patterson , &amp; Linke , 1993 ) on extended stay outdoor education school programs such as Timbertop . In addition , there are some interesting recent and in progress post-graduate studies Cohen ( 1996 ) on the Outdoor Activities Group more recently known as the Outdoor Education Group school programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending the Mittagundi program , and W. Davis ( personal communication , September 27 , 1996 ) on the outdoor education program at the Blue Mountains Grammar School . <p> Considered together , the outcome studies suggest the potential of outdoor education to provide effective personal growth experiences for school students . However , the results indicate a low to moderate amount of change is actually achieved , with considerable variability in outcomes between various programs ( Cason &amp; Gillis , 1994 ; Hattie , et al. , 1997 ) . <h> Academic achievement <p> There is a distinct shortage of studies investigating the potential of outdoor education to enhance academic achievement . A study by Marsh and Richards ( 1988 ) reported large academic and self-concept improvements yet , except for further analysis by Gouvernet ( 1988 ) , this has not inspired other practitioners or researchers to seek replication or further application of a very effective outdoor education academic intervention program . <h> Program components and characteristics <p> How do outdoor educators decide on program length and a sequence of activities ? A study by Thomas ( 1992 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their colleagues and that this influence is more in the area of program content than in areas of process or theory . This finding warrants some concern that practitioners may not be making appropriate use of the available research findings on the effect of program length and content . <p> Thomas ( 1985 ) studied the effect of course length on self-concept changes in junior school participants on Outward Bound programs . He reported no differences in self-concept improvements between students participating in 14 and 21 day programs , although the meta-analyses by Gillis and Cason ( 1994 ) and Hattie , et al . ( 1997 ) found that longer programs were associated with more effective outcomes . As pressure is applied to outdoor educators to deliver shorter and shorter programs , it is important that the implications of program length , suggested by the research findings , are taken into account . <p> Another area for programming research is to investigate the effect of specific program components on school students . Examples of research in this area are Wildes ( 1994 ) measurement of childrens physiological responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995a ) testing of girls anxiety and confidence responses to abseiling , McKennas ( 1995 ) investigation of the role of reflective journals in changing self-concept , and Hasties ( 1992 ) study of students enjoyment of adventure activities . Despite these beginnings , Shores conclusion about Outward Bound studies in 1977 ( as cited in Kesselheim , 1978 ) is still relevant today : <p> the research literature ... is weak . It has focused on disciplinary issues ( self-concept , self-esteem ) to the virtual exclusion of their relationship to programmatic issues ( length of course , mix of activities , and nature of instruction ) . There have been few attempts to link outcome measures with program components , and very little statistical analysis in this sense , as opposed to statistical reporting . <p> In an attempt to address such issues , Neill ( 1994 ) reviewed the literature on the characteristics of personal change programs conducted in schools , and predicted that the most effective programs would : <p> be physically oriented ; <p> use the school context ( i.e. be conducted through the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; <p> take place in a 24-hour-a-day setting ( i.e. students do not return to home or school during the program ) ; <p> be of a long duration ( e.g. at least a week ) ; <p> be conducted by therapists or trained group leaders ( rather than teachers ) ; <p> incorporate the aims of adolescents , parents and teachers , and <p> include teachers , parents and others involved with adolescents as targets in the program . <p> It would be exciting to see the outdoor educator industry take up the challenge of systematically testing these program characteristics and measuring corresponding changes in effectiveness . <h> School climate and student culture <p> Outdoor education studies typically measure change using individual students as units of analysis . An area awaiting further investigation is the effect that outdoor education programs can have on school climate and student culture . <p> An example of the possibilities in this area is a study by Parle ( 1986a , b ) which investigated the self-efficacy of two groups of female schools students from the same school . Self-efficacy refers to an individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of behaviours or tasks . In Parles study , one group of students chose to participate in an Outward Bound program , while the other group chose to stay at school . <p> The self-efficacy of the students attending the Outward Bound program increased more than for the girls remaining at school , however when the Outward Bound group returned to the school , there was a corresponding increase in the self-efficacy of the students who had not attended the Outward Bound program . This was an unanticipated finding which suggested that the Outward Bound attendees had a positive social influence on the non-attendees . <p> Another example of research in this area was a study by McConnnell ( 1985 as cited in Abbott , 1987 ) which found dramatic improvements in student-teacher relationships as reported by Christchurch secondary students following an outdoor education experience . <h> Individual differences <p> There is a tendency for outdoor education programs to be designed and conducted as though students are a homogenous group . Other areas of education , including subjects as diverse as mathematics and physical education , are well ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gender , academic ability , and physical competence . Health professionals and sports psychologists are now using sophisticated tools for measuring individuals readiness for change and then applying specific intervention strategies appropriate to their needs ( e.g. Gorley &amp; Gordon , 1995 ) . <p> A further aspect of individual differences largely ignored in outdoor education research is that outdoor programs are not always beneficial to all participants . Evidence and discussion on this matter has only begun appearing relatively recently ( Druian , Owens , &amp; Owens , 1986 ; Kiewa , 1992 ; Mackay , 1981 ; McIntyre , 1987 ; Richards , 1987 ; Voight , 1988 ; Wurdinger , 1995 ) and deserves much more attention . <h> Comparative studies and meta-analyses <p> Comparative studies of outcomes from different outdoor education programs are rare , particularly for school student programs . This is unfortunate , given the potentially rich and valuable information that such studies could provide . The only comparative study of school outdoor education programs found for this review was Nussbaumers ( 1988 ) thesis on changes in physical self-concept . <p> In recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This involves a relatively simple statistical procedure for summarizing the results of many different studies . Hattie ( 1992 ) conducted a meta-analysis of self-concept change programs , including cognitively-oriented programs , emotionally-oriented programs and a range of other approaches . One of the categories with the highest level of change was " physically oriented " programs , with the subgroup of camps and summer schools achieving the highest level of change in the study . Intrigued by this finding , Hattie , et al . ( 1997 ) conducted a meta-analysis which focused on 151 studies of adventure program outcomes . The results indicated much larger effects for adults than for students . In addition , of particularly concern for outdoor educators , was the finding that the overall outcomes for students were less than for outcomes reported by studies of innovative , non-adventure-based programs for school students . <p> A meta-analysis conducted by Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) focused specifically on outdoor adventure program outcomes for adolescents . Using 43 studies , the results linked larger effects to younger students and longer programs . Overall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for the same age group in Hattie , et al.s ( 1997 ) study . Like Hattie , et al. , however , Cason and Gillis commented on a wide variability in outcomes , ranging from negative through to highly positive . <h> Barriers and benefits <p> It is interesting that outdoor educators readily deliver challenges through their programs , but rarely seek challenges about their programs . Without ongoing research and evaluation to challenge outdoor educators , idiosyncratic , ineffective or even negative programs can evolve and be delivered . Yet commitment to a positive cycle of objective evaluation followed by systematic program adjustments holds promise for offering significant benefits for students learning outcomes . <p> So , what are the perceived barriers to a greater role for research and evaluation in outdoor education programs for school students ? The chief barrier is that the outdoor education culture does not collectively value or invite critical appraisal of its practices . Whole-hearted , long-term embodiment of research and evaluation practices within outdoor education organisations are very rare and have invariably resulted from the vision and commitment of single individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colin Abbott through organisations such as The Outdoor Experience Program , Brian Nettleton who has recently retired from University of Melbourne , and from overseas , Simon Priest with the Corporate Adventure Training Institute at Brock University ) . <p> Establishing a culture of ongoing evaluation is not easy . At first there can be fear , hesitancy , and skepticism about the value and purpose of research and evaluation in outdoor education . However , if conducted professionally , feedback about the results can increase staff understanding and be used to improve program design and processes . With staff on side , the culture of evaluation can become self-perpetuating and set program development on an upward spiral . <p> One of the initial deterrents to evaluation is that demonstrating significant and reliable changes for short programs conducted with adolescents is not easy . Fledgling attempts at formal evaluation often provide disappointing results and the evaluation process goes no further . Yet , poor results are an important beginning . Depending on the situation , the next step may involve developing more appropriate research methods or employing strategies to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise is another barrier to research and evaluation . This is where utilizing external expertise , such as a university , can help . This does not , however , guarantee the establishment of ongoing evaluation processes designed to meet the needs of a particular school or organisation . More likely to be fruitful are collaborative partnerships with established research programs in the outdoor education industry . <p> Cost is often perceived as another barrier . The reality , however , is that economic value flows from well designed research and evaluation .

Overall , there is evidence for a great deal of variability in outcomes between different studies , different programs , and different individuals . The potential value of outdoor education for school students is indicated by some studies which demonstrate highly positive learning outcomes . There are many more studies , however , which show that low to moderate changes are achieved . A further concern is that an unknown number of studies with less than positive findings are simply not published .

" , the answer is that we do n't  yet know . What 's more , unless research and evaluation is included as a fundamental component of outdoor education , we will continue not knowing . <p> To date , the vast majority of outdoor education programs have been sustained by an act of faith . We can choose to continue walking along the path of faith , however , this will require praying harder than ever that schools , teachers , parents , and funding bodies do n't  dare question the evidence for that faith . <h> Footnotes <p> 1 Similar conclusions can be drawn from Masters theses by Mackay ( 1981 ) , based on interviews with 90 New Zealand teachers , Thomas ( 1992 ) , based on interviews with 8 outdoor education practitioners in South-East Queensland , and Huxley ( 1995 ) , based on analysis of outdoor education programs in nine elite Sydney schools . <p> 2 A study by Lambert ( 1978 ) was noted , but not obtained for this review . <h> References @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution : Using the outdoors in corrections - history and concepts .

Wilson has also explored his theoretical ideas through many novels . <p> Wilson , by his own admission , makes the same point over and over again in all his books . <p> The human mind tricks itself into underperformance . Humans too easily fall prey to unnecessary defeatism . Certain kinds of experience trigger our full capabilities , e.g. , on receiving surprise good news we get a sudden surge of enthusiasm , optimism and meaning . When we are threatened , we suddenly spark into action . <p> Wilson has an very indepth background in literature and reading many many literary , philosophical , and psychological writers and thinkers .

It quickly attained cult status and is still cited by many people as a ' life changer ' . <p> The original title of the book was " The Pain Threshold " . The basic thesis of ' The Outsider ' is that the health of a society can be measured by how it treats its " outsiders " . Outsiders are about the 1 in 20 people who do not " fit in " . Outsiders may be artists , religious people , writers , criminals , adventurers , etc . They may also be society 's shamans , seers , visioneers , and litmus testers . Cultures which incorporate and tolerate outsiders get to enjoy the knowledge contributions of outsiders . Cultures which alienate outsiders by rejecting and repressing them , risk losing the contributions of their visioners and innovators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility on outsiders themselves for failing to meet their duty to society . Wilson identifies the main flaws that outsiders tend to suffer from . Wilson sees many outsiders as failures since they did n't fulfill their potential to themselves or society , e.g. , : <p> by being overly physical : e.g. , adventurers who overemphasize the physicalness of adventure e.g. , in exploration or war <p> overly emotional : e.g. , romantics who who fall prey to depression and negative thinking <p> Essentially , this boils down to outsiders who " give up " on the real task of creating truthful meaning from life by being overly active or overly passive . <p> By looking at the failings of outsiders and illustrating through numerous literary and biographical examples and anecdotes , Wilson attempts to map some solutions to the ways of life for the outsider . It is a difficult path to tread for outsiders to remain relevant to society and continue to find ways of helping the human race evolve through access to its incredible potential . <h> Keys concepts <p> Fallacy of insignificance <p> Jonah complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The will needs a purpose <p> What we accept as everyday consciousness is thoroughly sub-normal . <p> Human beings experience a range of mental states which is as narrow as the middle three keys of a piano . <p> Everyday consciousness is a liar . <p> Freedom is a quality of consciousness . <h> Key quotes <p> Dr. Miller says we are pessimistic because life seems like a very bad , very screwed-up film .

In the sanatoria , fresh air and sunshine as much as medicine were used to treat tuberculosis ( TB ) , with mixed success . This idea was extended in Britain during the first half of the 20th century , with the focus on improving the health of children who were seen as sickly and susceptible to TB . The schools were truly open-air ( no walls ) with purposeful , harsh ( but supposedly healthy ) environmental conditions , especially during winter , intentional . By the 1940 's there were 155 open-air schools and they aimed to improve both health and academics .

" - Carver &amp; Scheier ( 2000 , p. 310 ) <p> The learning perspective lies at the nurture end of the nature-nurture debate . In terms of the person-situation debate , the learning perspective lies at the ' situation ' end of the spectrum . Personaliity , from this point of view is an accumulated set of learned tendencies over a lifetime ( Carver &amp; Sheier , 2000 ) . The learning perspective draws on the traditions of behaviourism as well as social psychology . Concepts you may have heard of relating to the social learning perspective include modeling , reinforcement , social norms , etc . This perspective also implies that personality is " susceptible to molding , grinding , and polishing by the events that from the persons unique and individual history " ( Carver &amp; Scheier , 2000 , p. 311 ) . <p> The underlying assumption of the learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by interaction with the environment . The learning perspective views a person as entering the world as a tabula rasa ( blank slate ) , although it acknowledges that there are instincts and pre-set responses to stimuli , as well as a preference for pleasure and a desire to avoid pain . Primarily , however , the learning perspective differ from perspectives that propose that a person is born with an innate nature or personality structure -- some biological theories call it temperament , trait theories call it dispositions , psychoanalysts call it drives or instincts and the humanists also use the term drives . <p> Learning theories believes that your personality ( individual differences ) essentially arose from the moulding ( learning experiences ) you receive in your environment - i.e. , your patterns of behaviour are shaped by experience . This was an exciting concept when first postulated , because many were frustrated by the abstract , difficult to see and measure nature of psychoanalytic theory . Learning theories emphasized environmental influences and events which were tangible and could be identified and scientifically studied . With this approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a plus for psychology and its quest for using the scientific method <p> Because it was hypothesised that there were basic building blocks to learning and behaviour , which was posited to cross species , the ubiquitous lab rat could be used as a model for understanding human behaviour . Almost all variables could be controlled using lab rats which made good scientific research but left open the unanswerable question but can you extrapolate animal behaviour to humans ? Is human behaviour this simple or is it more complex ? <p> From a strictly behavioral perspective , introspective information is considered invalid because it ca n't be verified . From the learning perspective , personality is merely the sum of everything you do , not what you think or feel . Thus , the causes of behaviour were those which could be be observed directly . Theoretically , a person 's behaviors derived from the paired associations ( Classical or Pavlovian Conditioning ) and the rewards and punishments ( Instrumental or Operant Conditioning ) found in the social and physical world . <p> However , many learning theorists came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate theory was developed in which the humans are seen as more self-directive . We can learn quickly and , importantly , our cognitions are seen to affect our learning . Thus Social Learning Theory and Social Cognitive Theory views internal ( cognitive ) and social events as being important as well as external behavioral events . <p> According to social learning perspectives , personality consists of all learned tendencies a person has acquired , including those from social influences . Thus , for example , one of arguments for differences in personality across cultures is different social practices , particularly during childhood . Would you have been the same person you are today had you been brought up in vastly different circumstances in a different country ? At the very least , you would probably have quite different beliefs and views of the world and yourself . This is because some cultures encourage and reward certain behaviours , whilst other cultures value and emphasize certain other behaviours . <p> Because of such criticisms , there has been considerable development of learning theories allowing for integration of the role of social learning and cognition .

Adventurers often follow steps such as initial failings or trauma , strivings , an opportunity or problem , the role of a mentor and training , a climax in which a person is pitted against a significant challenge , and ultimately a triumph and resolution/transition .

Stories reporting successful change attempts were more likely than stories reporting failed attempts to mention intense emotional experiences , external threats , and focal events that often culminate in crystallizations of discontent . These events were related to reevaluations of goals and life meaning and increased motivation to change . Social support , attributions of internal control , blaming external events for failure , and the development of a new sense of identity that incorporated the changed behavior were strongly associated with reports of successful change . Failure narratives more likely than success narratives to describe change in terms of will power and to indicate an active participation in maintaining the status quo . These results provide a glimpse at the phenomenology of life change attempts . <h> Summary <p> Subjects were asked to write stories about a failed attempt at life change and a successful attempt at life change , including descriptions of the strategies they use to change and how those strategies helped / did n't help .

Van Gennep 's ( 1909/1960 ) conceptualization of the stages of rites of passage ( above the line ) and the social status of the individual ( below the line ) <p> I sensed from the article that Bell was a little too eager in suggesting that current outdoor education programs do not focus on stage 3 , incorporation . This may have been true in the past , but Reincorporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outdoor education programs of today involve linkages between program and home/work/school environments than ever before , with considerably more reincorporation work than ever before . So , in this sense , Van Gennep 's model seems to be becoming as relevant as ever to outdoor education . <p> As Bell points out , Western culture is , at least on the surface , disturbingly lacking in the distinct rites of passage of passage and this may be leading to a social pressure to view outdoor education programs as serving something of a rites of passage function . And why not ? Given the reasonable fit , it might well be that outdoor education is evolving to play just that kind of role for society , and this may well be important . This social pressure to generate genuine rites of passage is probably felt within and amongst outdoor educators , particularly in some organizations and areas of outdoor education , and from without , as society looks around for what healthy , guided rites of passage can be offered to people involved in developmental thresholds such as adolescence , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion of severing the connection between outdoor education and rites of passage does n't make sense . A better option Bell suggests is to strengthen the reincorporation stage , since the followup period is generally felt by outdoor educators to present something of a challenge to participants to sustain their changes and continue to grow . However , recent evidence ( go to recent evidence about long-term changes in outdoor education ) suggests that outdoor education programs are actually doing reasonably well with regard to sustaining positive personal development changes on a long-term basis , but that the short-term changes ( i.e. , from beginning to end of the intensive program ) are small to moderate and vary widely between programs ( Hattie , et al , 1997 ) . Thus , this evidence from thousands of participants actually suggests that more attention is needed to create powerful , consistent programs and that transfer/reincorporation , at least to date , seems to doing reasonably well . <h> Recommendations for Van Gennep 's model &amp; outdoor education <p> The long-term outcome evidence is not as paltry as Bell suggests and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to helping participants to transition their learning and changes to home environments . <p> Perhaps also we should n't be too eager to discard a model which has been found to be relevant across many cultures over a long period of time , particularly when it seems outdoor education programming may even be heading more towards program designs which are increasingly cognizant of both pre and post phases and not just the intensive program phase . <p> What research would seem to simply is the intensification of actual program design and the way in which activities are run , to center more around the Transition process . This should be in conjunction with the Separation and Reincorporation , but at the end of the day , the nature of the Separation and Reincorporation processes are entirely constructed around the engine room of the change process , the Transition period , the nature of the activities , the unique social atmosphere , the role played by the leader , and so on .

Existentialism was at its height during the 1930 ' -1950 's in Europe . Key figures included Jean Paul Sartre and Albert Camus , also Friedrich Nietzche and Soren Kierkegaard who were earlier philosophers . <p> Existentialism understands the human to be challenged by the reality of temporary existence , and the view that life has no inherent meaning ; meaning had to be constructed . Authentic human beings were those who could face existential futility and yet still go on to construct a meaningful life . The existential perspective could be understood thus : <p> All existence ends in death <p> Therefore , what is the point ? <p> The human challenge : <p> Descend into nothingness <p> or have the courage to be ? <p> Existentialism represents the philosophical root of the phenomenological approach to personality . <p> After WWII this philosophy gained a large following in Europe . The purpose of existential philosophy was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Key questions of existential philosophy : What is the nature of existence ? How does it feel ? What does it mean ? <p> The key issue for existential psychology is : All existence ends in death . Therefore , what is the point ? The human challenge : Do we descend into nothingness or have the courage to be ? All we have is existence . So existential psychology is about helping people to BE and helping people take responsibility for their lives . <h> Existential Psychology - Key Elements <p> According to the existentialists human beings have no existence apart from the world . Being-in-the-world or " dasein " IS mans existence . Dasein is the whole of mankinds existence . The basic issue in life is that life inevitably ends in death . Thus we experience angst or anguish because of our awareness of deaths inevitability . <p> So we either retreat into nothingness or have the courage to BE . The extreme of the retreat into nothingness is suicide but we can also retreat into nothingness by not living authentic lives . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we live authentically . This entails living a life that is honest , insightful and morally correct . Authenticity is about living genuinely with ones angst and achieving meaning despite the temporary nature of ones existence . Life has no meaning , unless you create it . Friedrich Nietszche said the only logical response to this void and meaninglessness was to rise above it and become a superman ( sadly Nietszche went insane and died in an asylum ! ) . <p> We are all responsible for our choices but even honest choices wont always be good ones . You will still feel guilty over failing to fulfill all the possibilities in your life . Existential guilt , or existential anxiety or ANGST is inescapable . <h> Ludwig Biswanger <p> Ludwig Biswanger , an existential psychologist , suggested in 1958 that in order to understand how existence feels , which is at the heart of the phenomenological approach , we need to understand our experiences at three different levels . That is , that the conscious experience of being alive has three components : biological ( Umwelt ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eigenwelt ) . <p> Umwelt : In order to understand how existence feels we need to be aware of our physical sensation such as pain , pleasure , hunger , warmth , cold etc . <p> Mitwelt : In order to understand how existence feels we need to be aware of our social relations . What we think and feel as a social creature who exists in a world with other people . Your thoughts and feelings about others and the thoughts and feelings you receive from them is your experience of Mitwelt . <p> Eigenwelt : This could be simply classified as " introspection " . In order to understand how existence feels we need to be aware of the inner workings of ourselves . This is all about our attempt to understand ourselves : the experience of experience itself . <h> Rollo May ( 1909-1994 ) <p> The existential perspective was introduced into the US by Rollo May . May accepted many psychodyanmic principles ( such as neurosis , repression and defense ) . May believed that individuals can only be understood in terms of their subjective sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a stratagem for protecting the centre this is the subjective sense of self ) against perceived threats . The person may give up on self-growth if he or she feels his centre is threatened and retreat to the secure , known centre .

If we lose our commitment to a set of values we will feel lonely and empty . Life will be meaningless .

To avoid fatal collapse during the nights he kept himself awake by writing on slips of paper stolen from the camp office . On April 27 the camp was liberated by U.S. troops . In August Frankl returned to Vienna , where he learned , within a span of a few days , about the death of his wife , his mother and his brother who has been murdered in Auschwitz together with his wife . <p> During his time in the camps , he observed people who survived horrific circumstances but were able to resist despair . He felt that those who were able to do so were people who found some spiritual meaning in their lives . He believed that the prime motive of human behaviour is the " will-to-meaning " . In order to find a meaning in our troubled existence we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to discover these values . And we discover our values through work , through love for others and through confrontation with our own suffering . <p> Frankl devised a treatment for to help people find the meaning in their lives . It is called Logotherapy from the word Logos = Greek for meaning . Logotherapy views psychological problems as symptomatic of the person having lost meaning in life . Once meaning is rediscovered , the problems tend to resolve . This is done by confronting patients with their RESPONSIBILITY for their existence and by helping them choose values . <h> R. D. Laing ( 1927-1989 ) <p> According to the R. D. Laing , the British psychiatrist and existentialist the mind of modern man is a divided entity : the false self and the true self . He believes that modern social communication and the family in particular is very damaging . He believes the family requires us to stifle our true feelings and to pursue meaningless goals .

Laing conceded that there may be some biological predisposition towards schizophrenia but he firmly believed that interpersonal stresses could lead people to find they can no longer maintain their " false self " and hence they retreat from reality into their own inner worlds . <h> Existential Psychology Therapeutic Approach <p> Existentialists : freedom is a constant struggle , something people may wish to avoid , and that once embraced still comes with a price : existential guilt and anguish . The goal of existential therapy though is to set the client on this hard road . It encourages a sense of responsibility for their symptoms by attempting to make them see that this way of being is something they have chosen and helps to show them that they are free ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ways that will give meaning to their lives . The therapists tries to help restore a sense of self-responsibility &amp; courage and to facilitate self-discovery of meaning &amp; purpose . They try to see the world as the patient sees the world but they are less emphatically warm than the humanist therapist . The most important source of meaning is honest , respectful personal relationships . <p> Therapy is good in that it deals with the person as a whole but it is long and costly and is best for neurotic disorders . <h> Existential Psychology - Conclusions <p> The existential approach also has much more negative undertones than the humanistic approach . It emphasizes powerlessness , loneliness , emptiness , and angst and admits that it is very hard to find meaning and value in our lives .

It can be used as a first activity in an adventurous program with volunteers ( e.g. , the start of an Outward Bound program ) . However , if the program is less adventurous , or group members potentially will have significant problems with such proximity , e.g. , due to culture , or social or psychological problems , then Human Knot could be introduced later in a program . <p> Ideal group size is approximately 10 , but it can be done with anywhere from about 7 to 16 .

The more in a group , the more difficult the task , partly because of the complexity , and partly because there is physically less room to move . <p> If there are two or more groups doing the task simultaneously , have the groups reasonably spaced out , so they do n't feel distracted by a sense of competition . <p> Ask participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all stand closer can be a subtle way of helping to prepare them for what is about to come . <p> Ask participants to each place a hand in the middle of the circle and to grasp another hand . <p> To emphasize learning of names and get a bit of fun going , ask participants to introduce themselves to the person they are holding hands with . <p> Then ask participants to put their other hand in the middle , grasp a different person 's hand , and introduce themselves . <p> Do n't let participants let go of hands - some will be tempted to think the activity might then be over - but it is only just starting . <p> Explain to participants that what you 'd like them to do is untangle themselves , without letting go of hands , into a circle . <p> There will be a mixture of reactions , often including nervous laughter , fun amusement , excitement , trepidation , strong suspicion that it ca n't be done , and others who may view the task as a somewhat sadistic or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task before , but this doens't really matter , each time the task is unique . <p> Participants may change their grip so as to more comfortable , but they are not to unclasp and re-clasp so as to undo the knot . <p> If you want name-learning emphasized , then explain that whenever the group is talking to someone , or about someone , that the person 's first name must be used .

Sometimes , a new leader emerges from being in an opportune position in the knot . This can offer this person a significant boost . Also , almost everyone gets a positive sense of having played his or her part .

However , because it can be quite challenging , and people will often have been pulled in all sorts of directions ( literally ) , be prepared to have at least a short debrief , e.g. by asking " How well did you think the group worked together ?

One caveat however is that this study used self-report measures of aggression . <p> In a study by Dabbs and Morris ( 1990 ) , men higher in testosterone were found to be more likely to abuse alcohol and drugs , assault people , be dominant , have large numbers of sexual partners , be single , or divorced if married , and have trouble with teachers , parents , classmates whilst growing up . Mostly these effects were stronger for low SES , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As mentioned , females also produce testosterone . In a study by Dabbs , Ruback , Frady , Hopper and Sgoritas ( 1988 ) female prisoners who had committed violent crimes which were unprovoked were founder to have higher levels of testosterone than females who had committed violent crimes due to provocation or had committed non-violent crimes . <p> It should be noted however that the findings on the links between testosterone and aggression are by no means conclusive . It has been suggested , for example , that increased testosterone level may be the result of aggression rather than the cause of it ( Zuckerman , 1991 ) . Levels of testosterone are altered by situational factors , e.g. increases following success at a competitive event , sexual intercourse , and decreases following failure . <p> Another hormone implicated in personality is cortisol . People who suffer from severe stress , anxiety and depression tend to have very high levels of cortisol in their system . This would appear to be a RESULT of stress and depression rather than a CAUSE of it . <h> Neurotransmitters and personality <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called neurotransmitters . Some of the neurotransmitters you may be familiar with are epinephrine , norepinephrine , dopamine and serotonin . Norepinephrine for example is likely to be involved in both anxiety and anger . <p> High levels of norepinephrine have for example been associated with anxiety-proneness , dependency and sociability . On the other hand , low levels of norepinephrine are associated with disinhibition &amp; impulsivity ( Zuckerman ) . <p> Criminals have been found to have low levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine . <p> The neurotransmitter , dopamine , is implicated in bodily movements , amongst other things . A lack of dopamine is associated with Parkinsons disease ( l-dopa and Sacks ) . <p> The enzyme MAO which I mentioned early and which regulates the breakdown of the neurotransmitters serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine has been found to be implicated in aggression , extraversion , sensation seeking , such that low levels of this enzyme lead to increased levels of aggression , extraversion , and sensation seeking . <p> Another neurotransmitter , serotonin has a role in the inhibition of behavioural &amp; emotional impulses . Low serotonin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , and chronic pessimism . Marazzitti , et al . ( 1993 ) found that highly aggressive individuals had reduced levels of serotonin when compared with controls . <p> High serotonin levels are associated with compulsive behaviours and obsessive tidiness . However the workings of serotonin are extremely complex and not fully understood . Dean Hamer , who has researched serotonin extensively , suggests that serotonin is a chemical that ABETS rather than alleviates anxiety and depression . Serotonin levels have been linked to aggression such that when serotonin levels rise so to does aggression ( Wright , 1995 ) .

@@41691645 @1691645/ <h> Humanistic Perspectives on Personality <h> Humanism : An Introduction <p> Humanism is a philosophical movement that emphasises the personal worth of the individual and the centrality of human values . The Humanistic approach rests on the complex philosophical foundations of existentialism , and emphasizes the creative , spontaneous and active nature of human beings . This approach is very optimistic and focusses on noble human capacity to overcome hardship and despair . <h> Carl Rogers ( 1902-1987 ) <p> The idea that we are responsible for our own lives , embodied in existentialism , is exemplified in the work of Carl Rogers . However Rogers approach was extremely OPTIMISTIC . Rogers believed that " The organism has one basic tendency and striving- to actualize , maintain , and enhance the experiencing organism " ( 1951 , p. 487 ) . <p> Rogers believed that all people have a tendency toward growth = Actualization . The need to maintain and enhance life . The goal of existence is to satisfy this need . This desire to preserve and enhance oneself is on one level : <p> Psychological = self-actualization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new experiences , master new skills , quit boring jobs and find more exciting ones etc . <p> In the course of pursuing self-actualization , people engage in what Rogers called the organismic valuing process . Experiences that are perceived as enhancing to oneself are valued as good and are therefore sought after . Experiences perceived as not enhancing are valued as bad and are avoided . In other words , we know what 's good for us ! <p> Rogers used the term Fully Functioning Person for someone who is self-actualizing . These people are OPEN TO EXPERIENCING THEIR FEELINGS , do n't  feel threatened by those feelings no matter what they are . They trust their own feelings . They are open to the experiences of the world . They live lives full of meaning , challenge and fulfillment . <p> According to Rogers , the main determinant of whether we will become self-actualized is childhood experience . Rogers believed that it is crucial for children to receive positive regard , that is affection and approval from the important people in their lives , particularly their parents . Rogers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard , that is affection and acceptance with no strings attached . Often however , according to Rogers this regard is conditional , it comes with strings attached . To be loved and approved the child must be well-mannered , quiet , assertive , boyish , girlish , whatever . These things are incorporated as conditions of worth . If the conditions are few and reasonable then the child will be fine but if the conditions of worth are severely limiting then self-actualization will be severely impeded . According to Rogers , external conditions of worth come to control more and more of a person 's behaviour . We even start to apply these conditions to ourselves . This pattern of self-acceptance and self-rejection is called conditional self-regard . Eventually , a gap opens between a persons actions and his or her true self . The person automatically covers over the split with perceptual distortions , denying the conflict between self and reality . Rogers felt that theses distortions can become so severe that they may lead to personality breakdown . <h> Rogers : Self congruence <p> Rogers is sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exist at birth but that infants gradually differentiate self from non-self . The self is constantly evolving . <p> One way of looking at the self is to look at the ideal self and the actual self : <p> The ideal self is the person you 'd like to be <p> The actual self is what you are now or even what you THINK you are because remember from this perspective its all about subjective perceptions . <p> When you are self-actualized then there is congruence ( i.e. harmony or agreement ) between the real and the actual selves . That is you become more like the self you want to be . <p> There 's a second kind of congruence and that is between the actual self and experience . That is the experiences in life should fit with the type of person you think you are . So there will be incongruity if you think you 're generous but find yourself being mean to someone or if you think your ruthless and you find yourself being soft and mushy . If you think you 're clever and do badly in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means there is a breakdown in your unitary sense of self . Incongruence leads to anxiety , whether the incongruence is between actual &amp; real self or between actual self and experience . Rogers believed we defend ourselves against incongruence or even the perceptions of incongruence . <h> Rogers : Incongruence and Defenses <p> This concept of defenses is very similar to the psychodynamic concept . Rogers assumes 2 main categories of defenses : <p> 1 . DISTORTION OF EXPERIENCE : An example is rationalization : creating a plausible but untrue reason for why something is the way it is . OR another distortion of experience is when you try to change you perception of an event from what you really know it to be : you go out with someone other than your partner but tell yourself that it does n't  matter because your partner wont mind . <p> Ultimately , defenses are there to maintain the congruity or integrity of self . Defenses protect and enhance our self-esteem . <h> Ed Deci ( 1975 ) - Self-Determination ( Autonomy ) <p> Rogers ideas are echoed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1975 ) and expanded upon by Deci and Richard Ryan ( 1980 , 1985 , 1987 , 1991 , 1995 ) . <p> Some actions we perform are done to gain payment or to satisfy someone else ( their pressures or demands on us ) . These are known as CONTROLLED actions ( or introjected regulation ) . These are " should " , " ought " : behaviour done to avoid guilt or anxiety , gain self-approval , etc . <p> Some actions we perform are done so because they have intrinsic value to the person , These are known as SELF-DETERMINED actions ( identified regulation ) . This is behaviour which is accepted as personally meaningful and valuable We stay interested in performing a behaviour if its self-determined. e.g. you 're more likely to stick with this course and study hard if you are doing it because it has intrinsic value for you , rather if its what your parents want you to do or even if its because you think it will result in a good job and therefore you pressure yourself . <p> There 's a wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an activity can undermine peoples interest in them ( intrinsic vs extrinsic motivation ) . However , sometimes the presence of reward can increase motivation . Deci argues that this is because reward has 2 aspects : a controlling ( non self-determined ) aspect and an informational aspect . The informational aspect tells you something about your skills . If the reward is telling you you 're competent then it increases your motivation but if the reward implies conditions of worth then the controlling aspect is more salient and motivation decreases . <p> In other words , people are motivated by self-determination and autonomy . WHY a person has various motivations to do things , rather than what the aspirations are , is the key to self-actualization . <h> Maslow ( 1970 , 1987 ) - Hierarchy of Needs <p> Abraham Maslow began his psychological research studying basic motivations of animals , but then shifted his focus to the higher motivations of human beings . Abraham Maslow , like Rogers , focussed on the positive . He was interested in the qualities of people who get the most out of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his view of motivation was very different from what we looked at in the dispositional perspective ) . <h> Hierarchy of Needs <p> He viewed human needs or motives as forming a hierarchy . <p> 1 . PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS : At the bottom are the basic , primitive needs for air , food , water - those things we HAVE to have to survive <p> 2 . SAFETY AND PHYSICAL SECURITY NEEDS : shelter from weather , protection against tigers etc . Very important but not QUITE as important as the physiological needs . <p> 4 . ESTEEM NEEDS : needs for a sense of mastery and power . Need for appreciation from others . <p> 5 . SELF ACTUALIZATION : similar use of the term to the way Rogers used it . " The tendency to become whatever you 're capable of becoming " : The highest of human motives . In trying to describe the process of self-actualization , Maslow focused on moments when self actualization was clearly occurring . Maslow used the term " peak experiences " to refer to moments of intense self-actualization . At these moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sounds and colours around them . There 's a loss of a sense of time as the experience flows around you . You may feel awe , wonder or even ecstasy . This is similar to what Csikszentmihalyi ( chick-sent-me-high ) calls " flow " but he sees it not so much as joy or ecstasy but rather as a period of intense concentration , with a slightly elevated mood when time flows by very quickly . <p> Motives WEAKEN as go from the more primitive to the higher needs ( up the pyramid ) . In general you need to deal with lower level needs before you can move onto other needs . <h> Maslow : Self-Actualizing People <p> Characteristics of self-actualized people according to Maslow ( 1968 ) : <p> efficient and accurate in perceiving reality <p> are accepting of themselves , of other people and of nature <p> are spontaneous in thought and emotion , rather than artificial <p> are problem-centred - are concerned with the eternal philosophical questions of humankind <p> are independent and autonomous <p> have a continued " freshness of appreciation " of ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense of oneness with nature <p> identify with all of humanity and are democratic and respectful of others <p> form very deep ties but only with a few people <p> appreciate for its own sake the process of doing things <p> have a philosophical , thoughtful , non-hostile sense of humour <p> have a childlike and fresh creativity and inventiveness <p> maintain an inner detachment from the culture in which they live <p> may appear temperamental or ruthless as they are strong and independent people guided by their own inner visions <p> Maslow suggested that from his observations " probable " self-actualizers included : <p> Studies have shown that only approximately 1% of people self-actualize . Most others live between love and belongingness needs and self-esteem needs . Self-actualization is of course the weakest of needs , and is easily impeded . Some people have a fear of self-knowledge &amp; entering into state of uncertainty . Sometimes cultural norms stifle us e.g. manly . Many people feel the need for a balance between safety and freedom . <h> Maslow : Transpersonal Psychology ( 1971 ) <p> Maslow proposed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the end of his life , Maslow made a distinction between two different kinds of self-actualizers . The type Ive just described and others he called " transcendent self-actualizers " . These people focus on mystical , ecstatic , spiritual states , cosmic awareness , unitive consciousness , etc . Self-actualization becomes the most important aspect of their lives . They are motivated by beauty , truth , unity , religiosity . All experience is sacred to them . <h> Maslow : Problems of measuring self-actualisation <p> Maslow used interviews , observations , biographical studies , self-report questionnaires and projective tests to " measure " self-actualization . It was and is a very loose approach to measurement . Its hard for theorists to agree precisely WHAT self-actualization is and HOW to measure it . In other words its not been tightly defined and operationalised . The concept of self actualization provides some very interesting insights but it is hard to actually verify self-actualization scientifically . One scale , the Personal Orientation Inventory ( POI ) by Shostrom ( 1974 ) , is a self-report measure of self-actualization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reliability weaknesses but does at least capture some aspects of a " healthy " personality ( e.g. Burwick &amp; Knapp , 1991 ) . <h> Therapeutic Approach <p> While humanistic and existential psychology both stress freedom , they understand it slightly differently . For humanists , freedom is liberation from limiting conditions of worth : once achieved that will lead to self-actualization <h> Rogers Client-centred Therapy ( 1951 ) <p> The best known and probably the most popular humanistic therapy is Rogers " client-centred therapy " . Remember that Rogers believed that human beings are intrinsically good and are motivated to self-actualize . Self-actualization may be impeded by conditions of worth so they need to be removed . REMOVING these conditions of worth is the way to solve peoples problems . Client centred therapy is the means to that end . Treatment is focussed on the INDIVIDUAL . The therapist tries to see the world through the clients eyes so that the client will come to see his or her view of reality as having value . The therapist empathizes with the client and offers unconditional positive regard i.e. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to induce the client to accept the totality of his or her experience and thus facilitate unconditional positive SELF-regard . <p> The therapist " hears " the client by mirroring back the message they are getting from the client . They restate the content and state the feelings they are picking up from the client . This process helps the client clarify their feelings and not to feel threatened when doing so . The touchstones of this approach are EMPATHY , INTUITION , and UNCONDITIONAL POSITIVE REGARD . Ultimately the client is responsible for his or her own growth - the therapist just helps to facilitate this process . . <h> Therapeutic Approach : Group-based Growth and Therapy <p> Other types of " therapy " based on the phenomenological approach to personality ( whether existential or humanistic ) are group-based therapies . These growth groups offered something lacking in everyday life at work , school , church , and within the community . Some examples of various groups based on this tradition are : <p> Encounter Groups <p> Gestalt Groups <p> Sensitivity Training Groups <p> Marathon Groups <p> Sensory Awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Creativity Workshops <p> Team Building Groups <p> Experiential Education ( e.g. Adventure programs ) <p> Many of these groups are not really therapy as such but are just meant to be beneficial to all . Encounter groups , which were very popular in the 60s are given this name because the group helps people encounter the reality of their own experiences more directly . <p> Although each type of group is different there are some important similar features : <p> Encouraging people to get in touch with their feelings <p> Encouraging people to get in touch with their sensory experiences <p> Encouraging people to act out fantasies , impulses and feelings within the group atmosphere of mutual trust ( safe place for change and growth ) and unconditional positive regard <p> They offer social support , empathy , encouragement , feedback <p> Exploration of possible new ways of being socially , psychologically , and physically . The idea being to transfer this growth to the rest of life . <p> Generally , this type of therapy is more likely to be beneficial than not but not as good as individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confrontation . Group leaders need to be properly trained or there can be negative effects . Not marvellous for people experiencing SEVERE psychological distress . <p> The dark side to this process is deindividuation - absorption in the group and a lessened sense of individuality .

@@41691646 @1691646/ <h> Classical ( Pavlovian ) Conditioning Perspectives on Personality <p> Last updated : 29 Sep 2003 <p> Conditioning theory can be broken down into 2 types : <p> Classical Conditioning <p> Instrumental / Operant Conditioning <p> Classical Conditioning is also called Pavlovian Conditioning . It explains how a previously neutral stimulus can come to have a learned effect on someone . This takes place by pairing ( associating ) a unconditioned stimulus ( which already produces an unconditioned response ) with a neutral stimulus ( conditioned stimulus ) . In this way , the organism learns to respond to the conditioned stimulus with a conditioned response which is like the unconditioned response . <p> " Most of the likes and dislikes , the preferences and biases that define ones personality , develop through emotional conditioning " <p> " In sum , it seems not unreasonable that classical conditioning processes may underlie many of peoples preferences for persons , events , things , places , and ideas . Inasmuch as these preferences are important aspects of personality , conditioning processes would appear to represent important contributors to human experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In order for Classical Conditioning to occur : <p> Organism must already respond predictably and automatically to a STIMULUS <p> Unconditioned Stimulus -&gt; Unconditioned ResponseUS-&gt; UR <p> A second stimulus is paired in time and space with the Unconditioned Stimulus . <p> Conditioned Stimulus -&gt; Conditioned ResponseCS-&gt; CR <p> There must already be a reliable , automatic response whenever a certain stimulus occurs ( a reflex if you like ) e.g. if you drink a sharp , acidic wine ( US ) your salivary glands start to work ( UR ) . ( These reflexes can be innate or learned in themselves ) . <p> The second thing that 's required is that the stimulus causing the reflexive response must be associated ( in both time and space ) with another stimulus . This stimulus is usually neutral and so would n't in itself cause a particular reflexive response . <p> So now the learning can take place . This is when the neutral stimulus occurs at the same time and place ( or it might be just before ) as the original US . <p> So if you drink this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar ) every night you may come to salivate every time you walk into that bar : <p> So now JOES BAR becomes the CONDITIONED stimulus ( CS ) and the SALIVATION is the CONDITIONED response ( CR ) <p> Example <p> Dry wine -&gt; Salivation US -&gt; UR <p> Joes Bar -&gt; Salivation CS -&gt; CR <p> The more often this pairing occurs the more likely that learning will have taken place . Or if the US is VERY strong e.g. <p> Chemotherapy -&gt; nausea US -&gt; UR <p> Canberra Hospital -&gt; nausea CS -&gt; CR <p> Once conditioning i.e. LEARNING has taken place the CS -&gt; CR can go on to function just as any innate reflex ( which is why I said earlier that the reflex can be innate or learned ) <p> Canberra Hospital -&gt; nausea <p> Doctor Smith -&gt; nausea <p> Example <p> US-&gt; URKissing -&gt; Feeling Sexy ! <p> CS-&gt; CRParticular Song -&gt; Feeling Sexy ! <p> = a learned response to a previously neutral stimulus <p> Advanced Classical Conditioning Concepts <p> Discrimination <p> Generalization <p> Extinction <p> I 'd just like to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditioning . <p> Classical conditioning provides a mechanism for new responses to become attached to neutral stimuli . But the CS often does n't  occur in exactly the same form as it did earlier and of course you may come across stimuli that are similar to but not the same as the original CS . So what happens is that we can DISCRIMINATE on the one hand and GENERALIZE on the other . <p> For example , you can of course DISCRIMINATE one bar from another so not all bars may provoke the same response ( as Joes bar ) . On the other hand , if you walked into a bar that was VERY similar you may get the same response ( CR ) i.e salivation . This is known as GENERALIZATION . <p> Sometimes conditioned responses go away : this is called EXTINCTION . When a CS come repeatedly without the US this occurs ( so when you go to Joes bar all the time after you 've gone on the wagon ( that is no wine ) then you no longer get the CR ( salivation ) when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr Smith ( CS ) down at the golf club all the time rather than at Canberra Hospital ( US ) the sight of him will no longer make you vomit ! Mind you hell probably still always make you feel slightly queasy ! <p> Emotional Conditioning <p> previously neutral stimuli can be conditioned to bring about good or bad feelings <p> the CRs are emotional reactions <p> With classical conditioning many of the stimuli that that lead to reflexive reactions are stimuli that bring about GOOD or BAD FEELINGS ( joy , excitement , pleasure , fear , anger , pain ) . <p> EMOTIONAL CONDITIONING is the term which refers to classical conditioning where the CRs are emotional reactions . So you can see how you start to build up a way of behaving in the world and responding positively or negatively to certain people , situations , surroundings etc . <p> Conditioning theorists suggest that most likes and preferences AND dislikes and biases that DEFINE our personality develop through EMOTIONAL CONDITIONING .

A typology of curriculum models is developed consisting of : 1 ) a first generation model--focusing on experience alone--which dominated Outward Bound programming in the 1960 's and early 1 970 's , 2 ) a second generation model--emphasizing discussion , group process , and imported techniques--which is the current ruling paradigm at Outward Bound , and 3 ) a third generation model--stressing experiential metaphors--which may provide a direction for future curriculum evolution . The three models are contrasted , and the strengths and weaknesses of each are explored . <p> Perhaps the most compelling aspect of Outward Bound is the life-affirming peak experience which occurs so predictably and regularly on the courses . This phenomena has fascinated Outward Bound observers and participants , and elicited numerous articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience has been documented so regularly that its existence is beyond question , its long term effects are still relatively unknown . Certainly most Outward Bound participants believe that the experience is life transforming . Illustrating this point , Fletcher ( 1970 ) sent questionnaires to 3000 Outward Bound students five years after they had completed their Outward Bound courses . Of the approximately 2400 questionnaires which were returned , 98.6% of the respondents indicated that the Outward Bound experience was either " successful " or " highly successful . " 86% of the students reported that their self-confidence had improved , 78% felt that they had increased in general maturity , and 64% believed that they had become more aware of the needs of others . 64% thought that these changes would last for their lifetimes , 32% believed they would last for several years , and only 4% thought that their gains were limited to several months . <p> While these results are impressive , critical observers of Outward Bound suggest that the case for the long term positive effects of Outward Bound is still unproven . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results ( cf Shore , 1976 ) , that the better studies have found less impressive results than the poorer studies ( Burton , 1981 ) , and that it is unrealistic to expect a short experience to transform a set of life long patterns ( James , 1980 ) . <p> The increase in the number of special population courses has also highlighted the " duration of impact " issue . As Outward Bound began to work with more clinical populations --eg substance abusers , troubled youth , Vietnam Veterans , and so on-- the referring parties wanted to be sure that the course improvements would have a lasting effect . <p> In response to the research critiques and the special needs of clinical populations , Outward Bound program designers have paid increasing attention to the issues of transference and the generalization of course learnings to daily life . One could even argue that these concerns about transference have been the primary driving force behind Outward Bound curriculum evolution in the past decade . There has been little other impetus ; as the Fletcher article demonstrates , the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support leaving the curriculum as is . <p> The purpose of this paper is to examine how the Outward Bound curriculum has evolved in the face of these concerns about transference and to look at how the curriculum might change in the future . It will be argued that almost all of the curriculum developed to date falls into one of two broad categories : 1 ) the basic Outward Bound model imported from England in the 1960 's or 2 ) a more sophisticated version emphasizing detailed debriefings and psychoeducational techniques . The heart of this paper , however , lies in an exploration of a new model of Outward Bound curriculum , the Metaphoric Model , which emphasizes trans-forming Outward Bound activities into experiential metaphors . <h> The " Mountains Speak for Themselves " Curriculum Model <p> The original Outward Bound curriculum model employed in the United States , which can be named the " Mountains Speak for Themselves " ( MST ) model , is based on an implicit assumption about Outward Bound 's global efficacy , ie it believes that Outward Bound is an all purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Outward Bound experience can be useful for almost anyone . A curriculum based on this model includes only the most basic Outward Bound elements ; essentially it consists of the minimal components necessary to generate the Outward Bound experience , the most frugal and sparing approach which results in an affective " high . " The model particularly deemphasizes discussion and feedback . Similarly , it believes that reflection on the activities and insight into one 's behaviors and feelings are primarily the responsibility of the students . The instructors provide space and time to conduct such activities , but they do not see themselves as active facilitators of these processes . <p> Instructors adhering to this model are experts at mastering wilderness situations ; they also have the ability to introduce the kinds of incremental challenges which lead to a sense of mastery and a peak experience . However , MST instructors generally avoid functioning as counselors , discussion leaders , or group process experts . <p> Given this resistance to verbal expression , it is not surprising that there are no articles in the Outward Bound literature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 ) did write about the approach ; in fact , he was one of the first writers to popularize the term the " Mountains Speak for Themselves " in print . James describes this model as follows . <p> To begin with , it seems to me that people who are saying anything equivalent to " Let the mountains speak for them-selves " are also saying something more , which is that instructors can rely on the overall structure of the Outward Bound course to give their students a good experience . They can rely on a training sequence , a way of grouping students and committing them to task performance , activities like solo and the rappel , etc ... So the point is not exactly that the mountains do the teaching . It is that the training sequence we arc using is a remarkably effective way to get people to learn in the mountains ... The experience happens naturally if instructors are skilled enough to take their students safely through the adventurous activities that make up Outward Bound , and when they do that , the mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original ) . <p> As mentioned above , MST adherents believe firmly in the general efficacy of Outward Bound . They also suggest that the Outward Bound experience is so positive , profound , and powerful that it will automatically generalize to the student 's daily life ; instructors do not need to be excessively concerned about transference . <p> Lest this sound somewhat unrealistic and naive , one is cautioned not to expect excessive results from the Outward Bound program . Interestingly , it is also noted that MST instructors simply do not have enough special expertise to work with the Outward Bound process in more than a basic manner . James ( 1981 ) ) continues his discussion . <p> ... it may be pretentious to expect that Outward Bound can do more than give its students what course director Ron Gager has called a " short-term turn-on . " The standard course is only twenty-three days long . Instructors have no formal training in counseling , therapy , communications , human relations , etc . In fact , what instructors are trained to do is let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wilderness , building up its skills for outdoor living , and then confronting it with a characteristic set of problem-solving tasks . Students coming to Outward Bound are looking for this very thing ... What I am driving at is that the mountaineers are making an important point by demanding a more limited set of expectations for an Outward Bound course . Perhaps that point is that we should do what we do best , which is to deliver students into an extraordinary experience of action and adventure , leaving them to make of it what they will . ( pp. 8-9 ) . <p> As James points out , the MST prospective recognises the limits of Outward Bound : Outward Bound should " do what it does best " and leave the rest to others . Following this principle , MST adherents believe that Outward Bound courses for special populations should essentially be a basic Outward Bound course with a homogenous population . For example , a standard course where 100% of the students are alcoholics can be called an Outward Bound sub-stance abuse course . The special population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " make of it what they will , " to get as much as they individually or collectively can from the courses without any sophisticated help from a specially designed curriculum or a specially trained staff member . <p> Historically the MST approach has been successful for both standard and special population courses . These courses achieve the usual Outward Bound outcomes . The students tend to have peak experiences at the end of the course and they report an increase in their self-confidence and an enhanced sense of the interdependence of humanity . <p> In spite of these positive outcomes , the MST model has received substantial criticism . Not surprisingly , the criticism focuses on the transferability of the Outward Bound experience . James ( 1980 ) describes this critique as follows . <p> ... ( E ) ducators are apt to follow John Dewey 's notion that the challenge of any form of education is to select present experiences that will live fruitfully and creatively in future experiences . Few would disagree with this . Dewey , who was probably the greatest educational thinker ever produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuum , a continuity of growth experiences . But here is where the disagreement begins , because he characterized learning not as the experience itself , but as thinking about the experience . So a form of education like Outward Bound that provides intense experiences also needs to provide tools for thinking about those experiences , for tying what has happened on a course into the experiential continuum of those who have passed through it . Another equally abstract way of saying this comes from social scientists who have studied learning behavior and concluded that the experience of the learner must be generalized into the learner 's repertoire of skills and knowledge . Students need help to draw inferences , to see the pattern that connects their continuous experience ( pp. 6-7 ) . <p> James ' critique of the MST model 's lack of verbal facilitation is aimed at the standard course and normal students . His critique can be extended and made more specific when one focuses on the MST approach to special population courses . For example , one can argue that MST courses are not based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain population , e.g. , alcoholics . Clearly , Outward Bound courses for alcoholics would be more powerful if the staff knew something about the particular problems of substance abusers and were capable of integrating that knowledge into their courses . <p> In addition , the somewhat amorphous goals of Outward Bound --increased self-confidence and compassion-- may not always lead to the precise behavior changes needed by certain special populations . For example , while it is logical to assume that enhancing the self-concept of a troubled adolescent should lead to less fighting with his parents , it is difficult to promise that an Outward Bound course will result in that specific behavioral change . In other words , the global goal of character development may be achieved , but that accomplishment may not lead to measurable and significant changes in the student 's life . <p> The third criticism of the MST model is similar to the second ; it argues that some special populations --such as alcoholics-- have specific problem behaviors , ie drinking , which must be altered if the student is to have any long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courses need to be explicitly designed to impact those specific problem behaviors . In summary , the three criticisms of the MST approach to special populations are : 1 ) the curriculum does not reflect any special knowledge about the dynamics of a target population ; 2 ) there is little proof that achieving global goals leads to specific behavior changes ; and 3 ) if a change in a specific behavior is necessary for student growth , the course will be more effective if it directly concentrates on changing that specific behavior . <h> The " Outward Bound Plus " Curriculum Model <p> The three criticisms summarized above , plus James ' argument about the transference problems inherent in the MST model , provided the impetus needed to develop a new approach to the Outward Bound curriculum , a " second generation " curriculum model . The most significant change between the first and second generation curriculum models is that the second generation model emphasizes the importance of the instructor as a discussion leader , counselor , and group process facilitator . In marked contrast to the MST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the second generation approach focuses on making cognitive links between the course experiences and the students ' daily life . In addition , it actively attempts to promote reflection , insight and introspection . <p> The second generation model does not ignore the primary importance of experience in Outward Bound . It continues to use the basic Outward Bound activities and achieves the Outward Bound experience as regularly as a first generation approach . But in addition , there is an emphasis on reflecting on experience . The second generation instructor not only provides the incremental course challenges which lead to mastery experiences , he actively assists the students ' attempts to integrate the meanings of those experiences into their lives . <p> In addition to this emphasis on facilitating reflection and insight , the second generation model is different from the first generation model in that the basic Outward Bound experience is often supplemented by integrating effective techniques from beyond the Outward Bound pale into the course curriculum . Adding these " imported " techniques allows one to assert that the resulting courses specifically address the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transactional analysis on courses for troubled youth , introducing Alcoholics Anonymous techniques into courses for substance abusers , and giving didactic lectures on communication skills during corporate training courses . While these techniques were originally included specifically for special population courses , in some cases their use has spread to the standard course . For example , it is not unusual for one to discover second generation instructors including relaxation or imagery techniques on a standard course . <p> Because of this openness to imported techniques , the second generation curriculum model can be called the " Outward Bound Plus ( OBP ) " approach . It is worth noting that when the emphases on debriefing , group discussion and instructor facilitation were first championed in the mid 60 's , these verbal techniques were also considered " imported " techniques . However , somewhere around the mid 70 's or early 80 's , the verbal emphasis had become so common that many , if not most , instructors accepted it as an integral --or perhaps even an indigenous-- aspect of Outward Bound . <p> The OBP approach is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magazine article about Outward Bound corporate courses ( McGee , 1985 ) . Note how the opening comments by an Outward Bound staff member emphasizes transference , post-activity discussions , and introspection . <p> " The OB instructors do n't formally teach management concepts , but at the end of every activity , we talk about what we learned . We always focus on , " What did you learn that you can use in the office ? " We ask thought-provoking questions , so that the participants make the in-sights and do the connecting between the two parts ( p. 19 ) . <p> The article continues with a quote from a corporate trainer . <p> You learn the routine of rock-c1imbing . We put you at the bottom of an 85-foot rock and say , " Climb . " .. Afterwards an instructor will ask the group , " What made it safe for you to climb ? ' ' and then point out , " You had a safety rope tied around you that you --and someone else-- had tested and trusted . You had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain holding the safety rope , using special techniques so if an accident happened , we were n't even depending on the strength of the person --just their presence-- to help guard you against being hurt . Who is on belay for you at work ? Who checks your knots at work ( pp. 19-20 ) ? " <p> A participant made this final comment . <p> The toughest challenge ... was expressing the things that we had experienced after going through the physical activi-ties , such as rappelling . It was pretty enriching to think about " How did it change me ? What did it do for me ? " The instructors tied it to , " How do you relate to the people you manage or work with ... do you communicate with them ( p. 20 ) ? " <p> As one would expect , the OBP approach was even more successful than the MST model . Not only were the typical Outward Bound outcomes achieved , but also , many of the criticisms of the MST approach were successfully redressed . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dynamics of a special population . Second generation instructors were expected to go beyond the more limited definition of an Outward Bound instructor ; they were expected to become knowledgeable about the background and daily functioning of the specific population they were serving . As a result , alcoholics on an Outward Bound course were exposed to frequent comments about substance abuse problems and corporate managers held many discussions about how Outward Bound learnings might transfer back to the job . Just as important , OBP instructors were prepared to target specific behaviors critical to the post course success of their students . For example , alcoholics were encouraged to attend AA meetings and to create sobriety-oriented support systems , corporate managers learned about problem solving techniques which could be directly applied at the office , and troubled youth learned how to communicate more effectively with their parents . <p> There were additional benefits as well . It was soon apparent that the Outward Bound environment provided a fertile context for the successful practice of non Outward Bound techniques , a context which tended to multiply the power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of reasons . The level of stress on the course broke down traditional defenses . The activities were concrete and thus provided an opportunity to try out new life strategies and graphically demonstrate success or failure . The supportive , small-group atmosphere promoted trust , rapport building , and risk taking . Finally , the overall wilderness setting was conducive to a feeling of renewal and revitalization . In summary , the OBP model overcame virtually all of the criticisms of the MST approach . It was knowledge based ; it related the course back to the students ' real life ; it was prepared to target specific behaviors and attempt to change the behaviors directly ; and it potentiated the power of " imported " techniques . <p> In spite of these notable successes , certain criticisms of the OBP model began to emerge . One concern was that it was to " techniqey " --that it was excessively dependent on the use of imported gimmicks , psychotherapy techniques , and lectures . The critics became concerned that the uniqueness of Outward Bound might be lost if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum . A typical question asked by some of the critics might go something like : " At what point does the extended amount of time devoted to verbal interactions and techniques significantly impair the basic Outward Bound commitment to doing and experience ? " <p> Furthermore , the flurry of differing imported techniques was potentially confusing to the instructor --especially the novice . There was some danger of losing a sense of organizational identity as the type and style of imported techniques changed from course to course and from one instructional team to another . <p> Finally , there was a question about when and how the OBP model transmits course learnings to the students . Outward Bound 's ability to differentiate itself from other human development paradigms is dependent on its commitment to experiential learning . And yet in the OBP model , it can be argued that as much or more learning occurs during the post-activity discussions as during the actual experience . If the post-activity discussions are really assuming such a primary position , is the OBP model a " pure " form of experiential education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population specific curriculum did indeed achieve its goals of specificity . However , it may have achieved these goals by importing and emphasizing techniques which minimize the uniqueness of Outward Bound . Experience and adventure are still emphasized in an OBP model , but at times there can be a sense that the course activities are less important than the verbal discussions --the component of the OBP approach most responsible for specificity and transference . Such an emphasis throws Outward Bound open to the criticism that it is a conventional therapeutic or psychoeducational approach , albeit one which operates in a wilderness environment . <p> The MST and OBP models have been presented in depth because it is important to understand past and current Outward Bound practices before discussing future directions . However , the primary purpose of this paper is to look toward the future , to describe a third generation curriculum model . A third generation model must attempt to conserve the OBP gains in specificity and transferability while simultaneously reasserting the primacy of experience in Outward Bound . Furthermore , a third generation model needs to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bound model . If Outward Bound wishes to be maximally effective with its students , and simultaneously achieve a credible position in the professional world as well as in the world of ideas , it must continue to emphasize , develop , and refine its techniques in the area where it is unique : the use of adventure oriented experiences to facilitate human growth . <h> The Metaphoric Curriculum Model <p> The differences between the first , second and third generation curriculum models can be graphically portrayed by examining the different ways in which each model would work with a particular Outward Bound activity the Wall1 . Imagine a course for corporate managers . The group is coeducational and the participants are concerned about sexist versus egalitarian leadership styles at work . <p> The MST instructor would take his group to the Wall , inform them of the relevant safety rules , and then stand back and watch them work through the challenge . Following the event , there would be little or no formal discussion of the activity , however , students might choose to talk about it informally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the activity was completed . Then he would ask the group to meet and discuss what they had learned on the Wall . He would ask open-ended , general questions , such as , " Who were the leaders and who were the followers ? " , " How was this the same as or different from the way you function at work ? " , and " Were you pleased with your performance ? " <p> With a number of groups , this type of questioning and the resulting discussion would help the group realize that their actions during the Wall were a reflection of their typical leadership styles at work . Given that the group has conflict around gender and leadership roles , the conversation would probably focus on how those problems were illustrated by their behaviors on the Wall . The concreteness of the activity would allow for a graphic display of sexist leadership styles . In discussing and reflecting on this experience , it is likely that the group would achieve powerful insights into their typical patterns . Ideally , the men would realize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the women would realize that they needed to take more risks and assume greater initiative . Both groups would resolve to practice these styles on the rest of the course and back in the workplace . <p> The instructor using a third generation or Metaphoric Model ( MM ) approach would also begin by offering the relevant safety rules . However , he would also add a few brief sentences of introduction to the activity . <p> Most corporate groups who attempt the Wall tend to do it in a particular way . At the beginning , they mill around a bit with lots of people offering their suggestions . After some time , a couple of dominant males tend to start the group off . They get a few people to the top and then throw the women over like sacks of potatoes . Then the same group of dominant males decides how to do the hardest part which is getting the last few people up . Afterwards , during the discussion of the exercise , everyone agrees that the leadership was more-or-less sexist and there are various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do the Wall . Other groups have found them and I hope this group does too . <p> As may be imagined , following this introduction , the students become strongly motivated to master the Wall using nonsexist leadership styles . The short introduction has psychologically transformed the Wall from a thirteen foot high plywood contraption which must be physically overcome to an experience which will test/examine/reveal the students ' leadership styles . Should they get over the Wall using nonsexist strategies , they will have both an experiential success and a concrete memory of a time where they were able to work through a difficult problem in a male/female group without discounting feminine contributions . Should they fail the task , there will be a clear and graphic depiction of the obstacles impeding egalitarian leadership in this group . <p> During the post-activity discussion , the instructor will not need to create an awareness that the activity was a metaphor for leadership ; the metaphoric nature of the experience is already clear to the group . As a result , the students will arrive at the discussion eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall . They will want to discuss how those styles were the same as or different from their typical corporate styles , and they will want to examine the meaning of the event for their future behavior . <p> Clearly , both the OBP and MM approaches to the Wall generate powerful educational results , results which should transfer back to the students ' daily lives and provide long term benefits . It is important to note that both approaches are based on perceiving the Outward Bound activity as a metaphor for relevant corporate challenges . The difference between the approaches is that the second generation students generally do not realize the metaphoric nature of the Outward Bound event until the post-activity debriefing . Conversely , third generation students perceive the metaphoric qualities of the experience as they pass through it ; their post-activity discussion focuses on how they reacted to the metaphor , not on how they reacted to the literal experience of surmounting a plywood wall . <p> The title , " Metaphoric Model , " does not refer to the idea that the third generation approach uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is used because learning and transference occur via experiential metaphors in a third generation approach . In contrast , as will be shown below , the OBP model uses cognitive processes --primarily reflection and insight-- to achieve transference . In summary , the basic difference between second and third generation approaches is when the literal experience becomes metaphoric . This difference in timing has critical implications for student learning . <h> A Definition <p> The Metaphoric Model is a way of working with Outward Bound activities which emphasises consciously framing course events so that they become experiential metaphors for salient challenges in the students ' daily lives . The four primary components of the Metaphoric Model are presented below . <p> 1 ) Assessment : The first step in using the Metaphoric Model is to understand the particular students on the course in hopes of determining what challenges and/or problems typica11y characterize this group of people . This research stage usually consists of reviewing the relevant professional literature , consulting with appropriate experts , studying Outward Bound 's experiences in working with this group , and , above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . <p> One of the primary goals of this research is to generate a list of challenges , problematic situations and developmental passages which characterize the population under study . For example , a list of " high risk of relapse situations " might be a useful tool if one were applying Outward Bound to alcoholics or addicts . A similar list for standard course adolescents might be comprised of common developmental challenges such as identity crises , learning to handle peer pressure , and the ability to adapt to a changing relationship with parents . Other lists could be made for the key experiences which typically concern corporate managers , or midlife adults , or Vietnam Veterans , or adolescent substance abusers . <p> The Metaphoric Model is active and directive . As a result , its ethical and effective employment requires a complete and accurate assessment . One can easily imagine what might have occurred in the example above if sexism had not been an issue for the + corporate participants . In that case , the introduction would have been an irrelevant distraction from more salient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their ability to gain anything from the exercise . The participants could have become angry at the instructor 's imposition of the sexism issue or so concerned about conforming that they might lose touch with their own needs . <p> 2 ) Structured Introductions : Once the assessment is complete , the MM instructor frames the course events so that the Outward Bound experiences become psychologically identical to real life challenges . This creation of a psychologically identical context often rests on the use of structured verbal introductions which , as in the example above , are delivered immediately prior to the actual event . <p> The Metaphoric Model however , recognizes that verbal introductions are not the only way to make an Outward Bound event into an experiential metaphor . Every student approaches every Outward Bound event in the context of all of their previous experiences and knowledge . For example , a student will perceive the first event on a course in the context of all that he has heard and read about Outward Bound . Later on in the course , all of the previous course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event . Taking this a bit farther , one can argue that the student 's entire life history is an introduction to the event ; obviously , a student 's personality and experiences will have a significant effect on how an Outward Bound activity is perceived and understood . <p> This implicit introduction to an Outward Bound event can be called , in deference to the tendency to adopt computer terminology , the " default " introduction . Default , as used herein , refers to the way a student will understand an activity if the instructor provides no introduction . A MM instructor is often satisfied to leave this default introduction in place , preferring it over any structured introduction . In making such a decision , however , the instructor makes a conscious choice that the default introduction is appropriate ; if he believes otherwise , he will choose to alter the default using a structured introduction . <p> Finally , effective introductions are not limited to discourses or " mini-lectures " which define a dear cognitive relationship between the Outward Bound activity and the real life challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a more oblique manner ; typically these less overt introductions take the form of readings , poems , or myths and fairy tales . <p> These less intellectually-oriented , less clearly defined introductions are often more powerful because their very lack of definition gives each participant great freedom to make the activity into a metaphor which fits his own life . It is usually easier for each member of a group to apply the moral of a story to his life than it is for each member to find a relevant motif in a lecture . <p> From this context , one can argue that the ultimate form of this freedom lies in offering no introductions --simply leaving the default introduction in place-- as is championed by the MST and OBP models . In support of this contention in an earlier work ( Bacon , 1983 ) , I argued that even without introductions , powerful metaphoric connections occur regularly at Outward Bound . <p> However , many students are unable to make these connections without some assistance , some sort of introduction . This is well documented by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups during post-activity discussions trying to get them to see the relevance of Outward Bound activities to their daily lives . <p> The primary goal of the Metaphoric Model is to help a larger percentage of the group achieve experiential metaphors . Within the context of that goal , the smaller the introduction , and the less defined the introduction , the better . Best of all is no introduction ; next best is a relatively undefined introduction such as a reading , poem , or story ; and least preferred is a formal discourse or mini-lecture . However , the mini-lecture which achieves an experiential metaphor is much to be preferred over a MST or OBP model where experiential learning is only attained by a few students . It is best to strive for a minimal intervention , but to do as much as necessary to achieve a good outcome . <p> The concept " metaphor " has been selected over " analogy " to emphasize the way in which learning at Outward Bound is holistic instead of simply cognitive . The complexity of the tasks , the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the re1ease of adrenaline and other hormones and neurotransmitters , and the uplifting effects of the wilderness environment , all combine to touch a person to his core . Moreover , as argued earlier ( Bacon , 1983 ) , the Outward Bound experiences have a mythic and archetypal character ; participating in course activities often elicits age-old patterns of responding to primal themes such as leadership , cooperation , self-testing , and self-affirmation . <p> In sum , the Outward Bound experience is too globa1 --too all-encompassing-- to be merely an outdoor analogy for daily experiences ; its complexity and unpredictability earns it the title of " metaphoric . " Certainly , the less defined a structured introduction , the more the metaphoric quality of the experience is preserved . However , even with a highly structured introduction --a mini-lecture which defines a dear analogical re1ationship between the course event and a daily life challenge-- the richness and subtlety of the experience will push the student beyond a simple cognitive analogy into the realm of holistic metaphor . <p> 3 ) Double Bind Technology : The Metaphoric Model transforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student 's daily life . This suggests that the third generation approach makes it more difficult for students to have a success on the Outward Bound event ; not only must they master the physical challenge , they must succeed at the metaphoric challenge as well . In the examp1e offered above , the Wall , it is often quite difficult for groups to succeed at the physical challenge . In the context of the sexism introduction , this difficulty becomes magnified . Not only do they have to go over the Wall , full success requires them to use atypical egalitarian leadership styles . <p> When the Metaphoric Model is employed correctly , students must operate at their physical as well as their psychological and existential limits . The presence of this extra challenge suggests that MM students will have greater needs for support and motivation . The Metaphoric Model uses paradox to provide this extra motivation and support . In the example above , the paradoxical technique of " prediction of failure " was used to enhance the group 's motivation to master the Wall in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no easy task . The dictionary defines paradox as " an argument that derives self-contradictory conclusions by valid deduction from acceptable premises . " As the definition implies , the approach rests on the instructor 's ability to give the student a series of logical and compelling statements which , when followed , lead the student into a contradictory position where typical defenses , denials , or fears become difficult or impossible to maintain . The most common paradoxical technique is the " symptom prescription ; " in a symptom prescription , the client or student is encouraged to become even more symptomatic --encouraged to practice the undesirable behaviors . <p> The difference between a paradoxical approach to change and a traditional confrontive , supportive , suggestive approach is like comparing Aikido with boxing . In boxing , the direct approach of striking out at the opponent creates strong resistance : either defense or counterattack . In Aikido , the opponent 's own momentum is used against him , often in surprising ways , and a minimum of effort creates surprisingly powerful results . <p> Similarly , the employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or confrontation with students often leads to resistance . In such instances , it can be useful to employ an indirect or paradoxical approach which utilizes the student 's own typical behaviors , feelings , and beliefs as levers for change . In the corporate example above , directly suggesting that they had sexist tendencies might have been met with denial or resistance . The indirect suggestion that they would find it difficult to avoid emulating the sexist strategies of other corporate groups bypassed the denial and resistance and enhanced motivation . <p> A full description of the paradoxical approach is not possible given the space constraints of this paper . Interested readers are referred to the bibliography ( cf Weeks &amp; L'Abate , 1982 ; Haley , 1973 ; Madanes , 1984 ; Lankton &amp; Lankton , 1983 ; Flsch , Weakland &amp; Segal , 1983 ) . However , a simplified set of characteristics which define most paradoxical interventions is included below and another example of the use of paradox on an Outward Bound course appears later in this paper . <p> a ) Direct or Indirect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use direct techniques or an indirect ( paradoxical ) approach . Direct techniques refer to common sense , logical approaches such as inspiration , support , confrontation , reasoning , and argument . Such approaches are sometimes problematic because they can lead to denial , defensiveness and resistance . It is both time consuming , energy-intensive and difficult to surmount this resistance . If it is anticipated that these types of problems will occur , it is best to bypass them by using indirect techniques . <p> b ) Encourage the Problematic Behavior : If it is likely that the problem behavior will occur despite admonitions to the contrary , the paradoxical instructor does not fight the inevitable . Instead , he generally follows some variation on a strategy which encourages the student to emit the target behavior . In the example above , the students were implicitly encouraged to emit sexist behavior by mentioning that most groups practice it on the Wall . However , the meaning , the context , the amount , the duration , or the exact form of the behavior is subtly altered so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . <p> c ) Reframing : Both the encouragement of the behavior and its subtle alteration are justified by reframing . Sometimes , as in the example above , the reframe labels a conscious choice ( sexist leadership style ) as unconscious or inevitable ; this is usually done in " prediction of failure " paradoxes . At other times the reframing rests on a rationale describing the positive aspects of practicing the behavior . For example , an anxious student before a rock climb could be instructed to meditate on his anxiety since " anxiety leads to caution and caution is important at Outward Bound . " <p> d ) Results : Frequent1y , the result of such an approach is a minimization or cessation of the problematic behavior . This occurs because the instructor 's encouragement of the action and/or the subtle modifications of its practice have made it unappealing . In the anxiety/rock climbing example above , encouraging a student to meditate on his fears disrupts his typical strategy of trying to hold the fears at bay . Often , simply disrupting typical strategies is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The paradoxical approach is a technique which has been developed outside of Outward Bound . The Metaphoric model recommends importing it into Outward Bound courses . Hence , it is logical to argue that in this respect the MM is as dependent on imported techniques as the OBP model . <p> However , paradox differs from most imported techniques in that it is not simply a technique , it is an approach to learning and psychological change which fundamentally differs from the cognitive , behavioral , and psychodynamic theories which currently dominate education and psychology . Paradox rests on a systemic view of psychological causality , rejects medical , pathological and individual-centered paradigms , and is strategic in its implementation . In short , paradox is a new way to understand how people change and grow . If fully understood , it is not one more technique to be added to a " bag of tricks ; " rather , it provides a new conceptual context for human learning which has the potential to transform one 's relationship to and employment of all other techniques . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of post-activity debriefings into the Outward Bound curriculum back in the early 1960 's . Post-activity debriefings are no longer viewed as a technique ; rather , allowing people to talk over their experience is seen as simple common sense --a way to utilize one of the basic mechanisms of human learning . Only time will demonstrate whether paradox earns a comparable role as another representation of a basic human learning mechanism . <p> Clearly , this brief description of the paradoxical approach fails to do justice to this complex topic . For the purpose of this paper , it is simply useful to understand that the paradoxical approach is included in the Metaphoric Model as a way to enhance student motivation and success , an enhancement which is required by the greater demands placed on students by making Outward Bound activities metaphorical before the students attempt to master them . <p> 4 ) The Primacy of Experience : The Metaphoric Model assumes that learning is maximized when it occurs in the midst of the experience . As will be discussed below in further detail , this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reflection or other cognitive processes . <p> The MM rests on a basic assumption about learning and transference : an Outward Bound experience can be psychologically equivalent to a situation in one 's daily life . In an earlier work ( Bacon , 1983 ) , I discussed the mechanisms of this metaphoric equivalence . The connection between Outward Bound course events and real life situations rests on the isomorphism of the experiences --the one to one correspondence between the components of the daily life experience and the Outward Bound event . <p> This is a critical point : in profoundly isomorphic metaphors , the student will be living two realities simultaneously . In literal reality , he will be having an Outward Bound course experience ; in psychological reality , he will be having both the course experience and the correspondent real-life experience . The mechanism of the transderivational search ties the two experiences together so tightly that one can not be separated from the other . <p> When two experiences are tied together this intimately , the established strategy of the real life experience will usually prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style as the real life experience . If the student usually handles the situation well , he will have a success during the metaphoric experience , and if he usually handles it poorly , he will have a failure . However , the Outward Bound course is explicitly organized to facilitate success experiences . When failure strategies are encountered , the instructor , the patrol , and course format help generate a counter-typical resolution to the metaphoric challenge --a resolution that gives the student a success experience . In achieving this success experience , the student has installed a new strategy . He now has two ways of responding to his situation : the old way , which leads to failure and decreased self-esteem , and the new approach , which demonstrably leads to mastery . And this new strategy will now be available in any real-life situations that are isomorphic with the metaphoric experience . <p> The concept of simultaneously living two realities is of course an ideal . In practice , the metaphor is never perfectly isomorphic with the real life situation ; even psychologically speaking , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is no question that in well-formed metaphors there will be profound and meaningful links with isomorphic real life experiences . People who have had a metaphoric experience in which the outcome has been successfully altered will have reorganized their typical life strategies ( pp. 9-10 ) . <p> Clearly this sort of equivalence of separate experiences occurs fortuitously and somewhat randomly during Outward Bound courses and at other times in people 's lives . Many seemingly coincidental and spontaneous insights are due to this equivalence . In the context of understanding this isomorphic process , one can restate the aim of the MM approach : it attempts --consciously , care-fully , and ethically-- to facilitate this process of equivalency for the benefit and learning of Outward Bound students . <p> Successful passage through a metaphorically equivalent experience gives students a powerful positive memory which is almost as compelling as the experience of mastering the real life challenge . But what if a student has a literal failure experience on an Outward Bound course ? What if he tips over in the rapids or can not complete the rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not guarantee that all activities will result in literal successes . For example , sup-pose the corporate managers made it over the Wall using sexist leadership styles . The post-activity debriefing , would probably focus on the group 's inability to operate in an egalitarian manner in spite of a strong motivation to avoid sexism . This type of discussion is as dependent on reflection and insight as a debriefing conducted by second generation instructors ; the difference , of course , is that some time was saved by pre-establishing the metaphoric nature of the Wall before experiencing it . Furthermore , the students will be applying the tools of reflection and insight to the question of " Why could n't we change old habits when we were trying ? " instead of " Was n't our performance on the Wall just like the leadership styles typically employed back at the corporation ? " <p> Clearly , the Metaphoric Model continues to endorse the utility of insight and reflection . However , their importance is deemphasized in comparison with the power of learning in the midst of experience . Moreover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection and insight to operate more easily , more powerfully , and more graphically . Finally , as will be demonstrated below , the employment of the paradoxical approach tends to minimize student attempts to rationalize or discount their Outward Bound behaviors . <p> In order to illustrate the four characteristics which define the Metaphoric Model , another example , this one from an Outward Bound course for alcoholics , will be offered . The following introduction attempts to make an Outward Bound ropes course experience metaphorically equivalent to a " high risk of relapse " situation . The students will be required to handle an experience related to exposure to stimuli associated with alcohol ; in other words , they will receive some training in how to resist temptation . As one might expect , research suggests that exposure to such stimuli often results in a drinking relapse . <p> I 'm sure that many of you have heard descriptions of this next activity . the ropes course . As you can see , it 's a big jungle gym in the trees . But it 's a jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; many of them talk more about this than anything else on the course . Most of them talk about how frightening it was . <p> From our point of view though , we do n't use it to practice courage or risk taking or anything like that . What good would that be ? Does it really help your sobriety to be able to walk a narrow log between two trees ? Does the fact that you can do that mean you wo n't take a drink ? No , it does n't mean that . <p> But we do think the ropes course does have something to do with sobriety and I 'll tell you why . At some point on this ropes course we expect that you 'll feel some degree of challenge , risk , maybe even fear . And we want you to feel that , not because we want you to experience those things for their own sake , not because we think being scared is good for you , but for another reason . Because when we see that you are in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a rather strange thing . <p> But before telling you exactly what we 're going to do , I need to diverge for a moment . Research has shown that many alcoholics return to drinking because they ca n't resist temptation . You know , like the temptation of passing by your old favorite bar or having a friend or acquaintance invite you out for ' Just one , " or whatever . So we 've designed this particular ropes course activity with this temptation situation in mind . <p> I know you are all used to depending on staff for support for your sobriety and you have probably also gotten used to the idea that the Outward Bound instructors are on your side ; but today , because we think it 'll help your sobriety , we 're going to reverse that . Out there in the real world , you 're going to be tempted ; and when that happens , you 're going to be all alone . And it maybe your best friend pushing alcohol on you just when you want a drink real badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is , just when it gets real hard on the ropes course and you 're really tempted to quit , we --that is , the instructors-- are going to try and talk you into quitting . That 's right ; instead of offering support or help , we 're going to try and get you to come down or , at least , we 're going to suggest that you only have it in you to do it the easy way . You might hear us say , " Hey Joe , you 've done enough . " Or , " It 's OK to come down ; this does n't really have to do with sobriety . " Or , " You 've already done as much as can be expected of you given your fear of heights . Why do n't you just come down now ? " <p> What I 'm saying is , you ca n't trust us on this one . Or maybe I 'm saying that you need to trust your own ability to know what 's right and do it no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that in reality , we all hope that you 'll complete the ropes course . And I can tell you that right now in a very clear manner . It would please us all , if every one of you has a total success . But we might not be acting like that in a few minutes . During the course , from time to time you 'll see and hear us trying our best to tempt you or your friends . You 'll see us trying to talk you off of the ropes course . Of course , most of the time we 'll just be helping out , just like we usually do , but when the crunch is on , you may notice that we 've shifted into another perspective . <p> Do all of you understand this ? Do you know why we may be encouraging quitting or taking the easy way out ? ( Get answers and respond appropriately . ) <p> When this introduction is offered in a caring and concerned manner , it typically results in an enhancement of the alcoholics ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heights , lack of strength , or what ever . They act as if they are more afraid of succumbing to the temptations offered by the instructors than of the actual ropes course events . The introduction often results in more events attempted and more student successes than a standard introduction . It also has the fringe benefit of eliminating the " talk the hesitant student over the high beam " role of the instructor . This type of support sometimes degenerates into a somewhat bizarre power struggle where the student attempts to prove he can not do it and the instructor argues that he can . Not only are these types of inappropriate encounters eliminated , the student feels that he has accomplished the course independently using his own strengths . <p> When there is a succumbing to temptation --an actual withdrawal from the ropes course-- the debriefing is almost guaranteed to go well . The withdrawal is perceived by the entire student group as a meaningful event , as a sign that the quitter is vulnerable to the kind of temptation which will be encountered on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of excuses like fear of heights or lack of strength are disputed energetically by the group . The group tends to break through the alcoholic 's denial and there are significant therapeutic gains both for the withdrawer and for the other group members . <p> This example has all of the characteristic marks of the Metaphoric Model . First , it is based on appropriate assessment findings ; alcoholics generally do need to learn how to handle temptation . Second , it in uses a structured introduction to make the ropes course , an experience which in a literal sense has little to do with their lives , into something which is highly relevant . Third , it employs the paradoxical technique of " pre-scribing the symptom . " And fourth , the primary learning of the alcoholics will occur in the midst of experience as they choose how to respond to the instructor 's solicitations in the context of their own fear and doubt . Finally , if they have had a failure experience , the debriefing is set up in such a way that there is a minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bound experience . Above all else , the introduction ensures that the alcoholics will not literally be climbing around in the trees ; rather , they will be experientially confronting a kind of temptation that is directly related to sobriety . <p> Before leaving this section on the Metaphoric Model , it is important to emphasize that it does not attempt to provide a complete explanation for all of the learning which occurs on an Outward Bound course . The amount of change and growth enjoyed by Outward Bound students is not limited by the degree to which their life experiences are isomorphic with and tightly analogous to course challenges . Learning at Outward Bound can not be fully described by such a reductionistic model . <p> Recognizing this , in an earlier work ( Bacon , 1983 ) , I argued at some length that a metaphoric approach needed to be supplemented by a mythic or archetypal model . Using such a model , the Outward Bound experience can be conceptualized as an opportunity for students to participate in age-old patterns of learning --an opportunity to recreate symbolically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myth and fairy tale . A later work ( Bacon , Kimble &amp; Taylor , in press ) , applied this same archetypal perspective to Outward Bound troubled youth programs and paid particular attention to the similarity between modern wilderness challenge experiences and traditional rites of passage . This is not a new theme in the Outward Bound literature . Lev ( 1968 ) and others ( cf Shore , 19 76 ) have discussed this aspect of Outward Bound in some detail . <p> This sort of archetypal/mythic model has much intuitive appeal . Its numinous qualities fit the esthetic/spiritual feel of the wilderness and it provides a kind of explanation for the powerful and dramatic transformations often experienced by Outward Bound students . Moreover , it avoids reducing the Outward Bound process to a box defined by a set of psychological or educational themes --a reduction practitioners and students have repeatedly and vigorously resisted . <p> Unfortunately , in spite of the appeal of such an explanation , it has been very difficult to develop the archetypal/mythic approach to the point where it is capable of achieving specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as luck , the openness of the students , and the charisma of the instructors . While programming may eventually be developed which takes advantage of the full potential of this model , at present , specific pedagogical and curriculum recommendations do not exist . <p> In summary , with full recognition that the Metaphoric Model does not describe the whole of the Outward Bound process , it does provide a technology which allows one to gain a bit more control over a part of that process . An Outward Bound instructor who completely depended on the Metaphoric Model would miss out on much of the potential of the course ; yet one who turned his back on this approach would lose the opportunity to influence the course outcomes in a positive direction . <p> The Ascendancy of Experience over Insight <p> Outward Bound theorists have remained true to Dewey 's famous dicturn that experiential learning is not simply " experience " but " reflection on experience . " For example , Gager ( 1977 ) makes the following comments about the centrality of thought and insight to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical analvsis and reflection is the final ingredient in the process flow . In this context I am referring to the need to 1 ) link practice with theory , 2 ) reflect upon and examine one 's experience in order for it to " take " ; and 3 ) attempt to make a transfer from what is learned through experience to broader considerations . Experience alone does not automatically produce learning ( p. 10 , underlining in original ) . <p> Putnam ( 1985 ) , an Outward Bound school director , comments in a similar vein . <p> An Outward Bound course necessarily allows time for reflection on experience ... The event or task is experienced , and this leads to reflective observation , which is followed by an intellectual " sorting-out " process . The final stage of the cycle sees the experimental application of the new concepts , thus providing further experience .... Central to this process is the responsibility of the participant , helped by his companions and the staff , to review and evaluate continuously what occurs during and following the course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may include the preparation of a formal assessment or self-assessment in written or recorded form ( p. 5 ) . <p> Finally , Kalisch ( 1979 ) discusses his view of the function of the intellect in the Outward Bound learning process . <p> After an experience has been rendered into words it can then be subjected to disciplined thinking . This is the real work of learning ... Real learning occurs when a student actively utilizes his awareness in a way which effects his self-concept and his relationship to the existing environment . True logical conclusions are reached and stand ready for integration and implementation ... The instructor 's task is to facilitate as much reflective thinking as possible . Yet , this is not to imply that the program should center itself entirely around this objective . That would indicate a misunderstanding of its role in learning . Experience provides the raw material for thought ; in the absence of new information gained by personal experience , reflection can become a repugnant and pointless activity ( pp. 69-70 ) . <p> Gager , Putnam , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , analysis , and insight for the Outward Bound learning process . As mentioned above , the Metaphoric Model has no direct quarrel with reflection , analysis , or insight ; in fact , these tools are essential when debriefing certain activities . <p> However , these factors do not need to be the center of the Outward Bound process . In the Metaphoric Model , the primary focus is on setting up the experience so that learning and behavioral change are accomplished in the midst of the course experience . Given that the introduction has made the course activity psychologically equivalent to salient real life challenges , it is assumed that a success at the course activity automatically transfers and generalizes . Post-activity discussions are primarily re-served for ratifying already existent learnings . <p> " Ratify , " as used here , describes a process in which an individual offers testimony about new behaviors or insights . The group then gives him support by agreeing that he did indeed do something or learn something valuable and worthwhile . In addition , the student will often implicitly or explicitly state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will look to the group for approval and consensual validation . In the ropes course example , the process of ratification would be operating if an alcoholic were to discuss how he felt tempted to come down from the trees in the midst of the activity but then mastered himself and persevered in good style . The group would reinforce his choices and implicitly suggest that it would be good for him to continue to use this new strategy in future situations . <p> This type of ratification is very important in terms of solidifying and stabilizing experiential learnings . Most human beings need some sort of consensual agreement to concretize new self-perceptions and new world views . For example , Watzlawick ( 1984 ) argues that reality is socially constructed ; that is , he believes that an individual 's perception of himself and his world is constantly supported by feed back from a network of social contacts . Watkins ( 1986 ) believes that patients attempting to change through psychotherapy need to articulate and receive support from a new self-image . Watkins thinks this is especially important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as catharsis or abreactions . In fact , he argues that the ratification process is so critical that clients who do not experience it may have difficulty sustaining their personality improvements . <p> The Metaphoric Model 's emphasis on experience and its complementary de-emphasis on reflection and insight occur for two reasons . First , there is a wish to underscore Outward Bound 's commitment to experiential learning . Increasing Outward Bound 's ability to work with experience is to further develop Outward Bound 's indigenous approach to human development . To develop reflection on experience and insight is to follow education and psychology . There is nothing intrinsically wrong with emulating these worthwhile fields ; however , it distracts from Outward Bound 's unique purview : the use of adventure-oriented experience . Besides , it is unlikely that Outward Bound instructors will ever be quite as effective at facilitating reflection , group process , and insight as educators and psychologists . Why concentrate on someone else 's specialization ? Why not concentrate on what Out-ward Bound does best ? <p> The second reason for this de-emphasis on insight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflection are necessary or even helpful factors in character development . Taking an anti-insight stance is , of course , somewhat heretical . Psychodynamic therapy and its school of thought have dominated character development theory for almost a century . Its influence is so strong that the twin factors prized so highly by dynamic therapists --insight and reflection-- are considered to be absolutely necessary for significant personal growth . <p> However , in the 1960 's and 1970 's , two other schools of thought emerged which began to challenge psychodynamic psychotherapy 's assumptions about the fundamental importance of insight . The first of these was the cognitive/behavioral school . Alfred Bandura , a member of this school of thought and one of the most prominent psychologists in America , reviewed the research on psychotherapy and wrote the following about insight : " It is evident from the results of interpretive approaches that a therapist who leads his clients to believe that insight will alleviate their behavioral malfunctioning is unlikely to accomplish the changes he implies ( Bandura , 1969 , p. 103 ) . " <p> A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic therapy school . Haley ( 1973 ) gives literally dozens of examples of profound personal changes occurring in people 's lives without insight and went so far as to write a series of satiric essays suggesting that the psychodynamic devotion to insight could actually keep people from changing ( Haley , 1986 ) . Milton Erickson commented that " insight into the past may be somewhat educational , but insight into the past is n't going to change the past ( Zeig , 1980 , p. 69 ) . " And as a final example , Weeks and L'Abate ( 1982 ) , two noted psychologists , also denigrate the efficacy of insight . <p> In fact , it appears that some clients use insight-oriented therapy to avoid making changes . Insight may help clients better understand themselves and their relationships to others , but this fact does not mean they will change their behavior . The fact that couples change more rapidly in problem-solving therapy than in insight therapy has recently been demonstrated empirically by Slipp and Kressel ( p. 82 ) . <p> Given these possible limitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's traditional emphasis on experience , the Metaphoric Model chooses to deemphasize cognitions and prioritize behavioral change . But not simply any behavioral change --rather , it emphasizes generating new behavior in the context of an experience which is metaphorically equivalent to a problematic or challenging situation in the student 's daily life . <p> Success in this context leads to a different type of insight : an experiential rather than a cognitive insight . Having a relevant success experience creates a gut level understanding of one 's former behaviors . For example , how often people who have just solved a personal problem comment , " Now , in hindsight , I see so clearly what I was doing wrong --how I caused the entire situation . " Such a phrase is uttered with relative ease once the person has had a success and is sure that they have mastered the difficulty . Conversely , insight without the prior experience of an actual success often generates a statement which lacks confidence , eg " I see what I 'm doing wrong and I 'll try to change it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Metaphoric Model generates the comfortable and confident insights which accompany an already solved problem . Conversely , the MST and OBP models foster a different type of insight , an insight based on reflection , discussion and cognitive processes . This insight is not founded on an experiential success ; rather , it is based on abstract , cognitive connections between Outward Bound experiences and real life challenges . Even after these connections have been made , the best that the student can hope for is a relatively weak , intellectual insight into his tendencies to be caught in unproductive patterns . Perhaps this new knowledge will help him , but he is not sure . <p> In spite of the weakness of OBP insight when compared to the Metaphoric Model 's experiential strategies , it is still vastly superior to the type of insight fostered in a clinic or doctor 's office . The second generation form of insight is based on an analysis of concrete and graphic behaviors , behaviors which have been emitted in stressful , challenging situations and witnessed by an entire group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a person , it tends to be achieved more quickly and easi1y than the abstract struggle with second hand events practiced in a clinic . <p> Interestingly , the Metaphoric Model 's experientially derived form of insight is similar to something strategic therapists call pragmatic insight . Note that in the following passage , Weeks and L'Abate ( 1982 ) differentiate pragmatic insight from traditional insight by the degree to which it is grounded in experience . <p> The kind of insight produced from a paradoxical intervention is different from that produced by reflection or interpretation ( ie by words ) . Most insights are generated by the therapist 's verbalizations and the impact on the client is questionable . We believe most insights are nothing more than cognitions --thoughts about overt behavior . A paradox , on the other hand , can produce a pragmatic insight . This kind of insight emerges from the systematic manipulation of the client by the therapist , but it is a self-generated insight . The therapist merely provides a structure for an experience-- not the interpretation of that experience . The insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Its truth is utterly convincing and inescapable . It is such a powerful insight that the client may slip into a trance state as the insight occurs . It might be noted that using the term pragmatic to describe this type of insight is consistent with William James ' ( 1907 ) pragmatic theory of truth . For James , truth referred to whether an idea worked , and whether any idea worked depended upon some form of action leading to an experience ( p.143 , underlining and parens in original ) . <p> It is clear from this quote that the authors are not actually anti-insight ; rather , they are critical of traditional forms of insight , but in favor of " pragmatic " insights which actually lead to change . <p> It is also interesting to note their insistence that this pragmatic insight is self-generated insight , albeit a self-generated insight which arises from a structured experience . Similarly , the Metaphoric Modelis paradoxically both highly directive and strongly committed to ensuring students ' control over their own learning . While there is a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies , there is an equal devotion to allowing him to decide what type of choices to make for the future . In the example of the Wall , the sexist leadership strategies were discouraged but the students were not told how to act to be egalitarian . They developed their own approach to egalitarian leadership without any influence from the instructor . This strategy reflects one of the basic assumptions of the Metaphoric Model : if an individual 's blocks to success are removed , they will be capable of generating an effective solution to their problems without any outside coaching . <p> Curriculum Evolution as a Spiral : Reconciling Opposing Views <p> This paper has spent much energy contrasting the strengths and weaknesses of the three different Outward Bound curriculum models and arguing the superiority of the third generation approach . This challenge-oriented style has been consciously selected because of the characteristics of two subgroups of adventure-based educators . The first of these subgroups is made up of educators who tend to be eclectic and pragmatic in their approach to working with the Outward Bound process . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques in hopes of achieving better out-comes with their students . This kind of openness is laudable and has led to many valuable innovations and powerful courses . <p> The potential drawback to such openness is that some of these instructors abandon a critical approach to evaluating their Outward Bound teaching tools . Everything is thrown into a large " bag of tricks . " Very few of these " tricks " are considered better or worse , more or less effective ; rather , they are all considered potentially equal if employed at the right time with the right group of students . The bag of tricks can grow to the point where it becomes difficult to sort through , to the point where there is no unifying theoretical model tying together the diverse technical applications . <p> Arguing the superiority of a third generation model over the first two models is an attempt to encourage good instruction by emphasizing the importance of consciously and carefully selecting a certain theoretical stance to organize one 's technical applications . Even if a third generation model is rejected , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivate instructors to choose and use another model in a consistent manner . <p> In marked contrast to this first group of instructors , who are characterized by their excessive openness , there is another group who might be described as excessively conservative . These instructors hesitate to experiment with their instructional style once they have discovered an approach which reliably generates a peak experience at the end of the course . The challenging style of this paper is intended to attack this level of complacency directly in hopes of encouraging further risk-taking and learning . <p> Regardless of how useful this challenge-oriented , superior/inferior stance might be for some instructors , it is somewhat contradicted by reality . An in-depth examination of the three different models suggests that the lines between them are not all that clear . For example , the discussion of the effectiveness of the insight available through each model is oversimplified . The power of MM insight rests on the equivalency of the course and daily life experiences . Yet even the most potent MM introduction only makes a course event similar to the real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are never totally identical . Given that fact , a metaphoric course success is not completely equivalent to mastery of the real life challenge . <p> Furthermore , in a second generation approach , after a student gains intellectual insight , he may be able to test that insight on the next Outward Bound activity . Essentially , the first event and its debriefing serve as an introduction to the second event . If the student achieves an experiential success during this second event , one can argue that the OBP model also provides insight which is grounded in experience . <p> Earlier in this paper it was argued that gifted and/or fortunate students achieve spontaneous metaphoric connections without any help from the instructor . In this sense , experiential metaphors occur in every model and are not limited to the Metaphoric Model . Furthermore , it has also been noted that Outward Bound can be most powerful when it is most metaphoric --as opposed to analogous-- and that this occurs most easily when introductions are kept to a minimum or are indirect and oblique . Obviously the MST and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In summary , it appears that the three models do not form a discrete typology , rather , it is much more likely that they are different , and perhaps progressively more sophisticated , forms of the same process . One can speak of three discrete forms for heuristic purposes , but , in reality , there is only one model : the Outward Bound model . In this sense , evolution may be an incorrect term ; perhaps " unfolding " or " deepening " describes the transitions between models more accurately . Tom James ( personal communication , November 4 , 1987 ) summarized the relationships between the models as follows . <p> Rather than a typology , rather than three discrete stages of development , there appears in your view of evo1ution to be a sort of spiral ; the older stages are not so much left behind as deepened and transformed into a better engagement with personality change . If you succeed in persuading the practitioners at Outward Bound that stage three is the way to go , then you will have brought Outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep play , " an encompassing moment of profound understanding through collective action . The depth of that play is transforming not only because it adds to older stages of the process , but because it more fully expresses them , mining their potential to a greater degree . <p> 1 . The Wall is a thirteen or fourteen foot high smooth wall without any handholds or footholds . The purpose of the exercise is to get the entire group over the top . Once a person is over , he can no longer assist the students remaining on the initial side of the Wall except by pulling from the top . Hence , the crux of the exercise is to figure out how to get the last few students over the Wall .

These can be understood as making up the philosophical fabric of phenomenological views about psychology . <p> Historically , the phenomenological perspective can be traced to Wilhelm Wundt who is often considered as having conducted the first formal psychological research in the 1870 's . Wundt had people " introspect " , that is concentrate on and report on subjective conscious experience . Introspection was seen as lacking in scientific rigour and as not having any particular application , then psychoanalysis which emphasized the unconscious mind came along and become more dominant . Interestingly , though , in the 1950 's and 1960 's sense of political and personal freedom , the importance and interest in subjective experience become more interesting again to psychology .

@@41691652 @1691652/ <h> A socio-cultural history of outdoor education <p> A sociocultural history of outdoor education suggests that outdoor education has emerged as a semi-ritualized form of encounter with nature since Western consciousness moved indoors . <p> Once upon a time , all education took place in the outdoors . <p> In the days of hunter/gatherer lifestyles , a child learnt by observing others and experiencing the challenges of survival for him/her self . <p> But early on humans also began making shelters . The " door " became physically and symbolically a critical access point between the inner sanctum of relative protection ( inside ) and the relative wild and uncontrollable outside . Previously the human only lived inside his/her skull and skin , occasionally journeying outwards on shamanistic flights . <p> But with the advent of simple dwellings , the human consciousness expanded and became contained within the space of the house . Two critical aspects of the house negotiated entry and exit of consciousness -- the door and , later , the window . <p> The door has had a remarkable and profound cultural impact . Huxley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Doors " ( e.g. , " Break on through " ) are just two examples of the power of the symbology expressed by the door explored in recent culture . Both these references draw their inspiration from William Blake 's poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell : <p> If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is : Infinite . <p> When the invention of the door was combined with industralization there was a mass shifting of the loci of human consciousness indoors . Long forays into forays into the natural , outside world in order satisfy their basic living needs became the exception rather than the rule . It was not the door per se -- animals also use door technology for a variety of purposes ; molluscs , for example , are experts , as are trap-door spiders , and many mammals , such as those which use tunnels -- the problem was the massive shift of consciousness away from intimate encounter with the rhythms of nature . <p> During the twentieth century , the fruits of industrialization became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilizations . Houses and suburbs got cluttered with possessions and absorbed the time and focus that people used to spend engaged with the natural environment . Industrialized countries lost connection with the sustainable systems of nature . The people of industrialized nations lived during the 19th and 20th century lived off the back of nature and off the back of people in less industrialized nations , two-thirds of whom lived in poverty . The resource consumption rate of the average US citizen , for example , is approximately six times that of the rest of the world . <p> Its a remarkable story but so much of the remarkableness is lost because its common knowledge which is taken for granted . The situation needs to be " made strange " to sense its remarkability . For example , what observations would aliens make about our human situation ? They might report back to their fellow aliens something like these World facts about the universe and human activity . <p> The excising of everyday contact with nature for humans was problematic not only for the natural environment , but also for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of evolution to live in natural environments ( E. O. Wilson 's biophilia hypothesis ) . What 's more , there seems to be an innate calling to adventure in the human ( as Jung said , " man needs difficulties ; they are necessary for health " ) to keep the survival instinct sharp and strong . The difficulties inherent in surviving in nature are perfect for the shaping of human behavior and nature 's deeper effect on the psyche has been critical in guiding humans through the past challenges and , undoubtedly , the future challenge of sustainable human living on earth . <p> Outdoor education , then , can be understood as a logical response to the widespread societal disconnection from immediate experience with nature-based living . Since industrialization created material wealth and humans have largely lost the simple cultural living skills , they now largely either fear returning to nature at all , or return scared and ill-prepared , thus feeling the need to drag along excessive amounts of equipment . The tent , for example , in most situations , really only serves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sense that the individual is protected from the unknown . <p> In this socio-cultural sense , outdoor education programs are symptomatic of post-industrial societies suffering from prolonged and institutionalized disconnection from the natural environment . <p> Outdoor education programs can be very valuable in helping individuals or groups to develop higher levels of functionality and consciousness , but unless longer-term , nature-based living systems are the real purpose , then the value resources and efforts used for a foray into the woods remain somewhat questionable . Currently , outdoor education programs are a mere drop in the ocean of the global human challenge . Whilst this might seem grim , let us take heart from the wisdom of Marx : <p> Mankind always sets itself only such problems as it can solve ; since , looking at the matter more closely , it will always be found that the task itself arises onlywhen the material conditions for its solution already existor at least in the process of formation.Karl Marx , A Critique of Political Economy ( 1859 ) <p> Outdoor education programs , then , can be seen then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more widespread rejuvenation of sustainable living experiments . To date , outdoor education programs have largely been in an extended hippy period , functioning as modern substitutes for the paganistic , romantic attachment to a simpler lifestyle in the Garden of Eden . Then commercialism got hold of outdoor education programming and we now have a glut of irreverent , shallow outdoor education programming . But there are grains of gold and speckles of jewels deep within outdoor education programs -- and therein lay many fascinating examples , possibilities , experiments , research leads , and inspirational people . From these beginnings and with existing outdoor education infrastructure we can stand a chance of initiating a new phase of programming which will help guide human adaptation for the future . After all , the new phase of human history will have to be one of human adaptation and only nature can teach us how to adapt .

Thus , conducting program evaluations is becoming a necessity for many programs . <h> Reason #2 : Morality - Because you want to ! <p> There is also a moral argument that it is a responsibility of those who design and conduct the programs to be rigorous in ensuring the best possible experiences are provided for participants .

In this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer-reviewed research and formal program evaluation . <p> There are several other motivations for research and evaluation ( see 7 stage hierarchy ) , but necessity ( external motivation ) and morality ( internal motivation ) are the two major ends of the motivational spectrum underlying efforts to conduct program evaluation . <h> Common Practices in Program Evaluation <p> Richards , Neill and Butters ( 1997 ) surveyed 113 attendees at the 10th National Outdoor Education Conference in Australia about the nature of their outdoor education work and program evaluation practices . <p> More than half of the recipients reported working with programs which evaluated participants ' and teachers ' overall satisfaction with the program and satisfaction with operational aspects of the program ( such as food , accommodation etc. ) ( see Table 1 ) .

Critical to their knowledge was their indigenous spirituality , which was intimately connected with nature . It may be that in outdoor education some new reconstruction of early forms of indigenous knowledge and spirituality could be developed . The idea is not necessarily to reinstitute old ways ( neigh impossible ) but rather to build new indigenous sub-cultures that could mine the wilderness for wisdom rather than for its material value . In many ways outdoor education already is an artificial replacement ( shot-in-the-arm ) for the loss of indigenous culture . --&gt; Go to Indigenous Knowledge &amp; Outdoor Education . <h> Amazing Event ( planned ) Spirituality <p> Spirituality has elements of predictability .

Extreme tasks can serve to break down human identity ( which is a protective , survival feature ) and reveal deeper inner and outer realms . This is the basis , for example , of rites of passage , a concept that several have linked to outdoor education . <h> Spontaneous ( unplanned ) Spiritual Experiences <p> Often the most memorable or impactful part of outdoor education program is unplanned . A spontaneous moment in nature , possibly watching an animal , experiencing a weather change can provoke an unplanned spiritual experience . Also , one unique individual in a group , be they a group member or a leader , can catalyze unplanned spiritual experiences .

Innovative experimentations are needed with outdoor education as a method for helping to guide adolescents into successful adulthoods in the twenty-first century . <p> Traditionally , adolescent identity development was facilitated via culturally-guided rites of passage involving physical and spiritual challenges . However , in modern Western society , there is a lack of such experiences available for young people . <p> Problem-behaviours such as delinquency and drug-abuse can be seen as natural risk-taking behaviours through which adolescents seek to explore their potential .

How , then , are we expecting young people to ' cut their teeth ' on the world and forge for themselves a strong sense of personal identity and capabilities for handling the twenty-first century ? <p> Over the past century , the responsibility for providing meaningful developmental experiences for young people has increasingly been placed on schools . Schools have become the mass training ground for children and youth in Western society and , increasingly , are being seen as intervention sites for primary and secondary prevention programs . <p> Unlike the relatively uniform academic curricula in mainstream schooling , the degree of emphasis on , and methodology of , approaches to personal , social and community development of students varies substantially between schools . <p> The mainstream education system is often criticized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adolescents . In responding though , there is a temptation to only respond to the most immediate , acute needs , such as suicide and drug-abuse . However , more than ever we need preventative efforts which foster a secure sense of self and allow adolescents to develop a flexible repertoire of skills for navigating and creating their future . <p> One way in which our society has responded to the call for education of the whole person is by including personal and/or character development as part of the school curriculum , such as through classes focused citizenship , health and physical education , religious studies , etc . <p> A second way is by offering extracurricular activities ( such as school plays , sporting activities , camps , etc. ) as a companion to the mainstream curriculum . <p> A third way has been to adjust the whole curriculum and focus of a school to reflect a primary goal of providing personal development for students , such as in Steiner and Montessori schools . <p> One form of prevention program which is becoming increasingly utilized is outdoor education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurous challenges , using involving living and expeditioning in the outdoors . <p> Activities often include camping , hiking , rafting , abseiling , and rockclimbing , but with a special focus on facilitating social , emotional , and intellectual growth .

At their best , outdoor education programs can provide adolescents with effective rites of passage in developing skills for life . <p> Some features of effective school-based primary prevention programs which can be recommended are that the program : <p> be physically oriented , <p> use the school context , but outside of the immediate school environment , <p> take place in a residential setting , <p> be of a long duration , <p> be conducted by therapists or trained group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teachers , and <p> include teachers , parents and others involved with adolescents as targets in the program ( Neill , 1994 ) . <p> Although such lists can be created , it important to remain open to a wide variety of ways in which we can better guide todays adolescents towards effective adulthoods .

@@41691677 @1691677/ <h> The Future of Outward Bound <p> For the first couple of decades after Outward Bound was started in the 1940 's there were few other major adventure education programs . Today it is a different story . Outward Bounds survival may even be threatened by a market flooded with other outdoor education competitors and specialized adventure organizations targeting specific sets of clientele ( e.g. , corporate outdoor programs ) . Many from outside the Outward Bound movement have commented that the organization has been too slow to change . <p> Recent years have seen several mergers of schools , including the two Canadian schools , two of the US schools , and in the UK , Outward Bound merged with Duke of Edinburgh . On the other hand , there continues to be an exciting growth of Outward Bound in countries such as Costa Rica , Brazil , Czech Republic , and so on . Outward Bound International is struggling financially , which is problematic at a crucial time in the organization 's history . <p> The leaders of Outward Bound today must create an innovative , practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on reputation and past successes . The unique strengths around which a new future for Outward Bound could be developed are : <p> 1 . History &amp; Reputation : Generally speaking , the reputation of Outward Bound is very good , and Outward Bound can trade on this and its impressive history , but this is stronger if combined with its other strengths . <p> 3 . Extensive International Network : Currently Outward Bound schools operate very independently . There is either an international staff symposia or international Outward Bound conference once a year . There seems to be considerable , as yet unrealized potential , however , for greater international collaboration between individual schools or coordinated by Outward Bound International . It seems strange , for example , that Outward Bound has not invested in an international marketing website for its programs or in seeking grants for international programs . <p> 4 . Rich Knowledge Base , including extensive research evidence , program information , staff training modules , etc . There is a massive knowledge base of outdoor education information and expertise within Outward Bound schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this information between Outward Bound schools , let alone with the outside world . The potential value of this information could be examined and marketed/sold in the form of training packages or degree programs , books , articles , videos , etc . <p> Outward Bounds Innovative Possibilities <p> So what will be unique about Outward Bound in the future ? Here are some practical , radical suggestions for the future of Outward Bound . The history of Outward Bound is one of innovation . In this day and age , further innovation is required for fulfilling the long-term vision of Hahn . Hahn was critical of Outward Bound later in his life . He felt that its leaders were sitting on the laurels , satisfied with having added a few more schools . In 1960 Hahn chastised the Outward Bound Trust ( UK ) : <p> " will you be satisfied to increase at a slow and safe rate the number of new schools , or will you hear the cry for help from bewildered and frustrated youths all over the world and accept a missionary assignment ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution , and is capable of doing so " . <p> I often wondered what Hahn would say and inspire today , were he still alive . <h> What if the international network invested more heavily in Kurt Hahns philosophy ? <p> Hahn 's philosophy has been perennial , and the Outward Bound movement could promote and develop Kurt Hahn 's philosophy more avidly . <p> Perhaps a larger Kurt Hahn network needs to formed with the Round Square Schools , Duke of Edinburgh and other Kurt Hahn inspired institutions ? A well-conceived network extend Outward Bounds possibilities through deeper connection to Kurt Hahn philosophy and his other educational projects ? United under the umbrella of Kurt Hahn 's philosophy , these educational movements could better support one another with ideas , resources , and innovations . <h> What if the international network made more of collective Outward Bound knowledge ? <p> Knowledge management is a buzzword in the information society . One of the opportunities for Outward Bound is to effectively organize its philosophical , theory , research and practice resources . For example , the American Camping Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and have received over a half million dollars ( US ) for a large research study . ACAs strategic planning reveals a belief that research and knowledge management are important for the future of camping in America . <p> Currently , the international Outward Bound website has limited downloadable resources to help people learn about Outward Bound . Likewise , there is no clear schedule of publishing or media campaigning by the Outward Bound movement internationally . Small schools , in particular , are very much left to fend for themselves . Greater efficiency and productivity could be facilitated by developing some centralized resources , such as fact sheets on Outward Bound theory and research , staff training modules on facilitation skills , etc. which individual schools could incorporate into their operations . <p> The rich , but scattered knowledge base of Outward Bound has yet to be optimized . In my opinion , a strategic plan for research and knowledge management is needed at an international level . <p> The Global Facilitation Network is the beginning of a vital process which can bring schools together in a rewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many other ways in which an international Outward Bound knowledge base can be created . <h> Outward Bound should be aiming to fuel an educational revolution in the 21st century <p> Were Kurt Hahn alive today , I imagine that he would be calling for no less than a complete , innovative overhaul of Outward Bound programs to improve their pervasiveness and relevance to society . I doubt that he would be happy with the Outward Bound experiment as it stands , although he would be pleased , I think , to see the flourishing of the outdoor education movement more generally . <p> Where is Hahns missionary zeal and spirited leadership action in Outward Bound today ? Nothing short of an educational and social revolution should be OBs responsibility for the 21stcentury . One thing is for sure , Hahn would have created new schemes , for example . <p> What if the Expeditionary Learning Outward Bound experiment was extended around the world ? <p> What if an Outward Bound experiential practicum was developed for teachers around the world ? <p> What if Outward Bound developed a cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantaged areas of the world ? <p> What if Outward Bound extended its programming into areas of international and civil conflict , such as the Play for Peace program , instead of staying within the safety of largely peaceful , affluent countries ? 
@@41691680 @1691680/ <h> What is experiential learning ? <p> Experiential learning has come to mean two different types of learning : 1 . learning by yourself and 2. experiential education experiential learning through programs structured by others ( Smith , 2003 ) . <h> 1 . Experiential learning by yourself <p> Learning from experience by yourself might be called " nature 's way of learning " . It is " education that occurs as a direct participation in the events of life " ( Houle , 1980 , p. 221 , quoted in Smith , 2003 ) . It includes learning that comes about through reflection on everyday experiences . Experiential learning by yourself is also known as " informal education " and includes learning that is organised by learners themselves . <p> Principles of experiential learning are used to design of experiential education programs . Emphasis is placed on the nature of participants ' subjective experiences . <p> An experiential educator 's role is to organize and facilitate direct experiences of phenomenon under the assumption that this will lead to genuine ( meaningful and long-lasting ) learning . This often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often contrasted with didactic education , in which the teacher 's role is to " give " information/knowledge to student and to prescribe study/learning exercises which have " information/knowledge transmission " as the main goal . 
@@41691681 @1691681/ <h> Roles of Schemas in Personality <p> Last updated : 21 Oct 2003 <h> Schemas <p> With regard to personality , the cognitive perspective focuses on organised mental structures of experience , including memory , schemas , scripts , and attributions . <p> We are surrounded by a mass information , therefore in order to survive and be efficient in progressing towards our goals , we must have ways of sorting through and selectively attending to the mass of information . By using stored " information guides " , we can simplify and structure the world of information . These " guides " are sometimes called heuristics , models , algorithims , schemas and scripts . Whilst technically these may be different terms , for our purposes they are important because they are all " tools " for filtering and interpretation information . By the way , information is meant here in a broad sense - information that arrives externally through each of the senses on an almost constant basis , but also information that may arise from within , from the unconscious , or memory , or newly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but you are surrounded by more information than you can use you ca n't deal with it all , so you impose organisation and use just a few bits and you make inferences about the rest . In this way , cognitive organisation is good because it saves mental resources and allows us to understand events using selected pieces of information . <p> But cognitive organisation can also be bad in unusual situations and when we get stuck in negative perceptions ( e.g. , depressive self-schemas ) or when there are novel events . <p> Because of all this information coming in and the need to simplify things we tend to treat a piece of information as a member of a category and we can then respond immediately in a way established for other members of this category . We do not treat each tree ( whether an individual ash or elm , or prunus ) as a completely unique category , but rather identify it as a member of the category " TREE " and we can then respond accordingly . <p> Similarly , when we meet people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ category rather than as a totally unique creature that weve never come across before . The category may be race , gender , religion , nationality , dress style , whatever . In cognitive psychology these categories are called schemas . A schema is a knowledge structure or a cognitive structure that organises information and thereby influences how we perceive and respond to further information about objects , people and events . In other words , we impose order on experiences derived from recurrences of similar qualities across repeated events . <p> A helpful formulaic representation is <p> Perception = memory ( i.e. , stored guides ) + incoming information <p> If I say " VEHICLE " do you know what I 'm referring to ? You probably have a generalised idea of a motorised contraption that goes on the road and has 4 wheels . But youd need more information to know exactly what I 'm referring to . So you know for example that your " vehicle " schema is say different from your " plant " schema or your " person " schema or your " clothing " schema @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schema I 'm referring to . <p> It is generally agreed that for physical objects we arrange the schemas hierarchically . Now you have a schema for vehicle for example , and you probably also have a schema for " car " and one for " sports car and so these can exist at different levels . <p> Younger children for example tend to use middle level schemas more frequently . Higher level categories like " vehicle " are distinctive but more abstract and not as specific as the next category level . Low level categories are specific but may not always be cognitively economical to use . <p> EXEMPLARS : Schemas are usually assumed to include information about specific cases or exemplars as well as information about the more generic sense of what the category is . That is for any given category , say , vehicle , you can bring to mind specific examples of vehicles and you can bring to mind a general sense of the category on the whole e.g. a " typical " vehicle ( something that is a motorised contraption on the road and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some members of a category are the " best members " that is they best exemplify the category . For example a Porsche might best exemplify the category of sports car for you and a Maserati might best exemplify the category for me . This is called a prototype . Some theories suggest that it is the best actual member you have found so far and others that its an idealised member , an average of the members you 've found so far . <p> ATTRIBUTES : On the other hand some researchers say that no prototypes are stored at all . Instead the category or schema is simply a collection of attributes or elements that help define what the category is . In the case of a sports car those attributes may be sleek , low , racy looking , expensive looking etc . <p> It has also been suggested that many categories do n't  have explicit definitions . The features of a category or schema all contribute to its nature but are n't  necessary for category membership . For example your schema for birds probably includes the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NT fly . So flying cant actually be a defining feature if birds . But hearing that a creature flies does make it more likely that it will fit the bird schema than say the cow schema . So flying counts for something ! <p> FUZZY SET : As with our bird example , some schemas are defined in a fuzzy way by a set of criteria that are IMPORTANT but not necessary . e.g. flying <p> DEFAULT INFORMATION : Many events do n't  contain complete information about what 's going on . If there 's enough information available to bring up a schema then you get additional information from memory . e.g. if I told you I did the washing this morning , you would assume I was talking about clothes , that I used washing powder , that I used a washing machine , etc. even though none of these thins was mentioned . Research shows that people may even REMEMBER things that they have n't explicitly been told if it fits their schema of the event . ( you may think I mentioned the washing powder even though I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about washing the dog by hand using biocarbonate of soda . Information you assume to be true ( unless you 've been told otherwise ) is called default information . <p> STEREOTYPES : When one aspect of a stereotype is brought to mind you tend to assume other aspects as well . If you hear that a person is a Liberal Voter you may also assume that they love John Howard , are conservative in thinking and dress style , are generally warmongering and anti refugees ( if that 's what your " Liberal Voter " schema is ) . People automatically assume schema-consistent information even when it its not available . So default information is brought from memory to fill in the gaps . <h> Role of Schemas <p> Any event is a collection of elements : people , movements , objects etc . These various elements might just as well be random unless you have some sense of what the event is ABOUT . In the same way the attributes of an object are just a collection of bits unless you have an overriding sense of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the bits of information together . Schemas : are used to recognize new experiences ( new events are identified by comparing them to existing schemas ) . They affect perception , affect encoding , affect memory recall and become self-perpetuating . You are more likely to remember information that CONFIRMS your expectations than does n't  . <h> Self-schemas <p> Hazel Rose Markus in 1977 suggested that the self is a concept or a category like any other concept or category and that people form cognitive structures about the self just as they do about other phenomena . These cognitive structures are called SELF-schemas . <p> Self-schemas are cognitive generalisations about oneself , derived from past experience . The meaning is similar to the meaning of the term self-concept . Our self-schemas organise and guide the processing of self-related information . Self-schemas , like other schemas influence whether information is attended to and how easily it is recalled . Thus it is easier to encode things that fit into it and to remember things that fit into it . <p> Once we have developed a schema about ourselves there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bias in what we attend to , a bias in what we remember , and a bias in what we are prepared to accept as true about ourselves . In other words our self-schema becomes self-perpetuating . <p> Self-schemas tend to be larger and more complex than other schemas and there are individual differences in the complexity of self-schemas . <p> " Some people have many different self-aspects , which they keep distinct from each other . Each role these people play in life , each goal they have , each activity they engage in , has its own separate existence in their self-image . These people are high in self-complexity . Other peoples self-aspects are less distinct from each other . These people are lower in self-complexity . <p> For people who are low in self-complexity , feelings relating to a bad event in one aspect of life tend to spill over into other aspects of the sense of self ( Linville , 1987 ) . This spill over does n't  happen as much for people high in self-complexity because the separations and boundaries theyve developed between self-aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail to acquire ) complexity in the self-schema may be partly a matter of how much you think about yourself . Nasby ( 1985 ) found that people who report spending a lot of time thinking about themselves have self-schemas of greater complexity and detail than people who think about themselves less . Apparently the very process of thinking about yourself causes a continued growth and articulation of the self-schema . " Carver &amp; Scheier ( 2000 , p. 445 ) <p> " Another way of thinking about self-complexity is that it involves a family of self-schemas , rather than a single one . In a way , you 're a different person when you 're in different contexts because you make different assumptions about yourself , and you attend to different aspects of what 's going on . When you 're with one set of friends at a party to another set in a study group to being at home with your parents , its as though you 're putting aside one schema about yourself and taking up a new one . Not only may people have distinct self-schemas in different contexts , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues ( e.g. , Markus &amp; Nurius , 1986 ) , suggest that people develop images of selves theyd like to become , selves they 're afraid of becoming and selves they expect to become . Other selves that have been suggested include the disliked self ( Oglivie , 1987 ) and selves you think you ought to be ( Higgins , 1987 , 1990 ) . These various possible selves can be used as motivators , because they provide goals to approach or to avoid . " Carver &amp; Scheier ( 2000 , p. 446 ) . <h> Examples of self-schemas <p> Because the self=schema contains our ideas about what we are like and what we are capable of doing it affects what we do . <p> If we think were reliable well try to always live up to that image . <p> If we think we are sociable we are more likely to seek the company of others . <p> If we think were attractive well be more confident in our romantic dealings with the opposite sex . <p> If we think were shy we are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way we 've behaved awkwardly in social situations in the past and well therefore interpret new situations in the light of this knowledge .

@@41691682 @1691682/ <p> Acknowledgements : This exercise has been adapted from an exercise facilitated by Chris Loynes at the 10th National Outdoor Education Conference , 1997 , in Perth , Western Australia and subsequent personal advice ( see links ) . Chris attributes his learning of the learning to Roger Greenaway who provided me with some excellent information about a similar activity he calls " Stones " and a related activity called " Human Sculpture " ( see links ) . <p> Psychodynamics &amp; Personal Objects : My intention in developing this particular adaptation was to use it in an outdoor education graduate seminar class to facilitate within group communication and interpersonal understanding , and to stimulate discussion about psychodynamic theory in outdoor education settings . The most obvious psychodynamic principle at work is the notion of " projection " , although this is a psychologically complex activity that is likely to elicit several other observable psychodynamic processes ( such as ego states and interpersonal transactions ) . The group had in the previous week been introduced to background readings about psychodynamic theory and had been challenged to think about possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . Students were requested to bring a small , non-fragile object of personal significance to the class . Note that the selection of personal objects of significance for the exercise is likely to bring into play the history of psychological association and meaning that individuals have attached and invested the object with . Thus the decision to include these objects immediately heightens the level of psychological investment . Using objects of personal significance comes with associated risks and liabilities of course and requires an appropriately supportive and trusting atmosphere , so use this feature carefully . Using personal objects can make for a weightier and more sobered session than might be the case when using readily available objects in the immediate environment . Surprisingly little has been written in the psychological literature about the psychology of objects . Possibly the key text is still Jungs " Man and His Symbols " , along with a relatively recent book by Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton , " The meaning of things : Domestic symbols and the self " which states in the preface : <p> " To understand what people are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on between people and things . What things are cherished , and why , should become part of our knowledge of human beings . Yet it is surprising how little we know about what things mean to people . By and large social scientists have neglected a full investigation of the relationship between people and objects . " <p> Roger Greenaway made a useful suggestion here that <p> " it may be tricky to move from here to group dynamics if , say , someone brings a photo of their boyfriend , another a family photograph , another a tiny piece of jewellery , another a goldfish in a jar ... So each person may like to have the option of choosing a new object when switching into group dynamics that is more representative of their image or role within the group . " <p> Interesting effects might be obtained by instead bringing a lot of set of objects from which participants can select . Also note that before the activity , give the group the extra instruction that their object will be subject to group activity , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that they will therefore lose a certain amount of control over their object . So if they wish they should select an alternative object for the activity . Usually peope do not take up the offer , but usually someone has forgotten to bring an object . In this case , they should use something handy , e.g. , something from their bag or wallet , or a watch or pen . What is a Mandala ? : Mandala is Sanskrit for circle , polygon , community , and connection . The The Concise Macquarie Dictionary defines mandala as <p> " a mystic symbol of the universe , in the form of a circle enclosing a square ; used chiefly by the Hindus and Buddhists as an aid to meditation " . <p> Mandalas , however , need not be so narrowly defined . A Google Image Search for Mandala reveals many traditional and contemporary mandala designs , several of which go beyond a circle enclosing a square . What seems to tie them together is their patterned interconnectedness . By the way , I do n't share the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or possibly at all .

This helps to enhance the unknowness of the activity ( and therefore , any experienced meaning is largely socially constructed by participants themselves ) . <p> Also note , the facilitator should consider whether or not participate in the group - either way can be appropriate or not , depending on the nature of the group and the facilitator . <p> Participants in a group select a small object . The object can be anything , from anywhere : e.g. , an object of personal significance or collected from the outdoors <p> Standing in a circle , ask a participant for their hat ( or use some other container ) . <p> Place your object in the hat , and pass the hat on to the next person who does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some randomness ( like rolling dice ) ( may use casting mat , e.g. , a sarong or coat , particularly if using personally significant objects ) .

Why ? <p> What happened in this group during this activity from a Psychodynamic perspective ? <p> Facilitator Notes <p> Participants could bring a surprising variety of objects , for example an engagement ring , a pocket knife , a stone bearing the inscription " inspiration " , a teddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Initially I did not ask students to initially describe the significance of their objects not asking this obvious question can heighten the sense of mystery and suspense in the activity . By the end of the activity , the students responded favourably and more richly to an earlier hint that we might close the activity by sharing with others the personal significance associated with the object . This provided a deep , satisfying sense of closing to the activity . <p> Overall , the exercise works well , but it can be a challenge initially to process as there is often some resistance and anxiety associated with the apparent open-endedness of the activity . At a critical point when a student challenged me on the seeming pointlessness of the activity I explained that from a psychodynamic point of view the ultimate activity is give someone a blank piece of paper and ask them what they see . Whatever the person replies with would be an indicator of their inner psychological state , because there is relatively little external stimuli .

The instrument allows pre- to post assessments on a variety of personal , social and work-place qualities which corporate adventure training programs often try to enhance . The content of the instrument is customizable from a pool of self-report scales . The objectives emerged from consultation with interested programs and organizations and the research literature . This paper describes the rationale , development , and items for the tool . <p> Basically , the focus is on measuring three domains : Personal , Social , and Work-place . The short version ( 6 scales , 23 items ) is designed for 1 to 2 day adventure training programs . The long version is customizable from a list of 13 suggested factors and is recommended for more involved corporate adventure training programs such as 3 to 5 day residential programs .

Interested users may wish to consult with the author to get more update information prior to using . <h> Measuring corporate adventure training outcomes <p> Instrumentation is vital for good quality empirical research ( Neill , 2003 ) . Designing valid measurement of personal , social and work-place changes following intervention processes has attracted hype and debate , but there remains a lack of readily available , valid program evaluation tools . This paper aims to plug one of those gaps - the evaluation of outcomes typically aimed for in Corporate Adventure Training or Outdoor Management Development . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to " About Outdoor Adventure Training for Corporate and Management Development " . <p> There are many possible research and evaluation tools for applying to corporate adventure interventions , but to date , there is no readily available tool with reasonable psychometric design and user-friendliness available for corporate adventure training programs and program evaluators . Simon Priest used an abbreviated form of the Team Development Index in his well-known research studies and this is my other recommendation of a tool to use , however it has been notoriously difficult to obtain , get permission to use , etc . Some other possible instruments and places to search are listed on the Tools , Instruments , and Questionnaires page . <p> One of the other options to consider is how to analyze the data once collected .

The current instrument is designed to provide a low-cost , **36;1289;TOOLONG , user-friendly instrument for researching and evaluating typical goals of corporate adventure training programs . <h> Guiding principles for this evaluation tool and system <p> The evaluation tool derives from the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire program evaluation system . <p> This new tool aims to provide for a rigorous and reasonably comprehensive evaluation of the extent to which program objectives are achieved in a cost and time efficient manner . <p> Most corporate adventure training programs are conducted by leaders and administrators who do not have a background in research , but who are skilled in report writing and knowledge about their own program . Thus , as long as program operators are supported in selecting an appropriate evaluation methodology , and with good quality data analysis , they can construct good quality reports to clients , funders or evaluators , or for internal program development . <p> This instrumentation is also designed to be user-friendly for participants , program instructors , and administrators . <p> The self-report tool can be administered pre- ( Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of the short-term program impact . It is recommended , however , that baseline and followup assessments are obtained , as well as observer measures ( e.g. , by leaders , parents , teachers , and/or peers ) . <p> This evaluation tool is also designed to be customizable . Program evaluators too often use full instruments , when only part of the instrument is relevant to program objectives , for fearing of undermining the overall validity of the questionnaire . With this instrument , the goal is to get the best of both worlds - psychometric validity and flexibility . Evaluators can select from the pool of scales to develop a set of items for evaluating the effects of a particular program . <h> Developing the list of objectives and the item pool <p> The range of objectives was mainly derived from those typically mentioned in the research literature on corporate adventure training , and the kinds of goals requested by clients and offered by organizations . Suggestions for other objectives to measure are welcome - email James Neill . <p> In addition , other self-report tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Review of Personal Effectiveness , and several scales were clearly relevant to corporate adventure training and thus were included in the list . Suggestions are welcome for suggestions of other instrumentation and contribution of scales and measurement items , such as used in graduate theses , are welcome . <p> For approximately half of the objectives , 3 items were identified from pre-existing instruments . For the other half , new items were constructed ( 4 items per scale ) - these are pilot scales . Since corporate adventure training programs are often customized to specific company cultures and needs , no single instrument would serve all needs . Thus , this instrument is customizable in the selection of scales ( outcomes ) to be measured . The results are then quite meaningful , because they 're relevant and customized to the program goals .

No longer were there the same opportunities and requirements for physical stamina , endurance , perseverance , tolerance , tenacity , and having the wherewithal to hold up in difficult conditions in which the only way through was via sheer persistence , inventiveness and dedicated support of one another . <p> So , John Dewey ( 1938/1997 ) said , let us organize education better ; Kurt Hahn said yes we need to , just look at all the ills of modern society . Kurt Hahn said , let 's provide physical and moral challenges , let 's put huge faith in peoples inner capabilities being discovered and support them in discovering more than themselves than they might have thought possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits of people in the name of the greatest good . <p> John Dewey 's view of a new , progressive education was one which designed experiences based on intimate understanding of peoples past experiences which , he claimed , significantly determine their present experiences ( the principle of experiential continuity ) . According to Dewey , the continuity of a persons stored individual past experiences interacts with the dynamics of the present experience , to create individual 's current experience of ' reality ' . For Dewey , the educator must manage the quality of students ' experience in the present situation by interacting with , and adjusting , the circumstances . The educator must finds ways of presenting relevant subject matter which maximally engages the interest and motivation of the student ; Hahn would add that this experience must stretch the person beyond the students ' limited self-conceptions and towards their potential . This requires compelling circumstances . <p> What is this strange notion of going beyond ones self ? How paradoxical is sounds to intentionally design an experience to go beyond known boundaries .

I have my toothbrush from home , I have my picture of my Mommy , I have my familiar clothes , I have my you-beaut sleeping bag , I have the assurance that I have the choice to do only what I want to do , I have brought the food I like , etc . <p> This is not real outdoor education . This is a nature walk , a cozy camp , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense ; it is not outdoor education . Outdoor education is about taking the real risk of finding out that your current being can be opened up and altered via engaging itself in different contexts and taking the risk of behaving and thinking differently from normal . <p> This does not mean that outdoor education is a paradisiacal , ideal land of heaven and glory . Far from it . In fact , to the extent that human beings have become divorced from the grimy reality of life on earth , there is a long journey back through the steps of civilization , like flicking the pages in a picture book about evolution , before any sustainable happiness can be experiences in the outdoors . This is no skiing package holiday . Outdoor education should try to capture the essence of dramatized and treasured educational adventure stories such as in Robinson Crusoe and Huckleberry Finn . <p> Outdoor education must dispense with the glitz of leisure class outdoor recreation , which uses the environment as another consumption , preying on thrill , novelty and aesthetic beauty . Outdoor education means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of different individuals which allow them encounter their atavistic and potential selves . The pathway to such goals will be necessarily littered with barriers , particularly constructed , limited beliefs based on previous stored experiences . It is difficult to survive all the minutes , hours and years spent in artificial , chaotic cultures without taking on limiting , false messages about who the person is and the potential for who he/she might become . <p> Outdoor education is simply the design of adventure experiences to bring into light the nature and possibilities of self . So , I count among outdoor education experiences any intentional use of nature and adventure for facilitating insight into , and change of , self . Thus , the outdoor education method should be intensely psychological . By this I mean that Deweys underlying argument is critical understanding and managing the quality of experience is the key to good education . Since every experienced carries its legacy on into the future , every minutiae of experience for every person is vital and should be the prime concern of the instructor . <p> The instructors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore impossible to fulfill . The instructor is a guide , a gatekeeper to realms of possible experience . The instructor creates some rough boundaries , maps out a route , follows his/her charges closely , and yet must remain behind a cloud of obscurity to allow the experience to be as fundamentally pure as possible . <p> The instructor is subject to many dangers of power and the perilous temptations of therapeutic compensation via attaching to participants . Until an instructor knows him/her self thoroughly and has been through his/her own psychotherapeutic process , an instructor is likely to impact negatively on his/her participants quality of experience to the extent of the instructor 's own inadequacies . Inner maturity and motivation are the only necessary qualities for an outdoor education instructor . Other qualities , such as communication skills , capacity to envision , plan and execute a program , empathize and relate to participants , and learn necessary outdoor skills , can be learned relatively by those with inner maturity . Only such individuals should be considered as worthy of outdoor education instruction , in an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences would be sacred and the instructors would be shamans . Of course , since all individuals have infinite potential for growth , all individuals are also capable of being such outdoor education instructors . ( You may be interested to read more about these ideas in Facilitation &amp; Processing ) <p> Part II : Outdoor Education Programs Need Sound Theory <p> I have drawn on Kurt Hahn , John Dewey , and existential and psychodynamic psychology ; now I draw on the role of nature . There is much evidence and logic which suggests that human beings evolved from a long , long history of intimate engagement with nature ( e.g. , see Frumkin , 2001 ) . In a very recent flicker of time , industrialization began shielding whole human societies remarkably from nature . Hence the need for outdoor education and outdoor recreation has been recent . However , at the moment , this relatively new practice of taking people into the outdoors for organized educational experiences , varies greatly in the quality of experiences provided to participants ( e.g. , see Hattie , Marsh , Neill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide fluffy , touristy , distraction , relaxation , thrill-a-minute , and sometimes a fleeting sense of the range of human possibilities . Until more programs are constructed by those with psychological insight or by those who understand the history , theory and practices of outdoor education , no genuinely profound impact of outdoor education on society will occur . <p> Deweys theory of experience ( 1938/1997 ) and/or some other well-constructed theory consistent with a particular goal ( such as McClellands theory of enhancing achievement motivation , 1963 ) , should be used as a basis for building outdoor education programs . Alternatively , personal and spiritual development practices , such as those developed by indigenous societies , could be used . Newly designed forms of outdoor education are popping up everywhere ; it is vital that they develop a theoretical basis and are instructed by individuals with inner maturity . <p> Programs should also be subject to systematic research and evaluation . Otherwise what guarantee is there for consistently good effects for participants and for well-guided refinement of program quality ? This is analogous to the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects , the causal mechanisms involved , and the side effects , a program should not be marketed to the public . <p> Part III : The Underestimated Role of Nature <p> The more I read and experience and the more I learn about other people and their experiences , the more I believe in that there is considerable untapped power in nature-induced or nature-facilitated experiences . <p> Direct experiencing of nature , especially the elements , cold , heat , etc. , but also nature symbols and stories , over time can crafts the body and mind into a more finely tuned instrument which , in turn , alters inner chemistry and consciousness . Eating of simple , wholesome food over time , with physical exercise , and so on , can combine to holistically bring the human animal into a state of greater potential relationship with nature . <p> This does not happen as easily or as simply as most people think , particularly as mainstream Western society becomes increasingly divorced from non-human nature .

I believe the " true adventurers " visit this frontier e.g. , Willi Unsoeld , Chris McCandless , etc . <p> Eventually as we set about this new way of " harder " living , life becomes , curiously " easier " , " richer " and " more interesting " . The natural endorphins return . The individual can relax and take a new attitude to the challenges of nature and life , and run with new , unfettered conceptions of his/her self . What we are after , is creating an " ideal environment " for the human to flourish . That ideal environment includes harmony with nature ( see wilderness &amp; education ) , as much as it also includes harmony with other people ( go to peace &amp; experiential education ) . <p> Eventually , there can be a new " capability of thriving " , a natural well-spring " joie de vivre " .

But there are enough searchers ( about 1 in 20 ) who will break through the " threshold of culture " and seek a genuinely different route . Colin Wilson famously referred to these types as " outsiders " ( 1956 ) . If you 're reading this , there 's a good chance you are one of them - or potentially .

It is a pauper 's history , without much sophistication in theory and program design . There has been little integration of psychological theory , deep ecology , psychotherapy , and so on . <p> What 's more , many dangerous elements have crept in , particularly the capitalistic plunge that has taken run rife and turned a sacred field into the sale of cheap , safe thrills . <p> But there are also the sneakier evils of the fear of litigation limiting much creativity in programming and driving overemphasis on accreditation and qualification of physical skills , ignoring the fundamental requirement for inner maturity . This is the " too easy " &lt;------&gt; " too hard " threshold . We could also call this the " challenge knob " ( go to Risk , Challenge &amp; Safety in Outdoor Education ) . <p> Thus , outdoor education exists in a cultural community that challenges much of its core philosophy . Unless outdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses the challenge of transforming culture , it risks irrelevancy and extinction . The changing attitudes and conceptions of " risk " have eaten away at the average Westerner 's tendency to " get out there and mix it with the elements " . <p> Thus , outdoor education programming must move beyond short time-frame experiences and move in to live more completely into peoples lives ; it must become a lifestyle . What is meant here by outdoor education as lifestyle , is the living of a brave , sustainable , mature life day in and day out .

In fact , its the other way around . Risks always exist . But true safety never exists , except in hypothetical situations . So , risk is reality , safety is a fantasy . <p> Thus , the concept of safety is a very problematic one . It is often falsely assumed that it is really possible to " be safe " . Think of " safe sex " for example . But , there is no such thing as safe sex -- all one can do is minimize the risk of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease through so-called " safe sex " practices . Even if one gets sterilised and wears 3 condoms , there is the risk of heart-attack and many other morbid possibilities during sex . <p> Likewise , there are no completely safe outdoor and adventure activities . There is always the risk of freak events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should closely scrutinize their written and verbal language , taking particular notice of the way the word " safety " is used . Some instructors and organizations explicitly avoid the term " safety " because it can foster false assumptions and expectations . To claim an activity is safe , when it is clearly ca n't be , is asking for trouble because sooner or later you 'll be wrong . That 's why it is important to play it straight -- share with clients what the nature of the main risks are , do n't apologize for the risks ( celebrate them ! ) , and allow the person to make an informed choice about participating . <p> The idea behind " safety practices " is that by adopting certain standard ways of operating , " acceptable " levels of risk can be created . " Acceptable " risk is of course subjective , and changes over time and across cultures , and varies widely for individuals . Good safety practices evolve via constant reviewing , based on actual experience and the experiences of others , including research evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has become increasingly attractive , especially when people feel vulnerable or threatened . To strive for safety in an adventure program has become an increasingly valued objective from a societal perspective over the last 2 decades . The focus on safety , however , has taken on a mantle above and beyond the bigger picture . " Safety " is one aspect of participant 's experience . We must not over obsess about the holy grail of safety , however . It is at least as equally , if not more important , to embrace the positive potentials of risk-taking . Go to " Is Outward Bound Becoming Too Safe ? " <p> One example of how we 've become more aware of the lack of safety is that " life jackets " were renamed during the last 10 to 15 years as " personal flotation devices " . The term " life jackets " was seen to falsely imply that they would " save your life " by preventing drowning . But many people have drowned whilst wearing " life jackets " . The new term , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague and euphemistic .

@@41691735 @1691735/ <p> Previous research in adventure recreation/tourism has focused principally on definition , risk management and personal outcomes . Recently , there has developed an increasing interest in understanding outdoor leisure as a process . This paper reports on one approach which is being used to explore the unfolding nature of adventure tourism experiences . A combination of the Experiential Sampling Method and Personal Accounts is discussed in this paper as a means of better understanding the complexity of adventure experiences as perceived by the participant . Instrument characteristics , data analysis techniques , limitations and potential of the method are explored using data from two adventure tourism experiences . <p> Correspondence concerning this article should be addressed to Dr. Norman McIntyre , Department of Leisure Studies , University of Waikato , Private Bag 3105 , Hamilton , New Zealand or sent via electronic mail tonorm@waikato.ac.nz and **26;1356;TOOLONG <p> Increasingly , in today 's world , people are viewing adventure experiences in natural settings as a desirable way of escaping from the mundanity which surrounds their day-to-day life . Visits to national and forest parks , especially those within easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards shorter more frequent trips is evident in a number of countries . As the desire for nature/adventure experiences increases , but the time available either to develop skills to participate or to undertake the essential planning has reduced , people are relying more and more on private providers to package adventure and nature for their consumption ( Hollenhorst , 1995 ) . <p> Traditionally , research in adventure recreation/tourism , has tended to emphasise description of activities , definition , risk management ( e.g. Ewert &amp; Hollenhorst , 1989 ; Priest , 1992 ) and outcomes ( e.g. Driver , Brown &amp; Peterson , 1991 ) . Recently a number of researchers have begun to focus on examining the experience from the point of view of the participant in a way which recognises the complexity and variability of such leisure events ( e.g. Arnould &amp; Price , 1993 ; Celsi , Rose &amp; Leigh , 1993 ; Hull , Michael , Walker &amp; Roggenbuck , 1996 ) . <p> This paper reports on an approach which samples adventure experiences at various selected points during an experience . Two case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be collected and how this data may be analysed to reveal information about adventure experiences in general and about individual participant 's perceptions in particular . <p> Adventure Recreation Experiences <p> Nature-based adventure recreation is one type of activity that we can begin to examine and understand by focusing on its experiential qualities . Much research has focused on the beneficial products or consequences of adventure recreation ( e.g. , stress reduction , and self-esteem ) ( e.g. Hattie , Marsh , Neill &amp; Richards , 1997 ) . This approach is limiting in the sense that it has focused mainly on pre and post assessments of adventure experiences , and thus failed to give due regard to the richness and complexity of such experiences . If we are to understand these experiences fully , we need also to focus on participants ? immediate conscious experience ( e.g. , thoughts , images , feelings and sensations ) during adventure recreation . <p> To attempt to measure all the dimensions of adventure indicated in the literature during the lived experience would likely change the nature of the experience itself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the advice of Ittelson ( 1978 ) , Knopf ( 1987 ) , and the work of Hull and his colleagues ( e.g. , Hull et al. , 1996 ) I decided to measure recreationists ? focus of attention , their moods , and their feelings of risk and competence during a nature-based adventure experience . <p> Measures <p> Focus of Attention <p> Knopf ( 1987 ) noted that when people experience nature in leisure settings , they are not simply responding to a collection of physical attributes . Instead , they are involved in a transactional process in which natural setting and person " jointly define one another and contribute to the meaning and nature of an holistic event " ( Altman &amp; Rogoff , 1987 , p.24 ) . Environmental psychologists have studied this transaction by examining the modes in which people experience the environment ( Ittelson , 1978 ) . Five modes seem dominant : focus on nature as an object or place ; focus on self and internal thoughts ; focus on others ; focus on emotions and affect ; and focus on task or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these modes indicated that people did not distinguish between ? internal thoughts ? and ? emotions and affect ? , so these modes were collapsed into one ( thoughts and feelings ) ( McIntyre &amp; Cattermole , 1997 ) . At any given moment during a nature-based leisure experience , one or more of these experiential modes may be dominant , and the recreationist would describe the environment and his or her experience in the context of this person-environment transaction . <p> The Focus of Attention scale was adapted from Borrie ( 1995 ) and included a differential rating of the degree of focus on self , others , nature and task . The scale consisted of a stem " How much are you focusing on each of the following , " and four items : " your own thoughts and feelings ? " , " other people around you ? " , " the natural environment ? " , and " the task you are carrying out ? " Responses were measured on a ten-point scale varying from " Not at all " ( 0 ) to " Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pervasive to the human condition . It is defined as " the subtle subjective state or feelings of a person at any given moment " ( Hull , 1991 , p.252 ) . It refers to specific sets of subjective feelings ( e.g. excited , bored , stressed , relaxed , aroused and drowsy ) which occur as a consequence of everyday experiences . Mood and mood changes have been found to be sensitive to the multi-phasic and dynamic nature of the lived and remembered recreation experience ( e.g. Hammitt , 1980 ; Hull et al. , 1996 ) . Finally , mood can apparently be measured validly and reliably during the experience without unduly disrupting or changing the nature of the experience ( Hull &amp; Michael , 1995 ) . In summary , mood seems to provide a reliable and valid indicator of the quality of recreation , and one which is especially sensitive to the dynamic nature of the recreation event . <p> Past research in the leisure context has provided particular insights into the way in which leisure experiences and mood states interact . Four key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in predictable ways during the leisure event ; some vary in their patterns of change across recreation contexts ; both environmental and person variables shape moods during the on-site experience ; and moods are not always pleasant throughout the recreational engagement ( McIntyre &amp; Roggenbuck , 1998 ) . <p> The approach to the measurement of mood was taken directly from the work of Csikszentmihalyi and associates ( e.g. , Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson , 1987 ) . This scale is a 7-point semantic differential comprised of twelve bi-polar adjectives to describe moods . The adjective pairs in this scale were alert/drowsy , happy/sad , cheerful/irritable , energetic/tired , friendly/angry , active/passive , sociable/lonely , calm/worried , free/constrained , excited/bored , clear/confused , and relaxed/tense . <p> Risk and Competence <p> Risk and competence are central aspects of adventure recreation , whether it is undertaken as a personal venture or purchased as a commercial product . Risk is defined as the potential to lose something of value ( Priest , 1990 ) . Perceived risk is a measure of the level of risk in a particular context as judged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on factors such as skill , previous experience and personality characteristics such as timidity and fearlessness ( Priest , 1990 ) . Similarly , perceived competence is a personal assessment of one ? s ability to successfully meet a situational risk ( Priest , 1992 ) and depends on such factors as past experience , skill level , knowledge and personal efficacy ( Ewert &amp; Hollenhorst , 1989 ) . The interaction of perceived risk and competence is central to the perception of adventure in any situation ( Martin &amp; Priest , 1986 ) . <p> Perceptions of Competence and Risk were measured on a ten-point scale varying from " None " ( 0 ) to " Very High " ( 9 ) using the following two items : " How would you rate your competence in undertaking this activity at this time ? " and " How would you rate the level of risk for you in the activity at this time ? " <p> Methods <p> The Experience Sampling Method ( ESM ) was developed by Csikszentmihalyi and associates ( Csikszentmihalyi &amp; Larson , 1987 ; Larson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents ' daily behaviour through the use of electronic pagers which are activated by the researcher on a random basis up to twelve or more times a day . When the pager sounded , the respondent was required to fill out a short questionnaire that focussed on ' where you are ' , ' what you are doing ' , ' who you are with ' and ' your mood ' at the time . <p> An ' outdoor adventure ' version was developed which was basically similar in structure and included identical questions on locality and mood . Major differences were the ten-point focus of attention scales and measures of perceived risk and competence which replaced the activity and social questions of the original . In contrast to previous studies , key localities for sampling were chosen by the researcher . Also , the experience lasted only three hours rather than the three to five days of daily leisure studies . It took approximately two minutes to complete the Experiential Sampling form ( ESF ) at each locality . <p> The ESM has the advantage of providing a real-time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not suffer from the well recognised deficiencies of other verbal reports ( e.g. memory decay , reconstruction , socially desirable responses , over-generalisation and illusory correlation : Borrie &amp; Roggenbuck , 1995 ) . In addition , it asks respondents ? what ? ? ( ' Do you feel tense ? ' ) rather than ? why ? ? questions , leaving the latter to the personal accounts . <p> A personal account or ' story ' about the experience was added as a second departure from the traditional ESM . The purpose of this was to access more in-depth information about the experience . Specifically , to find out about : <p> those contexts of the trip that were not sampled but were of importance to the individual ; <p> satisfaction about the trip in general and about particular aspects e.g. guides , leadership , level of challenge and so on ; <p> information on the effects of the natural surroundings on the individual 's experience . <p> The ESM provides contextually specific data at physical locations chosen by the researcher and the personal accounts afford insights into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial meanings that individuals attach to the experience . The combination therefore is synergistic , enabling a much more comprehensive understanding of the experience than either method would in itself provide . Close association in time between the two methods also allows for validity checks ( e.g. ' are we missing some key variable ? ' and ' are the quantitative data corroborated by the personal accounts ? ? ) . <p> The Case Studies <p> The activities chosen were two adventure tourism activities , Black Water Rafting and Horse-Riding . The participants in these trial projects were tertiary university students in the second or third year of a leisure studies course . Each of the activities was approximately three hours in length and represent two examples of adventure/nature tourism activities available to the inexperienced but ' adventurous ' tourist . <p> Black Water Rafting <p> The study site was at Waitomo , a well-known tourist cave system in the North Island of New Zealand . The specific adventure experience is known as Black Water Rafting and consists of a three-hour trip walking and floating on a rubber tube through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip previously . <p> Data were collected at five survey sites during the Black Water Rafting experience . The first survey site was in the Dressing Area where participants changed from their ? street clothes ? into wet suits , waterproof boots and gloves and donned safety helmets with battery powered headlamps . After a short drive , participants chose their ? tube ? and under the supervision of the guides jumped into the stream from an elevated pontoon . They then walked approximately 500 meters to the cave entrance . The first entry into the cave was viewed as an important stage in the journey and was chosen as the second survey site ( Cave Entrance ) . At this point , trip leaders gave participants the standard briefing on details of group management and safety . After this briefing , participants completed the second ESF . Then followed 30 to 45 minutes of walking and floating down the underground stream . At the end of this section , participants came to a 1.5 meter waterfall . The briefing at the top of the waterfall provided a natural break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jump ) immediately prior to jumping into the plunge pool below the falls . <p> After the jump participants floated gently downstream with headlights extinguished , viewing glow-worms on the roof of the cave . At one point , participants left the water briefly to traverse a number of rock ledges and view a tomo ( a hole in the roof of a cave ) . The fourth ESF ( Glow-worm Traverse ) was completed at this point . Participants then re-entered the water and continued the float downstream , in darkness , viewing the glow-worms . After approximately 45 minutes to an hour , participants reached the point of exit of the stream from the cave , and they then climbed out of the cave and walked or floated downstream to the vehicle . The final ESF ( Vehicle ) was completed in the vehicle to capture the immediate recollection phase of the journey . On return to the tour operator ? s center , participants removed their wet suits , showered , dressed and had a cup of hot soup at the Black Water CafT . <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . The research technician suggested that they write as if recounting the experience to a friend or member of their family who had asked them about the trip . The written accounts were collected from the participants prior to their departure . <p> Horse-Riding <p> The methodology was broadly similar to the Black Water Rafting event and also took place in the Waitomo area . This experience involved a three hour ride over rolling rural countryside and along an unsealed road through a mature pine plantation . Some of the participants had ridden previously but not for some years and the majority had never been on a horse before . Weather conditions were sunny and fine , although rain the previous week had made sections of the ride very wet underfoot . <p> The first ESF was conducted after the participants were introduced to their horses and were preparing to mount . After riding up a long open hill , the second ESF was conducted about 45 minutes into the ride during a respite prior to descending through the pine forest . The descent through the forest was steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their mounts slipped and jolted down the churned up roadway flanked by high banks on one side and a steep forested drop-off on the other . The third ESF was conducted immediately on exiting the forest onto the flat . <p> The next section was across a series of wide flat meadows culminating in a gentle ascent up a long open ridge . Given the open terrain , the majority of participants cantered their mounts in this section of the ride . At the end of this section , there was a short break at which the fourth ESF was completed . Participants then rode downhill and along the main road to the stables . The fifth and final ESF was completed at this point after dismounting and bidding farewell to their mounts . Personal accounts were completed at the Horse-Riding Centre prior to departure . <p> Analysing the ESM Data <p> The ESM data lends itself to at least two analytic approaches . ESM data may be analysed using each participant ? s response at each location as an individual data point . For example , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total data set of 140 responses ( 5 locations x 28 ) participants . McIntyre and Roggenbuck ( 1998 ) used this data set in a principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation of the Mood Scale to reduce the number of mood states from the original twelve on the ESF to three which they labelled sociable ( i.e. the mood states sociable , friendly , excited , cheerful and happy ) ; relaxed ( i.e. relaxed , calm and free ) and aroused ( i.e. energetic , active and alert ) . The aroused/sleepy and relaxed/tense continua are well recognised in mood research in outdoor recreation ( Hull , 1991 ) . <p> In addition , variations in participants ? moods , foci of attention and perceptions of competence and risk can be compared between locations . Because there were multiple administrations of the ESF for each individual , repeated measures analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with location as a five-level , repeated measure within-subjects variable and mood states , focus of attention , perceptions of competence and risk as dependent variables , is the preferred analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dependent variables between locations , they do not tell you which locations are responsible for the differences . A post-hoc test such as the ScheffT test ( p=.05 ) must be used for comparisons of the locations . In other words , the ANOVA provides an overall test for differences in means and the ScheffT test shows which sites are significantly different on the particular measure . This type of analysis is illustrated by using Competence , Risk and the factor Relaxed as dependent variables in the Black Water Rafting case study . <p> Competence , Risk and Relaxed <p> Key variables in the construction of ' adventure ' are perceptions of risk involved in the situation and perceptions of personal competence to successfully meet the perceived risk ( Priest , 1990 ) . A key mood variable is Relaxed which provides a sensitive indicator of the feelings of an individual in ' adventure ' situations . The results of the repeated measures ANOVA are shown in Table 1 . Competence did not change significantly during or over the time of the experience , whereas both Risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Water Rafting , on average , perceived their Competence to be more than adequate to meet the Risk entailed throughout the trip . Perception of Risk varied with the changing context ( Table 2 and Figure 1 ) , being significantly higher at the Waterfall Jump ( M=5.25 , p&lt;.05 ) than at all other sites . Entering the Cave was seen as no more risky than dressing . However , the former was perceived as significantly more risky than sitting in the vehicle . While perception of Risk during the Glow-worm Traverse decreased significantly ( M=3.04 , p&lt;.05 ) from the Waterfall Jump , it remained significantly higher than either at the Dressing Area or in the Vehicle . <p> The mood factor Relaxed ( Table 2 and Figure 1 ) was essentially similar at the Dressing Area ( M=4.86 ) , Cave Entrance ( M=4.92 ) , and at the Waterfall Jump ( M=4.51 ) . It then rose significantly during the Glow-worm Traverse ( M=5.71 , p&lt;.05 ) , and attained a maximum ( M=6.00 , p&lt;.05 ) at the end of the experience in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the experience leading up to the Waterfall Jump . Subsequently , there was a significant change to a more relaxed frame of mind during the remainder of the trip . <p> The well known " Adventure Experience Paradigm " ( Priest , 1990 ) provides a basis for comparison of perceived variation in ? adventure ? between different activities . Figure 2 was constructed from the ten-point Competence and Risk scales of the ESM . The subdivisions between the adventure modes ( peak adventure and adventure etc. ) shown on Figure 2 are illustrative , as there is little evidence on which to base their exact positions . Mean perceptions of Risk and Competence for participants at each site for the two activities of Black Water Rafting and Horse-riding were plotted on Figure 2 . Although the spread of adventure experiences is the same in each activity , it is evident that three sites in the Horse-riding as compared to only one in the Black Water Rafting fall in the " Peak Adventure " stage . Overall , it would appear that on average Horse-riding was perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt less competent , rather than that Horse-riding was perceived as more risky . <p> The personal written accounts are an important source of data in themselves and as a means of expanding or corroborating the ESM data . Analysis involved an initial reading of the participants ? accounts to develop a number of preliminary coding categories ( e.g. , conceptualization of nature , perceptions of risk , feelings ) related to participants ? responses to specific locations ( e.g. , the Waterfall Jump or the Open Flat/Gallop ) . These preliminary categories were progressively modified and refined by a number of passes through the data . For example , nature themes were further expanded to indicate the character of the conceptualization ( e.g. physical , aesthetic , amazing , beautiful ) . The site specific commonality and diversity of the coding categories was analyzed by using the ' Method of Agreement and Difference ' ( Neumann , 1994 ) . This approach involved a tabulation of the various coding categories against the participant ? s code number which enabled the identification of those categories which were common to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories that were more distinctive of individual responses . <p> By combining the individual 's personal profile with data from the personal account , it is possible to reveal a greater depth of understanding about an individual response to a specific context or to the whole experience . <p> Mary provides an example from the Horse-riding context . Initially Mary was moderately relaxed but felt somewhat incompetent and at risk ( Figure 3 ) .

She recalled it this way : <p> " off we went to what I imagined to be a gentle stroll on flat land .

Risk , Competence , Relaxed/Tense : Horse-riding ( Mary ) <p> Elsewhere I have demonstrated that rigorous analysis of the personal accounts can stand alone in shedding light on participants ' experiences and provide insights into , for example , people/nature transactions during outdoor adventure experiences ( McIntyre &amp; Roggenbuck , 1998 ) .

It moves beyond the ? black box ? approach which has dominated much of outdoor adventure research and instead tries to she 'd some light on the complexity of the unfolding adventure experience . It is pragmatic , in the sense that data is relatively easy to collect and presents minimal impact on the individual and the flow of the experience . Also , it takes advantage of the natural propensity of humans to tell stories about experiences ( Bruner , 1990 ) and as those experiences we study are both extraordinary and vivid for the individual , there is a natural inclination to share them if given the opportunity . There are a variety of ways in which the data can be analysed . At the aggregate level it can inform our general understanding of outdoor experiences and at the individual level it can help us better understand the responses of our clients to particular situations and re-emphasise how unique these experiences can be to each one of them . <p> Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , akin to opening a door a few times , albeit significant times , on a room full of activity and then collecting an individual perspective on what happened . This is certainly a limitation but the simplicity of implementation , the immediacy of the data and the relative ease of analysis recommend the approach . The paper and pencil approach used in the case studies is unlikely to be suitable in all instances , especially in those activities which do not provide natural breaks ( e.g. white-water kayaking ) and other ESM approaches may be necessary such as the use of mini tape recorders . While some interruption in the process is inevitable given the necessity to sample at intervals , discussion with participants suggest that this effect is minimal and some participants have even suggested it enhances the experience for them . <p> The application of this approach to outdoor recreation is limited only by the creativity of the researcher , teacher or leader . Currently , I am applying the same methods to understanding participants ' perceptions in guided nature walks , challenge courses and multi-day leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant satisfaction is to improve the quality of the product by tailoring it more specifically to the needs of participants . This paper proposes a methodology which can address the issue of better understanding participant experiences in adventure and nature-based tourism situations . It provides a means of evaluating such experiences that can be used to understand the intensity of emotions experienced by individual participants , their perceptions of risk and personal competence and gives an indication of their satisfaction with various aspects of the trip . Further , it is a useful tool for guide training , sensitising guides to the range and intensity of feelings experienced by individual clients at particular stages of the trip and in particular contexts . <p> I am arguing that the combination of ESM and personal accounts allows a deeper understanding than traditional methods of the effects of context and the inherent complexity and variability of leisure experiences . In addition , this approach provides access to both immediate contextualised responses and insights on the meanings that individuals construct from outdoor leisure experiences . <p> McIntyre , N. &amp; Cattermole , A.

@@41691740 @1691740/ <h> Introduction <p> Animals , including humans , are born with in-built instincts to perform adaptive behaviors . These instincts include many reflexes and relatively straightforward behaviors , such as food-seeking behavior . But , as animal behavior gets more complex , there are in-build instincts which are correspondingly more complex ( e.g. , food storing behaviors ) . Thus , personality in humans is considered , from an evolutionary perspective , not be qualitatively different in origin than the drive in dogs , for example , to bury their bones , or squirrels to store acorns . It 's just that human personality is even more complex . <p> The evolutionary perspective of personality probably makes most sense when considered in conjunction with other perspectives . Evolutionary psychology can seen , for example , as a theoretical platform which underlies the human personality . At birth , everyone starts from scratch , with a unique genotype , some inbuilt instincts ( including a temperament ) , and a pre-wired capacity to learn certain kinds of behaviors . Biological processes , psychodynamics proceses , behavioral processes , social shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's genotype , to dynamically create the unique psychological characteristics of the individual . All the time , however , this shaping occurs within certain parameters layed down by the genotype , which itself is a synthesized expression of the knowledge of human evolution about what seems to be adaptive , stored and conveyed through genetic code . <p> The evolutionary perspective is closely related to all other perspectives of personality . Freud , for example , was ultimately famous for being the father of psychology , by revealing that human behavior was driven by unconscious , instinctual forces . Freud understood personality as arising from the way in which humans were able to resolve these instinctual impulses ( such as for pleasure , sex , food , etc. ) with societal constraints , and the long-term needs of the individual . Indeed , there is evidence that Freud was influenced by the writings of Darwin and that he greatly admired Darwin 's work ( Sulloway , 1979 , cited in McAdams , 1994 ) . <p> Skinner , the famous advocate for behavioral understandings of the human behavior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , although he saw this as not being as important as environmental reinforcement : <p> " We can trace a small part of human behavior ... to natural selection and the evolution of the species , but the greater part of human behavior must be traced to the contingencies of reinforcement , especially to the very complex social contingencies we call cultures . Only when we take those histories into account can we explain why people behave the way they do . " - Skinner , 1989 , p. 18 , cited in Feist &amp; Feist ( 2002 , p. 281 ) <p> Rather than see the various perspectives in opposition from one another , as Skinner seems to do here , I think it is more useful and productive to understand how they all work together in various ways to create the multi-faceted reality of human personality . <p> The evolutionary perspective , then , views personality as the product of a long history during which it was advantageous for humans to adopt particular characteristic ways of thinking and behaving . Evolutionary forces are most useful for understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also seems that although we have been shaped as a species by the challenge of survival , understanding individual 's personalities is often best approached from other perspectives , particularly because the evolutionary perspective currently seems to offer little in the way of practical intervention or assistance in dealing with personality problems . <h> Variation in human characteristics as adaptive for the species <p> An important principle of natural selection is that a species will exhibit variations in various physical and behavioral characteristics . In this way , over time , individuals with physical and behavioral characteristics which are most adaptive for survival will be more likely to survive and pass on their characteristics to their off-spring . Over a long period of time , this leads to eventually to entirely different species , or the gradual shaping ( evolution ) of a species to have some characteristics and not others . <p> In this light , then , observations of the wide variations in human personality can be understood as the process of evolution throwing up variations of the human psyche which allows the most adaptive personalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex species , such as humans , it is also important to realize that quite different personalities may prove adaptive in different ways . For example , highly aggressive behaviors can be adapative in that they allow a person to stand up for themselves and fight for their share , or more , of available resources . However , this also makes a person vulnerable to the aggression of others . So , it is also understandable that more submissive or passive personalities can be adaptive . By avoiding conflict with others , the individual is less likely to suffer direct harm from the aggression of others , but may find that it is difficult to get access to the resources for survival . <p> For some aspects of personality , there appear to be convincing evolutionary explanations ; for other aspects , for other aspects of personality , evolutionary perspectives are less useful . Evolutionary perspectives are probably most useful for explaining general societal behavior trends . <p> An example of such a trend is that males are greater perpetrators of violence than women . <p> During human history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were advantageous for hunting and physical defence of tribes . This underlying predisposition of males seems to also predispose males to also being more likely to have overly violent behaviors . This may be due to higher than normal levels , for example , of particular hormones and neurochemicals ( testosterone , for example ) . Other behavioral sex differences which have attracted evolutionary explanations include the higher rates of promiscuity for males , and the higher rates of rape by males . <h> Behavioral genetics <p> Behavioural genetics has sometimes been called " trait " genetics as it examines the way our genes influence our personality traits . <p> The basic methodology of behavioural genetics is to compare similarities in personality between individuals who are and are not genetically related , or who are related to different degrees . <p> Humans are highly similar to each other genetically . About 90% of human genes are identical from one individual to another . Behavioural genetics concentrates on the approximately 10% of the human genome that does vary . <p> Behavioural genetics , like trait psychology , focuses exclusively on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inheritance of species-specific traits or traits that all humans share is examined later in evolutionary psychology . <p> The basic assumption of behavioural genetics is that if a trait is influenced by genes then it ought to be more highly correlated across pairs of identical ( monozygotic:MZ ) twins than across pairs of fraternal ( dyzygotic:DZ ) twins , and more highly correlated across closer genetic relatives than across more distant genetic relatives . <p> Across many personality traits the average correlation across MZ twins is .50 and across DZ twins is .30 ( e.g. Bouchard &amp; McGue , 1990 ; Loehlin &amp; Nichols , 1976 ) . Thus according to twin studies average heritability of most personality traits is .40 . This is interpreted to mean that the proportion of behavioural variance that can be explained by genetic variance is 40% . ( This is a heritability coefficient i.e. a percentage not a correlation coefficient ) . <h> Heritability of the Big Five personality factors <p> Are the Big 5 traits influenced by our genes ? A number of twin studies have explicitly examined the heritability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Graph showing high heritability for extraversion and neuroticism in identical twins . <h> Heritability of Aggression <p> Rushton , Fulker , Neale , Nias and Eysenck , ( 1986 ) found aggressiveness partially hereditary . They assessed 500+ MZ and DZ twin pairs on altruism , empathy , nurturance , assertiveness and aggressiveness and found high correlations for MZ twins for each personality variable . <p> Monozygotic twins were found to be more similar than dyzygotic twins on aggressiveness ( for MZ twins , r = .40 and for DZ twins , r = .04 ) . Their analyses indicated that nearly 50% of the variance for each personality variable was due to hereditary causes . <p> The data from this study indicate a role for genetic determination in the case of several traits related to aggression . Mednick and Volavka ( 1980 ) also found a much higher concordance rate for delinquent behaviour in monozygotic twin pairs than in dizygotic twins . In Ge et al . ' s ( 1996 ) study of children adopted at birth , aggressiveness in the children was significantly related to antisocial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the children 's aggressive behaviour correlated with the adopted parents ' parenting practices which suggests a complex interaction of environment and heredity . <p> Another possible explanation is that aggression in males could be linked to a chromosomal abnormality . Some males who carry an extra Y chromosome have been found to show increased aggression ( ref on XYY karyotype ) <p> The enzyme monoamine oxidase regulates the breakdown of the neurotransmitters serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine . Low levels of MAO have been found to be associated with aggression ( along with things such as extraversion and sensation seeking ) . There is a gene for MAO called the Monoamine oxidase-A gene . Sometimes , but very rarely , an individual may lack the MAOA gene altogether . In one very well-studied Dutch family , many of the men lack the MAOA gene altogether and the men are notoriously violent individuals . <p> Interestingly , there is a promoter region near the MAOA gene and this promoter area is responsible for switching the gene on and off , and thus controlling the amount of MAO . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues found that the combination of low-activity promoter regions together with abusive childhoods resulted in violent behaviour in adulthood . The researchers studied a large sample of more than 500 men in NZ from birth until their late 20s . Those with abusive childhoods but with a genotype which resulted in high levels of MAOA expression did not show nearly such great evidence of aggression . This interesting study shows the complex interplay of genes and environment . <p> Buss and Plomin state from their extensive research that these temperaments show continuity through the lifespan BUT that they are not perfectly stable as genes do n't  operate continuously but switch on and off during development AND temperament can be modified by experience . <p> Buss and Plomin identify three temperaments <p> emotionality <p> activity level <p> sociability <h> Activity Level <p> overall output of energy <p> vigour = intensity ; e.g. tennis vs. chess <p> tempo = speed ; prefer fast-paced activities <h> Sociability <p> desire for other people 's attention , to share activities , desire for the responsiveness and stimulation that is part of social interaction <p> value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused ( easily and intensely ) in upsetting situations three emotions : distress , anger , fear ( other emotions do n't involve enough arousal to be relevant to this temperament ) <p> the three emotions are not strongly correlated ( except distress and fear ) <p> similar to Eysenck 's neuroticism <p> EAS temperament survey is available for adults and you 'll be doing a shortened version in the tutorial this week . It is also available for children via teacher report or parent report . Very widely used . <p> The three temperaments can be related to Sheldon 's somatotypes : <p> activity level ( mesomorph ) <p> sociability ( endomorph ) <p> emotionality ( ectomorph ) <p> Graph : Are Buss and Plomins 3 temperaments inherited ? A number of studies have shown that the correlations were next to nothing or even inverse for DZ twins but were strong for MZ twins . Average correlations for 228 MZ twin pairs and 172 DZ twin pairs with an average age of 5 years 1 month can be seen on the screen . <p> Cautions : Possible rater bias when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parent ratings may be biased towards expecting MZ twins to be more similar and DZ twin parents tend to contrast the differences . Furthermore , mothers of VERY young children are not particularly good at rating their children , and we know that sometimes MZ twins may be treated in more similar fashion than DZ twins . <p> Temperaments seem to be useful descriptors of general styles , but not strongly linked to specific behaviours , etc. , which probably require more detailed understanding of more specific personality traits <p> Other temperaments ? - Impulsivity ? - Intelligence ? <h> A person is just a genes way of creating another similar gene <p> Evidence that inheritance plays a role in personality is part of the thinking that sees evolutionary processes as having an influence on human behaviour . There are a number of related disciplines such as behavioural ecology , sociobiology , evolutionary psychology , ethology and evolutionary biology . I shall be referring to this area by the generic term " evolutionary theory " . Basic assumptions of evolutionary theory : <p> that behaviours seen in people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> these behaviours were helpful or necessary for survival <p> the more a behaviour helps us survive and reproduce ---&gt; more likely to occur in subsequent generations . <p> The focus here is not on IDs but on patterns of behaviour common to ALL ( human nature ) . <p> Rushtons research shows that people are more attracted to genetically similar people <p> People who go on to have children together are more alike than those who do n't  . Thus among sexually active couples , those most genetically similar are those most likely to have reproduced . <p> Attraction not limited to the opposite sex . We tend to be friends with people who are genetically similar . Why ? From an evolutionary perspective its because you are more likely to be altruistic to a friend than a stranger , making it more likely that the friend will go onto reproduce ( similar genes to your own ) and you may nmeet the friends opposite sex sibling - close genes again ! <p> How do we detect this genetic similarity : either drawn to those with similar facial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate selection <p> From an evolutionary perspective men and women are seeking the same thing : The greatest possible likelihood of mating with someone with whom they will have healthy offspring <p> Male seek fertile females i.e. they are drawn to cues indicating those with good reproductive capacity ( those who appear youthful and beautiful ) . Men seek younger mates . <p> Females seek economic security for their few possible offspring . They are drawn to cues indicating availability of resources , dominance ( expressed in socially positive ways ) , and high status . Females seek older mates . <p> Note that David Buss ( 1989 ) examined mate preferences in 37 cultures around the world and found surprisingly little difference . <p> Other gender findings consistent with an evolutionary perspective : Males are more : <p> interested in casual sex <p> relaxed in their partner criteria for one-night stands <p> readily excited by visual erotica <p> disturbed by thoughts of females ' sexual infidelity ( whereas females are more disturbed by thoughts of males ' emotional infidelity ) . <p> Example : Men and women approach sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westen , and Semmelroth ( 1992 ) men and women were asked to respond to the following vignette : <p> Please think of a serious committed relationship you have had in the past , that you currently have , or that you would like to have . Imagine that the person with whom you 've become seriously involved became interested in someone else . What would distress or upset you more ? <p> From an evolutionary perspective women worry more about emotional infidelity because they are concerned about loss of support to her and her children i.e. mate will share resources with another . <p> Men worry about sexual infidelity as they are concerned that offspring might not be their own . Why , you might ask do some women prefer men who are unstable and will treat them " bad " ? <p> From an evolutionary viewpoint this does n't  appear to make sense or does it . According to the sexy son hypothesis proposed by Gangestad ( 1989 ) these men may leave them but if they produce a boy , he will be a " sexy son " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womans grandchildren ) . <p> These findings may overemphasis gender differences . There are many similarities in what both genders seek in partners . Both genders look for : <p> good sense of humour <p> pleasing personality <p> agreeableness <p> emotional stability <p> kindness <p> lovingness <h> Evolutionary theory and aggression <p> According to ethology or behavioural biology ( another term ! ) humans are members of the animal kingdom and this is emphasised as these theorists try to explain some aspects of human behaviour in terms of its primate origins . <p> Aggression seen to be pre-programmed to serve an adaptive purpose . Seen as a behaviour ( personality trait ? ) that has evolved as a natural element in the behavioural repertoire of some species because it facilitates survival and adaptation to the environment . <p> Inter-male fighting in animals purposive and adaptive . It is likely to ensure an optimal spacing of animals within a given amount of territory ( Lorenz , 1966 ) . Aggression also allows the formation of dominance structures and thereby serves to enhance natural selection through mating of the strongest members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out is not required ( e.g. horses ) , as there is no territorial jealousy and enough food for all ( Lorenz ) . Nonetheless aggression still occurs and the result is the evolution of strong defenders of their young and of the herd in general ( Lorenz ) . <p> There are however questions over whether ethology explains human aggression . Firstly , it has yet to be shown that aggressive tendencies are adaptive in humans . <p> Opponents suggest that aggression is the product of environment and learning . Evolutionary theorists do n't  deny learning but insist there 's also an innate mechanism or drive . <h> Behaviour Genetics and Pathology <p> Well now turn our attention to a brief look at the likelihood of a genetic component to a couple of diffferent pathological conditions : schizophrenia and bipolar disorder . <p> Schizophrenia is characterized by disorientation , confusion , cognitive disturbance , separation from reality . Many studies have shown a genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia exists . For example , it has been shown that in general , parents brothers and sisters of schizophrenics are more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , the more closely one is related to a schizophrenic , the greater the likelihood of having schizophrenia . <p> In a study conducted by Gottesman and Shields ( 1972 ) a concordance rate of 50% in MZ twin pairs and 9% in DZ twin pairs was found . <p> In a well-known study conducted in Denmark with 5000 children of schizophrenic parents who have been adopted or reared away from their parents ( Kety et al. , 1975 ) it was found that the biological relatives of schizophrenics were significantly more often schizophrenic than the biological relatives of a control group matched for age , sex and social class . The adopted relatives of the schizophrenics ( i.e. the adoptive parents , siblings etc ) showed no greater incidence of schizophrenia than the controls . It has also been found that the MZ twin of a schizophrenic is not only more likely to be schizophrenic but is also more likely to show other forms of psychosis even if not diagnosed with schizophrenia ( Heston , 1970 ) . <p> It is thought likely that a diathesis-stress model best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predisposition towards the illness and then environmental factors influence whether the disease is realized . <p> Bipolar disorder ( previously manic-depression ) : characterised by severe depressions , alternating with hyperactive , frenetic , talkative behaviour , grandiose thoughts , a rush of ideas ( mod may be elevated but can also be highly agitated ) . <p> Twin studies reveal genetic component ( e.g. Tsuang &amp; Faraone , 1990 ) one study found link with specific gene on chromosome 11 in a group of Amish families but not found in other studies - so that gene not always responsible . <h> Critique <p> Heritability coefficients are not nature-nurture ratios . They do n't  necessarily always tell you how much a trait is determined by genes as opposed to environment . For example , television watching has been found to be heritable to a significant degree ( Plomin , et al. , 1990 ) . So do we have a gene for TV watching ? <p> More likely to some basic propensity that has some genetic component : <p> lethargy ? sensation seeking ? craving for blue light ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of TV <p> Evolutionary theory : Because a plausible theory can be constructed about how a behavioral pattern may have been evolutionarily adaptive , it does not necessarily follow that the evolutionary needs forced the behaviour pattern <p> None of these things tell you how personality develops , at best they can tell you that genes are involved SOMEHOW !

Project Adventure emerged from the successful introduction of Outward Bound programs into the USA , with the theme " bring the adventure home " . In other words , it was an experiment to bring the novel possibilities of adventure-based learning into more familiar environments , such as the school . <p> Since 1971 , Project Adventure has expanded considerable and spawned a new wave or style of outdoor education programming which , until the 1970s , had been dominated by either residential camping style programs and wilderness expedition style programs . Project Adventure is well known for its use of ropes challenge courses , a field which has taken off its own right and for its development of many creative group learning games and activities . Perhaps most importantly , however , is that Project Adventure has from the start being guided by a strong pedagogical philosophy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs . There is a strong sense that there is a " Project Adventure " way which is characterized by the belief that : ( i ) having personal control is important , therefore participants are given choice about their level of participation in any activity , and ( ii ) a safe and supportive group atmosphere is important , therefore careful attempts are made to develop a group contract ( Full Value Contract ) . Furthermore , Project Adventure programs utilize experiential learning principles ( learning by doing ) , which draw on John Dewey 's educational philosophy ( 1938/1997 ) and learning cycle theorists such as Kolb ( 1984 ) . <p> In 1974 , the potential of Project Adventure was recognized by being awarded a National Diffusion Grant from the US federal government . The idea behind this grant was replicate a promising model is many locations around the country .

Like all good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also faced business competition , especially from smaller organizations specializing in particular services , such as building ropes courses . <p> As Project Adventure searches the horizon and considers its future in the 21st century , one of the interesting questions is to know more about what actually happens on Project Adventure programs and how effective this Project Adventure methodology is for achieving various goals . To date , there has been no major summary of the research on Project Adventure programs ; in fact we fact there not even a bibliography or convenient list of Project Adventure research studies . Thus , this first bibliography was embarked upon to help construct some more solid foundations for better understanding the educational contribution and potential of Project Adventure style programs . <p> Since no previous bibliography had been constructed , we broadened our scope in the searching to include any significant scholarly pieces of literature about the philosophy , theory , research , and evaluation Project Adventure literature .

@@41691745 @1691745/ 1842 @qwx411842 <p> Helen Klaebe , a Masters student in Creative Writing at the Queensland University of Technology has written a history of Outward Bound in Australia for its 50th Anniversary ( 1956-2006 ) . This book is an oral history of the people who contributed to the remarkable development of Outward Bound in Australia . The stories and accounts provide a snapshot full of colour , insight , perspective and memories . It is human account of an organisation 's ongoing contribution to Australian society and includes many historical photos . <h> Introduction <p> Outward Bound programs are diverse and use a complex combination of experiential learning activities . This makes Outward Bound a challenging topic for research investigation . There have been a number of interesting research efforts over the years , however the field is characterized by a lack of overall synthesis and direction . <h> History <p> One could argue that research was part of Outward Bound from its beginning . In the 1940s , Lawrence Holt , head of the Blue Funnel shipping line told Kurt Hahn that the survival rates of young merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat situations . Hahn then shared his theory that the young men had been ill-prepared because modern life lacked exposure of young people to real-life challenges . <p> Holt and Hahn devised " Outward Bound " a 4-week intensive program based on the principles of Kurt Hahns County Badge scheme . These first Outward Bound courses improved the survival rates of the young sailors , giving empirical support for spreading Outward Bound theory and programs . Despite the dramatic life-death nature of the outcomes from the first Outward Bound courses , the original data is not known to be publicly reported anywhere , leaving the original evidence about the efficacy of Outward Bound shrouded somewhat in mystery . <p> During the rest of the 1940s and the 1950s , little other Outward Bound research was conducted . The first major Outward Bound research study of substance was Basil Fletchers follow up interviews with thousands of Outward Bound alumni in the UK . Fletcher ( 1970 , 1971 ) reported : <p> After I had talked to some 500 students , I was obliged to accept their nearly unanimous view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I received this impression at first with incredulity , but was obliged to pay attention to it because the same view was expressed , only more strongly , by past students . ( 1971 , p. 98 ) . <p> Another notable early study was by William Keay ( 1970 ) , an instructor at Outward Bound New Zealand . Keay 's pilot study on the effects of OBNZ courses on personality variables ( using Cattell 's 16 PF ) in a pre-post design with a control group , was reported in the Outward Bound UK Trust newsletter , Strive . Keay explained the Outward Bound research problem as follows : <p> In an age when arguments are inevitably settled by reference to tables of figures and many people 's working lives are calculated in terms of units of production per man/day , Outward Bound may have been fortunate to escape analysis and measurement . Yet how many wardens and instructors involved in confrontation with sceptical sponsors or hostile critics have felt uneasy or dissatisfied with the language and words at present used to describe the aims and achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Marsh 1966 , Tom Price found ' " character training " an inadequate description of the present-day aims and , furthermore , open to grave misinterpretation ' , and " leadership training " an expression which has curiously little real meaning but a large number of connotations , most of them unpleasant . ' An article in Strive of June 1968 by P. D. Fyshwick stated the problem concisely in these words : We continue to search for more quantitative measures of many training exercises but it remains true that many have to be taken on trust . This is true of attitude training , and Outward Bound is no exception. The ideal solution will be a clear and objective way of describing the effects of an Outward Bound course which will answer the questions - what changes ? in whom ? how much ? and for how long ? - pp.34-35 , Keay ( 1970 ) , " Lies damned lies " : A pilot study . Strive , 2(1) , 34-37 . <p> Perhaps the best cited early Outward Bound studies were the studies by Kelly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kelly and Baer ( US ) in the mid-1960 's to mid-1970 's conducted the first major research studied into the effect of Outward Bound programs with delinquent youth , reporting positive , long-term benefits ( Kelly , 1974 ; Kelly &amp; Baer , 1968 ) . These studies provided a significant boost to Outward Bound programming for youth at risk and helped to spawn the emergence and legitimization of adventure therapy . <p> Despite the early studies by Fletcher ( UK ) , Keay ( NZ ) , and Kelly and Baer ( US ) , it was arguably the Colorado Outward Bound School ( COBS , USA ) from the mid-1960 's to mid-1980 's which pioneered the first substantial ongoing Outward Bound research and theory program , lead particularly through the efforts of Thomas James and Stephen Barcia Bacon . The COBS research and theory efforts were independent , but supported by the developing experiential education movement in the US . In the early 1970s , the Association for Experiential Education ( AEE ) was formed and with it , the first major journal in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OB USA Inc appointed a national research director in the 1980's-1990 's , but most USA OB was , and continues to be , generated at the individual school-level . <p> In the mid-1970 's , Outward Bound Australia ( OBA ) begun its formidable 20-year research program under the leadership of Garry Richards . For example , Marsh , Richards and Barnes ( 1986a , b ) studied of the effects of standard Outward Bound Australia programs on multidimensional self-concepts . The positive results were notable because : <p> they showed positive effects of self-concept which lasted during an 18 month follow-up ; <p> there predictably stronger results in some areas of self-concept compared with other areas ; 
@@41691748 @1691748/ <h> Philosophy of Scientific Inquiry <p> Scientific inquiry refers to a set of assumptions and methods for investigating answers to questions . Scientific inquiry is characterized by its systematic approach to problem solving based on assumptions of positivism , empiricism , and objectivity . <p> Positivism refers to the assumption that all phenomena , whether physical , natural , social , or psychological , exhibit persistent pattern or regularities that can be studied . According to logical positivism , there are only two sources of knowledge : logical reasoning and empirical experience . <p> Empiricism refers to the assumption that only empirical evidence is acceptable and that only phenomenon which can be validly observed can be studied scientifically . According to empiricism , a statement is meaningful if and only if it can be proved true or false , at least in principle , by means of experience .

" This definition highlights the responsibility that every scientist must take to make sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bias their findings . That is a very high standard and one that needs to be constantly reinforced . To enhance objectivity , scientists adopt various measures to enhance objectivity . During the research process , scientists use randomization , blinding , statistical control , or other procedures to minimize , control for , or eliminate bias that may cause misleading findings . In interpreting and publishing their findings , scientists use methods such as peer review and replication as ways to make their work more objective . The extent to which scientists achieve objectivity in their work , it scientific value is enhanced .

In the case of science , positivistic assumptions are made . <p> Theory : Theory proposes abstract principles to explain and predict phenomena . Scientific theories provide a basic framework within which scientific inquiry can take place . Scientific theories are based on the positivistic philosophy used by science . Theory gives rise to development of models and hypotheses which guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on evidence and should be testable . <p> " A scientific theory is an axiomatic system that obtains an empirical interpretation through appropriate statements called rules of correspondence , which establish a correlation between real objects ( or real processes ) and the abstract concepts of the theory . The language of a theory includes two kinds of terms : observational and theoretical . The statements of a theory are divided in two groups : analytic and synthetic . Observational terms denote objects or properties that can be directly observed or measured , while theoretical terms denote objects or properties we can not observe or measure but we can only infer from direct observations . Analytic statements are a priori and their truth is based on the rules of the language ; on the contrary , synthetic statements depend on experience , and their truth can be acknowledged only by means of the experience . This conception about the structure of scientific theories is perhaps the most durable philosophical principle of the logical positivism .

For example , using a theory that it is psychologically healthy for humans to express their feelings , a group facilitator might use a particular debriefing model to guide a group discussion . <p> Research is the active process of investigation which usually follows a series of stages from developing research questions based on theory and models , design of methodology , collection and analysis of data , and interpretation and reporting . Research implements scientific inquiry to test scientific theory . In conducting research , one should be aware of the general assumptions of scientific inquiry , the underlying theory , and models derived to explain and predict the phenomena in question . <p> Evaluation investigates specific instances of phenomena ( e.g. , " How well did this particular intervention program work with this particular group of individuals ?

Select the general research topic that you would like to review the literature on for this class . Topic selection is crucial . Ideally , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are strongly encouraged to discuss the topic with potential faculty supervisors . <p> Choosing a subject for a research paper calls for good judgment and solid decision-making skills . The imagination and insight that goes into defining the research problem usually determines the ultimate value of a research study more than any other factor . The right topic can make your thesis ; the wrong one can break it . Think through a subject completely before you launch into indepth reading and writing . Unsuitable subjects often share one or more of the following characteristics : <p> They can not be completed within the time allocated ( i.e. , too broad ) . <p> They can not be researched since the material does not exist ( i.e. , too narrow ) <p> They do not persuade since they are expository or narrative ( i.e. , pedestrian ) . <p> They are inappropriate for the purposes of the course of study ( i.e. lacks relevance ) . <p> Nearly every subject can be researched , but not every subject should be researched . For example , why bother researching a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shopworn , and boring subjects usually lead to trite , shopworn , and boring research papers . Start with a fresh , exciting subject , although it is important that this topic is relevant to the field and builds on existing research . Having said , this , there is a fine line to tread - you must also find a topic which can be completed and for which material exists , including the availability of appropriate supervision for that topic . <p> 2 . Generate at least 10 possible research questions . It is recommend that start of by generating lots of ideas and not being overly concerned about the quality of the ideas . Consider using brainstorming techniques to help unlock creative thinking processes and/or concept mapping to help extend and map out your initial ideas . Often within one possible question lie the seeds of many others . Also read , Developing a Research Question . <p> In your written report , include a detailed description of your research generation activities and processes . Feel feel free to include all questions generated , but definitely include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three research questions and refine them into " good " research questions . This should involve considerable rewriting , further thinking , and quite possibly reading , research , and discussion with experts . Also , exercise 2 at Developing a Research Question should be helpful . <p> In your written report , include the final three research questions . The questions can be related or unrelated . <p> 4 . Write an evaluation of each of your three research questions . In your report , comment of the strengths and weaknesses that you see with each research question . Exercise 3 at Developing a Research Question should be helpful . <h> Brainstorming Ideas <p> Where can you get ideas for research ? here 's some proven brainstorming strategies . Experiment with these techniques to find the one or ones that suit you . By using the different techniques you may uncover other possible research topics or get new insights into your current topic . <p> Keep an idea book . Many professional writers keep an " idea book " as a place to store their ideas and let them incubate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diary or journal . Your idea book can include newspaper , magazine , and internet articles that intrigue you , scattered notes and ideas , diagrams , pictures , etc . The more you tend to the garden of ideas , the more lush it grows . <p> Listing . List all the ideas you associate with a specific subject . This method allows you to come up with many ideas fast because you are writing words , not sentences or paragraphs . List 10 ideas you have for research paper subjects . <p> Concept Mapping . Concept mapping is a visual way of sparking ideas for subjects . Many people find that concept mapping frees their mind to roam over a wider variety of ideas . Create a concept map for the most interesting research idea you have by following these steps : <p> Write your subject in the center of a page . Draw a circle around it . <p> Draw lines radiating from the center and circles at the end of each line . Write an idea in each circle . <p> Continue connecting and adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see better ways of organizing your ideas . <p> Feel free to use other visual formats , such as a diagram , model , chart , etc. if these would seem to better organize and represent the ideas you have . <p> Freewriting . Start writing about an idea and keep writing ; do n't let your pen stop moving . Nonstop writing like this jogs your memory and releases preconscious ideas and associations , as well as underlying emotions . When you freewrite , jot down whatever comes to mind . Do n't worry about full sentences , spelling , punctuation , grammar , or style . Just try to keep writing . The key to freewriting is letting your mind roam and seeing what subjects it uncovers . <p> Other people . Speak to fellow students and , importantly , to faculty about your ideas . Once you have an initial idea about a possible research question talk it over with your supervisor . What advice did your supervisor provide ? <p> Stage process : Heres a slightly different summary of a process you can go through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a general subject that interests you and fits the parameters of the assignment . <p> 2 . Phrase the subject as a question . <p> 3 . Brainstorm subdivisions of the subject to create topics . <p> 4 . Consult different sources for possible subtopics , such as the card catalog , reference books , magazines , friends , and the media . <p> 5 . Sift the ideas until you find one that suits your taste and the assignment . <p> How can you decide if you have chosen an appropriate topic and correctly refined your research question ? here 's a checklist to help you in evaluating your topic . <p> 1 . Is my topic too limited ? <p> Problem : Sometimes in your zeal to make the topic more precise , you narrow it so much that you do n't have enough left to write about . <p> Solution : Always remember how many pages you have to fill . The overly narrow topic may be just right for a 350- to 500-word essay , a research thesis at the Masters level usually constitutes approximately 10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length required by the task . A reasonable literature review for a major graduate student paper is usually 4,000 8,000 words . <p> 2 . Is my topic still too broad ? <p> Problem : You may think you have narrowed your topic sufficiently , but it may still be too vast for the assignment . <p> Solution : Check your resources . How many pages do good answers to this kind of question usually constitute ? If it takes other writers a book to answer the question you have posed , your topic is still too big . <p> 3 . Is my topic too technical ? <p> Problem : The topic you have selected is highly technical and you do n't have the background or theoretical understanding of the question needed to answer it . <p> Solution : Get a new topic . Unless you have the background you need for the topic , you 're going to end up spending most of your time backpedaling and filling in the gaps in your knowledge . This is not the time to teach yourself nuclear physics , calculus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my topic stale ? <p> Problem : Everyone seems to know everything about your topic . Who wants to read another paper about the bad effects of alcohol , speeding , or street drugs ? What reaction can you expect ? Been there , done that , got the T-shirt . If your topic bores you before you 've even started writing , then you can bet it will bore your audience . <p> Solution : Get a new topic that is fresh and original . A sparkling topic automatically gives you an edge , even if your writing is a little weak . <p> 5 . Is the topic too new ? <p> Problem : If the topic is too fresh , there may not be sufficient information available yet to fill a paper on your specific subtopics . <p> Solution : Find a topic that affords you sufficient information to cover the issue thoroughly . <p> 6 .

General <p> Adolescence is the transitionary period between childhood and adulthood ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991a ; Harper &amp; Marshall , 1991 ) . Adolescence encompasses the physiological changes of puberty - the rapid development of the child into an adult capable of sexual reproduction ( Marieb , 1992 ) . While puberty underlies adolescence , concurrent psychological and social changes contribute to make adolescence a crucial developmental stage ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991a ; Siddique &amp; D'Arcy , 1984 ) which partially determines the success of adult life ( Compas , 1993 ; Newcomb , Huba , &amp; Bentler , 1986 ) . A wealth of research has investigated psychological aspects of adolescence , painting a mixed picture about the quality of adolescent life ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ; Nussbaumer , 1988 ; Siddique &amp; D'Arcy , 1984 ; Violato &amp; Holden , 1988 ) . The ' classical ' view , which comes from socially oriented literature , sees the lives of adolescents becoming increasingly grim . For example , the proportion of adolescents growing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and committing suicide is reported to be increasing , while academic performance , physical fitness , and employment are reported to be on the decrease ( American Academy of Pediatrics , 1985 ; Braungart and Braungart , 1989 ; Csikszentmihalyi , 1991 ) . <p> Empirical psychological findings , on the other hand , do not support such dire views ( Compas , 1993 ; Feldman , 1990 ; Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ; Siddique &amp; D'Arcy , 1984 ; Stefanko , 1984 ) . Stefanko ( 1984 ) , for example , surveyed the 455 articles published between 1976 and 1981 in Adolescence and concluded that , " for the majority of adolescents , the transition to adulthood appeared to be relatively smooth , with predominant feelings of competence and affection associated with school , family , and peers " ( p.9 ) . Offer , Ostrov , Howard , and Atkinson ( 1988 ) conducted a cross-national self-image survey of 5938 adolescents in 10 countries ( Australia , Bangladesh , Hungary , Israel , Italy , Japan , Taiwan , Turkey , United States , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are remarkably consistent in reporting a positive self-image . Despite these different pictures of the quality of adolescent life , there is general agreement that adolescence involves considerable changes and adaptation to new stressors . Some of these stressors , particularly for the 20% of adolescents who are experiencing serious problems at any one time ( Stefanko , 1984 ) , are so undesirable that most people would want to prevent them from happening in the first place . <p> However , for other stressors which are an inherent part of moving from childhood to adulthood , it may be more realistic to consider how adolescents ' deal with them and whether their coping resources need to be strengthened . It has been shown in stress-related studies and cognitively-based intervention programs ( Kutash , Schlesinger , &amp; Associates , 1980 ; Lazarus &amp; Folkman , 1984 ) that the consequence of a stressor is dependent on psychological variables . By affecting key psychological processes it is theoretically possible to help adolescents deal more effectively with the stressors inherent in growing up and also to prepare them for facing unpredicted stressors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two key questions : <h> 1.1.2 . Self-concept <p> The ' self-concept ' construct can be dated back over 2000 years to the Greek philosophers ( Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ) , to the first century B.C. in Hindu scripture ( Ewert , 1982 ) , or to William James ' ( 1890 ) " The Principles of Psychology " . Self-concept 's rich history has resulted in an abundance of definitions , models , theories and assessment methodologies . Some 10,910 ' self-concept ' entries appeared in Psychological Abstracts between 1974 and 1992 ( Hattie , J. A. , 1992 ) . However major reviews have criticized self-concept research for a lack of consistent and sound theory and poor quality instrumentation ( see Hattie , J. A , 1992 ; Marsh , 1990 , 1992 ; Marsh , Parker , &amp; Barnes , 1985 ; Wylie , 1979 ) . <p> The current literature generally agrees that the self-concept is the product of cognitive appraisals an individual makes about his/her personal attributes ( Hattie , J. A. , 1992 ; Marsh et al. , 1985 ; Van der @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these self-appraisals occur frequently , making self-concept more dynamic and susceptible to change than relatively static psychological constructs such as personality dimensions ( Heatherton &amp; Weinberger , 1994 ) . <p> Empirical evidence , on the other hand , tends to report high levels of stability for self-concept over time and relatively small changes induced by most intervention efforts ( Hattie , J.M. , 1992 ; Marsh , Richards &amp; Barnes , 1986a , 1986b ; Nussbaumer , 1988 ) . Theoretical views on the structure of self-concept range from unidimensional models to hierarchical , multi-dimensional models ( Jackson &amp; Bosma , 1990 ) . J.A . Hattie 's ( 1992 ) substantial review of self-concept research concludes that there is a lot of empirical support for a multi-dimensional model of self-concept , and some support for a hierarchical model ( i.e. that there are higher order dimensions underlying the multiple dimensions ) . Uni-dimensional models of self-concept are evident in childhood and become multifaceted during adolescence ( Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ) . This changing structure of self-concept is paralleled , and perhaps caused , by the cognitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal operational or abstract level in adolescence ( Baker , 1982 ; Inhelder &amp; Piaget , 1958 ; Piaget , 1969 ) . <p> High self-concepts , that is positive self-appraisals , have a number of correlates . Some gender differences are found for specific self-concept scales - boys tend to report higher maths and physical self-concept scores , while girls tend to report higher social and verbal self-concept scores ( Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ; Marsh , et al. , 1985 ; Wylie , 1979 ) . However , major self-concept reviews consistently conclude that there are no gender differences for other self-concept dimensions and for total self-concept . Correlates that have been more strongly associated with higher self-concepts are : ( a ) internal locus of control , ( b ) desirable home environments , ( c ) supportive and attentive communication style , and ( d ) versatile and deep processing study skills ( Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ) . <p> While these findings do not demonstrate causal links with self-concept , they do contribute to establishing the construct validity of the self-concept construct as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correlates with high self-concepts invites the speculation that enhancement of self-concept may also have positive effects in other areas of individuals ' functioning . <p> If a long history and large volume of related research are any measure , then the importance of self-concept as a core psychological construct would be difficult to overstate . At the same time , it must be borne in mind that too much self-concept research has been correlational , descriptive , and used over simplistic theories and methodologies ( Hattie , J.A. , 1992 ; Wylie , 1979 ) . Currently there is a need to conduct more intensive research on self-concept , and particularly on self-concept change programs , to further our understanding of self-concepts ' underlying mechanisms , self-concept 's amenability to change , and to examine the validity of self-concept instrumentation ( Hattie , J. A. , 1992 ) . <h> 1.1.3 . Mental health <p> Mental health , like self-concept , has a long history as a major psychological construct . Traditionally mental health has been considered as the absence of mental disorder . More recently , definitions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological well-being ( Compas , 1993 ; Schaefer &amp; Moos , 1992 ; Sleet &amp; Dane , 1985 ) . Today , mental health is understood as the capacity of an individual to function in ways that promote their own and others ' subjective well-being ( Raphael , 1993 ) . The absence of mental disorder is dependent on an individual 's resilience to biological , psychosocial , and environmental risk factors ( Brooks-Gunn &amp; Paikoff , 1993 ; Compas , 1993 , Raphael , 1993 ) . Resilience can be developed , according to Schaefer and Moos ( 1992 ) , by confronting stressful experiences and coping with them effectively . The concept of well-being refers to an individual 's capacity to experience ' wellness ' , that is , to enjoy life , experience satisfaction , and feel optimistic ( Veit &amp; Ware , 1983 ; Wood , Rhodes , &amp; Whelan , 1989 ) . The inclusion of well-being in the domain of mental health has allowed mental health assessments to be made of normal populations . Measures of mental disorder are typically subject to floor effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrimination of the quality of mental health ( Fry , 1992 ) . Measures of well-being , on the other hand , provide a more sensitive and discriminating assessment of the quality of mental health for people relatively free of mental illness ( Veit &amp; Ware , 1983 ) . he dimensional structure of mental health is an ongoing debate . <p> Convincing findings come from Veit and Ware 's ( 1983 ) major study with 5089 subjects aged between 13 and 69 years old which provided strong psychometric support for a hierarchical model of mental health . Based on their Mental Health Inventory ( MHI ) , Veit and Ware ( 1983 ) extracted two higher order correlated factors - psychological distress and well-being - as well as five lower order correlated factors - anxiety , depression , emotional ties , general positive affect , and loss of behavioural/emotional control . <p> Correlates of mental disorder have been studied more extensively than correlates of well-being . Generally , mental disorder research associates the existence of mental problems with other life difficulties . Other research shows that psychological well-being is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al. , 1989 ) . There exists a distinct need to investigate pro-active methods of developing resilience to psychological distress and of fostering psychological well-being , particularly for the large population of normal adolescents . <h> 1.1.4 . Coping <p> Studies of coping grew out of research on stress in the 1960s , 1970s , and 1980s ( Carpenter , 1992 ; Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991a ) . Early approaches to the theory and measurement of coping were based on Freud 's psychodynamic theory and others were based on ego psychology ( Carpenter , 1992 ) . More recently , following the development of cognitive-appraisal models in stress research , coping has been explained as an individual 's psychological mediation between the perceived demands of the external world and the perceived needs of the internal world . Coping refers to all strategies - whether cognitive , emotional , or physical - that an individual uses to negotiate between their internal and external environments . Stressors occur all the time , making continuous demands on individuals ' physiological and psychological systems to adapt ( Selye , 1980 ) . Coping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . <p> Based on Lazarus and Folkman 's ( 1984 ) transactional model of psychological stress , coping can be understood as part of an **31;1491;TOOLONG feedback loop . In this explanation , coping begins with a cognitive judgement which decides whether or not a situation is stressful ( i.e. , whether or not the individual needs to adapt ) . If it is judged that adaptation needs to take place , then a coping strategy is chosen . A coping strategy can impact by : ( a ) minimizing the stress response , ( b ) removing or reducing situational demands , ( c ) increasing available resources ( e.g. , obtaining professional help ) or , ( d ) altering the cognitive appraisal itself ( Carpenter , 1992 ) . The outcome of the coping response is then cognitively re-appraised by the individual , leading to a continuation of the **31;1524;TOOLONG feedback loop . Empirical support has come from laboratory studies which show that the way an event is cognitively appraised influences the coping strategy subsequently chosen ( Stone , Kennedy-Moore , Newman , Greenberg , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies on children and adolescents across a wide range of stressors generally support the usefulness of Lazarus and Folkman 's transactional model of psychological stress ( Compas , 1993 ; Compas , et al. , 1988 ) . With the cognitive developments of adolescence a wider selection of coping strategies which make use of concrete and abstract thinking become available ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991b ) . An individual 's coping style emerges from the integration of cognitive developments with the normative events and specific stressors that occur during childhood and adolescence , with long term consequences for shaping coping behaviour in adulthood ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991b ) . This supports the notion that a short-term experiential intervention may be able to have a positive and long-term influence on coping responses . <p> Coping researchers have had some difficulty establishing a consistent factor structure across different contexts , subject populations , and instruments . Some consensus does seem to have emerged for the broad structure of problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping ( Carpenter , 1992 ; Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ; Stone , et al. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treat these two factors as underlying , and to some extent masking , more specific coping strategies ( Carpenter , 1992 ; Compas , 1993 ; Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ; McCrae , 1992 ) . <p> The coping behaviours used by Australian adolescents have been investigated in several studies by Frydenberg ( 1993 ) and Frydenberg and Lewis ( 1991a , 1991b , 1993b , 1994a , 1994b ) . These studies indicate that , although Australian adolescents are resourceful in managing their concerns , there are numerous strategies which could be developed to enhance their repertoire of coping responses ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ) . <p> The cognitive appraisal process provides a theoretical mechanism through which therapeutic or educational intervention can act ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1991b ) . There is currently a need to develop an understanding of which coping strategies it is desirable to change , which coping strategies are amenable to change , and different methodologies by which successful coping strategy intervention can be achieved . <h> 1.2 . Intervention programs <p> Adolescence has been discussed in terms of three psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attention is now turned to intervention programs and their effects in these key psychological areas . <h> 1.2.1 . Self-concept effects <p> Self-concept enhancement has been a major aim of numerous psychotherapy and education programs . J. M. Hattie ( 1992 ) conducted a meta-analysis of 89 studies ( 485 effect sizes ESs1 ) which assessed change in self-concept measures as an outcome of intervention programs . Overall , a moderate average ES of .37 was found , with control groups reporting an ' unexpected ' non-zero ES of .12 . There was considerable variability in ESs between studies . Cognitively-based programs had higher ESs ( .47 ) than affectively-based programs ( .12 ) or non-specific programs ( .37 ) . The highest ES of the 16 coded categories was for physically oriented programs ( .58 ) , with the sub-category of camps and summer schools , including Outward Bound programs , achieving an ES of .97 . This compares favourably with the average effect size of .68 for psychotherapy outcomes ( Smith , Glass , &amp; Miller , 1980 ) . Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) conducted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescents . Based on 43 studies ( 235 ESs ) , a small to medium ( see Footnote 2 ) ES of .31 was reported . When effect sizes were further related to the specific conditions under which the programs are conducted , a more detailed picture emerged : <p> ( c ) Program Length . J. M. Hattie ( 1992 ) did not find a linear relationship between program length and ES , although this may have been due to the restricted program length categories she used . Residential programs achieved higher ESs ( .48 ) than full day ( .21 ) and half day ( .46 ) programs ( Hattie , J.M. , 1992 ) . Cason and Gillis ( 1994 ) found a significant and positive correlation between program length and ES ( r = .174 , p &lt; .008 ) . <h> 1.2.2 . Mental health and coping effects <p> Mental health enhancement programs have used a wide range of methodologies and have been applied to different populations of adolescents . However , no clear picture of the effectiveness of these programs can be gained because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be of poor quality ( Klein , Kotelchuck , &amp; DeFreise , 1990 ) . Compas ( 1993 ) surveyed empirical evaluation studies of adolescent mental health programs . Although he did not report outcome statistics succeeded in building both the skills to cope with stress and involvement in personally meaningful activities . <p> One of Compas ' ( 1993 ) recommendations was for future programs and research to further investigate the characteristics of positive mental health from multiple perspectives , including adolescents , parents , and teachers . This is because the goals of existing interventions tend to be skewed towards achieving outcomes primarily valued by mental health professionals . The result is that mental health promotion programs are mainly focused on removing signs of psychopathology as opposed to increasing resilience to psychological distress or specifically fostering psychological well-being . <p> A second of Compas ' ( 1993 ) recommendations is that mental health interventions should expand beyond a person-centred model to include a range of helping and socializing interventions , meaning that the attitudes and behaviours of teachers , parents , and others who interact with adolescents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two of Compas ' ( 1993 ) other recommendations are consistent with J. M. Hattie 's ( 1992 ) findings . Firstly , schools should remain a primary context for the promotion of positive mental health , but there is a need to expand intervention efforts to include other settings and contexts . This is consistent with J. M. Hattie 's meta-analysis which showed higher ESs for programs outside the school setting . Compas 1993 ) also emphasized the role of physical health in mental health and argued for the integration of mental and physical health promotion efforts . Given that the highest ES of J. M. Hattie 's 16 categories was found for physically based programs , there appears to be sound empirical support for such an approach . <h> 1.2.3 . Characteristics of effective intervention programs <p> This research review suggests that an intervention program which positively affects the self-concept , mental health , and coping resources of normal adolescents would : <p> ( a ) be physically oriented , <p> ( b ) use the school context , but outside the school setting , <p> ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ) be of a long duration , <p> ( e ) be conducted by therapists or trained group leaders , <p> ( f ) incorporate the aims of adolescents , parents and teachers , and <p> ( g ) include teachers , parents and others involved with adolescents as targets in the program . <p> Given that these characteristics have been associated with positive outcomes , intervention programs which come close to meeting these criteria deserve further research attention . <h> 1.2.4 . Outward Bound high school programs <h> 1.2.4.1 . Intervention characteristics <p> Outward Bound Australia high school programs have five of the seven characteristics and at least some aspects of the other two ) associated with effective adolescent intervention programs : <p> a ) A physically oriented program . Outward Bound high school programs use a wilderness expedition format . This involves a developmental series of physically-based activities such as camping , bushwalking , rafting , abseiling/rockclimbing , environmental awareness activities , and communication exercises . <p> b ) Use the school context , but outside the school setting . Outward Bound high school programs are designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take place in an environment completely separate from the school setting . <p> c ) In a residential setting . Outward Bound programs are residential , that is , they involve the students 24 hours a day . <p> d ) For a long duration . Outward Bound high school programs are 9 to 10 days in length . <p> e ) Conducted by therapists or trained group leaders . Outward Bound high school programs are conducted by ' trained group leaders ' or , in Outward Bound terminology , instructors . Instructors are selected on the basis of their ability to facilitate personal development using outdoor activities as their learning medium ( Outward Bound Australia , 1994e ) . Outward Bound instructors are trained in-house in the technical skills of outdoor activities and educational techniques for individual and group development . <p> f ) Incorporate the aims of adolescents , parents and teachers . Outward Bound high school programs incorporate the aims of teachers at two levels : <p> ( i ) in the initial design of the program by Outward Bound in conjunction with the school , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Outward Bound instructor work as a team with each group of students . <p> The aims of adolescents are incorporated at two levels : <p> ( iii ) in the initial design of the program if these aims are recognized and expressed to Outward Bound by the high school , and <p> iv ) by instructors helping the students set individual and group goals and reviewing these goals with the students during the program . The aims of parents are incorporated indirectly through expression of their aims to the high school . <p> g ) Include teachers , parents and others involved with adolescents as targets in the program . Teachers are included as targets of Outward Bound high school programs by having them work with Outward Bound instructors and the students throughout the program . This provides teachers with opportunities for their own personal development and also to develop closer relationships with their students . Generally , parents are not included as targets of the program , although they are invited to an information meeting conducted by a senior Outward Bound staff member at the high school prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will do during the Outward Bound program . <h> 1.2.4.2 . Philosophy and practice <p> Outward Bound Australia school programs involve " total and integrated programming incorporating physical and adventure based activities , personal development techniques and academic studies in the field " ( Richards , 1977 , p.123 ) . Although Outward Bound programs do not derive from any specific psychological theory , the basic underlying tenet is that " all forms of growth in the human being , whether they be physical , psychological , social or cognitive can be significantly enhanced by the individual engaging himself in active experiences in these various fields " ( Richards , 1977 , p.37 ) . The impact is further enhanced by the " great interdependence of these variables evidenced in Outward Bound " ( Richards , 1977 , p.37 ) . <p> Outward Bound instructors use a ' guided discovery learning ' approach ( Outward Bound Australia , 1994b , 1994c ) . This means providing enough direction and structure to guide the students ' development and to ensure a high chance of ' learning success ' , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover for themselves ( Outward Bound Australia , 1994a ) . The emphasis is on learning through personal and group discovery , as opposed to didacticism. <h> 1.2.4.3 . Aims and objectives <p> The stated objectives for Outward Bound Australia school programs are to provide a learning environment which : <p> ( f ) challenges the individual to cope with change , overcome difficulties and build on their strengths , <p> ( g ) creates real life experiences which complement and reinforce the learning from within the classroom , and <p> ( h ) develops a rapport between staff and students not readily attainable in a school environment ( Outward Bound Australia , 1994c ) . <p> A pilot study conducted by Neill ( 1994 ) clarified the aims of Outward Bound high school programs from the perspectives of Outward Bound instructors and accompanying high school teachers . Fourteen instructors and thirteen teachers were surveyed with regard to their overall objectives as well as the particular self-concept dimensions and coping strategies which they aimed to influence during Outward Bound high school programs . The picture emerged that some dimensions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The self-concept dimensions which instructors and teachers identified Outward Bound high school programs as aiming to enhance were : Physical Abilities , Physical Appearance , Single-Sex Relations , Honesty-Trustworthiness , Emotional Stability , and General Self ( Marsh , 1990 ) . The coping strategies which instructors and teachers aimed to encourage on Outward Bound high school programs were : Social Support , Focus on Solving the Problem , Work hard and Achieve , Focusing on the Positive , Physical Recreation , and Social Action ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ) . The coping strategies which instructors and teachers aimed to discourage were : Worrying , Seeking to Belong , Wishful thinking , Not Coping , Tension Reduction , Ignoring the Problem , Self-Blame , and Keeping to Self ( Frydenberg &amp; Lewis , 1993a ) . <h> 1.2.4.4 . Past research <p> Outward Bound 's eclectic theoretical basis presents a significant challenge to the serious researcher . The majority of research on Outward Bound and outdoor education has used a " black box " approach , focusing on program outcomes and ignoring their relationship to process issues ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Outward Bound Australia , 1994d ; Shore , 1977 ) . Research on Outward Bound high school programs has been inconclusive . Spinaze ( 1986 ) conducted a pre-post program evaluation of the effects of a 9 day Outward Bound program for 29 Year 11 boys using the Tennessee Self-Concept instrument , finding statistically non-significant gains for each scale , with no followup or control group . Nussbaumer ( 1988 ) investigated the effects of different outdoor education programs , including two Outward Bound high school programs with female students , on physical self-concept . One of the Outward Bound high school programs ( N = 176 ) found a significant gain in overall physical self-concept compared to the control group , a change which was sustained at a three month followup . There was no reported change in overall physical self-concept for the second Outward Bound high school program ( N = 59 ) . One consistent finding from Nussbaumer 's study was a significant main effect for time for experimental and control groups . Unfortunately two-way interaction analyses between time and experimental condition were not reported for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change for the experimental and control groups unanswered . <p> Parle ( 1983 ) investigated the role of self-efficacy in a voluntary 10 day Outward Bound high school course for 109 female Year 9 students . The control group consisted of 60 students from the same school and year level who had chosen not to attend . The study included a one month follow-up assessment . Students who attended the Outward Bound program had higher ' Outward-Bound-specific self-efficacy ' scores than the control group to start with , and this difference increased by the end of the Outward Bound program . Participants in the Outward Bound program also reported an increase in their general self-efficacy at the end of the program . However the non-participants ' caught-up ' at the follow-up assessment . Parle 1983 ) suggested this was due to social influence from the Outward Bound participants returning to the school environment . While the study supported the effects of Outward Bound high school programs on specific and general self-efficacy , the results were limited by the poor quality scales used ( Parle , 1983 ) . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) expressed concern over the quality of studies available for inclusion in her meta-analysis . From an original pool of 650 self-concept change studies , only 89 reported basic outcome statistics ( e.g. , N , mean , standard deviation ) from which an ES could be calculated . Of these 89 studies , 10 studies used control groups and 4 studies conducted followup assessments . In other words , less than 1% of the original pool of self-concept change studies used an experimental or quasi-experimental design and reported basic followup statistics . This is particularly disturbing in the light of J. M. Hattie 's finding that control groups exhibit a non-zero ES ( .12 ) . In addition , there is evidence that pre-post testing conducted immediately before and after a program is subject to distorting that self-report scores measured immediately prior to an intervention tend be depressed because of the proximity of anticipated situational demands . Marsh , Richards , and Barnes ( 1986a , 1986b ) discussed the phenomenon of post-group euphoria , temporary elation at the end of intervention , which can inflate post-test scores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( 1994 ) finding that less empirically sound studies were more likely to have more positive findings . <p> There is a distinct need for sound research design to be applied to the evaluation of intervention programs . Such studies need to : <p> ( a ) use outcome measures with established reliability and validity , <p> ( b ) match outcome measures to program objectives , <p> ( c ) use control groups ( or establish a baseline through time series design ) and followup assessments , and <p> d ) report standardized statistics . <p> The ultimate aim of adopting these measures is for intervention studies to make a systematic contribution to the accumulation of knowledge about key elements of effective of intervention programs . <h> 1.3 . Research questions <p> This review of psychological constructs related to adolescence reveals some unresolved issues . Adolescence is understood as a developmental period which involves a number of stressors . Although adolescence is experienced reasonably well on the whole , many researchers suggest a need to help develop adolescents ' ability to deal with these stressors . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in some cases empirically , to self-concept , mental health , and coping . Most research in these areas treats each particular psychological construct in isolation from other psychological constructs . Such research is necessary , particularly as further knowledge is still needed about the structure of each of these constructs . There is , however , a need to develop a broader understanding of how these psychological aspects of adolescence can be changed through intervention efforts and how they change in conjunction with one another . <p> The current review of intervention program research reveals a number of characteristics associated with relatively large ESs . Further investigation is needed to determine whether or not these characteristics are causally related to the intervention program outcomes and , if so , to understand why . Evaluation of intervention programs offers opportunities to answer not only practical questions about the quality of the intervention but also theoretical questions about the structure , stability , and interrelationships between the various psychological constructs that are measured . <h> 1.4 . Aims of the present study <p> The present study investigated an adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high outcome effects in order to : <p> ( a ) determine what outcomes are achieved by an intervention program currently being applied to thousands of Australian adolescents , <p> ( b ) investigate whether or not there are causal relationships between the outcomes and the intervention program , <p> ( c ) shed light on the susceptibility of self-concept , mental health , and well-being to positive change , <p> ( d ) demonstrate use of key research design elements required to make sound conclusions about intervention program effects , and <p> ( e ) make a contribution to Outward Bound program philosophy and practice . <h> 1.5 . Hypotheses <h> Hypothesis 1a <p> Based on the observation that Outward Bound high school programs exhibit a number of characteristics associated with effective self-concept enhancement programs , it was hypothesized that : ' There will be an improvement in Outward Bound participants ' overall self-concept compared to any changes in the control group . ' <h> Hypothesis 1b <p> According to multi-dimensional self-concept models , some self-concept dimension scores can change while others remain the same ( Hattie , J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Outward Bound high school program objectives ( Outward Bound Australia , 1994c ) and programs , it appears that the programs aim to affect some dimensions of self-concept more directly than others .

Ego psychology , as a particular perspective within the psychoanalytic framework , developed post-Freud . It is a psychodynamic framework in which ego functioning is seen as very important . Anna Freud , Sigmund Freuds daughter , analysed defense mechanisms ( the egos protective devices ) in detail . <p> Freud felt that the egos primary task was to mediate among the i 'd , superego and external reality . Ego psychologists differ from Freud by stating that : <p> The ego is involved in adaptation ( Carver &amp; Scheier ) , i.e. that the goal of behaviour is adaptation to the environment and that the ego is strongly involved ; and that <p> The ego is present at birth <p> A number of famous ego psychologists have built on Freuds early work but with a greater and different emphasis on the ego . These ego psychologists can all be classified as Neo-analysists . Examples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erikson ( 1963 , 1974 ) ; Freud ( 1946 ) ; Hartmann ( 1939 , 1964 ) ; Loevinger , ( 1969 , 1976 , 1987 ) ; White ( 1959 , 1963 ) . <p> The material below focuses on Adler and Erikson , along with 2 other Neoanalysists who are not classed as ego-psychologists : Jung and Horney . <h> Alfred Adler 1870-1937 <p> Alfred Adler strove throughout his life to overcome his sense of inferiority : he was the 3rd of 6 children and lived in his elder brothers shadow . He suffered rickets and pneumonia as a child and was therefore a pretty poor physical specimen . <p> Adler was the first disciple of Freud to strongly disagree with the master . He thought Freud focussed too much on sex as the ultimate motivator and organiser of behaviour . <p> Adler developed his own psychological society , and established his own journal . He called his approach individual psychology . <p> " It ( the striving for superiority ) lies at the root of all solutions of lifes problems and is manifested in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow its direction " ( Adler in Ansbacher and Ansbacher , 1956 , p. 103 ) . <p> Behaviour motivated by striving for superiority : He believed that all of us begin life with a sense of inferiority . He believed that a striving for superiority was THE motivating force in life . <p> However he did n't  believe that achievement = mental health . He argued that well-adjusted people express their striving for superiority through concern for the social interest . e.g. successful business people achieve a sense of superiority and satisfaction through their accomplishments in business but are only truly happy if they reach their goals with consideration to others i.e their staff and their customers . <h> Carl Gustav Jung 1875-1961 <p> Carl Gustav Jung was born in 1875 . In 1906 he began a regular correspondence with Freud . Jung first met Freud in person in 1907 . Freud decided that Jung was his heir apparent and in 1910 when the Psychoanalytic Association was founded , Jung became its first President . Their relationship cooled and was fully terminated in 1914 . <p> After World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It set the differences between his position and that of Freud . Jung became more interested in the study of mythological and religious symbolism . His studies took him across the globe where he observed many different cultures . He was interested in tracing the analogies between the contents of the unconscious in Western man and the myths , cults , and rituals of primitive peoples . <p> Jungian therapy deals with dreams and fantasies . A discussion is set up between the conscious and the contents of the unconscious . When the therapy works the patient enters an individuation process . This consists of psychological transformations ending in the opposite tendencies working together to achieve personal wholeness . <p> " Instead of being at the mercy of wild beasts , earthquakes , landslides and inundations , modern man is battered by the elemental forces of his own psyche . " ( Jung , 1934 ) <p> Jung was a bitter defector from Freud 's inner circle . Jung had been viewed by Freud as his heir apparent . <p> Jung shared Freud 's view of the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sexual and aggressive drives ( which he thought Freud over-emphasised ) , all humans inherited a desire to seek higher religious fulfilment and self development . His thinking was dominated by the principle of opposites . He believed that the human experience consists of polarities - qualities that oppose and tend to balance each other . For example he believed that people are dominated by attitudes of either introversion and extraversion. ( also postulates polar opposite types in terms of thinking / feeling and sensing / intuiting ) . <p> Via Jung 's study of cross-cultural anthropology and mythology , he was led to posit a collective unconscious or universal set of ideas or memories that are part of our biological heritage : he believed Freud overlooked this collective unconscious . <p> He believed that this collective unconscious contains certain archetypes : inherited tendencies that predispose us to view the external world in certain ways . Jung believed the following are archetypes we all share : <p> Mother , father , wise old man , the moon , God , death , snakes and the hero . Modern work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built-in tendency to learn some associations more readily than others . e.g. easier to learn fear of snakes than of say cars which our ancestors never encountered . <p> Some other archetypes which were particularly important in Jungs writings were : <p> The anima ; the animus ; the shadow ; and the self . <p> Anima / Animus : Jung believed that although we each have a sex gender we are not purely male or female . He believed each of us has aspects of the opposite sex both in biological and psychological terms . The anima is the feminine side of the male psyche and the animus is the masculine side of the female psyche . <p> Shadow : This Jung considered to be the unconscious part of ourselves that is essentially negative ; the dark side ( Cole/Balthazar ) . <p> Self : the central archetype ; the striving for unity of all parts of personality . <p> Persona : Jung believed that that we all have a persona ( latin = mask ) which represents a compromise between our true self and the expectations of society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become asocial whereas if we try to hard to comply with societys expectations we put our true identity and our fulfillment at risk . <h> Karen Horney 1885-1952 <p> Karen Horney was born in Germany in 1885 . She became a doctor of medicine ( encouraged by her mother but not her father ) at a time this was unusual for women . She was a career woman , a mother to 3 daughters and eventually a divorcee . She was one of the early feminist psychologists . <p> She moved to the US in 1932 and eventually founded both the Association for the Advancement of Psychoanalysis and the American Institute of Psychoanalysis . <p> She came to believe more and more that environmental factors such as keeping a job , paying bills and other social factors were very important in inducing neurotic behaviour . <p> " Is not the tremendous strength in men of the impulse to creative work in every field precisely due to their feeling of playing a relatively small part in the creation of living beings , which constantly compels them to an overcompensation in achievement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a woman feels deep inferiority because she lacks a penis . Horney , particularly after she experienced childbirth and motherhood , led her to feel that mens experiences in life were shallow in comparison . She came to believe that the fact that men had only a small part to play in the creating and nurturing of new life led men to suffer from a deep sense of inferiority . She backed this up with her reports that in much of the therapy she conducted with men they showed envy of womens ability to have children . <p> Freud suggested that Horneys whole theory was based on penis-envy ! <p> Karen Horney , like Adler focused on social interactions as the source of adult motivations . She believed that our adult personality and behaviour often represent attempts to deal with this concept she called basic anxiety . This she felt was the childhood feeling of being alone , isolated and helpless in a potentially hostile world . According to Horney , basic anxiety results not from sexual or aggressive conflicts but from disturbances in the childs relationship with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the breakdown of trust , overprotection can all lead to excessive anxiety , according to Horney . This is minimised by being raised with trust , love , warmth and tolerance . <p> She believed that in attempting to deal with basic anxiety , the person develops a characteristic social orientation , which could include being dependent on others for security and very submissive to them ; the feeling one has to meet that one right person to make everything right ; by developing an inflated self-concept to cope with insecurity and being competitive with others ; or being avoidant of others ( similarities here with the work of Bowlby , Ainsworth and attachment and attachment patterns in adulthood : romantic love ) . <h> Erik Erikson ( 1902-1994 ) <p> Erik Erikson was born in Germany in 1902 ( of Danish parents ) . His father abandoned his mother when he was 3 and she remarried a Jew . Young Eric looked like a Scandinavian but was brought up as a Jew with the Jewish name - Homburger . He trained as an analyst in Vienna under Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a great impact upon his theory and his therapy . He came to believe that the attainment and preservation of a sense of identity was a critical task of growing up . <p> Erikson agreed with Freud that development occurs in stages . However unlike Freud he emphasised social as opposed to sexual development . He also felt that development occurs across the lifespan rather than just during childhood . <p> The central theme is ego identity : To Erikson , the ego is a relatively powerful , independent part of personality that works towards goals such as establishing ones identity and satisfying a need for mastery over the environment . Basically , the principal function of the ego is to establish and maintain a sense of identity . Eriksons approach to personality is often called ego psychology . <p> Erikson believed there are 8 psychosocial stages and that there is a crisis / conflict at each stage . He believed that how we resolve each of these crises determines our the direction our personality development will take . Each stage is characterised by 2 different ways to resolve the crisis : one maladaptive and one adaptive .

Udana 68-69 : <h> Examples of integrating perspectives and concepts <h> Psycho-analytic &amp; Evolutionary Perspectives <p> For one thing , psycho-analytic and evolutionary perspectives on personality were constructed at similar times , in the late 19th century , courtesy of Freud and Darwin respectively . But more importantly , they have in common the notion of an unconscious . In evolutionary terms , we can understand the unconscious as the reptilian and mammalian parts of the brain , deeply seated urges which were successful for homo sapiens ' adaptation and survival . Only in relatively recent evolutionary history did human consciousness , as we know it , evolve to include conscious self-awareness . <p> Can you find other similarities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was criticized for overly focusing on the libido as being driven by sexual energy , but the theory of evolution would seem to support that the sexual urge is a critical and fundamental necessity for survival . <h> Humanistic &amp; Evolutionary Perspectives <p> It seems rarely considered , but there is an important commonality shared by the humanistic and evolutionary perspectives . Both perspectives are evolutionary in the broadest sense of the word . The humanistic perspective tends to focus on the future potential evolution of individual human beings , whereas the evolutionary perspective tends to focus on the past evolution of human beings as a species . The notion of the human species as involved in a story of unfolding and developing psychological capacity underlies both perspectives . What other connections can you see ? <h> On eclecticism &amp; integral psychology <p> " There is no need to choose a single lens for psychology when we can enjoy a kaleidoscope of perspectives . " - Sandra Scarr ( 1985 , p.511 ) cited in Carver &amp; Scheier , ( 2000 , p.510 ) <p> It can be fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be helpful . For example , in post-graduate social work and clinical psychology courses , students are actively encouraged to draw from many perspectives . But be warned of the dangers here - do n't hide behind vague statements which give no weight to one theory over another . This is lame . The real meaning of eclecticism is not equal inclusion of everything , but rather drawing the best perspective from amongst multiple perspectives as opposed to being hostage to a single perspective or a fence-sitter between all perspectives . <p> eclectic Ec*lec " tic - 1 . Selecting ; choosing ( what is true or excellent in doctrines , opinions , etc. ) from various sources or systems ; as , an eclectic philosopher . 2 . Consisting , or made up , of what is chosen or selected ; as , an eclectic method ; an eclectic magazine . <p> The goal of an " integral psychology " is to honor and embrace every legitimate aspect of human consciousness under one roof . This book presents one of the first truly integrative models of consciousness , psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western , ancient and modern--Wilber creates a psychological model that includes waves of development , streams of development , states of consciousness , and the self , and follows the course of each from subconscious to self-conscious to superconscious . Included in the book are charts correlating over a hundred psychological and spiritual schools from around the world , including Kabbalah , Vedanta , Plotinus , Teresa of -vila , Aurobindo , Theosophy , and modern theorists such as Jean Piaget , Erik Erikson , Jane Loevinger , Lawrence Kohlberg , Carol Gilligan , Erich Neumann , and Jean Gebser . Integral Psychology is Wilber 's most ambitious psychological system to date , and it is already being called a landmark study in human development . <h> Exploring topics related to personality <p> Although sometimes studied as single subject , personality is rarely studied on its own . More typically , researchers are interested to explore possible connections between personality and other aspects of life and behavior . Here are some examples : <h> Looking back : Where have we succeeded &amp; where have we failed ? <p> We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological uniqueness and similarities that can be characterized as personality . <p> We have failed in that so much about human behavior and experience remains unexplained . Remember the correlations between personality and actual behavior are roughly .3 to .4 at best , i.e. , roughly 10 to 20% . <h> Looking forward : Trends in personality <p> In the 21st century , it might become as popular to craft a personality as it has been in the 20th century to craft a particular physical look . Personal development is a growth industry ( pun intended ! ) e.g. , personal coaching is increasingly popular , and the promise of " new age " experiences continues to appeal to many <p> What other trends do you think we might we see ? For example , do you think we will be able to choose the temperament of our babies via genetic engineering ? <p> Personality &amp; The Big 5 : The use of the Big Five Supertraits to organise and understand the universe of traits is being increasingly pursued in research ; its dominance looks set to continue <p> Personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " terrorist " personality and seek methods of screening and dealing with potential " terrorists " <p> Personality &amp; marketing : In the search for profits , big companies will fund research into how to customize marketing to target particular personalities , e.g. , motivating music ! <p> Personality &amp; alternative health : Integration between personality and medicine is common in non-Western culture and will become attractive ( but not as attractive as pills to pharaceutical companies ! ) <p> Personality &amp; multiplicity : Are we one or many ? Western culture has adopted a unitary view of self , whereas many other cultures , especially indigenous cultures view self as having multiple parts worth exploring . In Western culture , now , for example , increasing drug use to alter consciousness can be seen as an example of this ancient view of self . <h> Develop your own personality theory <p> Despite all the theory by famous people , at the end of the day , each person operates with some fundamental assumptions about how he/she and others function psychologically . These assumptions are powerful . We are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feeling , and making inferences and hypotheses about the reasons for their behavior . <p> put it all back together in a way that better equips you to succeed in the kind of work you hope to do <p> be aware of the strengths and weaknesses of your perspective <p> In this way one 's amateur assumptions can be become at least semi-professional , but still be " true to one 's self " . I agree with Funder ( 2002 ) that after considering different perspectives it is probably helpful to adopt the perspective that appeals most , and then work actively to improve it to suit your particular situation and needs that evolve over time . <h> Personality &amp; multiplicity <p> Are you one or many ? There is an implicit assumption in most Western psychology that we are united , singular psychology entities , whereas we can also be considered separate , disparate parts . For example , this is the basis of psycho-analytic theory - e.g. , I 'd , Ego , Superego . In Western psychology we tend to label persistent experiences of altered consciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a normal aspect of consciousness . <p> In modern society , our basic physiological needs are reasonably satisfied , so there is greater opportunity to experience other parts of self . With huge amounts of information available , modern methods of travel , and so on , the global age serves up a huge platter of possibilities for self-creation . Completely different and unique lives can be manufactured , including lives of multiple parts . Indeed , this may even be an adaptive response ( e.g. , case of Sybil ) . <p> So , why not explore multiple aspects of self ? In many respects , the unitary sense of self is a construction or defence against the plurality of consciousness . It may seem safest to stick with one consciousness , but multiplicity has a way of making its presence felt . Freud referred to the techniques one use 's to keep one 's unwanted consciousness away as defense mechanisms . However , in particular environments , people can feel more comfortable about letting these other urges come through . And sometimes people characterize these other ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not explore the labyrinth , since we are all serving a lifetime in the dungeon of self ( aka Cyril Connolly , The Unquiet Grave , Ch 1 ) . <h> Exploring multiplicity : " The Dice Man " by Luke Rhinehart <p> Luke Rhinehart is the pseudonymn of George Cockroft who wrote a cult bestseller in the 1970 's called " The Dice Man " . In the book , Rhinehart is a bored psychiatrist who decides that his life is boring because his dominant self keeps his other urges effectively under control . So , he experiments with giving other aspects of self a chance to be expressed . He does this by writing down what he might want to do in any given moment , laying out 6 possibilities , then rolling a dice and following the decision that comes up . Rolling dice becomes an obsession for Rhinehart and he adopts increasingly large , risky and perverse possibilities as the book continues . <p> During the 1990 's there was a resurgence of interest in the novel , and there are many people who practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several dice websites , if you want to explore the idea further - go to Multiplicity links . <h> Where will it all end : Is personality transformation possible ? <p> " at this point in history , the most radical , pervasive , and earth-shaking transformation would occur simply if everybody truly evolved to a mature , rational , and responsible ego , capable of freely participating in the open exchange of mutual self-esteem " - Ken Wilber ( 1981 , p. 328 ) <p> Personality has been emphasized through this course as defined by that which is psychologically characteristic of a person and reasonably persistent over time and across situations . But we should also consider the possibility of radical personality transformation , which . Basically , if sufficient conditions occur ( e.g. , supportive therapeutic environment and efficacious methodology ) then personality characteristics can be reshaped . As Wilber optimistically points out of above , it may even be possible for radical shifts to occur quite rapidly in the psyche of an entire human culture .

The designers of the 25-item Resilience Scale ( Wagnild &amp; Young . 1993 ) purported five factors . A subset of 15 of the original items is provided from data collected from young Australian adults by Neill &amp; Dias ( 2001 ) . Check whether a five factor solution holds up for the data . For this factor analysis , we are interested in developing a theoretical understanding of the underlying psychological components of resilience , so use Principal Axis Factoring ( PAF ) , which looks at the shared variance amongst the items , not all the items ' variance . <p> You should find that there are really not enough primary loadings on 4 or 5 factors to justify their presence , therefore try 2 and 3 factors . Best approach is probably 2 factors ( " taking control " and " taking it easy " ) , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three worst items 2 , 8 , and 17 ) and using an oblimin rotation . <p> It seems that according to this data , psychological resilience consists of two main underlying components . The first factor , " Solve " is about taking control , making plans , being determined , task oriented , active , and disciplined , and solving problems ( 7 items - 1 , 14 , 10 , 15 , 6 , 24 , 21 ) . The second factor , " Flow " is about a flexible approach to coping , including being able to take things in one 's stride , taking it easy , laughing things off , and finding alternative ways through problems ( 5 items - 19 , 7 , 23 , 16 , 9 ) .

Yet , further exploration of the factor loadings suggests that 6 or 7 factors make more sense . However , there are some cross-loadings between the Opposite-Sex Relations and Physical Appearance items . These can be minimised by using an oblimin rotation . A 7 factor solution makes most sense .

The purpose for developing the Program Satisfaction Assessment Tool ( PSAT ) is to provide us , and our clients , with a definitive way of measuring to what degree our programs meet client goals and objectives . <p> It is difficult to define " Meets client goals and objectives . " Consequently , it is difficult to define a problem or state a hypothesis . However , I can define a problem the Browne Center is struggling with : we do not currently have an assessment tool that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals and objectives . <p> To date the Browne Center has used one program evaluation questionnaire ( appendix A ) for the purposes of receiving feedback about its programs , facilities , food and facilitators . A quick glance of the questionnaire reveals that it attempts to cover varied aspects of the programming in a very brief and unspecific way . Roughly one half of the nine questions are open-ended , requesting narrative type information . The remaining questions use a scale of one through four , with one equating to poor and four equating to excellent . <p> The problem with the questionnaire is that it returns data that is very brief , fairly unrelated , lacks detail , and can not be used in any " decent " quantitative manner . Yes , we are concerned with what the participants think of our food and facility , but we are primarily concerned with whether or not we meet their training and development needs , and ( in simplest of terms ) whether or not we do what we say we will . This assessment tool is our attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where to focus our attention for improvement . It will be used to improve our programming , track our performance , and track client feedback of facilitators . <h> Method <p> The criteria used to develop the instrument were that it be succinct , quantitative , and relevant to the purpose(s) of the clients and the Browne Center . " Relevant to the client " means that it should provide the client an opportunity to reflect on the program and perhaps glean some further value out of it , and also to feel as though their feedback will affect the delivery and effectiveness of future training programs . <p> Seventeen graduate students and one professor ( N=17 ) from a graduate level applied statistics course were given the pilot survey ( Appendix B ) and everyone returned it . Item 9 was not completed on one of the surveys , but all other items were and surveys were complete . The pilot instrument used a five-point scale and asked participants to respond to twelve items by circling the one number that most closely matched their level of agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one through five and was presented as follows : <p> 1=Strongly Agree 2=Agree 3=Neither 4=Disagree 5=Strongly Disagree <p> For example , respondents completed the following opening statement by circling one of the numbers following the statement : " 1 . Overall , todays program met our groups stated goals/objectives. 1 2 3 4 5 . " <p> The pilot surveys weredelivered " on-line " via the UNH Blackboard to the respondents , who printed them out and completed them . The printed , completed , pilot surveys were then collected in person at the beginning of class . <h> Results <p> Seventeen of the eighteen pilot surveys were returned complete . As mentioned previously , one was returned incomplete , missing only the data for item nine . Consequently , for the purposes of reviewing the proposed assessment tool , for the one incomplete pilot survey N=17 , and the N for each remaining item is 18 . <p> Means for each of the items ranged from a low M=1.9412 for item number 8 ( " Facilitators were knowledgeable about the subject area " ) , to a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appropriate for achieving our goals .

For specific information about items you may refer to this table . <p> Analysis of the intercorrelations proved valuable for determining which items were the most appropriate for the final survey . In general the items related to program duration correlated the least with other items on the survey . For example , Pearson Correlations for Item 11 ranged from.339 ( p =.169 ) to 2.56 ( p =.306 ) for all but two cases .

Also note that the alpha with item 10 or 11 deleted would rise significantly to either .8929 or .9166 . With the exception of items 10 and 11 , the corrected item total correlations were strong , ranging from a low of .4718 for item 9 to a high of .8673 for item 12 . Further specific information for each item can be found in Tables 2 and 3 . <h> Discussion <p> At this point the Program Satisfaction Assessment Tool has been administered to one group of eighteen people and the recommendations based below are based on this fact . That being said , overall the pilot survey proved effective at returning the data we are looking for , with items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness in the survey is that items 10 and 11 do n't  relate well with the other items . The final survey ( Appendix C ) will have these two items and items 6 and 7 removed . Doing so increases our Alpha from .8850 to .9192 ( see Table 4 . ) In the pilot survey Items 6 and 7 were also seen as weak because item 6 was worded differently from other items , and it was lengthy and worded somewhat unclearly . Item 7 was removed because of concern over redundancy with items 1 and 12 . <p> Another weakness is the wording of the scale rating for " 3= Neither . " For the final survey we decided to change it to " 3= Unsure " when a respondent did n't  agree or disagree with an item . " Neither " really did n't  fit because there were four options , not two . <p> On the positive side , the pilot survey has a number of strengths we want to keep . First , it is brief . Respondents neednt take a lot of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and return the survey . That being said , a small change made to the final draft was the addition of a section for written comments by the respondents . It was felt that an opportunity to solicit comments outside the realm of the items in the survey would be helpful for both the respondents ( to have their input heard , ) and for the Browne Center ( so we do n't  miss an opportunity for critical feedback . ) <p> Another strength is the quantitative nature of the survey . We can use the data for analyzing our effectiveness and measuring our results , as well as for measuring respondents feedback about facilitators . In this way it is a useful tool for tracking what aspects of our program are strongest and/or weakest and can help us improve where we need to . <p> The Program Satisfaction Assessment Tool will be targeted at the client representative for school and youth groups , and for participants of adult and corporate training programs . It is felt that having school children responding to this survey is inappropriate because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they may not understand the wording of the survey . It will be used both immediately following the program to catch immediate feedback . A follow up will be necessary one month later with minor rewording of items 1 and 8 ( well change the word " todays " from these items to " the Browne Center " . ) <p> The Program Satisfaction Assessment Tool is really a measure of how respondents feel the program met their stated goals and objectives . It does not measure actual changes of behavior in the participants and should not be considered if that is the evaluation goal . I recommend a participant and an observer based measurement tool for that application . <h> Program Satisfaction Assessment Tool <p> This assessment tool is designed to help you , the participant , determine if the program designed and delivered by The Browne Center met your stated goals and/or objectives . <p> For each statement , please circle the ONE number listed that most closely matches your feelings about that statement .

@@41691806 @1691806/ <h> The Life Effectiveness Questionnaire : Development and Psychometrics <h> Abstract <p> This chapter briefly reviews the problematic history of evaluating the outcomes of outdoor-based experiential education programs . One of the key criticisms is the lack of theoretically and psychometrically sound instruments to assess changes in the self-perceptions of participants in such programs . Consequently , this chapter explains the development of a practical , easy-to-use self-report instrument designed to measure changes in key areas of " life effectiveness " . Congeneric and multifactorial confirmatory factor analyses were applied to the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire-version G to develop an eight factor model ( Time Management , Social Competence , Achievement Motivation , Intellectual Flexibility , Task Leadership , Emotional Control , Active Initiative , and Self-Confidence ) . Factorial invariance across gender and age groups was supported . A replication study confirmed the structure of the instrument . Potential applications of the Life Effectiveness Questionnaire for program evaluations are also discussed .

Much thinking is wasted in undisciplined wandering from topic to topic , never getting down to substance . To succeed in a thesis or project you need to develop a clear , achievable , worthwhile , specific research question . <p> Having developed a research question , one should then define the key terms , so that others can tell exactly what a researcher is talking about . <p> The researcher should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is the researcher 's expected answer to the research question . <p> Having developed a question , defined the key terms , and stated one 's research thesis , one can then search systematically for the best possible sources of information about this question .

The search should be systematic , so that the best possible information is identified , and should include dissertation abstracts , journal bibliographies , experts , the world wide web , and recent literature reviews . The best of these resources should then be selected for indepth reading and note-taking in order to prepare for writing the literature review . <p> Refining Research Questions <p> Once you 've drafted a research question to the best of your ability and knowledge , then a good way to refine your draft research question is to put it out to peer review . A second helpful way is to work one-on-one with a potential supervisor . <p> Defining Key Terms <p> Terms should be precisely and concisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reader to know exactly what a research is referring to and intending to investigate . See common problems in Task 2 . <p> Writing a thesis statement <p> It is important to be clear about what you expected to find as an answer to your research question . A succint statement about what you expect to find is called a " thesis statement " . Draft the what you think will be MAIN STATEMENT ( or main conclusion ) of your literature review . It should be longer than a sentence , but no longer than a paragraph . <p> At this stage , all you can provide is a draft , but it is worth roughing out a notion of where you think your literature review is probably heading , e.g. , <p> " Whilst several studies have shown positive effects of caffeine on elite endurance performance , there have been few studies which have specifically examined the effects of soda-based caffeine ( e.g. , Coke , Pepsi ) on the endurance performance in non-elite athletes .

Examples of useful searching guide resources are : <p> You will need to create for yourself a systematic way of keeping track of references to literature that could be useful for writing a literature review on your topic . Some academics and students use electronic bibliographic software , such as EndNote ( you can trial for 30 days ) . You could also try out the Knoesis Index Card Lite for 60 days . Others prefer more manual , handwritten systems . While most of us get probably by creating our own simple word processing document containing an organized list of possible references with appropriate annotations . Whatever system is chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , otherwise the quality of literature usually suffers significantly . <p> As electronic and hard copies of literature are obtained , the researcher should organize appropriate shelving and filing , and store and label articles systematically , so that they can be easily accessed . A balance needs to be struck between being disorganized and overly organized . <p> As the reading list is created , the types and importance of the article should be categorized in some way , so that a reading list can be generated . Developing a focused reading list of 20 sources is generally better than an unfocused list of 100 sources . However , it is likely that a researcher has identified and recorded something like 100 possible sources in order to come up with the final reading list of 20 . These other references may be included as an appendix and ordered , but the vast majority of the major content of a good literature review will likely emerge from less than 20 major sources . <p> This is due as a written report via email attachment by midnight next Wednesday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " KIN901 : Reading List " and name your attachment " KIN901 Reading List.doc " . <p> Please submit an open-format report on the following : <p> 1 .

Several studies have also shown that there are increased metabolic demands during exercise in the heat , however CHO has not shown to be the limiting factor . Many studies have demonstrated that thermoregulatory effects ( an increase in core body temperature ) will be the limiting factor in exercise performance in the heat . However very few studies have looked at the correlation between pre-exercise hydration state and glycogen utilization combined as the limiting factor in performance . Therefore , it is predicted that a well-hydrated endurance athlete will be limited in exercise in the heat by their pre-exercise glycogen content . <h> 4 .

It is a large review that hopefully will give me a better idea as to what is available already and where future research may lie . This article is also available currently at the Dimond Library at UNH . <p> This is another article that will be very helpful since heat acclimation is very important to performance and it would be interesting to apply this information about substrate utilization to endurance performance .

The contribution of demographic , situational and psychological factors to dishonest academic behaviours <h> Abstract <p> The present study investigated the dishonest academic behaviours of Australian university students ( N = 954 ) and their relationships with demographic factors , academic policy information provided to students , academic self-efficacy , and academic orientation . It was hypothesised that higher levels of dishonesty would be associated with low learning-orientation , high grade-orientation , low academic self-efficacy and non-receipt of information about the rules of cheating and plagiarism . Descriptive analyses revealed high levels of self-reported academic dishonesty for cheating , falsification and plagiarism . Regression analyses revealed demographic variables , academic orientation and academic self-efficacy to have differential predictive value for the three types of dishonesty , underlining the argument that it is misleading to measure academic dishonesty as a unidimensional construct . The results are discussed in terms of implications for strategic interventions and academic policy formulation . <h> Download Options <p> Full paper ( requires access to Taylor &amp; Francis ) - or email one of the authors for a copy .

@@41691813 @1691813/ <p> The first dedicated adventure therapy literature emerged in an identifiable way during the late 1950 's and early 1960s , around the time of the beginning of Outward Bound courses in the USA ( 1961 , Colorado Outward Bound School ( Miner , 1980 ) . <p> However , the real beginning of rigorous research within the field of adventure therapy and outdoor education is marked by the classic Kelly and Baer 's studies ( 1960 's and 1970 's ) of the long-term effects of long Outward Bound programs on the delinquency rates of at risk adolescent males , including a ten-year followup study . <p> Philosophically , a therapeutic role for nature , wilderness and adventure can be traced to the beginning of human evolution , tribal life , the first modern civilizations , and various pre-20th century works , such as Rousseau 's Emile . <p> More recently , between the 1960 's and the 1990s , adventure therapy practice in North America drew heavily on the experiential education philosophy of Dewey theory ( Dewey , 1938/1997 ) , which argued that education was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the society 's future . <p> More recently , Frumkin ( 2001 ) has written an interesting account of the various sources of research evidence about the positive , healing effects of nature on human health , which includes adventure therapy programs , as well the effects of animals on human health , and the effects of natural scenes ( e.g. , photographs ) in hospitals and workplaces . <p> Not all adventure therapy programs take place in nature ; many occur in relatively artificial environments , such as on ropes challenge courses and climbing gyms . These programs focus more on the potential experiential power of adventurous activities , the expertise of a facilitative guide , the cumulative sequencing of experiences , and the infusion of traditional therapeutic methods , which might include patient assessment , counseling , and so on . <p> Gillis ( 2002 ) has facilitated the creation of a useful , on-line historical timetable of important events in the development of adventure therapy . This suggests that following from some early experimental camping programs in the early 1900s , intentional programming of adventure-type processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentally dysfunctional first began in the 1960s . Perhaps missing from this history is the role of the sanatorium , which utilized an isolated , natural environment , hospital setting for people with tuberculosis ; sanatoriums were also used for people with untreatable mental health disorders . They were popular in the 1800 's in Europe . <p> Thus we seem to have a picture of the field of adventure therapy evolving in the 1960s , although there were earlier experiments . The origins seems traceable as far back to the beginning of human evolution , when nature experiences were used to heal . Today , adventure therapy program formats vary incredibly , such as equine therapy , sweat lodge ceremonies , indoor group initiative tasks , long wilderness expeditions , and so on . <p> Although there has been substantial implementation of adventure therapy programs over the last 40 years , there has been a notable lack of well conducted research and evaluation .

I grew up in a " hunter-gatherer " family of Euro-Celtic origins in south-western Australia . My father worked in the coalmines of Collie to supply our main material support , but at various times of the year we harvested the fruits of the earth for our sustenance and pleasure . <p> In summer there were marron , perch and cobbler from the river below the house . We caught crabs , prawns , tailor , whiting and mussels from the estuary ; kingfish where estuary and river join when the ' yakka ' sticks bloom , and a had 2 week sojourn and camp on the west coast to catch herring after the spawning season in May . On land , we hunted kangaroo for the farm dogs and ourselves ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multitude of burrows in the bush near our farm . We chewed banksia tips , ate the bottoms of grasstree fronds , collected mushrooms in paddocks , and picked the succulent " snotty gobble " fruits in season . In winter we harvested firewood and wildflowers for additional financial sustenance . And , we were much like most families we knew in the bush . <p> So what is the basis of the urge to partake in the resources of the land ? Is it just opportunistic fun or does it have a deeper base ? In operating programs designed to reawaken the deep connection I believe exists between humanity and Nature , we are essentially calling forward something innate in every person at a deeper level . <p> History <p> I grew up with the Jarrah forest of south-western Australia as a playground and learnt many stories and ' secrets ' of the bush from a young age , fuelled by parents with a lot of knowledge and affection for the bush . It became my work-ground during winters as I helped my parents collect wildflowers and firewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most peaceful place for all of us , and the firewood and flowers were merely an excuse to go there . It was the only place I remember hearing my mother spontaneously burst into song , just through sheer happiness . Most of our best family times were in sharing Nature in all its varieties . <p> As a family we experienced unseen ' presences ' in Nature ; and this began very early in life for me and continues to this day . <p> I then went to work for the Western Australian Forest Department which seemed a perfect profession for someone so attached to the bush . The connection experience deepened with an increase in knowledge of natural resource management . With this acquisition came the continuing experiences of other ' presences ' in the bush . The absolute surety that , even though no person existed ' in the flesh ' , nevertheless I was being watched , observed . We would even joke about this as a family over a glass of port at the end of a rainy day in the bush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other reference for them . It was n't until much later in life that I started to see and appreciate what was happening in a different light . <p> There were also the peaceful areas ; different places would attract us with their look and feel . Blackbutt gullies to this day , give me a great sense of peace and fertility . Wandoo forests always held a sense of mystery , and granite outcrops have always been attracting places that drew us and other people to them . There is a lot of energy interchange in these occasions . We even had mysterious sounding names for some of these spots ; Gibraltar Rock , Dingo Soak , Night Soak , Jura Formation and many more were etched into our minds through years of association . Some of my Noongar mates have since spoken about the Aboriginal significance of some of the spots we were attracted to as a family and individuals . <p> My Government career in the bush continued for 20 years , the latter ten with the Department of Conservation and Land Management(CALM) as several Departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the mid ' 80s I asked the big question , " What does it mean to be Australian and be Spiritual ? " . I had spent 8 years heavily involved in the church and this had n't answered the question . <p> So began the look at my own ancestry in Euro-Celtic origins . Here I found people who were/are deeply connected to Nature . They saw intelligence in all things ; plants , animals , rocks and water etc . Deeply ceremonial , they celebrated their connection with song and dance , stories and rituals many times in the yearly cycles . Their shrines are in Nature ; rock pools , tree groves and waterfalls . Their clans had distinct rights and connection to specific areas of land and their plant and animal totems guided them in living out their connection . Magic is a part of everyday existence and their ' little people ' , the carriers of magic and sacred law were and are well known to them . <p> My ancestors spirituality was deeply rooted in the land and Nature , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had been experiencing all my life in the bush . I had a knowing that this was my own spirituality ; that my journey in life had brought me to an awareness of the interconnectedness of everything in the visible and invisible worlds . Nature simply provided the window through which to see the connection . <p> A year later I took up tertiary studies in Human Services , minoring in Aboriginal Studies . This changed around two and a half years later when a Mandjildjara Aboriginal Lawman from the Western Desert took me into his family . To Nanyu I am marlangu ( little brother ) and he is kurda to me , my older brother . By desert law his family relations are also mine . When I go to the desert , I have a place to call home , a community and a family where I belong . This is a marvellous system of inclusion by Aboriginal people . As it turns out , I do n't see Nanyu very often but we both know we are " in each others hearts " . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I finished my degree majoring in Aboriginal and Inter-cultural Studies . <p> What surprised me was that in studying Aboriginal spirituality I found the same basis as my own ancestors . Land centred ; song , oral , dance and art expression ; totemic , magic and powerfully psychic/intuitive intelligence in all things . Later as I sat and learned with Cherokee native American people ; spoke with Shona in Zimbabwe ; and Lua , Kikuyu , Masai and Meru in Kenya , I found the same base for their spirituality . All of them spoke of their land as a living intelligent being that was enhanced and enlivened by ceremony and ritual . The common response to me speaking about Aboriginal culture was " Same for my people " . <p> I now knew that Aboriginal people in remote areas still celebrated their connection with the land , and that this practice was also shared by many indigenous groups around the world including people of my own ancestry . However , what of Aboriginal people living in heavily settled and farmed rural areas ? How did all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years with CALM as a Project Officer in Aboriginal Programs . My primary task was to find out what Noongar Aboriginal people in the south-west of Western Australia are currently doing with Crown land . What sort of activities are undertaken ? Shooting the occasional kangaroo or wallaby was known about , but very little else . The south-west is like most heavily settled areas of Australia in relation to Aboriginal people . Most of their traditional lands have been cleared , farmed , towned or put into various Government reserves for other purposes . For example , by 1903 there were 56,000 hectares cleared for farming . By 1914 there were 567,000 hectares cleared . With this went hunting and gathering areas , camp sites , sacred places , totems and Dreaming trails . The loss was devastating on Noongar people , made more so by the laws of 1905 and 1936 which produced the ' stolen generation ' and decimated family life , kinship structures and land affiliations . <p> As I spoke and listened to people in meetings , they would berate me for an hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots and gave very little in the end . After that they would begin speaking of places they go hunting , camping , gathering plants for food and medicine , and still taking their koolanga 's ( children ) to the bush to teach them . Cooking kangaroo and damper on the open fire and telling stories around the fire until well after the kids go to sleep in their arms . When I asked why they did this , they looked at me as if I was strange , shrugged their shoulders and said " It 's Noongar Way " . After this happened many times I finally figured out this was about identity . In essence they were saying , <p> " If we do n't do these things then we are just black white-fellas . This is what we do because of who we are . We want white-fellas to know about these things we do in the bush because it 's the only way they 'll have any respect for us " . <p> Therefore , Noongar people , for all their losses and what went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . <p> Common Ground <p> It became clear to me that we have many indigenous cultures with different expressions depending on geography , but one Truth of relationship and connection to land and Nature .

The deeper I delved into this hypothesis the stronger and clearer it became ; until it seems that the Earth carries the Truth of who we are and our connection to her and each other . I use ' her ' because this is the gender most often ascribed to the planet . This Truth expresses itself in each place through song , symbol , dance , story , rocks , water , plants , birds , animals and landform relevant to that place and it 's people . <p> Many indigenous cultures say that we do not die , but live many times and often are reborn into the same land and cultural group .

Firstly , it is only 10,000 years since farming began ; before that , we were all hunter-gatherers , physically and spiritually in touch and in rhythm with Nature and her cycles . Science has just confirmed something that many indigenous people have known for eons and that is : we carry the memories of our ancestors in our bones and blood . The strong beliefs , actions , emotions , ceremonies etc. are written within our genetic structure in blood and bone . We now call it cellular or genetic memory .

When you are born , the Spirits of that place surround you and welcome you in . If you are not born here but come with an attitude of respect and care then you are welcome . As soon as you eat the food of a place , drink the water and breathe the air and ' be there ' , you start to become part of that place .

" I am receiving an increasing number of requests from Outdoor Education Coordinators to present programs with this content to their students . For example , all Year 3 to Year 9 students from Scotch College , a private boys school in Perth , spend time in the bush with me going through these concepts of indigenous use of the land , relationship and responsibility . Combining both Science and The Sacred " , we are developing a journey in environmental , cultural and self-awareness for the students ; encouraging them to see their place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also building similar programs with several other Private Schools in Perth ; and some State schools ( such as Palmyra Primary . School near Fremantle ) are also on this journey , . <p> All activities and programs show the relationship between humanity and Nature . At one level , there is basic material Aboriginal culture in bushfoods , medicine , tool making and basic land and resource use . This is presented with a spiritual dimension emphasising the multi-dimensional character of the relationship . Community roles , sharing resources , land-human connections , personal and group responsibilities and ancestral cultural connections are all explored in context of relationship throughout the activity programs . At the ' deeper ' end of the continuum , I take participants through activities that honour and exercise all six senses . Each activity program is unique as each group calls forward choices of over 50 activities , depending on their need . <p> Initiation or ' Rites of Passage ' is another concept we have been working with for many years . Our cultures , like any indigenous culture , had constructive rites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have been lost and replaced with nebulous rituals that do not speak of self and community responsibility , or are of high-risk -taking nature to prove one 's worth to a peer group . <p> We have been involved in several development areas in rites of passage . A group of us designed Kidz Earth - a 6 week totally interactive program for 12 year olds emphasising the participants relationship with Nature , at the physical/mundane and non-physical/spiritual levels . Initiation camps for year 10 students going into year 11 at Helena College near Perth have been designed and run by staff for several years . I participated as an elder this year to bring a deeper spiritual and ceremonial focus to an already brilliant program . <p> I co-presented a workshop at an inter-generational conference called " Growing Into Wisdom " . This conference is focussed on growing older with strength , dignity and purpose ; and bringing together multiple generations to deal with these and other related concepts . " Elders " is the main group responsible for organising this and have done a workshop with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which looked at indigenous eldership and the difference between elders and old people . Various parts of the Men 's Movement are also showing interest in re-introducing some form of initiation to help boys become men in a society where they have little sense of how to be responsible adults in a complex and changing world . The Men 's Health and Wellbeing Association in Perth has also addressed the subject in several ways . <p> More recently ; in 2002 , sixteen Year 6 &amp; 7 students from Embleton Primary School with a population of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal students went through a day and evening of learning and ceremony to look closely at mens &amp; womens business and what it means to grow into adulthood .. They created a ceremony of their own . A group of Aboriginal kids from a metropolitan high school spent 3 days rediscovering some of their own cultural gems , and their own place in the land .

In 2003 another 111 from a another school did the same ; and we are developing a rite of passge weekend for their Year 11 students this year . <p> Facilitators Role and Preparation <p> The Outdoor Educator can act as a guide for the ' initiation ' of participants into a greater understanding of themselves , their relationship and connection to Nature , land and other people . This is a powerful and often pivotal role in participant 's life , and deeply rewarding for the facilitator . This can occur through " soft option " activities which de-stress the participants as much as possible and allow peoples own inner-knowing , connection and Truth to come to the fore . The facilitator 's role is to guide participants through their process , not to prescribe what their outcome should be . The facilitator 's own view of their connection to the earth , nature , land and other people may be strongly challenged in preparing for this process . There may be a need to provide professional development in these areas for facilitators . <p> Conclusion <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in the land or natural environment . If the life experiences of our ancestral cultures , many current indigenous groups and some ' western ' peoples are a reasonable guide to this relationship ; then we share connection that has both physical and spiritual roots . This is our common ground , which we share with all humanity and Nature . <p> Outdoor educators can play a significant role in facilitating the awakening of this connection by the way they conduct programs and the activity content used . This quickly becomes a reciprocating process as the facilitator will discover and recognise more of their own connection while taking participants through such programs . <p> Appendix I <p> Shared Dreaming-Common Ground <p> And so who holds that Dreaming .... that Song ? Who feels in their very being the bigness , the connection ? Is your heart the only one that beats to the sound of an ancient drum ? Are you the only one with Ancestors ? <p> The campfires of the Ancient ones are in the Milky Way ... maybe that is the union of our ancestry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then can we do the same here ? Your blood carries the stories of your Ancestors , your Dreaming and the many paths of your soul on its journey ...... so does mine . <p> The Earth , she is my Mother as she is yours . Her love for both of us is full and unconditional . You have a need to express that connection . So do I .... feel it as the incessant pulse of the Mother herself . <p> Again , there is union . <p> I do what I do because it is my choice and Dreaming . I came to do this ... to remember who I am , to express the memory fully , and to share this with who so ever chooses . It is my purpose in this ' lifetime ' , this brief experience of my total being . <p> I am remembering ...... old feelings , senses , wisps of information , barrages of experiences ; all serve to remind me who I am . I am not alone in this . We share the outcome , the expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , but it does not alter the truth of such . <p> If that is the case then let us share the outcome of Dreamings wonderfully lived . Let us share our common heritage and source ; and then we Know that we are One . There is no separation , only an illusion that we have believed .

@@41691830 @1691830/ <h> Locus of Control - Related Constructs <h> Attribution <p> Attribution refers to how people explain events that happen to themselves and others . Different kinds of attributional styles have been found to characterise and explain why people react quite differently , but predictably to events and how they explain the causes of those events ( actor-observer bias ) . The fundamental attribution error is that people tend to adopt more internal explanations for others behaviour and more external explanations for their own behaviour . However , this depends on whether one is explaining successful or failed behaviour . In other words , people tend exhibit a self-serving bias when it comes to explaining behavior , as follows : <p> Internal attributions about themselves when they succeed ( i.e. , I did it myself ) <p> Internal attributions about others when they fail ( i.e. , it was their fault ) <p> External attributions about themselves when they fail ( i.e. , Something else made me fail ) <p> External attributions about others when they succeed ( i.e. , they got lucky ) <h> Learned Helplessness <p> External locus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helplessness ( 1970s ) which found that animals and people will learn to simply give up trying when they experience having no control over what happens to them .

@@41691831 @1691831/ <h> Adventure Education and Resilience - The Double-Edged Sword <h> Abstract <p> Adventure education philosophers have argued that controlled exposure to challenge can enhance participants ' psychological resilience . This study supports this claim , demonstrating significantly greater gains in psychological resilience for 41 young adults participating in 22-day Outward Bound programs than in a control group . All Outward Bound participants reported positive changes in their resilience and their overall change effect size was large . Perceived levels of social support predicted 24% of the variance in resilience gain scores , with participants ' ratings of the least supportive group member being the best predictor . The findings for enhanced resilience and the important role of social support warrant wider investigation . In promoting psychological resilience adventure educators are alerted to the importance of facilitating positive interpersonal relations and minimising the detrimental impact of the diverse needs of group members .

Whether you call it karma , thermodynamics , homeostasis , sustainability , or just plain common sense , does n't really matter . What matters is that our own human nature is intimately interconnected with the nature of our local and global environment . For about 4 million years , humans evolve with a very close relationship between inner consciousness and the rhythm , riches and dangers of nature . As the human-nature connection has transformed and traditional knowledge about the connections lost , modern human society has spiraled out of control . <p> I have had persistent visions over the years of the streets of civilization being eventually overgrown with plants hundreds of years from now .

And , above all , if we as humans want to survive as a species , we need to nurture our relationship with plants ( upon which we are totally dependent for survival , whether nutritionally , economically , or psychologically ) . <h> On the Suppression of Psychoactive Plants <p> Human beings have a long history of being awful to one another , to animals , and to plants . Whether its slavery , wars , hunting , farming , clearing forests , or banning the growth and use of plants such as Poppy , Cannabis Sativa and Salvia Divinorum ( the three illegal plants in Australia ) . This is akin to jailing and massacring indigenous people . To " lock away " certain plants from access to society is to cut off our nose to spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship with such plants , and continue to do so illegally . People who wish to explore their relationship with plants are marginalized and by law punishable variously through death , jail or fine . Yet the viewpoint that such plants are evil and damaging is largely propaganda . <p> Instead , we need to create places on earth where people , animals , and plants can exist in freedom , unity , and harmony . All plants in indigenous life had uses and applications , whether for their strength , nutrition , medicinal or psychoactive properties . Plants were used wisely and effectively . The problem is that we 've largely lost the positive cultures into which the use of such plants were embedded . Our culture , if we are to survive , needs to rediscover a more holistic relationship nature , starting with plants , and one in we understand plants not only for their physical properties ( e.g. , aesthetics of flowers , wood for building ) , medicinally ( e.g. , for healing ) , but also psychologically ( e.g. , for exploring consciousness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humans have positive relationships for exploration of mutual power and potential . <h> Personal , Indigenous Farming of Psychoactive Plants <p> We need to develop an intimate relationship with plants throughout their life cycle , whatever one 's form of plant usage - vegetables , fruit , trees for wood , and plants for medical and psychological uses . Ultimately , we all consume and use many plants , although these days we grow very few ourselves . The disconnection from growing for one 's consumption , whether plant or animal , is a dangerous trait of industrial societies . It opens up an experiential gap which allows for poor decisions to made about the management of the natural environment . <p> Ironically , due to the illegal nature of psychoactive plants , personal farming of psychoactive is now becoming more common , because of the market scarcity and unpredictability .

We must be careful not to simply consume a plant without respect and understanding about how it grows , where it comes from , and the nature of its uses and effects . <p> Each plant species has properties in common with its genetic lineage that can be explored , mapped and understood .

@@41691844 @1691844/ <h> Abstract <p> This presentation explores philosophical tension about the role of technology in outdoor education . On one hand , modern outdoor educators is characterised by stripping participants of modern technology in order to encourage and facilitate " low technology " outdoor experiences . On the other hand , " high technologies " ( such as digital photography , video , audio , gps and digital mapping , web 2.0 ( blogs , wikis , etc. ) , pedometers , mood monitors , virtual environments , etc. ) offer new experiential tools and learning opportunities . This presentation encourages further development of both low and high technology experiences in outdoor education . <h> Information <h> About <p> These are some 2009 notes in development for future possible articles and presentations exploring the possible role and contribution of technology in outdoor education . <h> Preamble <p> I would like to share a few ideas with you about possible experiential and educative roles for technologies in the theory and practices of outdoor education . <p> Personally , I have a particular affinity for both low technology experiences - whether its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running , or long trails - but I also have a interest in experimenting with " high technology " and the outdoors , including sharing info and resources via the internet , digital photography , online mapping , and online social networks . I have also found myself trying wondering about the extremes of primitive living and high-tech living - and considering ways in which they might come together . <p> So , what I 'd like to share and explore with you today are some ideas around low and high technology and its connections and disconnections with outdoor education , and paths that this might offer into the future . <h> What would take with you - and why ? <p> Perhaps we might start with a little self-exploration . Imagine that you have a day off , with no commitments or obligations , and that are free to do whatever you like . And you decide to indulge in a day-trip , somewhere not too far away , but in a " place apart " , somewhere outdoors . Where would go ? And let 's just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What 10 things would you take - and why ? Jot down your list of items - do n't think about too much , its not a test . And then share your destination and list of what you 'd take and the reasons why with someone nearby . Remember , this is n't a survival exercise - its about designing for yourself a pleasurable , rewarding day somewhere in the great outdoors . <h> What is technology ? <p> What I 'd like to do next is to consider your day-trip kits in terms of the types of technology you 've decided to take along . And in doing so , I 'd also to explore a distinction I 've been making between " low " and " high " technology . First though , let 's consider what we mean by the notion of " technology " . <p> Technology refers to an animal species ' use of tools and crafts to alter their environments . From this perspective , a bird 's nest and a beaver 's dam are just as much technologies as is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology of another dimension because it requires more than a single human 's raw effort with nature ; it involves the use of machines ( technology ) to create technology , it requires social cooperation to capitalise on specific areas of expertise , and a skyscraper relies upon the transition of cultural heritage and knowledge over many generations in order to be built - it can not be built from scratch . With this example , of the skyscraper , then we have an example of " high " technology , whereas a " lean-to " can be considered " low " technology . <p> So , let 's consider what you decided to take on your day-trip , and see if we can allocate these examples to this distinction between " low " and " high " technology ... <p> ( ask for examples and add them until the point is clearly made e.g. even food might be considered " old food " and " new food " - would your great-grandmother recognise what you are taking as ' food ' ? ) <p> It probably turns out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us than we realise e.g. , who ventures out in their moccasins made from an animal they hunted and killed ? In fact , we may even struggle to find a single " low " technology item in many of our preferred kits . Would this have been true even one generation ago ? Two generations ago ? Three generations ago ? Here 's a rough hypothesis - go back about 10 generations ( that 's about 200-300 years ) and most of the items would have been " low " technology - so on average , we 've been trading one low tech item for a high tech per generation in recent times . However , the acceleration towards high tech has become more profound in recent generations . <h> The philosophical tension <p> At this point , I 've been careful not to pass judgment about " low " or " high " technology . Use of high technology is , in many ways , the great defining characteristic of homo sapiens and its what distinguishes us as unique in comparison to other known species . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primates , such as chimpanzees , we differ radically in our culture . And it is our social culture which passes on the knowledge of previous generations and allows us to build on the shoulders of others , to live three times as long , and to spend our time experimenting with increasingly sophisticated technologies and ideas . <p> But we are also conscious deep down that there is something not quite right about our rapid cultural evolution into a high-tech , urban societies where we increasingly live in artificial environments , eat artificial food , and where virtual , technology-mediated experiences are becoming the norm , and so-called " real " life visceral experiences are increasingly rare . <h> Types of technology : Low vs. high <p> There are innumerable ways of typologising technology , but a basic distinction which comes in handy , particularly with regard to outdoor education , is between " low " and " high " technology , where low technology refers to direct uses of natural substances ( e.g. , a stick to prod a puddle ) and high technology which refers to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immediate way by an individual from natural sources ( e.g. , a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) ) <p> Although we can make a discrete distinction between " low " and " high " , it is probably more richly understood as a continuum or a spectrum . For example , direction-finding using the sun and stars might be " low " tech , using a compass might be " medium " tech , and using a GPS might be " high " tech . <p> On one hand , outdoor education often involves living in relatively remote locations using relatively low technology ; but on the other hand , there is a strong trend in outdoor education and particular in adventure recreation , towards using high tech tools , equipment , and communication systems . Thus , the relationship between outdoor education and technology is varied and , at times , not entirely comfortable one . There is a fairly common view , for example , that mobile phones are unwelcome on outdoor education programs ( in order to shut participants off from outside communication and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but high-tech outdoor gear is usually quite accepted ( e.g. , head torches , sleeping bags , back-packs because they are seen as aiding comfort and convenience ) . Each of the accepted and non-accepted items for an outdoor education experience can and probably should ignite significant philosophical tension and debate . e.g. , should watches be allowed ? Why or why not ? And , on what basis are such decisions made ? One framework for considering such questions is Dewey 's theory of experience . Another framework to consider is the Adventure Education Program ( Mortlock ; Priest etc . ) . Without at least considering our technology orientation and choices within the context of such theories or frameworks , the priveleging of some technologies over others in the design and conduct of outdoor education seems to be based on local , personal , and organisational idiosynchracy and convenience , rather than to have reasoned pedagogical rationale . <p> Interestingly , in long , ambitious expeditions , such as Tim Severin 's " The Brendan Voyage " , it often turns out that low tech solutions survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this can be observed . On a recent family camping trip , we found once our digital camera failed ( and with no prospect of unaided repair ) , we simply returned to writing and drawing which was relatively fail-safe and reliable . Thus , whilst high tech seems to offer greater power and potential , its engineering turns out to often be far from perfect and the lack of amateurship renders the equipment useless , whereas one always has a chance to at least hand-fashion or jury-rig a low-tech solution to an encountered challenge . It is arguably the skill of surviving and thriving with low-tech equipment which is a key value of genuine outdoor education experiences . And where we are unable to fashion a solution , our final innnovation can be sheer determination and perservance to succeed anyway - or find an alternative path . There 's no point in crying over spilt milk - or an unbootable high tech device . <h> Some examples of the coming together of technology and outdoor education <h> Centrally- vs. self-organised outdoor education <p> One of the " highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organisation " . Outdoor education , in countries such as UK , USA , Australia , New Zealand , and many European countries has become " professionalised " , with peak body qualifications often required by government regulation . In addition , the spectre of litigation has spiralled insurance costs and dampened organisational adventuresomeness . As a result , centrally organised outdoor education activities risk being both unduly expensive and yet surprisingly " dumbed-down " . Yet , ironically , the person in the street is far more empowered to get out and tackle adventures on their own or in small , self-organised groups . Area-information is much more readily available via guidebooks and the internet , good quality gear is readily available , and various forms of transport and accommodation are available , largely thanks to the tourism industry , allowing people to readily seek destinations of their choice . Outdoor participation numbers remain relatively low , thus the great outdoors is arguably more available than ever . <p> Where some amount of central organisation is desirable , but avoiding the relative inflexibility and costly overheads of formally organised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptation of such ) may be considered . This is basically the posting of a public notice somewhere ( e.g. , in a shop , hostel , or on the internet ) of an intent to venture to location X and requesting others to join . When enough people of the desired mix are found , the trip unfolds . Generally , there is no designated leader as the group shares the responsibility . <p> On the one hand , formal outdoor education organisations can be seen as delivering the vast majority of outdoor education experiences , e.g. , especially to schools ( if the schools do n't have their own formal program ) . On the other hand , if we count any time spent outdoors ( such as walking or riding to and from school ) as at least forming the everyday basis of what ultimately constitutes outdoor education , then the formal providers are rather minor in their scope and impact - if somewhat exotic in their limited offerings . If we were take the $500 ( say ) from a 5-day outdoor education trip , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with tent , sleeping bag , and backpack , or send them on a bus-trip around the country with accommodation and low cost accommodation . The point I 'm trying to make here is that we should n't necessarily assume that a formal outdoor education program is necessarily the best " bang for one 's buck " as a developmental investment in outdoor and adventure-based educational experiences . Some healthy skepticism can also challenge the formal programs to self-examine their effectiveness and innovation . <h> Distributed , asynchronous learning <p> One way in which outdoor education might be fostered with the aid of the internet is for global participation in specific activities by individuals distributed around the world . Project Nature Connect , for example , uses this model . When enough people sign up for a course , it starts . Participants are given readings and information , then asked to undertake specific activites in their local area , then return and discuss with fellow participants around the world . A series of such occurrences forms the basic course model . The model has several advantages , e.g. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time flexible , diverse range of participants etc. that mark it as distinct from traditional outdoor education programs . It could be made even more open and completely free if such courses and their activities were collaboratively developed via open learning platforms , such as Wikiversity . <h> Guerilla gardening <p> Guerilla gardening involves covert cultivation of unused land for community and ecological good . It is seen as a form of non-violent , political action , to co-operate with and nurture the presence of nature in available spaces . There are a myriad of forms of guerilla gardening . Two basic types are the re-introduction of native species and the cultivation of edible plants . From an outdoor education perspective , this is a form of environmental education that can take place at home and in one 's surrounds . It can be done covertly or with local permission . It is related to and can also involve removal of litter and environmental restoration and conversation . It can help connect local community members and build a sense of community ownership and pride in the local environment . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local , low-tech <p> In the current age/phase of global economic downturn and increasing awareness of the ecological impacts and cost of non-renewable energy travel in order to pursue exotic , far-flung adventures , many have turned to electronic gaming for their sense of adventure . Yet , it is amazing how much adventure can be had starting with a single step outside one 's door , particular with a low-tech approach . For example , camping in one 's own backyard offers an exciting , low-risk , low-cost activity for kids , families , and adults . Many families already have a BBQ set up for outdoor cooking and a pergola for outdoor eating . Some have hammocks for resting . Some have flat roofs which can be slept and which provide a great way to view the night sky , even in relatively urban areas . Even in relatively built-up areas , a walk to a local park is not too far away , and a walk or cycle to a larger park offers good exercise . The routes that can be taken can avoid main roads as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various private gardens that others have nurtured . Although we may not be able to grow as much of our food as might be ideal , we can seek to source food as much as possible from local origins , e.g. , plan a trip to visit farm - buy from the local markets - and barter with neighbours who have a few fruit trees . One can buy or sew lettuce seeds and bring them up in pots in the window-sill etc . Even if nature is hard to find and bring into one 's life , we can remember that we are ourselves are nature ( although its easy to forget ) and we can manifest nature with small acts of cooperation each day . A little bit of water . A little bit of dirt . A seed . And some care and patience . <h> Low or no technologies <p> We can have some fascinating outdoor adventures by replacing some of our " high " technologies with low or no technologies . Take for example footwear . By removing our high-tech footwear and then taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How tough are one 's feet ? We become much more sensitive to the terrain , we slow down , we pay attention to the ground upon which we are walking . We take more care . We become more thankful and appreciative of softer places and intimately aware of the challenge of harder , harsher places . We become intimately aware of temperature and moisture . If we go barefoot over time , our feet become more accustomed , but our senses remain heightened . I 've found barefoot , cross-country walking and running , even over relatively short distances , to be far more interesting than much longer distances covered faster with the aid of high-tech footwear . What else could switch for similar effects ? e.g. , leave the tent behind and sleep in the open ? Take a candle instead of a torch ? Go naked instead of wearing clothes ? etc . <h> Mobile electronics <p> Of the vast array of mobile electronic gadgetry , what possible value and application might they have in outdoor education ? What if we consider , on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and examining what happens ? Here are some ideas/examples : <p> Audioplayer - An audioplayer could be used as an information source , e.g. , with pre-recorded information about the history , geography , weather etc. of a local area . As an instructor I often felt somewhat inadequate with my level of knowledge about local flora and fauna , the night sky etc . Audioplayers are now cheaper than most bits of outdoor gear that are traditionally taken - and lighter than ever . Students could be issues with a rich audio ( and possibly video ) library of information about the local area and also about how to use equipment , engage in various activities etc . Traditionally , outdoor education has relied on one-off " instructor briefings " to convey " expert " knowledge , but this is no longer necessary . <p> Voice recording - Outdoor education has traditionally emphasised hand-written journals or diaries as a form of private self-reflection during outdoor education programs . But writing does n't appeal to all participants and perhaps a wider range of options for recording self-reflections could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now part of many audio players ) and video cameras . <h> Mobile phone networks <p> In many ways now when an average person contemplates adventuring through a 21st century landscape , one of the basic questions to be asked is whether or not to take a mobile phone and where the points of coverage are likely to be . When adventuring within mobile range ( and when carrying a working mobile phone ) , an individual might be considered to be " on belay " . In other words they might feel relatively free to experiment and test themselves , knowing that the consequences of many possible misadventures are minimised due to their connectibility to the mobile phone network . Venturing beyond the mobile-covered areas or choosing not to take mobile technology involves greater self-responsibility and independence , or the use of alternative technologies such as radios , satellite phones etc. if one wishes to have more reliable electronic communication . <h> Parkour <p> Parkour or " free running " refers to fluid movement through a given space ( such as an urbanscape ) . The typical norms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with walls , for example , instead treated as places to be jumped over or from using gynmastics-type manoevres . It is not unlike cross-country running , but there is a dance-like quality to creative exploration and interaction with the physical environment . Sequences of movements may be taught , practiced , and perfected , with the basic skills of jumping , landing , and rolling being particular useful in many other contexts , and excellent fitness training , adventurous in nature , creative in spirit , requiring little equipment and , if done gradually and simply , requiring little expertise - anyone can do it anytime . Thus , parkour itself is low-tech , but interestingly it is often pursued in urban landscapes as a creative response to the dominant physical and cultural trends of urbanity . It can be thought of as pure and simple adventuresomeness pursued no matter , or almost in spite of , the harshness of urban environments . Much as one might marvel as a weed growing through a crack in the pavement , we can celebrate the human being who vaults a wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an integral part of outdoor education . And is commonly understand that a critical part of experiential learning is the processing of experience , via reflection , in order to better understand the experiences and extract useful lessons . There are innumerable ways in which individuals and groups may engage in processing and reflecting upon experiences , and similarly there are many ways in which low and high technologies might be used to aid this . For example , taking photographs can help to provide visual markers ( benchmarks or watersheds ) and aids to remember and consider particular experiences which may otherwise largely fade from memory . The details in photographs help to remind of subtle nuances which occurred during an experience . Low tech equivalents include drawing and keeping a written diary . <h> Sharing <p> It has often struck me as a great irony that within the context of outdoor eduction group culture , sharing is promoted , encouraged , and rewarded , but that many outdoor education organisations are notably protective of their area notes , activities , procedures , practices etc . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but such barriers are considerably lower , even arguably non-existent . What remains as the only significant barrier is the will to share , or the morality of openness . There is a false and old perception perhaps of organisational competition . Really , the only competition is the higher competition of moral good vs. moral deterioration . <p> By way of a single example , http : /www.wilderdom.com wilderdom.com was created in 2002 to openly share information about outdoor education . It attracts approximately 20,000 visitors per day for an average of 5 minutes each , equating to the equivalent of approximately 110 people 24/7 ( full-time ) participating in the site , year after year . This represents a larger collective human engagement than the vast majority of outdoor education schools or organisations . And it has simply arisen from one person sharing a bit of information with others . Imagine if a culture of genuine , open , global sharing was adopted more widely ? <h> Solo <p> With the rising crescendo of the " culture of fear " and insurisation of " safety " , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of formally-organised outdoor education has dwindled . However , ironically , modern technologies make the pursuit of such activities far safer than ever before , e.g. , many adventurous activities can be done alone , with the safety net of being within mobile phone network range . Online 2D and 3D mapping make surveying an area and route planning much easier and more efficient . GPS technology makes getting very lost somewhat less likely etc . So arguably now , more than ever before , people should be encouraged to learn about how they can become solo expeditioners and given confidence in designing and tackling their own adventures . <h> Spirit of adventure <p> The spirit of adventure seems to be about doing more with less - or at least of doing far more with our resources than is commonly done . Thus adventure requires both innovation and endurance . In this day and age we are at risk of unadventure - doing less with more . Outdoor education , and particularly low-tech , local outdoor education , offers arguably the most significant , society-wide opportunities for educative , accessible , day-to-day outdoor education .

@@41691852 @1691852/ <h> Post-modernism &amp; Outdoor Education <p> The very nature of post-modernism is that anything written about post-modernism is problematised and naturally then is to be deconstructed and found to be an arbitrary , relativistic construction of meaning . This ultimately seems to imply an inherent meaninglessness in postmodern debate , although in becoming meaningless itself it also seeks to bring down with it the constructed meanings of everything else . <p> To write about postmodernism is also to be prepared to be totally wrong and infinitely vulnerable . But there is freedom here too , to see meaning fractionated into new forms . <p> An illustration of erudite meaninglessness that can appear in postmodernism ( and elsewhere ) comes from this opening to Tilton and la Tournier 's essay entitled " Feminism , subcapitalist theory and the cultural paradigm of expression , in which they write describe " contexts of meaninglessness " : <p> " " Sexual identity is fundamentally impossible , " says Bataille . A number of narratives concerning textual precultural theory may be found . In the works of Burroughs , a predominant concept is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within/without distinction prevalent in Burroughs 's Port of Saints is also evident in The Soft Machine . The subject is interpolated into a semiotic postdeconstructivist theory that includes consciousness as a whole ....

Lyotard promotes the use of the cultural paradigm of expression to modify and analyse class . " <p> The problem here is that as erudite as this sounds , it is a fictitious essay that was randomly generated by a computer programmed with post-modern phraseologies . Thus it can been how easily meaning is constructed through interpretation . W we may also recognized in here an inherent meaningless to much similar postmodern jargonesque text that gets thrown out under the guise of real debate . <p> Personally , I 'm not sure of the history or origins of post-modern thinking except that I gather it is loose and involves many who do n't agree and the so-called key figures of post-modernism themselves usually question or deny being labeled as anything to do with what others have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with postmodernism , let alone possible connections between postmodernism and other fields of inquiry , such as outdoor education . <p> My sense of postmodernism is that there is logical historical connection with existentialism which essentially brought to light in literature and philosophy a realization of the meaningfulness of modern life . This came to fruition in literature and thinking emerging from Europe in the post-industrial wake and during and immediately post World War II ( e.g. , Sartre and Camus ) . The disconnection of human living from the natural elements , from religious structure , from lived-in-communities , from traditional human values , and so on , had become stark , as had the ready destructibility of human live and civilization . So , it was natural to see a philosophical orientation emerge which essential question the value of human existence . <p> My interpretation of the existentialists is that they were the litmus paper of society , realizing that one of the final results of the grand human experiment in civilization in the 20th century , in leading life stripped of the earlier structures for human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaning and to make sense of his/her world . For a while during industrialization it had seemed that the new answers could come from the sciences which had created comforts and conveniences of physical living -- why , indeed , should these sciences not also produce wonders for education and human well being ? A reasonable expectation , it might seem . However , the sciences of the physical elements have had difficulty in their application to the social sciences ( but not a complete lack of success ) . And this is a point of criticism from postmodernism , which extents the existentialists ' concern with the meaning and meaningfulness of life , that this efforts to produce scientific ' happiness ' are , in essence , rather idiotic and fake . <p> Whilst I 've focused here on possible historical connection between postmodernism and existentialism , I suspect postmodern can be seen as a meeting point , into which many rivers flow , willingly or not so willings . Postmodernism is a nexus of energies , from sociology , philosophy , education , psychology , in which wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critiqued , with tweaks of literary and political passion . It is important to add , though , that it is not the only such nexus into which these various rivers flow - there are also attempts such as Ken Wilber 's ' Theory of Everything ' which is arguably the greatest attempt in the twentieth century to pull it all together , arguably going beyond the problematic and critical nature of postmodernism to find the answers via science , ancient and Eastern knowledge , and proposing a new evolutionary psychology ) . <p> So , as I understand it , the postmodern take on things is that all ' certain ' meaning which can be proposed from history , or science or other methods of knowledge , can be shown to not be ' certain ' , but instead to have come about through the biased construction of certain individuals , groups , governments , etc . Thus postmodern may seem scary to people who feel like their sense of certainty is built on concrete , but philosophically that may turn into quicksand . Thus , few people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking because to do essentially rots away held meaning . If this is not paired with a strength of will for constructing new meaning that goes beyond the corrosive power of postmodernism , then an individual can be left rather lost and confused , but perhaps content that he/she has avoided subscribing to false meanings . <p> Interestingly , detaching one 's constant habitual attribution of meaning to objects in the mind is one of the key initial lessons in the " Course in Miracles " program . Indeed , once one realizes this awareness , amazing things do become possible , but achievement of new levels of consciousness usually involve some form of guidance for building new structures of meaning . In this sense , outdoor education could be seen as a possible format and structure for both the deconstruction of individual 's past meaning and the reconstruction of new forms of meaning . But to do so requires that the many implicit assumptions within outdoor education programs are made more explicit so that we can then go about creating programs which help participants to realize their assumptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , of course , themselves may need to be questioned . <p> So the essential value , in a pragmatic sense , of postmodernism is that it can help us to develop a functional realism by questioning available information and knowledge , instead of just swallowing it . There is however a huge emptiness in postmodernism , just as there is a huge emptiness in existentialism - at the end of the day , what is left ? What is to be done ? If human knowledge and knowing is so entirely constructed , then what are we to do ? And this is where I think postmodernism struggles and largely fails to emerge from its own self-reflective prison and here is where we need other methods of thinking and action , particularly the possibilities of a field based on dynamic ' doing ' , such as outdoor education . It is critical and healthy to have questioning , deconstruction , etc. taking place , but it is perhaps even more critical and healthy to be actively involved in experimenting with the construction of new ways experiencing , challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In my opinion , a well-rounded outdoor educator would embrace the power of critical questioning probably ( but not essentially ) by using some of the approaches of postmodernism , and on the other hand would just as much involved in construction of new meanings , new words , new language , new programs , new research , new theory , new action , new groups , and so on . Otherwise outdoor education deserves to become extinct ; it must keep pace with social change . <p> So be warned in discussing postmodernism about the dangers of getting lost in a recursive , rather than discursive , paradigm . There are labyrinths of mirrors which one can wander for hours , days , even lifetimes . We need to do more than that . 1842 @qwx411842 <p> Re/de/signing the world : Poststructuralism , deconstruction and reality in outdoor education research ( Noel Gough &amp; Warren Sellars , 2004 , International Outdoor Education Research Conference , La Trobe University , Victoria , Australia ; . pdf ; 1.4 MB ) Abstract : This paper examines rhetorical constructions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege philosophical realism coupled with suspicion towards poststructuralism(s) and deconstruction .

This re/de/signed world never represents the real world precisely or completely , and in this paper we explore and enact modes of textual ( and extratextual&gt; ) production that struggle to retain a poststructuralist skepticism towards representational claims without falling into antirealist language games . We focus in particular on Deleuzean concepts of rhizomatic inquiry and nomadic textuality as enabling dispositions for re/de/signing worlds in which realities and representations are mutually constitutive ( rather than dialectically related ) .

Physical education , perhaps , provokes similar levels of anxiety for many . <p> So , in the first class , I spend time in a circle having students describe what past statistics courses they 've taken , if any , how it went for them , and their level of confidence / anxiety about learning statistics . <p> To the extent that a warm , empathic approach is taken by the instructor , I have found deeper and deeper revelations of highly negative past experiences of learning statistics -- in short , nothing less than a series of educational horror stories . <p> I do n't try to provide post-mathematical trauma therapy in this course , but I do try to help students build a positive momentum of confidence in their capabilities , based on developing real skills , including for example analyzing data sets and interpreting analyses . <h> Advice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> seek help early when they come up against problems -- this helps to minimize the risk of having anxiety build and interfere with learning <p> on the other hand , it is important not to get overly caught up minor concepts which are n't entirely understood <p> Thus , I think its important that as the course proceeds , that it is understood which concepts are critical before proceeding , and which concepts is it desirable , but not necessary to grasp , at least for the time being . <p> Sometimes I find that it is helpful sometimes to take side-routes off main topics , particularly to explore an underlying concept . If the student is struggling to understand a topic ( e.g. , t-tests ) , it is often because he/she does n't understand a more foundational concept ( e.g. , normal distribution ) . <p> I have found in teaching statistics that if students come to understand the basic elements really well , e.g. , the normal distribution and correlations , then learning more advanced concepts such as multivariate analyses of variance and multiple regression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content and practical tasks in this course , a solid understanding of the basic concepts ( univariate statistics ) is the core , with it being desirable that students have at least an introductory understanding of the ( multivariate statistics ) . <p> Textbook It is advisable to purchase a statistics reference text which provides a solid introduction to at least these topics : <p> normal distribution theory <p> descriptive statistics ( e.g. , mean , standard deviation , etc . ) <p> t-tests &amp; ANOVAs ( tests of mean differences ) <p> correlation , regression &amp; multiple regression ( tests of association ) <p> non-parametric tests of mean differences and association <p> effect sizes and power <p> confidence intervals <p> Desirable , but not essential text-book topics : <p> scale construction &amp; reliability analysis <p> factor analysis <p> meta-analysis <h> Why have a hard-copy text for an online course ? <p> Computers do n't always work , neither is the web super-reliable . Also , it can be helpful to have a text open alongside the computer and to read both the online course material and the material in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different versions can greatly aid understanding . Finally , this course does not provide extensive formulae , statistical tables , referencing , etc. which should be part of your hard-copy statistics text . <p> Software SPSS is used for many exercises ; some are in Excel . <p> Questions <p> Consider the following questions and email your responses to the instructor ( or group ) : <p> What research methods or statistics courses have you studied before ? <p> In general , how easy or hard is maths and statistics for you ? <p> How confident are you about this course ? <p> What kinds of information or exercises seem to work best for you in learning concepts such as statistics and skills such as statistical analysis . <p> What specific areas of research , theory , or practice interest do you have ?

@@41691869 @1691869/ <h> Outward Bound as the Spawn for Project Adventure <p> In practical and philosophical ways , Project Adventure emerged from the Outward Bound movement . Whilst many see Project Adventure as having pioneered the adaptation of adventure education techniques into urban settings , I see Project Adventure as in many ways returning to some of the roots of the educational vision of Kurt Hahn , who had founded the Salem Schule , Germany ( 1920 ) , Gordonstoun , Scotland ( 1934 ) , and Aberdovey , Wales ( 1941 ) , prior to a scheme that become the Duke of Edinburgh 's Award and Outward Bound . <p> It is important to understand that , except for Outward Bound , all of Hahn 's projects were innovative educational programs based in traditional school settings . The Duke of Edinburgh 's Award was developed around Hahn 's four educational pillars ( expeditions , service , crafts , and sport ) and the format allowed for participation by students over several years in a wide variety of settings . Outward Bound was developed as a compact version of Hahn 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term , " shot in the arm " version of his character building programs . <p> When Outward Bound took off in post-World War II Britain , many of the former ( or current ) British colonies created Outward Bound schools , and then they took off in the USA in 1962 , with the creation of the Colorado Outward Bound School , in Boulder , Colorado . Outward Bound programs specialized in taking groups of about 10 to 20 people on extended wilderness-based expeditions for the purposes of personal and social development . Since Outward Bound 's methods relied so heavily on expeditions in the wilderness , it was increasingly asked during the 1960 's in the USA whether similar positive effects could could be provided through adapted adventure activities within traditional schools and organizations . <p> Jerry Pieh started Project Adventure in 1971 with staff at Hamilton-Wendham ( a Massachusetts high school ) . Importantly , Jerry Pieh was the son of Bob Pieh who had founded the Minnesota Outward Bound School ( later to become the Voyageur Outward Bound School ) , and Jerry himself had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good understanding of the principles of Outward Bound . The challenge for Jerry was to bring those principles into a mainstream school . Thus Project Adventure became the second major spin-off from Outward Bound ( the National Outdoor Leadership School being the first major spinoff ) . <h> Federal Funding in 1974 Launches Project Adventure <p> The second major step in the evolution of Project Adventure was in 1974 , when it received federal funding through the federally funded National Diffusion Network , which allowed Project Adventure to spread into 400 schools across the USA , which itself spawned a variety of new experiments with adventure-based learning in schools . In many ways , Project Adventure never looked back . <h> Project Adventure Today <p> Project Adventure is well known for stimulating the substantial ropes challenge course industry and continuing to disseminate its knowledge and methods via books , Ziplines , and workshops ( in contrast , for example , to Outward Bound , which has tended to keep its methods to itself ) . Project Adventure has been at heart of fueling new ideas and knowledge in outdoor education since its creation in 1971.

A subset of 15 of the original items is provided from data collected from young Australian adults by Neill &amp; Dias ( 2001 ) . Check whether a 5 factor solution holds up for the data . For this factor analysis , we are interested in understanding the underlying psychological components of resilience , which is a theoretical enquiry , so use Principal Axis Factoring ( PAF ) , which looks at the shared variance amongst the items , not all the items ' variance . <p> You should find that there are really not enough primary loadings on 4 or 5 factors to justify their presence , therefore try 2 and 3 factors . Best approach is probably 2 factors ( " taking control " and " taking it easy " ) , with 3 to 5 items removed and an oblimin rotation . <p> It seems that according to this data , psychological resilience consists of two main underlying components . Firstly , about the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take control and be task oriented . Secondly , resilience is also about being able to take things in one 's stride , laugh things off , find alternatives . People who exhibit both these we qualify someone as ' psychologically resilient ' . <h> Self-Concept <p> The designer of the Self Description Questionnaire for adolescents ( SDQ-II ) , Prof. Herb Marsh , proposes 11 factors . This is a sample of data pertaining to 7 of those factors , collected from Australian adolescents . Check to see whether there are 7 factors .

Yet , further exploring suggests that 6 or 7 factors make more sense . However , there are some cross-loadings between the Opposite-Sex Relations and Physical Appearance items .

Note that if 6 factors are used , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor with physical appearance - whilst understandably related , it would make more sense to keep them as a separate factors . <p> Further checking of this solution should take place across gender . If the data is split by gender , and the 6 and 7 factor solutions examined , it becomes apparent that whilst the 6 factor solution can apply to both genders , whereas the 7 factor solution seems to only apply to one gender .
