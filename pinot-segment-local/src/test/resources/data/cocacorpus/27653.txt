This module is designed to develop an understanding of how humans acquire , represent , store and process perceptual and semantic knowledge , concepts and categories from visual and also haptic ( active touch ) inputs . Students will review experimental cognitive psychological studies and neuropsychological research in order to gain an understanding of everyday object recognition and categorisation as well as the specific difficulties that can result from brain damage , and the theoretical implications of these findings . The syllabus topics include recognising faces and objects ( covering studies of both non-brain-damaged and brain-damaged subjects ) ; theories of categorisation ; the hierarchy of levels of categorisation ( from fine discriminations between specific categories such as alsation vs. labrador to gross discriminations between broad categories such as animal vs. vehicle ) ; visual similarity , typicality , expertise , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and categories such as attention and expertise . 40583 @qwx450583 <p> ? ? ? Students will be able to articulate their knowledge of the varied theoretical approaches taken to understanding the achievement of object constancy , object recognition and categorisation with a focus on our senses of vision and touch.Students will be able to demonstrate a systematic and critical understanding of the empirical evidence available to support and to test accounts of object recognition and categorisation , and to show a critical appreciation of the implications of this research for theories of object recognition and categorisation. ? <p> ?

I was then appointed to a permanent position as Lecturer in 2010 . I am primarily interested in the history of reading in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , using the practice and experience of reading in the past as a key to understanding much broader social and cultural processes across the English-speaking world . This research agenda was pioneered in my first monograph on the social impact of the Enlightenment in Scotland , but I 've since broadened out my interests to include published research on the cultural history of libraries , the reading experiences of Napoleonic prisoners of war , and the history of women 's reading . <p> I returned from extended research leave in January 2016 , funded by the award of a British Academy Mid-Career Fellowship for 2014-15.

@@40159976 @159976/ <h> The Duration of Plastic <p> Most weeks I spend at least half an hour collecting up plastic bottles , shredded food cartons , frayed rope , deflated balloons and other less distinguishable bits of plastic from a beach on Morecambe Bay , Lancashire . Generally it is the kind of stuff we 're meant to throw away ( if not directly into the sea ) : stuff we do n't give a minute 's thought to . <p> I collect it because it is in front of me . I see it daily . Some days are worse than others , depending on wind direction , strength of tide throwing the dross up the beach . Other days , if the tide gets to it before me , the rubbish is drawn back out of sight , away to wherever . I can forget it about it , until the next splintered hoard arrives , until years of watching this accumulation and dispersal has meant it never really leaves my imagination . I look at the winkle shells , marram grasses , shingle , unconsciously searching for snaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plastics integrity , as a petroleum-based product , is resilience . The belief that anything derived from oil , from millions of years of compression , ought to be cheap and disposable is as outmoded as the belief that time is money . Eight per cent of oil produced is used in plastic production . The carbon in oil locked in plastic does not breakdown quickly , and even more slowly in the cold dark currents of the ocean . Time , in the sense of plastic , as in the sense of oil , is infinitesimal change . If something takes so long to develop , its only inevitable that it will take a long time to decompose . <p> We should have the imagination to hold this process . Plastics ability to extend its reach to being both building and biro is , after all , the manifestation of human imagination . We looked at cellulose , at silk , at ivory and thought of ways of emulating these qualities to enrich and cushion our lives . If plastic were to be magically eradicated , we 'd lose our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car interiors , and so on . We would also lose the remaining elephants , tortoises , whales , forests and all the other natural products that plastics replaced . Plastic promised an insurance against decay , as well as disease . <p> On one hand plastic is cheap and easy to replace . It had to become disposal to be viable . If it lasted as long as it could , thered be no demand to make enough to turn a profit . However , slowness is its essential nature . This truth is in evidence in the shreds I collect from the beach . I have no idea how old many of the things I find are , many are , of course , faded from the light and salt , others , like the green-coated Every Ready battery pack I found once , seem to have washed up from the seventies . In fact none of the plastic ever produced has entirely disappeared . Microbes have yet to catch up with our pace of living . We have yet to catch up . <p> I organise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubs and car parts I take to the local tip ; crap I can throw away with my rubbish ; rope I can reuse ; and the interesting or attractive things whose provenance I cant determine go into a box of the Unknown . <p> Most of the ocean is unknown to us , but it is not an absence . It is not a nowhere that is nothing to do with us , a place simply to be crossed to get somewhere else . It is an everywhere . It is the most visible element of our single hydrological cycle . It , like mountains and deserts , is a reminder of the geological time our daily lives forget . It provides over half the oxygen of the planet . It has absorbed over half of all man-made carbon dioxide . It is a regulator for our climate . <p> I continue to collect the strewn plastic because to leave it there is not an option . While regular inventions promise to remove plastic from the sea , much of it is so small theyd be removing the similarly-sized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is to prevent the plastic getting into or returning to the ocean , and this is slow and laborious . As well as plastic , over the years I 've found carcasses , in various states of decay , of cows , sheep , porpoises , seals , guillemots , oyster catchers and many other disembodied bones and beaks . I am squeamish and avoid these mangled stinking corpses , with a squawky bounce if surprised by one . The shoreline is a regular reminder of mortality and my clearing up the plastic is a desire to prevent more unnecessary death . It is , I know as I drag my bin bag over the drying kelp , a somewhat foolhardy , certainly endless task . <p> Marine debris is well documented ; many of us know about the pledges to remove microbeads from cosmetics , that Johnson and Johnson are no longer going to use plastic shafts ( in half the world ) for their " cotton buds " and how synthetic fibres are washed out of our clothes and into the sea on each wash . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gyres miles out to sea , plastic is being pulverised into microscopic debris by tidal currents . The sea contains the smallest and largest organisms in existence , and holds the oldest living creature in the world . The micro-debris can be eaten by zooplankton , which are eaten by crustaceans , which are eaten by fish which are eaten by larger fish , then marine mammals , or birds . At each level of trophic transfer the toxic concentration increases . At each stage it disables creatures movements , bloats their stomachs with non-nutritional bulk , and releases toxins that render them sterile . If it is n't eaten , and does n't  remain large enough to anchor fish , seals or birds , it slowly decomposes , releasing gases - carbon , nitrogen , hydrogen , chlorine , whatever was added in production - as it diminishes . As gas it attaches to water molecules , condenses into cloud which falls as rain . <p> Our ingenuity has become a plague . Our fingerprints are everywhere .

One of Theresa Mays first acts as Prime Minister was to move responsibility for climate change to a new Department for Business , Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy . To link climate change to business and industrial growth is like treating plastic as disposable : it comes down to economics . Between climate change and plastic waste is ocean : the sink which is becoming more acidic from atmospheric carbon , and more acidic from the degrading carbon in plastic . Ocean is what links the air and land . <p> What I find washed up democratises every human action : from personal hygiene to family celebrations to farm management . Against the backdrop of the ocean we are a single species that has the capacity to imagine , produce and affect change . Walking alongside this slice of ocean reminds me of my citizenship : my responsibility to my species , and others in the world .

We will also discuss a general relation between the Berry connection in conformal field theories and the connections on conformal manifolds considered previously by several authors in conformal perturbation theory .

However , any associated scalar fifth forces have not been observed to date in local tests of gravity . The coupling to matter must therefore be fine-tuned , or the scalar fifth force itself must somehow be screened in the local environment . In this talk , we focus on so-called symmetron models , wherein spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to density-dependent modifications of the matter coupling . In addition , we discuss the potential implications of the symmetron mechanism for astrophysical observations , illustrating that it is capable of describing observed galactic rotation curves without the need for particle dark matter . <h> Wednesday 16th November 2016 - On branes and ( non-linear ) instantons <p> Speaker : Ruben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminar Room TP-117 <p> Abstract : I will describe some aspects of gauge theories as seen by supersymmetric D-branes , ranging from the non-linear deformations of instanton equations to the globally supersymmetric theories on curved manifolds . <h> Wednesday 9th November 2016 - Tachyonic antibranes and the landscape <p> Speaker : Iosif Bena ( Saclay , Paris ) <p> 1:00PM Chris Michael Seminar Room TP-117 <p> Abstract : Antibranes in backgrounds that have charge dissolved in fluxes are a key ingredient in constructing a landscape ( Multiverse ) of deSitter vacua in String Theory , and also of constructing microstate solutions corresponding to non-supersymmetric near-extremal black holes . There are several regimes of parameters in which one can study the physics of these antibranes , and I will show that in the regime of parameters where their gravitational backreaction is important , antibranes have a naked singularity that can not be resolved either by brane polarization or by cloaking with a black hole horizon , and that signals a tachyonic instability .

WIMPs can be detected indirectly ( via the products of their annihilation ) or directly ( via elastic scattering in underground detectors ) . After an overview of WIMPs and the status of attempts to detect them , I will focus on what we could learn from direct detection experiments about the astrophysics and particle physics of WIMPs . <h> Wednesday 26th October 2016 - The top quark and its mass <p> Speaker : Peter Marquard ( DESY Zeuthen ) <p> 1:00PM Chris Michael Seminar Room TP-117 <p> Abstract : The top quark is the heaviest particle in the Standard Model and plays an important role for precision observables .

The models are based on a " map " from stringy hadrons of curved holographic conning backgrounds . In the first part of the talk I will review the " derivation " of the models . I will start with a brief reminder of the passage from the original AdS=CFT correspondence to the string/gauge duality of certain favored confining holographic models . I will then describe the string configurations in these holographic backgrounds that correspond to Wilson lines , mesons , baryons , glueballs and exotics .

@@40159984 @159984/ <h> Workshop Speakers <p> Abstract : In this lecture we survey our recent works on social network games . They are tailored to study a model of social networks introduced by Apt and Markakis in 2011 in which the nodes influenced by their neighbours can adopt one out of several products . In these games the payoff of each player weakly increases when more players choose his strategy , which is exactly opposite to the congestion games . <p> We show that such games may have no Nash equilibrium and that determining an existence of a Nash equilibrium is NP-complete . We also clarify the status and the complexity of the finite best response property ( FBRP ) , the finite improvement property ( FIP ) . <p> Further , we exhibit in this framework some paradoxes . One of them allows us to explain ' bubbles ' in a financial market , in which a decision of a trader to switch to some new financial product triggers a sequence of transactions , as a result of which all traders involved become worse off . <p> Abstract : Cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at partitioning a set of objects into a disjoint collection of objects with similar characteristics . In this talk , we will use the concept of conductance to measure the quality of cluster structure and will focus on a question of approximately recognizing cluster structure of a graph in sublinear time in the framework of property testing in the bounded degree model . We show how to test in O* ( sqrtn ) time whether a graph with nodes can be partitioned into no more than k parts ( clusters ) such that the outer-conductance of each cluster is phio at most and the inner-conductance of the induced subgraph on each cluster is at least phii , for a large spectrum of parameters k , phio , phii . By the lower bound of Omega(sqrtn) for testing graph expansion , which corresponds to the case when k=1 in our problem , our algorithm is asymptotically optimal up to polylogarithmic factors . This is joint work with Pan Peng and Christian Sohler . <p> Abstract : With the advent of Functional genomics , any competent Biological laboratory can generate genome-wide measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been the rapid growth of public databases containing genetics information as well as the results of thousands of gene expression , proteomics and metabolomics experiments . This has generated the expectation that such vast amount of information would result in a rapid increase in our understanding of biology and that this in turn would contribute a whole spectrum of clinically relevant biomarkers , novel drug targets , and ultimately improved personalized therapies . <p> However , understanding this complexity has proven to be more challenging than expected . The main difficulty has been integrating such large datasets within a computational framework designed to infer the underlying structure of biological pathways from observational data . <p> In this talk , I will present several case studies demonstrating the successful identification of novel biological mechanisms using a set of network inference techniques . I will also explore the issue of biological interpretability in using computational models for the generation of testable hypothesis . <p> Abstract : In this talk I will be presenting two related papers that have to do with energy savings in wired networks .

That is , for a solution concept to be realistic , it should be obtainable using distributed computation by the agents , as opposed to , say , passing all information about the game to a central controller , who in turn tells everyone how to play . In the talk I will present some results about communication-bounded computation , and how this helps to capture the notion of decentralisation . <p> Abstract : Resilience needs to be one of the most important properties of future computer networks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructures and their support for mission-critical services . This talk introduces network resilience and a strategy for its realisation , alongside some relevant research issues . <p> Abstract : When placing sensors at random on a line we want to ensure that interference is minimized and coverage is guaranteed . Proximity between neighbouring sensors affects their transmission and reception signals and degrades network performance In fact , the closer their distance the higher the resulting interference and hence performance degradation . Similarly , monitoring a line domain requires that every point in the line is within the range of a sensor . <p> In general we are interested in the following questions : What is the expected min total sensor displacement required to avoid interference and/or ensure coverage ? We study these two problems separately . For the interference problem we develop tradeoffs between theinter-sensor distance and the expected min total sensor displacement and prove the existence of a critical regime . Similarly , for the coverage problem we develop tradeoffs between the sensor range and the expected min total sensor displacement . <p> Abstract : One of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synchronize the terminals attempting to send via a shared radio channel .

Compared to enterprise or corporate networks that permit wireless access in a controlled manner , such networks are necessarily more open in nature , in order to provide access to a greater range of users and their wireless devices .

The vertices may have a few additional possible states and can interact in pairs only if they share an edge . We first provide a population protocol with 4 states per vertex that always computes the initial majority value , under any fair scheduler . Under the uniform probabilistic scheduler of pairwise interactions , we prove that our protocol stabilizes in expected polynomial time for any connected network and is quite fast on the clique . It turns out that this protocol is optimal , in the sense that there does not exist any population protocol that always computes majority with fewer than 4 states per vertex . Furthermore we analyze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per vertex , introduced in ( Angluin , Aspnes , Eisenstat , Distributed Computing , 21(2):87-102 , 2008 ) . As it is known that this protocol determines the correct initial majority type in the clique graph very fast and whp under the uniform probabilistic scheduler , we study the performance of this protocol in arbitrary networks . We prove that , when the two initial states are put uniformly at random on the vertices , the protocol of Angluin et al . converges to the initial majority with probability higher than the probability of converging to the initial minority . In contrast , we present an infinite family of graphs , on which the protocol of Angluin et al . can fail , i.e. it can converge to the initial minority type whp , even when the difference between the initial majority and the initial minority is $n - Theta(lnn)$ . Finally we present another infinite family of graphs in which the protocol of Angluin et al . takes an expected exponential time to converge . Surprisingly , the resistance of the clique to failure causes the failure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of networks in epidemic modelling .

However , there are few direct observations of the growth of large intrusive bodies or mechanical models of magma intrusion . <p> The processes governing the growth of continental crust can be observed in areas with extensive volcanism in continents , such as those associated to subduction volcanic arcs . The deep roots of active volcanoes and associated magma reservoirs have been studied extensively in the search for clues on the nature of their growth , which is thought to occur either by the continuous accumulation of magma or by episodic pulses .
