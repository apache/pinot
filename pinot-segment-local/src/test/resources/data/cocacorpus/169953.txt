A new log message has been added indicating that an ARP resolve query failed . 5 . The following browsers are now supported : Firefox 3+ , Opera 10.5+ , Safari 5+ , Internet Explorer 7+ and Chrome 4+.6 . Grouping configuration objects into logical groups makes it easier to manage large number of configuration objects . It is also possible to add a descriptive description and custom color to distinguish what these objects do .

User authentication has been updated with a new authentication source that will grant access to the user without checking any credentials . This functionality can be used to authenticate users from within login scripts etc , to make auditing easier.Fixes:1 . The usage column in the DHCP Server status page has been updated to show active clients . 2 . References to UserAuth privileges for authenticated users could change when modifying the number of configured privileges . 3 . The web server could under certain conditions deadlock and print a " 500 - Internal Server Error " message when trying to access the web user interface . The web server has been extended with better error handling to prevent this kind of deadlock . 4 .

In certain scenarios , the voice transmitted through the SIP ALG terminated suddenly two minutes after the call was established . 7 . Office " xlsm " files were blocked by the SMTP ALG . Encrypted " xlsm " files are embedded in an " Office 97/2000 Compatible " container which results in an incorrect file typ according to file integrity control .

Deploying a configuration during heavy traffic load could cause a watchdog reboot.3 . It was possible to enable the anti-spam feature DNSBL on an SMTP-ALG without specifying any DNSBL servers . Configuring DNSBL without specifying any servers will now give an error.4 . Some errors in IPsec tunnel configuration were not correctly treated during the firewall start up process , resulting in IPsec tunnels not properly being set up . Now most of those errors make the tunnel be disabled and a warning message be displayed . For the most severe ones the configuration will be rejected by the system.5 . Running FTP-ALG in hybrid mode could result in the first packet being dropped when the connection to the server is n't established , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ALG to the client will now not be initiated until the server connection is established towards the ALG.6 . It was not possible to move a rule up or down in the list if the rule was disabled.7 . The command " ipsecstats " could in some circumstances not show all tunnels when a tunnel name was given as an argument . The command now displays all the tunnels when tunnel name is given as an argument.8 . The command " ipsecstats " only listed the first matching IPsec SA when a tunnel name was given as an argument . The command now displays all IPsec SAs that are connected to the specified tunnel name.9 . The FTP-ALG virus scanner triggered an unexpected restart if the virus signature database was updated while files were being processed by an FTP-ALG configured with fail-mode set to allow.10 . The " ippool - show " CLI command output showed all configured pools , which could be a very long list . Now only the first ten are listed by default . The " -max " option can be used to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Session Message " when initiating a new SIP call.12 . The return traffic for ICMP messages received on an IPsec transport mode interface was wrongly routed to the core itself and then dropped . The return traffic is now passed back using the same connection as it arrived on.13 . Tab completion in the command line interface ( CLI ) did not work on IPsec tunnels when using the " ipsecstats " command . Tab completion is now possible to use in the " ipsecstats " command.14 . The firewall did not accept certificates signed with RSA-SHA256.15 . Timezone setting could make the minimum date limit in scheduling to wrap and become a date into the future . The minimum and maximum dates in scheduling have been modified to be between the years 2000 and 2030 which will not trigger the incorrect behavior.16 . The SMTP-ALG incorrectly blocked emails sent using the CHUNKING ( BDAT ) extension . The ALG has been modified to remove the CHUNKING capability from the server 's EHLO response . This allows the emails to pass through the ALG.17 . It was not possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys were registered in the SSH client.18 . The firewall could unexpectedly restart when disabling automatic updates of anti-virus and IDP updates.19 . IPsec tunnels with a DNS name as remote endpoint would cease to function after a remote endpoint IP address change.20 . Blacklist could potentially write to media up to five times each minute . The delay between possible writes has been increased to two hours.21 . It was not possible to configure " maximum authentication retries " for the SSH server in the web user interface . Configuration support has now been added.22 . There was a problem when multiple IPsec SAs referenced the same XAuth context.23 . If a DHCP lease of a reserved IP address was manually released in the DHCP server and the host requested a new lease , the host was not given the reserved IP again.24 . The UDP checksum was not correctly updated when the multiplex rule was used together with address translation ( SAT SETDEST / NAT ) .25 . On some models , a data alignment error in the Route Load Balancing system could cause the firewall to malfunction.26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Upgrading from an older version to a newer version could cause problems . This problem has now been fixed and the old service will be converted during the upgrade.27 . In some scenarios , login attempts using the web user interface failed with the error message " Error 500 - Internal Server Error " . No new login attempts were allowed until the system had been restarted . A synchronization lock for an internal buffer failed to reset during reconfigure and caused this issue.28 . Scripts created by " script -create " could previously have problems to run even when executed with " script -execute -force " , because the generated script would sometimes incorrectly reference an object before it had been added . This has been solved in such way that " script-create " always generates a script that will not reference an object before it has been created . Circular dependencies are resolved by first adding the objects without the problematic references , then later modifying the object to its final state.29 .

Fixed issue in OSPF where an LSA could be incorrectly deleted after being re-originated.3 . The interface listings for Marvell Yukon interfaces showed incorrect IRQ values.It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.4 . The amount of memory used by the IDP engine was too high . The memory consumption has now been reduced.5 . E-mails from e-mail addresses in the whitelist were blocked if they were classified as spam messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let through , even if they are classified as spam.6 . Fixed leap year problem where leap year day was added to January instead of February.7 . Fixed problem in HA where one of the cluster members could be in lockdown and prevent its member from going active.8 . Fixed problem resulting in the IDP/AV license being expired prematurely.9 . It was not possible to enter an NTP server with a DNS name in the setup wizard . The NTP server can now be entered in the format " dns:server.example.com " .10 . HTTP Web Content Filter override functionality can cause an unexpected restart when timing out users that have clicked the override button . Users that have clicked the override button have access to blocked content for a specific amount of time . When this time expires , an unexpected restart may occur.11 . It was not possible to manually force media or duplex for Marvell Yukon interface types.It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.12 . Pattern matching in the blacklist and whitelist in the SMTP-ALG has been extended to be more dynamic.13 . Both members in the HA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were changed ( active to passive and passive to active ) . It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.14 . Very large configuration files could cause some web pages in the web user interface to not render completely.15 . It was not possible to select PPPoE interfaces as outer interface filter in PPTP/L2TP servers in the web user interface.16 . The SIP-ALG could in some scenarios cause instability of the system when running out of RAM . The issues have been addressed and fixed.17 . Fixed issue in TCPStack with stalling transfers with peers using a very small send window.18 . The SIP-ALG could in rare occasions fail to setup a call and generate a log message containing " M HEADER NOT FOUND " . The issue has been corrected.19 . SNMP Traps used the shared IP instead of the private IP in HA setups.20 . SNMP Trap messages could sometimes contain garbage characters.21 . The SNMP logger could in rare circumstances cause the system to malfunction.22 . Web Content Filtering functionality could fail if the WCF server used for URL lookups stopped responding to queries . The mechanism used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will connect to the second closest server if the primary server fails . If that server also fails , it will continue with the other servers . After 1 hour of using secondary servers , a new attempt will be made to contact the primary server in order to minimize latency.Known Issues:1 . The Oray.net for Peanut Hull DDNS client does not work after supplier changed the protocol.2 . HA : Transparent Mode wo n't work in HA modeThere is no state synchronization for Transparent Mode and there is no loop avoidance.3 . HA : No state synchronization for ALGsNo aspect of ALGs are state synchronized . This means that all traffic handled by ALGs will freeze when the cluster fails over to the other peer . if , however , the cluster fails back over to the original peer within approximately half a minute , frozen sessions ( and associated transfers ) should begin working again . Note that such failover ( and consequent fallback ) occurs each time a new configuration is uploaded.4 . HA : Tunnels unreachable from inactive nodeThe inactive node in an HA cluster can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnels , as such tunnels are established to/from the active node. ? Inactive HA member can not send log events over tunnels. ? Inactive HA member can not be managed / monitored over tunnels. ? OSPF : If the cluster members do not share a broadcast interface so that the inactive node can learn about OSPF state , OSPF failover over tunnels uses normal OSPF failover rather than accelerated ( &lt;1s ) failover . This means 20-30 seconds with default settings , and 3-4 seconds with more aggressively tuned OSPF timings.5 . HA : No state synchronization for L2TP , PPTP and IPSec tunnelsThere is no state synchronization for L2TP , PPTP and IPSec tunnels.On failover , incoming clients will re-establish their tunnels after the tunnels are deemed non-functional . This timeout is typically in the 30 -- 120 seconds range.6 . HA : No state synchronization for IDP signature scan states.No aspects of the IDP signature states are synchronized . This means that there is a small chance that the IDP engine causes false negatives during an HA LONG ... 2.20.02Platform Compatibility : **37;199;TOOLONG Version : A1 ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : July 10 , 2008New Features and Enhancements1 . PPPoE Interfaces.It is now possible to configure the MTU ( Maximum Transmission Unit ) for PPPoE Interfaces.1 . PPTP/L2TP Client Interfaces.It is now possible to configure the MTU ( Maximum Transmission Unit ) for PPTP/L2TP client Interfaces.Problems Resolved1 . ICMP Destination Unreachable packets were not sent when UDP packets hit a Reject rule.2 . Web authentication and web server connections were not closed correctly at reconfiguration.3 . The DHCP Server did just send replies back on the receiving interface without regarding routing decisions . The DHCP Server now performs a route lookup if the reply is destined for a host address ( i.e. not an IP broadcast ) .4 . HA setups with IDP scanning enabled , packets could be lost during a failover.5 . Some services were using the private IP in HA setups for communicating . This is now changed and the shared IP is used.6 . The DNS lookup of the IP address to a remote gateway failed under certain circumstances for IPSec interfaces.7 . The CLI command for displaying updatecenter AV/IDP update status did not show enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sometimes fail due to an incorrect sequence number check.9 . A missing **25;238;TOOLONG header field in e-mails could sometimes cause the SMTP-ALG session to malfunction.10 . With TCP sequence validation turned on , closing existing connections would cause all subsequent attempts to reopen the same connection to be dropped with a log message about a bad sequence number . The situation would resolve itself after a timeout of about 50 seconds , but would still cause severe traffic impairment in certain situations ( most noticeably HTTP traffic ) . This change will by default loosen the restrictions when an attempt to reopen a closed connection is received ( ValidateSilent , ValidateLogBad ) , while still enforcing RFC correctness.11 . The SMTP-ALG could not tell the difference between the new Microsoft Office 2007 document file types and file type ZIP . This is because there is no difference that can be easily discovered ( the new Microsoft Office files are in fact ZIP files with a different extension ) . An ALG configured to make file integrity checks would therefore signal these files as invalid ( wrong mime type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify Office 2007 files as ZIP files . Anti-virus checks will , if enabled , scan the contents of the new Office 2007 files just like it would with a regular ZIP file.12 . IP address with suffixes .0 and/or .255 could incorrectly be assigned to IPSec config mode clients.13 . Nested MIME bodies could in some scenarios be blocked by the SMTP-ALG . For example , the SMTP-ALG could block images inserted as ' inline ' with an error message indicating base64 decoding error . The recipient received the email without the attached image but an error message saying : " The attachment xxxx has been blocked by the Security Gateway " . The ALG has been updated with better support for nested MIME blocks.14 . A user logging in via Web based user Authentication , when configured to handle user credentials via one or several RADIUS servers , it could cause an unexpected abort if no RADIUS server was reachable . This issue has been fixed.15 . The web user interface , the properties in " Dynamic Black Listing " were incorrectly enabled when action was set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for removing IKE SA was missing , hence making it impossible to remove an IKE SA using the web user interface.n++17 . DNS Blacklist CLI command showed wrong status of blacklist servers on inactive HA member . Inactive HA member does not perform any anti-spam inspection so the inactive node is unaware of the status of the blacklist servers.18 . Email attachments with very long file names could cause memory corruption in the SMTP-ALG.19 . Log string sent to syslog receivers was not always correctly formatted . Some log arguments were not separated by a whitespace , resulting in invalid parsing by syslog receivers.20 . When restarting an interface on the DFL-1600 or DFL-2500 , there has been a theoretical possibility of memory corruption . This issue has been fixed from F/W v2.20.02 and later.21 . Connections were , under certain circumstances , incorrectly dropped by the IDP scanning engine when audit mode was used.22 . After IPSec tunnels were modified , the reconfiguration of the gateway was not done correctly . The result was that the gateway could go into unexpected abort state.23 . A configured external log receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreachable packets to the firewall . These packets would trigger new log messages resulting in high CPU utilization . Logging is now connection-based and the sending rate of log messages will be decreased by the firewall when it receives ICMP destination unreachable packets regarding log receiver connections.24 . TCP connections with SYN relay were not synchronized correctly . In case of HA failover , traffic on these connections would freeze.25 . Unnecessary DynDNS and HTTP-Poster re-posts were triggered during reconfigure . This is now avoided by always considering if the local interface IP address has been changed or if the HTTP-Poster/DynDNS configuration has been changed.26 . Some H.323 messages were incorrectly disallowed by the ALG . The H.323 Status Enquiry message is now allowed to be forwarded through the H.323-ALG.27 . The Fail Mode setting in the HTTP-ALG was not honored by the Dynamic Web Content Filtering.28 . The log message for expired or no valid Web Content Filtering license did only show up once .

The SMTP-ALG has been updated with improved state tracking and email syntax validation.30 . It was not possible to configure the primary NBNS server for L2TP/PPTP server interfaces in the web user interface.31 . The TCP monitoring of Server Load Balancing did not increase TCP sequence number in the reset packet sent to server in case of connection timeout . The sequence number is now increased by one.32 . Server Load Balancing did not use All-To-One for port numbers . When using a range on the service , the destination port would be the specified port plus the offset from the low port number in the service.33 . One of the log messages had an incorrect format . When the log message was placed first in the log table , the web user interface memlog would display an empty page.34 . The description text for IP Pools incorrectly specified that IP Pools could be used by L2TP and PPTP.35 . A confusing Anti-Virus status message was visible in status page on non UTM capable devices .

HA : Transparent Mode wo n't work in HA modeThere is no state synchronization for Transparent Mode and there is no loop avoidance.5 . HA : No state synchronization for ALGsNo aspect of ALGs are state synchronized . This means that all traffic handled by ALGs will freeze when the cluster fails over to the other peer . if , however , the cluster fails back over to the original peer within approximately half a minute , frozen sessions ( and associated transfers ) should begin working again . Note that such failover ( and consequent fallback ) occurs each time a new configuration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inactive node in an HA cluster can not communicate over IPSec , PPTP , L2TP and GRE tunnels , as such tunnels are established to/from the active node. - Inactive HA member can not send log events over tunnels. - Inactive HA member can not be managed / monitored over tunnels. - OSPF : If the cluster members do not share a broadcast interface so that the inactive node can learn about OSPF state , OSPF failover over tunnels uses normal OSPF failover rather than accelerated ( &lt;1s ) failover . This means 20-30 seconds with default settings , and 3-4 seconds with more aggressively tuned OSPF timings.7 . HA : No state synchronization for L2TP , PPTP and IPSec tunnelsThere is no state synchronization for L2TP , PPTP and IPSec tunnels.On failover , incoming clients will re-establish their tunnels after the tunnels are deemed non-functional . This timeout is typically in the 30 -- 120 seconds range.8 . HA : No state synchronization for IDP signature scan states.No aspects of the IDP signature states are synchronized . This means that there is a small chance that the IDP engine causes false negatives during an HA failover.

A new log message has been added indicating that an ARP resolve query failed . 5 . The following browsers are now supported : Firefox 3+ , Opera 10.5+ , Safari 5+ , Internet Explorer 7+ and Chrome 4+.6 . Grouping configuration objects into logical groups makes it easier to manage large number of configuration objects . It is also possible to add a descriptive description and custom color to distinguish what these objects do .

The schedule page has been improved36 . SSL/TLS TerminationProblems Resolved:1 . PPP negotiations were sometimes slower than necessary.2 . Deploying a configuration during heavy traffic load could cause a watchdog reboot.3 . It was possible to enable the anti-spam feature DNSBL on an SMTP-ALG without specifying any DNSBL servers . Configuring DNSBL without specifying any servers will now give an error.4 . Some errors in IPsec tunnel configuration were not correctly treated during the firewall start up process , resulting in IPsec tunnels not properly being set up . Now most of those errors make the tunnel be disabled and a warning message be displayed . For the most severe ones the configuration will be rejected by the system.5 . Running FTP-ALG in hybrid mode could result in the first packet being dropped when the connection to the server is n't established , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the ALG to the client will now not be initiated until the server connection is established towards the ALG.6 . It was not possible to move a rule up or down in the list if the rule was disabled.7 . The command " ipsecstats " could in some circumstances not show all tunnels when a tunnel name was given as an argument . The command now displays all the tunnels when tunnel name is given as an argument.8 . The command " ipsecstats " only listed the first matching IPsec SA when a tunnel name was given as an argument . The command now displays all IPsec SAs that are connected to the specified tunnel name.9 . The FTP-ALG virus scanner triggered an unexpected restart if the virus signature database was updated while files were being processed by an FTP-ALG configured with fail-mode set to allow.10 . The " ippool - show " CLI command output showed all configured pools , which could be a very long list . Now only the first ten are listed by default . The " -max " option can be used to display @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Session Message " when initiating a new SIP call.12 . The return traffic for ICMP messages received on an IPsec transport mode interface was wrongly routed to the core itself and then dropped . The return traffic is now passed back using the same connection as it arrived on.13 . Tab completion in the command line interface ( CLI ) did not work on IPsec tunnels when using the " ipsecstats " command . Tab completion is now possible to use in the " ipsecstats " command.14 . The firewall did not accept certificates signed with RSA-SHA256.15 . Timezone setting could make the minimum date limit in scheduling to wrap and become a date into the future . The minimum and maximum dates in scheduling have been modified to be between the years 2000 and 2030 which will not trigger the incorrect behavior.16 . The SMTP-ALG incorrectly blocked emails sent using the CHUNKING ( BDAT ) extension . The ALG has been modified to remove the CHUNKING capability from the server 's EHLO response . This allows the emails to pass through the ALG.17 . It was not possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys were registered in the SSH client.18 . The firewall could unexpectedly restart when disabling automatic updates of anti-virus and IDP updates.19 . IPsec tunnels with a DNS name as remote endpoint would cease to function after a remote endpoint IP address change.20 . Blacklist could potentially write to media up to five times each minute . The delay between possible writes has been increased to two hours.21 . It was not possible to configure " maximum authentication retries " for the SSH server in the web user interface . Configuration support has now been added.22 . There was a problem when multiple IPsec SAs referenced the same XAuth context.23 . If a DHCP lease of a reserved IP address was manually released in the DHCP server and the host requested a new lease , the host was not given the reserved IP again.24 . The UDP checksum was not correctly updated when the multiplex rule was used together with address translation ( SAT SETDEST / NAT ) .25 . On some models , a data alignment error in the Route Load Balancing system could cause the firewall to malfunction.26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service . Upgrading from an older version to a newer version could cause problems . This problem has now been fixed and the old service will be converted during the upgrade.27 . In some scenarios , login attempts using the web user interface failed with the error message " Error 500 - Internal Server Error " . No new login attempts were allowed until the system had been restarted . A synchronization lock for an internal buffer failed to reset during reconfigure and caused this issue.28 . Scripts created by " script -create " could previously have problems to run even when executed with " script -execute -force " , because the generated script would sometimes incorrectly reference an object before it had been added . This has been solved in such way that " script-create " always generates a script that will not reference an object before it has been created . Circular dependencies are resolved by first adding the objects without the problematic references , then later modifying the object to its final state.29 . Since the web user interface uses UTF-8 encoding , a PSK containing ASCII @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters .

The interface listings for Marvell Yukon interfaces showed incorrect IRQ values.It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.4 . The amount of memory used by the IDP engine was too high . The memory consumption has now been reduced.5 . E-mails from e-mail addresses in the whitelist were blocked if they were classified as spam messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let through , even if they are classified as spam.6 . Fixed leap year problem where leap year day was added to January instead of February.7 . Fixed problem in HA where one of the cluster members could be in lockdown and prevent its member from going active.8 . Fixed problem resulting in the IDP/AV license being expired prematurely.9 . It was not possible to enter an NTP server with a DNS name in the setup wizard . The NTP server can now be entered in the format " dns:server.example.com " .10 . HTTP Web Content Filter override functionality can cause an unexpected restart when timing out users that have clicked the override button . Users that have clicked the override button have access to blocked content for a specific amount of time . When this time expires , an unexpected restart may occur.11 . It was not possible to manually force media or duplex for Marvell Yukon interface types.It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.12 . Pattern matching in the blacklist and whitelist in the SMTP-ALG has been extended to be more dynamic.13 . Both members in the HA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were changed ( active to passive and passive to active ) . It affects in DFL-1600 and DFL-2500 only.14 . Very large configuration files could cause some web pages in the web user interface to not render completely.15 . It was not possible to select PPPoE interfaces as outer interface filter in PPTP/L2TP servers in the web user interface.16 . The SIP-ALG could in some scenarios cause instability of the system when running out of RAM . The issues have been addressed and fixed.17 . Fixed issue in TCPStack with stalling transfers with peers using a very small send window.18 . The SIP-ALG could in rare occasions fail to setup a call and generate a log message containing " M HEADER NOT FOUND " . The issue has been corrected.19 . SNMP Traps used the shared IP instead of the private IP in HA setups.20 . SNMP Trap messages could sometimes contain garbage characters.21 . The SNMP logger could in rare circumstances cause the system to malfunction.22 . Web Content Filtering functionality could fail if the WCF server used for URL lookups stopped responding to queries . The mechanism used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will connect to the second closest server if the primary server fails . If that server also fails , it will continue with the other servers . After 1 hour of using secondary servers , a new attempt will be made to contact the primary server in order to minimize latency.Known Issues:1 .

PPTP/L2TP Client Interfaces.It is now possible to configure the MTU ( Maximum Transmission Unit ) for PPTP/L2TP client Interfaces.Problems Resolved1 . ICMP Destination Unreachable packets were not sent when UDP packets hit a Reject rule.2 . Web authentication and web server connections were not closed correctly at reconfiguration.3 . The DHCP Server did just send replies back on the receiving interface without regarding routing decisions . The DHCP Server now performs a route lookup if the reply is destined for a host address ( i.e. not an IP broadcast ) .4 . HA setups with IDP scanning enabled , packets could be lost during a failover.5 . Some services were using the private IP in HA setups for communicating . This is now changed and the shared IP is used.6 . The DNS lookup of the IP address to a remote gateway failed under certain circumstances for IPSec interfaces.7 . The CLI command for displaying updatecenter AV/IDP update status did not show enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sometimes fail due to an incorrect sequence number check.9 . A missing **25;421;TOOLONG header field in e-mails could sometimes cause the SMTP-ALG session to malfunction.10 . With TCP sequence validation turned on , closing existing connections would cause all subsequent attempts to reopen the same connection to be dropped with a log message about a bad sequence number . The situation would resolve itself after a timeout of about 50 seconds , but would still cause severe traffic impairment in certain situations ( most noticeably HTTP traffic ) . This change will by default loosen the restrictions when an attempt to reopen a closed connection is received ( ValidateSilent , ValidateLogBad ) , while still enforcing RFC correctness.11 . The SMTP-ALG could not tell the difference between the new Microsoft Office 2007 document file types and file type ZIP . This is because there is no difference that can be easily discovered ( the new Microsoft Office files are in fact ZIP files with a different extension ) . An ALG configured to make file integrity checks would therefore signal these files as invalid ( wrong mime type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify Office 2007 files as ZIP files . Anti-virus checks will , if enabled , scan the contents of the new Office 2007 files just like it would with a regular ZIP file.12 . IP address with suffixes .0 and/or .255 could incorrectly be assigned to IPSec config mode clients.13 . Nested MIME bodies could in some scenarios be blocked by the SMTP-ALG . For example , the SMTP-ALG could block images inserted as ' inline ' with an error message indicating base64 decoding error . The recipient received the email without the attached image but an error message saying : " The attachment xxxx has been blocked by the Security Gateway " . The ALG has been updated with better support for nested MIME blocks.14 . A user logging in via Web based user Authentication , when configured to handle user credentials via one or several RADIUS servers , it could cause an unexpected abort if no RADIUS server was reachable . This issue has been fixed.15 . The web user interface , the properties in " Dynamic Black Listing " were incorrectly enabled when action was set to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for removing IKE SA was missing , hence making it impossible to remove an IKE SA using the web user interface.n++17 . DNS Blacklist CLI command showed wrong status of blacklist servers on inactive HA member . Inactive HA member does not perform any anti-spam inspection so the inactive node is unaware of the status of the blacklist servers.18 . Email attachments with very long file names could cause memory corruption in the SMTP-ALG.19 . Log string sent to syslog receivers was not always correctly formatted . Some log arguments were not separated by a whitespace , resulting in invalid parsing by syslog receivers.20 . When restarting an interface on the DFL-1600 or DFL-2500 , there has been a theoretical possibility of memory corruption . This issue has been fixed from F/W v2.20.02 and later.21 . Connections were , under certain circumstances , incorrectly dropped by the IDP scanning engine when audit mode was used.22 . After IPSec tunnels were modified , the reconfiguration of the gateway was not done correctly . The result was that the gateway could go into unexpected abort state.23 . A configured external log receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreachable packets to the firewall . These packets would trigger new log messages resulting in high CPU utilization . Logging is now connection-based and the sending rate of log messages will be decreased by the firewall when it receives ICMP destination unreachable packets regarding log receiver connections.24 . TCP connections with SYN relay were not synchronized correctly . In case of HA failover , traffic on these connections would freeze.25 . Unnecessary DynDNS and HTTP-Poster re-posts were triggered during reconfigure . This is now avoided by always considering if the local interface IP address has been changed or if the HTTP-Poster/DynDNS configuration has been changed.26 . Some H.323 messages were incorrectly disallowed by the ALG . The H.323 Status Enquiry message is now allowed to be forwarded through the H.323-ALG.27 . The Fail Mode setting in the HTTP-ALG was not honored by the Dynamic Web Content Filtering.28 . The log message for expired or no valid Web Content Filtering license did only show up once . There is now a log message generated once a one minute . This should be more noticeable to the administrator.29 . The SMTP-ALG could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track of SMTP state synchronization . The SMTP-ALG has been updated with improved state tracking and email syntax validation.30 . It was not possible to configure the primary NBNS server for L2TP/PPTP server interfaces in the web user interface.31 . The TCP monitoring of Server Load Balancing did not increase TCP sequence number in the reset packet sent to server in case of connection timeout . The sequence number is now increased by one.32 . Server Load Balancing did not use All-To-One for port numbers . When using a range on the service , the destination port would be the specified port plus the offset from the low port number in the service.33 . One of the log messages had an incorrect format . When the log message was placed first in the log table , the web user interface memlog would display an empty page.34 . The description text for IP Pools incorrectly specified that IP Pools could be used by L2TP and PPTP.35 . A confusing Anti-Virus status message was visible in status page on non UTM capable devices . The message has been removed.Known Issues:1 . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to manually configure interface speed , since IXP4NPE driver only allows auto/auto configuration .
