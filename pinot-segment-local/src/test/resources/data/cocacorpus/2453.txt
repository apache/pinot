But his observation about the racist effects of minimum wage laws can be traced back to the nineteenth century , and they continue to have a disproportionately deleterious effect on African-Americans into the present day . <p> The earliest of such laws were regulations passed in regards to the railroad industry . At the end of the nineteenth century , as Dr. Walter Williams points out , " On some railroads " most notably in the South " blacks were 85 " 90 percent of the firemen , 27 percent of the brakemen , and 12 percent of the switchmen.

In 1909 , a compromise was offered : a minimum wage , which was to be imposed equally on all races . <p> To the pro-minimum wage advocate , this may superficially seem like an anti-racist policy . During this time , with racism still rampant throughout the United States , blacks were only able to enjoy such high levels of employment by accepting lower wages than their white counterparts . These wage-gaps at the time genuinely were the product of racist sentiment . <p> But this new wage rule , of course , did not eliminate the racism of nineteenth-century employers . Instead , it displaced their racism at the expense of black workers . One white union member at the time celebrated the new rule for removing " the incentive for employing the Negro . " 2- This early minimum wage rule was explicitly put in place to prevent African-Americans from finding employment , and it was successful in this goal . <p> In the 1930s , racial views had hardly improved , if at all . Despite this , the unemployment rate among blacks was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this was due to their willingness to accept lower wages than whites . But as infuriating as the employer racism at the time might be , the 1930s wage laws should incite even more anger . <p> In 1931 , Congress passed the Davis-Bacon Act , requiring uniform wages for any workers employed in federally funded public works projects . In 1933 , the National Industrial Recovery Act was signed into law , mandating industry-specific wages throughout the economy . In 1938 , the Fair Labor Standards Act " the only one of the three to remain permanently on the books " took effect , initially imposing a federal minimum wage for any worker engaged in interstate commerce . <p> All of these laws served to price African-Americans out of the job market . Rather than forcing employers to pay non-racist wages , it simply forced blacks to shift from suffering race-motivated wages to suffering race-motivated unemployment . <p> The industries that were not governed by minimum wage laws demonstrate the markets propensity to raise the relative income of discriminated people . In the 1920s , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the 1940s , Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball , despite the racism in professional sports . Meanwhile , blacks in civilian and government jobs were being pushed out of their industries by wage floors . <p> By the 1960s , many African-Americans were employed as farmers " at least partly due to this being one of the few remaining fields of work that was not yet subject to wage regulations . This changed in 1967 , when the government extended the minimum wage laws to American farmers as part of the " War on Poverty . " Black farmers who were accustomed to making a modest $3.50 per day were now legally required to be paid $1.00 per hour " a tremendous increase in wages . <p> The effect of this law was immediate and undeniable . An estimated 25,000 farm workers were put out of work in the Mississippi Delta region alone.4- Black farmers were not oblivious to the cause-and-effect at play . " That dollar an hour ai n't  worth nothing , " said the wife of one day-laborer . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a day if you work every day . " 5- Fifty cents per day , of course , was a lower wage than what her husband would have been earning prior to the law . Her point was clear : the federal minimum wage destroyed their ability to earn a living . <p> Instead of raising the wages of the predominantly-black farmers , the new law sped-up the move toward mechanization and ushered in the use of chemical weed killers instead of the previously more economical human weed pullers . Meanwhile , black migration out of these farmlands occurred by the thousands ; the- New York Times- in 1968 called it the " Negro Exodus . " <p> Whatever your feelings on the status of racism in America today , it is difficult to argue that the United States is actually- more- racist than it was during the Jim Crow era .

John ColemanFrom:Conspirators Hierachy : The Story of The Committee of 300 <p> 1 . To establish a One World Government/New World Order with a unified church and monetary system under their direction . The One World Government began to set up its church in the 1920:s and 30:s , for they realized the need for a religious belief inherent in mankind must have an outlet and , therefore , set up a " church " body to channel that belief in the direction they desired . <p> 2 . To bring about the utter destruction of all national identity and national pride , which was a primary consideration if the concept of a One World Government was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the destruction of religion , and more especially , the Christian Religion , with the one exception , their own creation , as mentioned above . <p> 4 . To establish the ability to control of each and every person through means of mind control and what Zbignew Brzezinski called techonotronics , which would create human-like robots and a system of terror which would make Felix Dzerzinhskis Red Terror look like children at play . <p> 5 . To bring about the end to all industrialization and the production of nuclear generated electric power in what they call " the post-industrial zero-growth society " . Excepted are the computer- and service industries . US industries that remain will be exported to countries such as Mexico where abundant slave labor is available . As we saw in 1993 , this has become a fact through the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement , known as NAFTA . Unemployables in the US , in the wake of industrial destruction , will either become opium-heroin and/or cocaine addicts , or become statistics in the elimination of the " excess population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 6 . To encourage , and eventually legalize the use of drugs and make pornography an " art-form " , which will be widely accepted and , eventually , become quite commonplace . <p> 7 . To bring about depopulation of large cities according to the trial run carried out by the Pol Pot regime in Cambodia . It is interesting to note that Pol Pots genocidal plans were drawn up in the US by one of the Club of Romes research foundations , and overseen by Thomas Enders , a high-ranking State Department official . It is also interesting that the committee is currently seeking to reinstate the Pol Pot butchers in Cambodia . <p> 8 . To suppress all scientific development except for those deemed beneficial by the Illuminati . Especially targeted is nuclear energy for peaceful purposes . Particularly hated are the fusion experiments currently being scorned and ridiculed by the Illuminati and its jackals of the press . Development of the fusion torch would blow the Illuminatis conception of " limited natural resources " right out of the window . A fusion torch , properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources , even from the most ordinary substances . Fusion torch uses are legion , and would benefit mankind in a manner which , as yet , is not even remotely comprehended by the public . <p> 9 . To cause . by means of limited wars in the advanced countries , by means of starvation and diseases in the Third World countries , the death of three billion people by the year 2050 , people they call " useless eaters " . The Committee of 300 ( Illuminati ) commissioned Cyrus Vance to write a paper on this subject of how to bring about such genocide . The paper was produced under the title " Global 2000 Report " and was accepted and approved for action by former President James Earl Carter , and Edwin Muskie , then Secretary of States , for and on behalf of the US Government . Under the terms of the Global 2000 Report , the population of the US is to be reduced by 100 million by the year of 2050 . <p> 10 . To weaken the moral fiber of the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass unemployment . As jobs dwindle due to the post industrial zero growth policies introduced by the Club of Rome , the report envisages demoralized and discouraged workers resorting to alcohol and drugs . The youth of the land will be encouraged by means of rock music and drugs to rebel against the status quo , thus undermining and eventually destroying the family unit . In this regard , the Committee commissioned Tavistock Institute to prepare a blueprint as to how this could be achieved . Tavistock directed Stanford Research to undertake the work under the direction of Professor Willis Harmon . This work later became known as the " Aquarian Conspiracy " . <p> 11 . To keep people everywhere from deciding their own destinies by means of one created crisis after another and then " managing " such crises . This will confuse and demoralize the population to the extent where faced with too many choices , apathy on a massive scale will result . In the case of the US , an agency for Crisis Management is already in place . It is called the Federal Emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosed in 1980 . <p> 12 . To introduce new cults and continue to boost those already functioning which include rock music gangsters such as the Rolling Stones ( a gangster group much favored by European Black Nobility ) , and all of the Tavistock-created rock groups which began with the Beatles . <p> 13 . To continue to build up the cult of Christian Fundamentalism begun by the British East India Companys servant Darby , which will be misused to strengthen the Zionist State of Israel by identifying with the Jews through the myth of " Gods chosen people " , and by donating very substantial amounts of money to what they mistakenly believe is a religious cause in the furtherance of Christianity . <p> 14 . To press for the spread of religious cults such as the Moslem Brotherhood , Moslem Fundamentalism , the Sikhs , and to carry out mind control experiments of the Jim Jones and " Son of Sam " type . It is worth noting that the late Khomeini was a creation of British Military Intelligence Div. 6 , MI6 . This detailed work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put Khomeini in power . <p> 15 . To export " religious liberation " ideas around the world so as to undermine all existing religions , but more especially the Christian religion . This began with the " Jesuit Liberation Theology " , that brought an end to the Somoza Family rule in Nicaragua , and which today is destroying El Salvador , now 25 years into a " civil war " . Costa Rica and Honduras are also embroiled in revolutionary activities , instigated by the Jesuits . One very active entity engaged in the so-called liberation theology , is the Communist-oriented Mary Knoll Mission . This accounts for the extensive media attention to the murder of four of Mary Knolls so-called nuns in El Salvador a few years ago . The four nuns were Communist subversive agents and their activities were widely documented by the Government of El Salvador . The US press and the new media refused to give any space or coverage to the mass of documentation possessed by the Salvadorian Government , which proved what the Mary Knoll Mission nuns were doing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and placed a leading role in bringing Communism to Rhodesia , Mo+ambique , Angola and South Africa . <p> 16 . To cause a total collapse of the worlds economies and engender total political chaos . <p> 17 . To take control of all foreign and domestic policies of the US . <p> 18 . To give the fullest support to supranational institutions such as the United Nations , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the Bank of International Settlements , the World Court and , as far as possible , make local institutions less effective , by gradually phasing them out or bringing them under the mantle of the UN . <p> 19 . To penetrate and subvert all governments , and work from within them to destroy the sovereign integrity of the nations represented by them . <p> 20 . To organize a world-wide terrorist apparatus and to negotiate with terrorists whenever terrorist activities take place . It will be recalled that it was Bettino Craxi , who persuaded the Italian and US Governments to negotiate with the Red Brigades kidnapers of Prime Minister Moro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed under strict orders not to talk what happened to him .

Epstein , a law professor at New York University School of Law , wrote , " Upsetting this fixed hierarchy among creditors is just an illegal taking of property from one group of creditors for the benefit of another , which should be struck down on both statutory and constitutional grounds . " Todd Zywicki , Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law , wrote that Obamas treatment of secured creditors was " dangerous to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions could " establish a terrible precedent . Bankruptcy exists to sort legal claims on assets . If it becomes a tool of social policy , who will then lend to struggling firms in which the government has a political interest ? " Francis Cianfrocca , the CEO of Bayshore Networks , wrote that Obamas actions were " an astonishingly reckless abrogation of contract law that will introduce a new level of uncertainty into business transactions at all levels , and make wealth generation more difficult going forward An extraordinary uncertainty has been created when the most powerful man in the world can rewrite contracts and choose winners and losers in private negotiations as he sees fit . Since this is an unquantifiable uncertainty , and not a quantifiable risk , its effect on business and investor confidence will be large and unpredictable . As in the 1930s , a time when government also cavalierly rewrote private contracts , the prudent approach for business will be to invest minimally and wait for another administration . " <p> In Operation Fast and Furious , the Obama administration ordered gun storeowners to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Fired Inspector General for discovering that Obamas friend had embezzled government funds <p> In June 2009 , Obama fired Inspector General Gerald Walpin , after Walpin accused Sacramento mayor Kevin Johnson , an Obama supporter , of misuse of AmeriCorps funding to pay for school-board political activities . In a letter to Congress , the White House said that Walpin was fired because he was " confused , disoriented , unable to answer questions and exhibited other behavior that led the Board to question his capacity to serve . " A bipartisan group of 145 current and former public officials , attorneys , and legal scholars signed a letter that was sent to the White House , which defended Walpin , said the criticisms of him were not true , and said that his firing was politically motivated . The letter can be read here . <p> 22 ) Lied about putting health care negotiations on C-SPAN <p> Although Obama had made a campaign promise to have all of the health care reform negotiations broadcast on C-SPAN , he broke that promise after he was elected . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D-California ) said , " We have to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it . " <p> " No matter how we reform health care , we will keep this promise to the American people If you like your health care plan , you 'll be able to keep your health care plan , period . No one will take it away , no matter what . " <p> " Here is a guarantee that I 've made . If you have insurance that you like , then you will be able to keep that insurance . " <p> However , after Obamacare was passed , the Congressional Budget Office said that the law would cause seven million people to lose their employer provided insurance . <p> After Obamacare was passed , 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East announced that it would drop health insurance for the children of more than 30,000 low-wage home attendants . Mitra Behroozi , executive director of benefit and pension funds for 1199SEIU stated <p> " new federal health-care reform legislation requires plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 meeting this new requirement would be financially impossible . " <p> Also , after Obamacare was passed , the Franciscan University of Steubenville dropped its coverage in response to the law . <p> Universal Orlando dropped its coverage for part time employees in response to Obamacare . <p> " The Affordable Care Act mandate most commonly known as Obamacare has some tight stipulations that , CNN says , are forcing health care companies to rip up most of their current plans and draft new ones that comply . According to a University of Chicago study , just about half of the individual health care plans currently on the market wont cut it once key provisions of the Affordable Care Act kick in next year . " <p> Furthermore , it was reported that Obamacare would cause 58,000 Aetna and UnitedHealth Group customers in California to lose their insurance . <p> In response to Obamacare , some employers have dropped coverage for their employees spouses . <p> The chain of Wegmans supermarkets cancelled the policies of its part time employees in response to Obamacare . <p> In July 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi which said that Obamacare <p> " will shatter not only our hard-earned health benefits these restrictions will make non-profit plans like ours unsustainable we can no longer stand silent in the face of elements of the Affordable Care Act that will destroy the very health and wellbeing of our members along with millions of other hardworking Americans " <p> " I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits " either now or in the future . I will not sign it if it adds one dime to the deficit , now or in the future , period . And to prove that I 'm serious , there will be a provision in this plan that requires us to come forward with more spending cuts if the savings we promised do n't  materialize . " <p> However , after Obama signed it , the Washington Post reported that it would add more than $340 billion to the budget deficit over the next decade . <p> In March 2012 , the Congressional Budget Office said that over the next decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had promised . <p> In May 2013 , it was reported that Obamacares program for high risk patients was more expensive than what Obama had promised . <p> 25 ) Gave tax dollars to campaign contributors and lobbyists , and falsely claimed the money was for " green energy " <p> In 2009 the Obama administration gave $535 million to Solyndra , claiming that it would create 4,000 new jobs . However , instead of creating those 4,000 new jobs , the company went bankrupt . It was later revealed that the companys shareholders and executives had made substantial donations to Obamas campaign , that the company had spent a large sum of money onlobbying , and that Solyndra executives had had many meetings with White House officials . <p> It was also revealed that the Obama administration had already been aware of Solyndras financial troubles . For example , according to the companys security filings in 2009 , the company had been selling its product for less than the cost of production . In 2010 , Obama visited the Solyndra factory and cited it as a role model for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Solyndra are leading the way toward a brighter and more prosperous future . " The Washington Post wrote of this , " Administration officials and outside advisers warned that President Obama should consider dropping plans to visit a solar startup company in 2010 because its mounting financial problems might ultimately embarrass the White House . " Solyndra was a private company , but had been planning to use its government loans as a means of going public " so when Obama knowingly overstated the companys condition in order to help his friends at Solyndra , he broke the same law that Martha Stewart had been sent to prison for breaking . <p> In September 2011 , federal agents visited the homes of Brian Harrison , the companys CEO , and Chris Gronet , the companys founder , to examine computer files and documents . Also in September 2011 , the U.S. Treasury Department launched an investigation . <p> On September 13 , 2011 , the Washington Post reported on emails which showed that the Obama administration had tried to rush federal reviewers to approve the loan so Vice President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the companys factory . The company was a hallmark of President Obamas plan to support clean energy technologies . <p> The New York Times reported that government auditors and industry analysts had faulted the Obama administration for failing to properly evaluate the companys business proposals , as well as for failing to take note of troubling signs which were already evident . In addition , Frank Rusco , a program director at the Government Accountability Office , had found that the preliminary loan approval had been granted before officials had completed the legally mandated evaluations of the company . <p> The New York Times quoted Shyam Mehta , a senior analyst at GTM Research , as saying " There was just too much misplaced zeal at the Department of Energy for this company . " Among 143 companies that had expressed an interest in getting a loan guarantee , Solyndra was the first one to get approval . During the period when Solyndras loan guarantee was under review , the company had spent nearly $1.8 million on lobbying . Tim Harris , the CEO of Solopower , a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee , told the New York Times that his company had never considered spending any money on lobbying , and that " It was made clear to us early in the process that that was clearly verboten We were told that it was not only not helpful but it was not acceptable . " <p> The Washington Post reported that Solyndra had used some of the loan money to purchase new equipment which it never used , and then sold that new equipment , still in its plastic wrap , for pennies on the dollar . Former Solyndra engineer Lindsey Eastburn told the Washington Post , " After we got the loan guarantee , they were just spending money left and right Because we were doing well , nobody cared . Because of that infusion of money , it made people sloppy . " <p> On September 29 , 2011 , the Washington Post reported that the Obama administration had continued to allow Solyndra to receive taxpayer money even after it had defaulted on its $535 million loan . <p> On October 7 , 2011 , The Washington Post reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been warned that their plan to help Solyndra by restructuring the loan might be illegal , and should be cleared with the Justice Department first . However , Energy Department officials moved ahead with the restructuring anyway , with a new deal that would repay company investors before taxpayers if the company were to default . The emails showed concerns within the Obama administration about the legality of the Energy Departments actions . In addition , an Energy Department stimulus adviser , Steve Spinner , had pushed for the loan , despite having recused himself because his wifes law firm had done work for the company . <p> In January 2012 , CBS News reported that Solyndra had thrown millions of dollars worth of brand new glass tubes into garbage dumpsters , where they ended up being shattered . Solyndra told CBS that it had conducted an exhaustive search for buyers of the glass tubes , and that no one had wanted them . However , CBS discovered that Solyndra had not offered the glass tubes for sale at either one of its two asset auctions that took place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seller of such equipment , told CBS that he would have bought the tubes if he had had a chance to do so . Greg Smestad , a solar scientist who had consulted for the Department of Energy , also agreed that the tubes had value , and had asked Solyndra to donate any unwanted tubes to Santa Clara University . Smestad stated , " That really makes me sad Those tubes represent intellectual investment . These could have had a better value to do public good . I think they owed the U.S. taxpayer that . " <p> In April 2012 , CBS News reported that Solyndra had left a substantial amount of toxic waste at its abandoned facility in Milpitas , California . <p> Solyndra was not the only " green energy " company involved in this type of fraud . After Obama gave Raser Technologies $33 million to build a power plant , the company declared bankruptcy , and owed $1.5 million in back taxes . After Obama gave Abound Solar , Inc. a $400 million loan guarantee to build photovoltaic panel factories , the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Beacon Power a $43 million loan guarantee to build green energy storage , the company filed for bankruptcy . After Obama approved $2.1 billion in loan guarantees for Solar Trust of America so it could build solar power plants , the company filed for bankruptcy . <p> Although Obama stated that all of the " green energy " companies that received taxpayer money were chosen " based solely on their merits , " the truth is that 71% of these grants and loans went to Obama donors and fundraisers , who raised $457,834 for his campaign , and were later approved for grants and loans totaling more than $11 billion . By November 2011 , the Energy Departments inspector general had begun more than 100 criminal investigations related to Obamas stimulus . Although an " independent " review said that Obama had not done anything wrong , it was later reported that Herbert M. Allison Jr. , the person who had conducted this " independent " review , donated $52,500 to Obamas campaign . <p> 26 ) Had " off the record " meetings with lobbyists <p> In June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials had held hundreds of meetings with lobbyists at coffee houses near the White House , in order to avoid the disclosure requirements for White House visitors , and that these meetings " reveal a disconnect between the Obama administrations public rhetoric " with Mr. Obama himself frequently thrashing big industries battalions of lobbyists as enemies of reform " and the administrations continuing , private dealings with them . " <p> 27 ) Falsely claimed to believe in public education <p> Although Obama said , " We need to uphold the ideal of public education , " he expressed his true opinion of Americas public education system by sendinghis own children to private schools while living in Chicago and Washington D.C. <p> 28 ) Had armed SWAT agents raid a law-abiding guitar factory because it was owned by a Republican <p> President Obama had armedSWAT agents raid the Gibson guitar factory , ordered the employees to leave , and seized guitars and other property from the factory " and all of this happened without any charges being filed . <p> Obamas so-called justification for the raid was that Gibson had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibson had been using . <p> However , Gibson claimed that it had not broken any Indian laws " and no charges were filed against it . <p> In addition , it was also reported that Henry E. Juszkiewicz , the CEO of Gibson , was a Republican donor . <p> Meanwhile , C.F. Martin &amp; Company , Gibsonss competitor , had used the exact same imported wood , but had not gotten raided . Chris Martin IV , the CEO of Martin , was a Democratic donor . <p> 29 ) Shut down Amish farm <p> In February 2012 , Obama shut down an Amish farm for selling unpasteurized milk across state lines , even though the customers were happy with what they were buying . <p> 30 ) Rewarded his fundraisers by giving them federal jobs <p> Although Obama had promised to have " the most sweeping ethics reform in history , " and had often criticized the role of money in politics , the truth is that after he was elected , he gave administration jobs to more than half of his 47 biggest fundraisers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2009 , U.S. Senator Robert Byrd ( D-West Virginia ) expressed concern that Obamas dozens of czars might violate the U.S. Constitution , because they were not approved by the U.S. Senate . U.S. Senator Russ Feingold ( D-Wisconsin ) expressed a similar concern in September 2009 . <p> 32 ) Gave tax dollars to corrupt private contractors <p> While Obama was a state Senator in Illinois , he used tax dollars to build 504 units of slum housing , which had mice and backed up sewage . Federal inspectors graded the condition of the housing so bad that the buildings faced demolition . <p> 34 ) Falsely claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court had never overturned any laws that had been passed by Congress <p> Despite having taught constitutional law at one of the most prestigious law schools in the country , in April 2012 Obama falsely claimed that the U.S. Supreme Court had never overturned any laws that had been passed by Congress . <p> 35 ) Supported new bailouts for speculators who caused housing bubble <p> In March 2012 , Obama announced a new set of bailouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 ) Spent $205,075 of taxpayer money on a shrubbery which nurseries sell for $16 <p> As part of his economic stimulus , Obama spent $205,075 of taxpayer money to relocate and care for a single specimen of Arctostaphylos franciscana , a shrubbery which nurseries sell for $16 . <p> 37 ) Spent taxpayer money to see if using cocaine helped rats to enjoy the music of Miles Davis <p> Obamas administration funded a study to see whether or not rats enjoyment of the music of Miles Davis was increased when the rats were high on cocaine . <p> 38 ) Tried to outlaw family farms <p> In April 2012 , the Obama administration proposed new regulations which would prohibit farm children under 18 from working at grain elevators , silos , feed lots , stockyards , and livestock auctions , as well as from storing , marketing and transporting farm product raw materials . Critics claimed that this would prevent children from the common practice of working on their friends and relatives farms , and that farm children did not need " help " from a community organizer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands <p> In April 2012 , Obama nominated Timothy Broas , who had " bundled " more than $500,000 for Obamas 2012 campaign , to be U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands . <p> 40 ) Claimed that written tests are a form of " racial discrimination " <p> The Obama administration accused fire and police departments in Jacksonville , Florida , New York City , and Dayton , Ohio of " racial discrimination " because they required potential firefighters and police officers to take a written test . Ten real examples of these " racist " questions from the New York test can be read here . <p> 41 ) Made the TSA even more abusive and ridiculous than it had been under Bush <p> The Obama administration gave a very invasive patdown to a three-year-old boy in a wheelchair , which caused the boy to tremble in fear . The Obama administration gave an aggressive patdown to a seven-year-old girl with cerebral palsy . The Obama administration said that a four-year-old girl was a " high security threat . " The Obama administration placed an 18-month-old girl on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Henry Kissinger . The Obama administration forced a 95-year-old cancer patient to remove her adult diaper and fly without it . The Obama administration ripped open the urostomy bag of a 61-year-old bladder cancer survivor , and forced him to fly covered in his own urine . <p> The Obama administration demanded that the Goldwater Institute pay$78,935.80 before it would share public records which it had requested under the Freedom of Information Act . <p> 43 ) Fined public school $15,000 for selling soda <p> The Obama administration fined a high school $15,000 for selling soda to students during lunch . <p> 44 ) Conducted dangerous and illegal scientific experiments on people <p> From January 2010 through June 2011 , the Obama administration conducted illegal scientific experiments which exposed 42 people to dangerous levels of toxins . <p> 45 ) Gave middle finger to Vietnam veterans , their families , and their friends <p> On Memorial Day 2012 , Obama prevented Vietnam veterans and their friends and families from visiting the Vietnam memorial for seven hours , so Obama could have his picture taken . <p> 46 ) Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 2009 , Obama had the government take 60.8% ownership of General Motors , and fired the CEO . <p> 47 ) Forced banks to give mortgages to people who could not afford to pay them back <p> While working as a " community organizer , " Obama filed lawsuits which forced banks to give mortgages to people with bad credit and low incomes . As a result , many of these people ended up defaulting on their mortgages . As their attorney , Obama collected $23,000 in legal fees for himself . <p> Then in April 2013 , during Obamas second term as President , the Washington Post reported that President Obama was still pressuring banks " to make home loans to people with weaker credit . " <p> During Obamas presidency , the federal government repeatedly purchased soda for a cost of $3.40 per can . Obama did not express any desire to switch to a cheaper seller , such as Costco , amazon.com , or Wal-Mart " or to an even still cheaper seller such as a wholesaler . Instead , Obama repeatedly forced taxpayers to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitt Romney for his involvement with Bain Capital , Obama hired Jeff Zients , a former consultant at Bain ( and who had an estimated personal wealth of $200 million ) to be his budget director . <p> 52 ) Broke promise to teen campaign volunteers <p> Obama had promised to his teen campaign volunteers that if they each spent nine hours going door to door on Obamas behalf , he would invite them to attend his speech of September 6 , 2012 . However , after the teens did the volunteer work , Obama broke his promise . One of these volunteers , Madeline Frank , age 16 , of Charlotte , North Carolina , said of this " Ive been looking forward to this for a really long time . I am just feeling really let down and like bummed . It was kind of my dream to see him speak , so definitely really sad . " <p> 53 ) Falsely claimed to know more about Judaism than any other President <p> Obama falsely claimed to know more about Judaism than any other President . <p> 54 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers get for killing birds <p> The Obama administration has charged oil companies for drowning birds in their waste pits , and power companies for electrocuting birds on power lines . <p> But the administration has never fined or prosecuted a wind-energy company , even those that flout the law repeatedly . <p> " What it boils down to is this : If you electrocute an eagle , that is bad , but if you chop it to pieces , that is OK , " said Tim Eicher , a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service enforcement agent based in Cody . <p> More than 573,000 birds are killed by the countrys wind farms each year , including 83,000 hunting birds such as hawks , falcons and eagles , according to an estimate published in March in the peer-reviewed Wildlife Society Bulletin . <p> Nearly all the birds being killed are protected under federal environmental laws , which prosecutors have used to generate tens of millions of dollars in fines and settlements from businesses , including oil and gas companies , over the past five years . <p> Wind farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with spinning rotors as wide as a passenger jets wingspan . Though the blades appear to move slowly , they can reach speeds up to 170 mph at the tips , creating tornado-like vortexes . <p> Flying eagles behave like drivers texting on their cellphones ; they do n't  look up . As they scan for food , they do n't  notice the industrial turbine blades until its too late . <p> The rehabilitation coordinator for the Rocky Mountain Raptor Program , Michael Tincher , said he euthanized two golden eagles found starving and near death near wind farms . Both had injuries hed never seen before : One of their wings appeared to be twisted off . <p> " There is nothing in the evolution of eagles that would come near to describing a wind turbine . There has never been an opportunity to adapt to that sort of threat , " said Grainger Hunt , an eagle expert who researches the U.S. wind-power industrys deadliest location , a northern California area known as Altamont Pass . Wind farms built there decades ago kill more than 60 per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act , the death of a single bird without a permit is illegal . <p> But under the Obama administrations new guidelines , wind-energy companies " and only wind-energy companies " are held to a different standard . <p> Eagles take five years to reach the age when they can reproduce , and often they only produce one chick a year . <p> 55 ) Falsely claimed that he had never belonged to the New Party <p> Obama falsely claimed that he had never belonged to the New Party , which is a third political party . <p> 56 ) Supported punishing students based on their race instead of on their behavior <p> Obama expressed support for a proposal which would punish students based on their race instead of on their behavior . <p> 57 ) Used " off the books " funding for military interventionism <p> In April 2009 , antiwar activists who helped elect Obama accused him of using the same " off the books " funding as his predecessor George W. Bush when Obama requested an additional $83.4 billion from Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Obama had voted against when he was a Senator . <p> 58 ) Tried to silence criticism of auto-bailouts <p> The Obama administration pressured Ford Motor Company to stop airing a TV ad that criticized Obamas bailouts of General Motors and Chrysler . <p> 59 ) Dismissed charges of voter intimidation , despite video evidence <p> In May 2009 , the Obama administration dismissed charges that had been filed by the Bush administration against members of the New Black Panther Party who had been videotaped intimidating voters and brandishing a police-style baton at a Philadelphia polling station during the November 2008 election . In August 2009 , the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights demanded that the Justice Department explain why it dismissed the charges . In July 2010 , J. Christian Adams , a former lawyer for the Justice Department , testified before the Commission on Civil Rights that the case was dropped because the Justice Department did not want to protect the civil rights of white people . <p> 60 ) Falsely claimed to support the second amendment <p> Although Obama stated , " I have always believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear arms , " the National Rifle Association gave Obama a rating of F based on his voting record . <p> 61 ) Nominated a communist who said 9-11 was an inside job <p> In September 2009 , Obamas green czar Van Jones resigned after it was reported that he was a self-described " communist " and had blamed George W. Bush for the September 11 attacks . <p> 62 ) Falsely said he would not raise taxes on the poor and middle class <p> On September 12 , 2008 , Obama promised , " I can make a firm pledge . Under my plan , no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase . Not your income tax , not your payroll tax , not your capital gains taxes , not any of your taxes . " However , less than three months into his Presidency , he broke that promise when he raised the cigarette tax . Studies show that poor people are more likely to smoke than rich people . <p> 63 ) Falsely said he wanted to simplify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex <p> Although Obama said that he wanted to simplify the tax code , his proposals would actually add thousands of pages to the tax code . <p> 64 ) Oversaw some of the worlds worst increases in corruption <p> In December 2010 , Transparency International reported that corruption was increasing faster in the U.S. than anywhere else except Cuba , Dominica , and Burkina Faso . <p> 65 ) Falsely said " This is the most transparent administration in history . " <p> In February 2013 , Obama said , " This is the most transparent administration in history " <p> However , that same month , ABC News White House reporter Ann Compton , who covered Presidents Ford , Carter , Reagan , Clinton , both Bushes , and Obama , said " The presidents day-to-day policy development is almost totally opaque to the reporters trying to do a responsible job of covering it . There are no readouts from big meetings he has with people from the outside , and many of them are n't  even on his schedule . This is different from every president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the press away . " <p> In July 2009 , White House reporter Helen Thomas criticized the Obama administration for its lack of transparency . <p> Also , this list contains a huge number of things that Obama has done which contradict his statement . <p> 66 ) Falsely claimed he would wait five days before signing bills <p> Although Obama had promised to wait five days before signing all non-emergency bills , he broke that promise at least 10 times during his first three months in office . <p> 67 ) Falsely claimed stimulus spending would be transparent <p> Although Obama had promised that the website recovery.gov would list all stimulus spending in detail , a 400 page report issued by the Government Accountability Office stated that only 25% of the projects listed on the website provided clear and complete information regarding their cost , schedule , purpose , location and status . <p> 68 ) Announced plans to send military to Australia <p> In November 2011 , Obama announced that he would send 2,500 Marines to Australia . <p> During the 2008 campaign , Obama broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits that came with it . <p> 70 ) Tried to silence video on YouTube <p> In June 2011 , Obama asked a Jewish singing group to remove its video from the internet . <p> 71 ) Rejected international help to clean up BP oil spill <p> After the BP oil spill , Obama rejected offers of cleanup help from Canada , Croatia , France , Germany , Ireland , Mexico , the Netherlands , Norway , Romania , South Korea , Spain , Sweden , the United Kingdom , and the United Nations . <p> 72 ) Falsely said he opposed government waste , when he actually loves it <p> On September 22 , 2008 , Obama said , " I am not a Democrat who believes that we can or should defend every government program just because its there We will fire government managers who are n't  getting results , we will cut funding for programs that are wasting your money and we will use technology and lessons from the private sector to improve efficiency across every level of government The only way we can do all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Washington starts taking responsibility for every dime that it spends . " However , Citizens Against Government Waste gave Obama a 2007 rating of only 10% , and a lifetime rating of only 18% . <p> In September 2009 , it was reported that Kevin Jennings , Obamas Assistant Deputy Secretary for the Office of Safe and Drug-Free Schools , had written about Jennings own past frequent illegal drug use in his 2007 autobiography . <p> 74 ) Avoids firing aides who owe back taxes <p> In January 2012 , it was reported that 36 Obama aides owed a combined total of $833,000 in back taxes . <p> 75 ) Used Abbott and Costello style economics as a basis for national policy <p> In 2010 , Obama gave $16.3 million to First Solar , a company that manufactures solar panels , so the company could sell solar panels to itself . <p> 76 ) Sent U.S. troops to Africa <p> Obama sent U.S. troops to Uganda , Congo , South Sudan and the Central African Republic . <p> 77 ) Made secret plans for his second term <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dmitri Medvedev and did not know that the microphone was turned on , Obama stated , " On all these issues , but particularly missile defense , this , this can be solved but its important for him to give me space This is my last election . After my election I have more flexibility . " <p> 78 ) Holds double standard for people who use crude and vulgar language toward women <p> Concerned Women for America accused Obama of hypocrisy after Obama criticized Rush Limbaugh for using crude and vulgar language to describe Sandra Fluke , but Obama did not criticize Bill Maher ( who had donated one million dollars to an Obama PAC ) for using the same kind of crude and vulgar language to describe Sarah Palin . <p> 79 ) Illegally gave Obamacare exemptions to unions that supported the passage of Obamacare <p> Obama gave some organizations an exemption from some of the requirements of Obamacare . Many of these organizations were unions that had supported the passage of Obamacare , but now wanted exemptions from the very same law that they wanted to force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hypocrisy among many of the supporters of Obamacare . <p> In addition , these exemptions are illegal , because the Constitution requires the law to treat everyone the same . <p> " Selective enforcement of the law is the first sign of tyranny . A government empowered to determine arbitrarily who may operate outside the rule of law invariably embraces favoritism as friends , allies and those with the best-funded lobbyists are rewarded . Favoritism inevitably leads to corruption , and corruption invites extortion . Ultimately , the rule of law ceases to exist in any recognizable form , and what is left is tyranny . " <p> " The now-familiar monthly trickling down of new waivers is , at best , a tacit admission that Obamacare is a failure . So far , seven entire states and 1,372 businesses , unions and other institutions have received waivers from the law . The list includes the administrations friends and allies and , of course , those who have the best lobbyists . " <p> " More than 50 percent of the Obamacare waiver beneficiaries are union members , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the American work force .

Because the program required cars to be shredded instead of recycled , it wasted 24 million barrels of oil . Many of the cars that were destroyed were in perfectly good condition . Because the programs minimum requirement for so-called " fuel efficiency " was only 22 mpg , the reduction in pollution was negligible . <p> 102 ) Violated the very same campaign finance laws that he claims to support <p> In January 2013 , it was reported that Obamas campaign had been fined $375,000 by the Federal Election Commission for violating campaign finance laws . <p> 103 ) Lied about how he had answered a questionnaire on gun control <p> In 1996 , when Obama was answering a questionnaire on his political views , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to : ban the manufacture , sale and possession of handguns ?

" <p> Eva Galperin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation said of this , " I am actually kind of distressed by this Even though there are all these great quotes from inside the White House saying they support free speech.by calling YouTube from the White House , they were sending a message no matter how much they say we do n't  want them to take it down , when the White House calls and asks you to review it , it sends a message and has a certain chilling effect . " <p> 125 ) Falsely said that Fast and Furious was started when Bush was President <p> In September 2012 , Obama said that Fast and Furious had " begun under the previous administration .

He then blamed this on Republicans , even though both the House and Senate were controlled by Democrats during Obamas first year . <p> 136 ) Made it much harder for startups to raise capital and create jobs <p> In July 2010 , Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act . The Wall St. Journal wrote of this : <p> " Senator Chris Dodds 1,400-page financial reform bill contains many economic land mines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it harder for business start-ups to raise seed capital . " <p> " Currently , wealthy individuals who want to invest directly in a new business can do so with minimum interference from regulators . The law requires only that the investor be " accredited " by meeting thresholds for net worth ( $1 million ) or income ( $250,000 ) . Entrepreneurs depend on these " angel " investors , since many new businesses lack the collateral for bank loans and are too small to interest venture capitalists . " <p> " Amazon , Yahoo , Google and Facebook all benefited from angel investors , who typically target companies under five years old . According to a 2009 Kaufman Foundation study , such firms are less than 1% of all companies yet generate about 10% of new jobs . Between 1980 and 2005 , companies less than five years old accounted for all net job growth in the U.S. In 2008 , angels invested some $19 billion in more than 55,000 companies . " <p> " Mr. Dodds bill would change all this for the worse . Most preposterously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Securities and Exchange Commission and endure a 120-day review . Rare is the new company that does n't  need immediate access to the capital it raises , and a four-month delay is the kind of rule popular in banana republics that create few new businesses . " <p> " The Dodd bill also raises the net worth and income thresholds to $2.3 million and $450,000 , respectively . The Angel Capital Association , a trade group , estimates that these provisions would disqualify about 77% of current accredited investors . " <p> 137 ) Paid six figure salaries to federal employees so they could watch pornography all day long <p> " On a day when President Obama argued for more government regulation over the financial industry , a new government report reveals that some high-level regulators have spent more time looking at porn than policing Wall Street .

But the new report , obtained by ABC News , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computers looking at sites like naughty.com , skankwire , youporn , and others . " <p> " The investigation , which was conducted by the SECs internal watchdog at the request of Sen. Chuck Grassley , R-Iowa , found 31 serious offenders over the past two and a half years .

That 's real . " <p> At the beginning of Obamas second term , he said that he goes skeet shooting " all the time . " However , a witness said that when he saw Obama go skeet shooting , Obama acted as if he had never fired a gun before , that he appeared to be uncomfortable with a gun , and that he only stayed for five minutes .

" <p> 155 ) Broke his own deadline for creating healthcare exchanges <p> Three years after Obama signed Obamacare , the New York Times reported that Obama would miss his own deadline for creating some of the insurance exchanges for small businesses . <p> 156 ) Falsely said that surgeons get paid between $30,000 and $50,000 for amputating a leg <p> In August 2009 , while trying to justify the passage of Obamacare , Obama stated <p> " Let 's take the example of something like diabetes , one of " a disease that 's skyrocketing , partly because of obesity , partly because its not treated as effectively as it could be . Right now if we paid a family " if a family care physician works with his or her patient to help them lose weight , modify diet , monitors whether they 're taking their medications in a timely fashion , they might get reimbursed a pittance . But if that same diabetic ends up getting their foot amputated , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reimbursed . Well , why not make sure that were also reimbursing the care that prevents the amputation , right ? That will save us money . " <p> " President Obama got his facts completely wrong . He stated that a surgeon gets paid $50,000 for a leg amputation when , in fact , Medicare pays a surgeon between $740 and $1,140 for a leg amputation . This payment also includes the evaluation of the patient on the day of the operation plus patient follow-up care that is provided for 90 days after the operation .

' " <p> " Now , that may be the right thing to do . But I 'd rather have that doctor making those decisions just based on whether you really need your kids tonsils out or whether it might make more sense just to change " maybe they have allergies . Maybe they have something else that would make a difference . " <p> The American Academy of Otolaryngology " Head and Neck Surgery responded by saying <p> " The AAO-HNS is disappointed by the Presidents portrayal of the decision making processes by the physicians who perform these surgeries . In many cases , tonsillectomy may be a more effective treatment , and less costly , than prolonged or repeated treatments for an infected throat . " <p> 158 ) Purchased 2,717 mine resistant armor protected vehicles for use on civilian streets in the U.S. <p> In March 2013 it was reported that the Obama administration had purchased 2,717 mine resistant armor protected vehicles for use on civilian streets in the U.S. <p> 159 ) Spends $277,050 per year for three professional calligraphists <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $277,050 of tax money per year for three professional calligraphists .

More than one in nine African-American adults there received checks . In Little Rock , Ark. , a confidential list of payments shows , 10 members of one extended family collected a total of $500,000 , and dozens of other successful claimants shared addresses , phone numbers or close family connections . <p> In Arkansas , prosecutors rejected a test case against a Pine Bluff police officer who had admitted lying on his claim form . <p> in one ZIP code in Columbus , Ohio , nearly everyone in two adjoining apartment buildings had filed , according to the former high-ranking agency official . <p> She cinched the claim , he said to a ripple of laughter , by asserting that her father had whispered on his deathbed , " I was discriminated against by U.S.D.A. " <p> 168 ) Tried to rig federal auctions of radio spectrum space <p> In April 2013 , it was reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of radio spectrum space in a manner that would favor Sprint and T-Mobile , and make it harder for AT&amp;T and Verizon . <p> " Nakoula Basseley Nakoula deserves a place in American history . He is the first person in this country jailed for violating Islamic anti-blasphemy laws . " <p> " You wo n't find that anywhere in the charges against him , of course . As a practical matter , though , everyone knows that Nakoula would n't be in jail today if he had n't  produced a video crudely lampooning the prophet Muhammad . " <p> " In the weeks after the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi that killed Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others , the Obama administration claimed the terrorist assault had been the outgrowth of a demonstration against the Nakoula video . The administration ran public service announcements in Pakistan featuring President Barack Obama saying the U.S. had nothing to do with it . In a speech at the United Nations around this time , the president declared " no doubt with Nakoula in mind " The future must not belong to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After Benghazi , the administration was evidently filled with a fierce resolve " to bring Nakoula Basseley Nakoula to justice . Charles Woods , the father of a Navy SEAL killed in Benghazi , said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told him when his sons body returned to Andrews Air Force Base : We will make sure that the person who made that film is arrested and prosecuted . ' " <p> " Lo and behold , Nakoula was brought in for questioning by five Los Angeles County sheriffs deputies at midnight , eventually arrested and held without bond , and finally thrown into jail for a year . He sits in La Tuna Federal Correctional Institution in Texas right now , even as the deceptive spin that blamed his video for the Benghazi attack looks more egregious by the day . " <p> In May 2013 , the Washington Post reported that the IRS had illegally targeted conservative groups for additional reviews . Organizations with the words " tea party " or " patriot " were singled out for harassment , such as requiring them to provide a list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking websites , and information about their family members . <p> When this was first reported by the media in May 2013 , Lois Lerner , who heads the IRS division that had conducted these illegal activities , claimed that only low level employees had known about it , and that no high level IRS officials had known about it . However , soon afterward , NPR reported that an Inspector General report showed that Lerner had been lying , and that she herself had actually been aware of it since June 29 , 2011 . Even worse , during March and April of 2012 , Lerner herself had actually written such letters to fifteen different conservative groups . One of these letters can be read here . <p> While testifying in May 2013 , Lerner said , " I have not done anything wrong . I have not broken any laws . I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations . And I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee . " However , afterward , she invoked her Fifth Amendment right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement as to whether or not Lerners statement constituted a waiving of her Fifth Amendment right to remain silent . Soon afterward , she was placed on paid administrative leave . <p> The Washington Post reported that IRS officials at the IRS headquarters in Washington D.C. had sent such letters to conservatives groups . Reuters reported that higher level IRS officials had taken part in discussions about it as early as August 2011 . However , 21 months later , on May 10 , 2013 , the Washington Post reported that President Obama had not done anything to investigate or fire the IRS employees who had engaged in this illegal harassment . As of May 14 , 2013 , none of the IRS employees who engaged in any of this illegal behavior had been disciplined , despite the fact that higher level IRS officials had known about their illegal behavior at least since August 2011 . <p> On May 15 , 2013 , it was reported that Steven Miller , the acting IRS commissioner , had resigned . However , it was also reported that his assignment would have ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fire him . <p> The IRS gave out confidential information about conservative groups . ProPublica wrote : <p> " The same IRS office that deliberately targeted conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status in the run-up to the 2012 election released nine pending confidential applications of conservative groups to ProPublica late last year . " <p> " In response to a request for the applications for 67 different nonprofits last November , the Cincinnati office of the IRS sent ProPublica applications or documentation for 31 groups . Nine of those applications had not yet been approved " meaning they were not supposed to be made public . " <p> " No unapproved applications from liberal groups were sent to ProPublica . " <p> President Obama either lied about when he first knew about this " or was too busy playing golf and attending fundraisers to read the memos that were sent to him . The Daily Caller wrote : <p> " White House press secretary Jay Carney said in a press conference Tuesday that the White House was notified about the IRS targeting tea party groups several weeks ago. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it from news reports on Friday of last week . " <p> " During a press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron on Monday , President Obama was asked about the IRS scandal . He responded , I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this . I think it was on Friday. " <p> " However , Carney said Tuesday that first a report had to be compiled by the IRSs inspector general and then when it was completed , it was passed on to the administration . " <p> " A notification is appropriate and routine and that is what happened and that happened several weeks ago , Carney said . " <p> When Media Trackers , a conservative organization , applied to the IRS for non-profit status , after waiting 16 months , it got no response . But when it reapplied with a liberal sounding name , it got approval in just three weeks . Yahoo wrote : <p> " In May 2011 , Drew Ryun , a conservative activist and former Republican National Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve nonprofit status for a new conservative watchdog group . " <p> " When September 2012 arrived with still no word from the IRS , Ryun determined that Media Trackers would likely never obtain standalone nonprofit status , and he tried a new approach : He applied for permanent nonprofit status for a separate group called Greenhouse Solutions , a pre-existing organization that was reaching the end of its determination period . " <p> " The same Internal Revenue Service office that singled out Tea Party groups for extra scrutiny also challenged Israel-related organizations , at least one of which filed suit over the agencys handling of its application for tax-exempt status . " <p> " The trouble for the Israel-focused groups seems to have had different origins than that experienced by conservative groups , but at times the effort seems to have been equally ham-handed . " <p> Although the IRS went 18 months or longer without responding to conservative organizations applications , the IRS demanded that these same organizations answer the IRSs intrusive questions within a few weeks . <p> After the Waco Tea Party sent an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to respond . In its response , the IRS asked for printouts of its web page and social networking sites , copies of all of its newsletters , bulletins and fliers , and copies of all stories written about it . The IRS also asked for transcripts of its radio interviews . <p> As one example of how the IRS treated conservative organizations differently from liberal ones , Politico reported : <p> " Chris Littleton , one of the co-founders of the Ohio Liberty Coalition , said the group got a grilling from the IRS when it submitted its application , in letters the group has posted on its website . The IRS also gave him so much grief when he tried to apply for tax-exempt status for another group , American Junto , that we just gave up on it , he said . " <p> " But when he submitted an application for a third group " Ohioans for Health Care Freedom , now renamed Ohio Rising " it went through just fine , Littleton said . They never asked a single set of questions . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their application , it took two years for the IRS to respond . The IRS response included 35 questions . When the groups cofounder called the IRS , the IRS agent claimed that he had their groups file right in front of him . But when the groups confounder asked the IRS agent a question , the IRS agent asked , " What 's your groups name again ? " <p> Tea Party groups who spoke with each other said they were all getting the same questions from the IRS . <p> The Washington Post reported that some IRS employees were " ignorant about tax laws , defiant of their supervisors , and blind to the appearance of impropriety . " <p> In 2012 , the IRS leaked confidential information about Mitt Romney to the co-chairman of President Obamas re-election committee . <p> For a 27 month period that began in February 2010 , the IRS gave exactly zero approvals to Tea Party organizations that had sent in applications . During that same time period , numerous liberal organizations with names including words such as " progress " or " progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a conservative organization which was founded by Catherine Engelbrecht , sent its application to the IRS , the IRS went three years without responding . During that three year period , Engelbrecht and her familys small manufacturing business were audited by the IRS , and were investigated by OSHA , the ATF , and the FBI . <p> Democratic U.S. Senators pressured the IRS to target conservative groups . In May 2013 , U.S. News &amp; World Report wrote : <p> " Over the last three years , Democratic senators repeatedly and publicly pressured the IRS to engage in the very activities that they are only now condemning today . At the same time , Republicans repeatedly and publicly warned against this abuse of government power and pointed to a series of red flags that strongly suggested conservative political organizations were being targeted by the IRS . Those warnings were deliberately ignored by the Obama administration and Democratic leaders in Congress . " <p> " From Max Baucus to Chuck Schumer to Jeanne Shaheen , key Senate Democrats publicly pressured the IRS to target groups that held differing political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temerity to engage in the political process . The IRS listened to them and acted . " <p> In order to get approval , the IRS required members of Coalition for Life of Iowa , a pro-life organization , to sign a promise to avoid protesting in front of Planned Parenthood . <p> The IRS asked Christian Voices for Life , a pro-life organization , questions about its prayer vigils . <p> According to the official White House visitors log , during Obamas first four years as President , IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman made 157 visits to the White House . This is more visits to the White House " by a very large margin " than any other cabinet member during Obamas first term . By comparison , during the four years that Mark Everson was IRS commissioner when Bush was president , Everson made only one visit to the White House . <p> Shulman donated $500 to the Democratic National Committee in October 2004 . <p> During Congressional testimony that had taken place in March 2012 , Shulman falsely said that the IRS had not targeted conservative groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senior program advisor for Public Campaign , a liberal organization . The Daily Caller wrote of this group : <p> Public Campaign receives " major funding " from the pro-Obamacare alliance Health Care for America NOW ! , which is comprised of the labor unions AFL-CIO , AFSCME , SEIU , and the progressive activist organization Move On , among others . <p> Public Campaign also receives funding from the liberal Ford Foundation , the Common Cause Education Fund , and Barbra Streisands The Streisand Foundation , among other foundations and private donors . <p> Stephen Seok was one of the IRS agents who wrote threatening letters to conservative groups . After doing so , he was given a promotion . <p> In June 2013 , it was reported that two IRS employees had violated government ethics rules at a 2010 conference when they received $1,100 in free food and other items . One of them was Fred Schindler , the director of implementation oversight at the IRS Affordable Care Act office . The other was Donald Toda , a California-based employee . Obama did not fire them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By comparison , in 1981 , President Reagan fired 11,359 air-traffic controllers who had been illegally striking . <p> In June 2013 , it was reported that The National Organization for Marriage , a conservative organization , had forensic evidence which proved that its donors private information had been illegally leaked by the IRS . The IRS employee(s) who illegally leaked this private information could get five years in prison . <p> In July 2013 , it was reported that Obama had met with a key IRS official who was involved in the targeting just two days before the key official had told his colleagues how to target tea party groups . The Daily Caller reported : <p> The Obama appointee implicated in congressional testimony in the IRS targeting scandal met with President Obama in the White House two days before offering his colleagues a new set of advice on how to scrutinize tea party and conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status . <p> IRS chief counsel William Wilkins , who was named in House Oversight testimony by retiring IRS agent Carter Hull as one of his supervisors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roosevelt Room of the White House on April 23 , 2012 . Wilkins boss , then-IRS commissioner Douglas Shulman , visited the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on April 24 , 2012 , according to White House visitor logs . <p> On April 25 , 2012 , Wilkins office sent the exempt organizations determinations unit " additional comments on the draft guidance " for approving or denying tea party tax-exempt applications , according to the IRS inspector generals report . <p> " Well , congratulations , President Barack Obama . Conspiracy theorists who generally can survive in anaerobic environments have just had an algae bloom dropped on their f***ing heads , thus removing the last arrow in your pro-governance quiver : skepticism about your opponents . " <p> Michael Macleod-Ball , chief of staff at the ACLUs Washington Legislative Office , said of this : <p> " Even the appearance of playing partisan politics with the tax code is about as constitutionally troubling as it gets . With the recent push to grant federal agencies broad new powers to mandate donor disclosure for advocacy groups on both the left and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent this from ever happening again . " <p> 171 ) Spent $402,721 on underwear that detects the presence of cigarette smoke <p> In May 2013 , it was reported that the Obama administration had spent $402,721 on underwear that detects the presence of cigarette smoke . <p> 172 ) Rewarded one of his biggest campaign fundraisers by nominating him for the ambassadorship to Canada <p> In April 2013 , it was reported that Obama had nominated Bruce Heyman to be the ambassador to Canada . During Obamas election campaign , Heyman had raised more than $1 million for Obama . <p> 173 ) Hired a retarded man to sell illegal drugs and guns , and then arrested him for doing so <p> " ATF agents running an undercover storefront in Milwaukee used a brain-damaged man with a low IQ to set up gun and drug deals , paying him in cigarettes , merchandise and money , according to federal documents obtained by the Journal Sentinel . " <p> " For more than six months , federal agents relied on Chauncey Wright to promote Fearless Distributing by handing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store to friends , family and strangers , according to federal prosecutors and family members . " <p> " Wright , unaware that the store was an undercover operation being run by agents with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , also stocked shelves with shoes , clothing , drug paraphernalia and auto parts , according to his family . " <p> " Once authorities shut down the operation , they charged the 28-year-old man with federal gun and drug counts . " <p> " Wrights IQ measures in the 50s , about half of a normal IQ , according to those familiar with him . Wrights score is classified as mildly or moderately disabled , depending on the IQ scale used . " <p> The Justice Department secretly obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors for The Associated Press in what the news cooperatives top executive called a " massive and unprecedented intrusion " into how news organizations gather the news . <p> The records obtained by the Justice Department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Washington and Hartford , Conn. , and the main number for AP reporters in the House of Representatives press gallery , according to attorneys for the AP . It was not clear if the records also included incoming calls or the duration of calls . <p> In all , the government seized the records for more than 20 separate telephone lines assigned to AP and its journalists in April and May of 2012 . The exact number of journalists who used the phone lines during that period is unknown but more than 100 journalists work in the offices where phone records were targeted , on a wide array of stories about government and other matters . <p> In a letter of protest sent to Attorney General Eric Holder on Monday , AP President and Chief Executive Officer Gary Pruitt said the government sought and obtained information far beyond anything that could be justified by any specific investigation . He demanded the return of the phone records and destruction of all copies . <p> " There can be no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of the telephone communications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially reveal communications with confidential sources across all of the newsgathering activities undertaken by the AP during a two-month period , provide a road map to APs newsgathering operations , and disclose information about APs activities and operations that the government has no conceivable right to know , " Pruitt said . <p> Soon afterward , it was reported that obtaining these phone records had required approval from Eric Holder , Obamas Attorney General . <p> This has had a very dangerous and harmful effect on the medias ability to report the news . In June 2013 , Gary Pruitt , the president and chief executive of Associated Presssaid : <p> " Some longtime trusted sources have become nervous and anxious about talking with us In some cases , government employees we once checked in with regularly will no longer speak to us by phone . Others are reluctant to meet in person This chilling effect on newsgathering is not just limited to APJournalists from other news organizations have personally told me that it has intimidated both official and nonofficial sources from speaking to them as well . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bidding on government contracts <p> In April 2011 , Obama asked contractors to disclose their political donations before bidding on government contracts . <p> 176 ) Tried to deport German family that had fled Germany over Hitlers ban on homeschooling <p> In Germany in 1938 , Adolf Hitler outlawed homeschooling . He said " Give me a child when he s seven and he s mine forever . " <p> Hitlers ban on homeschooling is still in effect today . In 2006 , Katharina Plett was arrested for homeschooling her own children . Her husband and their children fled the country . In 2008 , Juergen and Rosemary Dudek were sentenced to 90 days in jail for homeschooling their own children . <p> Uwe and Hannelore Romeike and their homeschooled children fled Germany after the police showed up at their house to enforce Germanys ban on homeschooling . They came to the United States in 2010 and were granted political asylum , which gave them legal permission to live in the U.S. as political refugees However , in March 2013 , the Obama administration argued in federal court in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that Obama does not consider them to be political refugees , and that he does not consider Germanys policy of jailing homeschooling parents to be a form of persecution . <p> " If Latinos sit out the election instead of saying , Were gon na punish our enemies , and were gon na reward our friends who stand with us on issues that are important to us " if they do n't  see that kind of upsurge in voting in this election " then I think its going to be harder . And that 's why I think its so important that people focus on voting on November 2nd . " <p> This is a rare instance of a promise that Obama has actually kept instead of broken . A huge number of the things on this list can be explained by that one simple sentence that Obama said . <p> 178 ) Falsely accused a law abiding news reporter of being " an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator " in a criminal investigation <p> James Rosen is a law abiding reporter for Fox News . However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abettor and/or co-conspirator " in a criminal investigation when it applied for a warrant to read his emails . <p> With the decision to label a Fox News television reporter a possible " co-conspirator " in a criminal investigation of a news leak , the Obama administration has moved beyond protecting government secrets to threatening fundamental freedoms of the press to gather news . <p> Leak investigations usually focus on the source , not the reporter . But , in this case , federal prosecutors also asked a federal judge for permission to examine Mr. Rosens personal e-mails , arguing that " there is probable cause to believe " Mr. Rosen is " an aider and abettor and/or co-conspirator " in the leak . <p> Though Mr. Rosen was not charged , the F.B.I . request for his e-mail account was granted secretly in late May 2010 . The government was allowed to rummage through Mr. Rosens e-mails for at least 30 days . <p> Michael Clemente , the executive vice president of Fox News , said on Monday that it was " downright chilling " that Mr. Rosen " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a reporter . " Bruce Brown , the executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , added on Tuesday that treating " routine news-gathering efforts as evidence of criminality is extremely troubling and corrodes time-honored understandings between the public and the government about the role of the free press . " <p> Obama administration officials often talk about the balance between protecting secrets and protecting the constitutional rights of a free press . Accusing a reporter of being a " co-conspirator " shows a heavy tilt toward secrecy and insufficient concern about a free press . <p> The Rosen affair is as flagrant an assault on civil liberties as anything done by George W. Bushs administration , and it uses technology to silence critics in a way Richard Nixon could only have dreamed of . <p> To treat a reporter as a criminal for doing his job " seeking out information the government does n't  want made public " deprives Americans of the First Amendment freedom on which all other constitutional rights are based . Guns ? Privacy ? Due process ? Equal protection ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights , either . <p> Beyond that , the administrations actions shatter the presidents credibility and discourage allies who would otherwise defend the administration against bogus accusations such as those involving the Benghazi " talking points . " If the administration is spying on reporters and accusing them of criminality just for asking questions " well , who knows what else this crowd is capable of doing ? <p> My Post colleague Ann E. Marimow , who broke the Rosen story , obtained the affidavit by FBI agent Reginald Reyes seeking access to Rosens private e-mails . In the affidavit , Reyes stated that " there is probable cause to believe that the reporter has committed or is committing a violation " of the law against national security leaks . The affidavit detailed how the FBI had monitored Rosens comings and goings from the State Department and tracked his various phone calls with the suspected leaker , analyst Stephen Jin-Woo Kim . <p> Rosens supposed crime ? Reyes got his evidence from an e-mail from the reporter : " I want to report authoritatively , and ahead of my competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events on the ground in North Korea , what intelligence is picking up , etc . . . . I 'd love to see some internal State Department analyses . . . . In short : Let 's break some news , and expose muddle-headed policy when we see it , or force the administrations hand to go in the right direction , if possible . " <p> That is indeed compelling evidence " of good journalism . <p> Obama is establishing an ominous precedent . <p> 179 ) Asked Attorney General Eric Holder to investigate himself for lying under oath <p> U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder lied under oath . He said that he had nothing to do with monitoring the emails of Fox News reporter James Rosen . But it turns out that it was Holders own signature on the search warrant . <p> Even the liberal Huffington Post said that Holder should be fired over this . <p> The law allows the Department of Health and Human Services to set up federal health exchanges in the holdout states . But the statute makes no mention of the IRS providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved this conundrum by denying its existence . In a May 2012 regulatory ruling , it asserted its own right to provide credits outside the state exchanges as the reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous law . But the language of the law is not ambiguous . And health scholars Jonathan Adler and Michael Cannon , in an exhaustive recent analysis , find no justification for the IRSs ruling in the legislative history of Obamacare . " The statute , " they argue , " and the lack of any support for the IRS rule in the legislative record put defenders of the IRS rule in the awkward position of arguing that it was so obviously Congress intent to offer tax credits in federal exchanges that despite a year of debate over the PPACA , it never occurred to anyone to express that intent out loud . A better explanation is that the PPACAs authors miscalculated when they assumed states would establish exchanges . " <p> So : The IRS seized the authority to spend about $800 billion over 10 years on benefits that were not authorized by Congress . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . What was the role of politics in shaping this regulatory decision ? What pressure was applied ? <p> 181 ) Used environmental regulations to shut down an ambulance while it was taking a patient to the hospital <p> A Wednesday shootout on the streets of Washington Highlands left a cop injured and a carjacking suspect dead . But before the suspect expired , he went on an unusual ambulance ride that involved moving him from one vehicle to another on the shoulder of Interstate 295 . While this might appear to be another story of Fire and Emergency Medical Services dysfunction , the story is rather more complicated . As WUSA-TV explains , newer-model diesel engines are required by federal regulations to have emission-control features that , in some circumstances , require the motor to shut down for " regeneration " " a process in which the exhaust system burns off trapped soot . The need for regeneration can be unpredictable . The transfer to a second ambulance delayed 34-year-old Nathaniel McRaes arrival at a hospital by seven minutes . FEMS insists the wait did not play a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired 0.55% of its workers in the budget year that ended Sept. 30 " 11,668 employees in its 2.1 million workforce . " <p> " White-collar federal workers have almost total job security after a few years on the job . Last year , the government fired none of its 3,000 meteorologists , 2,500 health insurance administrators , 1,000 optometrists , 800 historians or 500 industrial property managers . " <p> Wow ! Those must be excellent workers , right ? <p> Actually , no . The article also says : <p> " San Francisco State University management professor John Sullivan , an expert on employee turnover , says the low departure rates show a failure to release poor performers and those with obsolete skills . Rather than indicating something positive , rates below 1% in the firing and layoff components would indicate a serious management problem , he says . " <p> A serious management problem ? <p> So who exactly is the highest ranking manager of the federal government ? <p> Its President Obama . <p> 183 ) Illegally solicited donations from health insurers <p> In May 2013 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from health insurers to help pay for Obamacare . Such soliciting is illegal . <p> 184 ) Chose an economic advisor who wanted roads and bridges to be built by unqualified workers <p> Obama chose to have Robert Reich be his economic advisor . Regarding Obamas stimulus , Reich said : <p> " I am concerned , as I 'm sure many of you are , that these jobs not simply go to high skilled people And therefore , in my remarks I have suggested to you , and I 'm certainly happy to talk about it more , ways in which the money can be " criteria can be set so that they money does go to others people who are not necessarily construction workers or high-skilled professionals . " <p> 185 ) Pressured unions to reduce the amount of health insurance coverage for their employees <p> Although the tax does not start until 2018 , employers say they have to start now to meet the deadline and they are doing whatever they can to bring down the cost of their plans . Under the law , an employer or health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual and $27,500 for a family would typically pay a 40 percent excise tax on the amount exceeding the threshold . <p> Tom Leibfried , a legislative director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. , one of the unions whose plans are vulnerable to the tax , says the demands that workers pay more for their care is a perennial aspect of labor negotiations . " Were very concerned about the hollowing out of benefits in general , " he said . " What the excise tax will do is just fuel that . " <p> Obama was lying . The free market means that in the business world , it is the customers , not the government , who pick winners and losers . But this list contains a huge number of instances where Obama tried to use the government to pick winners and losers in the business world . <p> 187 ) Falsely said " We believe in a light touch when it comes to regulations " <p> In June 2013 , Obama said , " We believe in a light touch when it comes to regulations . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Obama added 20,000extra pages of regulations to it . <p> 188 ) Said Catholic schools are " divisive " but did not say the same thing about other religious schools <p> " If towns remain divided " if Catholics have their schools and buildings and Protestants have theirs , if we cant see ourselves in one another and fear or resentment are allowed to harden " that too encourages division and discourages cooperation . " <p> I can understand why a person might criticize religious schools in general " although I myself happen to think that religious schools are a superior alternative to public schools . But for Obama to single out one religion in particular as being divisive , while not saying the same thing about all religious schools in general , is a double standard . <p> 189 ) Favored a new tax on Christmas trees so the money could be used to subsidize Christmas trees <p> In November 2011 , Obama proposed a new tax on Christmas trees , so that the money could be used to subsidize Christmas trees . If this had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest it as an actual government policy is absurd . <p> 190 ) Betrayed the people of the city that helped him launch his political career <p> As part of his effort to get Obamacare passed , Obama repeatedly promised that people could keep their current health insurance if they liked it . <p> More than any other city , the people of Chicago helped to get Obamacare passed . Chicago is where Obama chose to live when he first got into politics . The people there launched his political career and voted him into office . <p> And this is how Obama repays them . In May 2013 , the Chicago Tribune reported : <p> Mayor Rahm Emanuel plans to start reducing health insurance coverage next year for more than 30,000 retired city workers and begin shifting them to President Barack Obamas new federal system . <p> The move is aimed at saving the city money <p> Once the phaseout is complete , those retired workers would have to pay for their own health insurance or get subsidies under the Affordable Care Act . The city-subsidized coverage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Medicare <p> Henry Bayer , executive director of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees Council 31 , said the uncertainties of the Affordable Care Act and the state insurance exchanges they would create make the citys plan hard to assess . <p> " This uncertainty will cause anxiety and fear for tens of thousands of seniors who gave their working lives to public service " men and women whose retirement savings are already under attack in the name of pension reform . ' " Bayer said . <p> 191 ) Proposed military interventionism in Syria <p> In June 2013 , Obama proposed that the U.S. get involved in Syrias military conflicts . <p> 192 ) Planned to use military snipers to shoot innocent lions and cheetahs in the wild <p> In June 2013 , Obama was planning to use military snipers to shoot innocent lions and cheetahs in the wild . <p> However , after the media reported on his plans , Obama got embarrassed , and cancelled his plans . <p> 193 ) Refused to fire or prosecute more than 1,000 IRS employees who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use <p> During Obamas first term , more than 1,000 IRS employees illegally used their IRS credit cards for personal purchases , but Obama refused to fire or prosecute them . <p> 194 ) Defended intelligence chief who lied under oath <p> In March 2013 , James Clapper , the director of national intelligence , falsely stated under oath that the NSA was not gathering data on millions of U.S. citizens . In June 2013 , after it was reported that Clapper had lied under oath , Obama defended him , instead of firing him . <p> 195 ) Had the Secret Service visit a law abiding citizen who had criticized his policies on Twitter <p> In April 2013 , Obama sent the Secret Service to visit the home of Tom Francois , a law abiding citizen who had criticized Obamas policies on Twitter . <p> The Secret Service admitted that Francois had not made any threats against Obama . <p> In May 2013 , the Daily Caller reported that the IRS had taken the " unprecedented " step of approving a non-profit application within just one month . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Obama Foundation , a so-called " charity " which was headed by Malik Obama , Barack Obamas brother . <p> In addition , the IRS illegally gave retroactive approval for the organizations tax exempt status . Prior to getting this approval , the organization had illegally solicited tax deductible donations even though it did not have legal approval to do so . <p> 197 ) Raised the interest rate on student loans to pay for Obamacare <p> Obamacare raised the interest rate on student loans from 5.3% to 6.8% . The money is used to fund Obamacare . <p> 198 ) Refused to fire or prosecute 15 IRS agents who illegally seized the medical records of 10 million people <p> In March 2011 , 15 IRS agents illegally seized the medical records of 10 million people without a warrant . Obama refused to fire or prosecute them . <p> 199 ) Hired 16,500 new IRS agents to run Obamacare <p> In June 2013 , it was reported that Obama had hired 16,500 new IRS agents to run Obamacare . <p> 200 ) Tried to reward wasteful IRS spending with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werfel , Obamas new nominee to head the IRS , asked Congress for an increase in funding . At the same time , NPR reported on this waste of taxpayer money at an IRS conference : <p> Some of the 2,600 attendees received benefits , including baseball tickets and stays in presidential suites that normally cost $1,500 to $3,500 per night . In addition , 15 outside speakers were paid a total of $135,000 in fees , with one paid $17,000 to talk about " leadership through art , " the committee said . <p> Considering how the IRS wasted all that money on luxury hotel rooms and worthless speeches , Werfel really had some nerve asking Congress for more money . By proposing to reward wasteful spending with a budget increase , Werfel proved that he is incompetent to head the IRS . The fact that Obama nominated such an incompetent person does not surprise me one bit . <p> As the Obamacare law was written , the employer mandate was to begin in January 2014 . This is what the law said when it was passed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , in July 2013 , Obama delayed the employer mandate part of Obamacare until January 2015 . Obama did this without approval from Congress . <p> For Obama to change a law that was passed by Congress , without first getting approval from Congress , is a violation of the Presidential oath that Obama took to uphold and defend the Constitution . <p> What Obama did here is an action of a dictator , not an action of a President whose power is limited by a written constitution . <p> If Obama can get away with this , then it sets a horribly dangerous precedent , and means that the President can arbitrarily make any change to any law that has been passed by Congress , without first getting approval from Congress . <p> 202 ) Made it too hard for some doctors to continue their practices <p> In July 2013 , ABC News reported that some doctors were shutting down their practices in response to Obamacare . <p> Dr. Robert WcWilliams , an **25;0;TOOLONG with more than 5,000 patients , said : <p> " Its going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by politicians " who have no idea what is in your best interests , then I 'm getting out . " <p> 203 ) Falsely told Africans that contaminated water is a smaller problem than global warming <p> In July 2013 , while speaking in Johannesburg , South Africa , President Obama said that global warming was " the biggest challenge we have environmentally " and that it was worse than " dirty water , dirty air . " <p> However , according to the World Health Organization , while global warming kills 140,000 people each year , air pollution kills 3 million people per year . <p> According to UNESCO , each year , contaminated water causes 4 billion cases of diarrhea , 120,000 cases of cholera , 300 million cases of malaria , 12 million cases of typhoid , 6 million cases of trachoma , 200 million cases of schistosomiesis , and more than 1 billion incidents of intestinal parasites . <p> You know what 's worse than global warming ? How about living your entire life without ever having access to a toilet ? <p> The World Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disease and death around the world . " <p> That Obama would downplay these problems shows how scientifically illiterate he is . <p> That he would do so while giving a speech in Africa , which has the highest rate of water borne illness of any continent , shows how thoughtless and insensitive he is . <p> 204 ) Spent $630,000 to get more Facebook " likes " <p> In July 2013 , it was reported that Obama had spent $630,000 of taxpayers money in order to get more Facebook " likes . " <p> 205 ) Declared that hacking was an act of war , then hacked the EU <p> In 2011 , the Obama administration issued a statement which said that when one country hacked another countrys computers , the hacking constituted an " act of war . " <p> In July 2013 , it was reported that the Obama administration had hacked computers which were owned by the European Union . <p> 206 ) Said " If I had a son , hed look like Trayvon " <p> In Florida , after a school security camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpack showed that it contained 12 pieces of womens jewelry , including silver wedding rings , and earrings with diamonds . The backpack also had a screwdriver , which is often used as a tool by burglars . Martin said that the jewelry belonged to a friend , but refused to say who that friend was . <p> Why would a teenage boy bring a backpack full of silver wedding rings and diamond earrings to school ? Do Martins millions of defenders really think that he was not a burglar ? <p> The fact that Martin was in possession of stolen jewelry at school is perfectly in line with George Zimmermans claim on the 911 call that Martin was acting suspiciously . And there had been quite a few burglaries in the area recently . <p> Also on the 911 call , Zimmerman had said that Martin was acting as if he was on drugs . Martins autopsy showed that there was THC in his system . And while other parts of marijuana can stay in the system for weeks after its smoked , the THC only stays in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was indeed high when Zimmerman saw him . <p> So Trayvon Martin was a burglar , used illegal drugs , broke Zimmermans nose , and smashed Zimmermans head against the concrete . <p> 207 ) Falsely said that Secretary of State John Kerry had not been on his yacht during the regime change in Egypt <p> In July 2013 , the Obama administration falsely said that Secretary of State John Kerry had not been on his yacht during the regime change in Egypt . <p> Evan after CBS news presented the Obama administration with photographic evidence that Kerry had been on his yacht during that time , the Obama administration still continued to falsely claim that Kerry had not been on his yacht . <p> The USDA Rural Development agency also touted a program to subsidize the Wine Barn LLC in " marketing and increasing production of its Kansas produced wine . " That cost $25,000 . The USDA Rural Development also said it would hand $300,000 to the Mackinaw Trail Winery in Michigan , $100,000 for the Appleton Creek Winery in New York , $162,500 for the Old Westminster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wineries in Nebraska and Iowa . <p> Liquor is the name of the game for the USDA , apparently " they 're also subsidizing the production of vodka in North Carolina , Bloody Mary mix in West Virginia , and hard cider in Virginia . <p> 212 ) Gave 23,994 tax refunds worth a total of $46,378,040 to illegal aliens who all used the same address <p> In 2011 , the IRS gave 23,994 tax refunds worth a total of $46,378,040 to illegal aliens who all used the same address in Atlanta , Ga . <p> In June 2013 , the Obama administration filed lawsuits against Dollar General and BMW for using criminal background checks to screen employees . The Obama administration claimed that such background checks were " racist . " <p> In March and April of 2012 , Obama used tax money to pay federal employees to organize protests against George Zimmerman . <p> 215 ) Illegally continued giving foreign aid to Egypt after it had a coup <p> Federal law requires that U.S. foreign aid to Egypt be ended if and when Egypt has a coup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Obama administration said that it would continue giving foreign aid to Egypt . <p> 216 ) Broke promise to end Bushs surveillance of U.S. citizens who were not suspected of committing a crime <p> In August 2007 , Obama promised that he would end Bushs surveillance of U.S. citizens who were not suspected of committing a crime . However , in June 2013 , such surveillance was still being conducted . <p> 217 ) Spent $3 million to study the health risks of dating Mexican prostitutes <p> In July 2013 , it was reported that the Obama administration had spent $3 million to study the health risks of dating Mexican prostitutes . <p> 218 ) Lied about the cost of IRS conferences <p> In June 2013 it was reported that the Obama administration had lied about the cost of IRS conferences . While the actual cost was $50 million , the Obama administration had claimed that the cost was only 1% of that mount . <p> 219 ) Spent $890,000 per year on service fees for bank accounts that had no money <p> In April 2013 , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year on service fees for bank accounts that did not have any money in them . At the time , the government had 13,712 empty accounts which it was supposed to have closed , but which it had kept open anyway . <p> 220 ) Spent $34 million to construct a new military headquarters in Afghanistan after U.S. military commanders said they did not want it <p> After U.S. military commanders said in 2010 that they did not want a new headquarters in Afghanistan , the Obama administration spent $34 million to build it anyway . <p> 224 ) Illegally seized a privately owned gun from a law abiding citizen <p> After a jury found George Zimmerman not guilty , the Obama administration announced that it would seize his gun . This violated the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution , as well as the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment . <p> 225 ) Broke his promise to have real time verifiability of Obamacare subsidies <p> Meanwhile , the administration tacitly admitted last week that its promise of real-time verification of a consumers eligibility to buy subsidized coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under ObamaCare , only those who do n't  have access to " affordable " insurance at work can buy coverage in an exchange , and only those below certain income levels are eligible for tax subsidies . <p> Rather than a high-tech instant check , the administration told states they could simply take the applicants word for it when it comes to their employer-provided coverage , as well as their " projected annual household income , " without the need for " further verification . " <p> 226 ) Signed health care reform whose rules contradicted each other <p> Obamacare allows insurance companies to charge higher premiums for smokers . At the same time , it prohibits insurance companies from charging more than three times as much for older people as it does for younger people . In June 2013 , Obamas computer programmers said that they had been unable to write a computer program that simultaneously agreed with both of these rules . <p> 227 ) Signed a health care reform plan that is so horrible that even the IRS agents who run it do n't  want to participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IRS agents who run it do n't  want to participate in it . <p> In July 2013 , the National Treasury Employees Union , which represents the IRS employees who will be running Obamacare , provided a form letter to its members to send to their Congressmen . The letter stated : <p> " I am very concerned about legislation that has been introduced by Congressman Dave Camp to push federal employees out of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and into the insurance exchanges established under the Affordable Care Act . " <p> " I do n't  want to speak for the NTEU , but I 'll offer a perspective as a federal employee myself and a federal employee at the IRS . And that is , we have right now as employees of the government , of the IRS , affordable health care coverage . I think the ACA was designed to provide an option or an alternative for individuals that do not . And all else being equal , I think if you 're an individual who is satisfied with your health care coverage , you 're probably in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the change of moving into a different environment and going through that process . So I think for a federal employee , I think more likely , and I would " can speak for myself , I would prefer to stay with the current policy that I 'm pleased with rather than go through a change if I do n't  need to go through that change . " <p> 228 ) Tried to tax small businesses at a higher rate than corporations <p> Obama raised the top tax rate on small businesses to 39.6% , and tried to lower the top tax rate on corporations to 28% . <p> 229 ) Illegally prevented individual employees of small businesses from choosing their own plan during the first year of Obamacare <p> Obamacare requires that individual employees of small businesses be allowed to choose their own insurance plan during the first year of Obamacare . However , in March 2013 , the Obama administration announced that it would not be allowing them to make this choice during the first year . <p> 230 ) Falsely said that Obamacare had not hurt jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obamacare had not hurt jobs . <p> However , in the real world , in response to the medical device tax that is part of Obamacare , some medical device manufacturers have announced plans to lay off employees , including Welch Allyn ( 275 planned layoffs ) , Stryker ( 1,170 planned layoffs ) , and Medtronic ( 1,000 planned layoffs ) . In December 2012 , Al Franken , Elizabeth Warren , John Kerry , and 15 other Democrats who supported the passage of Obamacare wrote a letter to Harry Reid , asking him to delay the tax on medical devices , claiming that the tax would hurt job creation in their districts . The New York Times reported that Obamacare " sharply penalizes full-time employment in favor of part-time employment . " In response to the employer mandate of Obamacare , some restaurants have announced plans to switch some of their employees from full time to part time , including some franchises of Olive Garden , Red Lobster , Wendys , Taco Bell , White Castle , and Fatburger . Community College of Allegheny County switched 200 professors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in response to Obamacare . Clint Benjamin , an English professor at Community College of Allegheny County , said that this would reduce his own monthly pay by $600 . Also in response to the employer mandate of Obamacare , other colleges have announced plans to switch some of their employees from full time to part time , including Floridas Palm Beach State College , Ohios Youngstown State University , and New Jerseys Kean University . In Virginia , thousands of government employees had their hours reduced because of Obamacare . The Carnegie Museum of Pittsburgh reduced the hours of 48 of its employees in response to Obamacare . Regal Entertainment Group , the largest chain of movie theaters in the country , announced that it would be switching thousands of its employees from full time to part time in response to the Obamacare mandate . Utahs Granite School District reduced the hours of 1,200 of its employees in response to Obamacare . In response to Obamacare , many Wal-Mart stores have stopped hiring full time workers .

Numerous employers have begun to cut workers hours to avoid this obligation . " <p> 231 ) Falsely said that health insurance premiums would be reduced by $2,500 per family by the end of his first term <p> Labor unions enthusiastically backed the Obama administrations health-care overhaul when it was up for debate . Now that the law is rolling out , some are turning sour . <p> Union leaders say many of the laws requirements will drive up the costs for their health-care plans and make unionized workers less competitive . Among other things , the law eliminates the caps on medical benefits and prescription drugs used as cost-containment measures in many health-care plans . It also allows children to stay on their parents plans until they turn 26 . <p> Some 20 million Americans are covered by the health-care plans at issue <p> Top officers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large labor groups plan to keep pressing the Obama administration to expand the federal subsidies to these jointly run plans , warning that unionized employers may otherwise drop coverage . A handful of unions say they already have examined whether it makes sense to shift workers off their current plans <p> " We are going back to the administration to say that this is not acceptable , " said Ken Hall , general secretary-treasurer for the Teamsters , which has 1.6 million members and dependents in health-care plans . Other unions involved in the push include the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and Unite Here <p> Sheet Metal Workers Local 85 in Atlanta , which has about 1,900 members . Next year it must lift the $250,000 annual cap on the amount it will pay for medical claims . The laws requirements will add between 50 cents to $1 an hour to the cost of members compensation package <p> 234 ) Illegally changed Obamacare to benefit members of Congress and their staff <p> Obamacare was passed by the House and Senate , and signed by President Obama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff complained that Obamacare was going to cost them a lot of money , and said that this would likely cause a brain drain among their staff . In response to this , Obama made changes to Obamacare so that these things would not happen . However , Obamas actions were illegal , because he made these changes without Congress voting on them first . <p> 235 ) Told General Mills to stop making true claims about Cheerios <p> For quite some time , advertisements for the breakfast cereal Cheerios made the true and accurate claim that eating Cheerios lowers a persons cholesterol . <p> However , even though this claim is true and accurate , in May 2009 , the Obama administration ordered General Mills , the maker of Cheerios , to stop making this claim in its commercials . <p> 236 ) Illegally avoided enforcing the required income verification of people who receive subsidies for Obamacare exchanges <p> Even though Obamacare requires the government to verify the income of people who receive subsidies for Obamacare exchanges , in August 2013 it was reported that Obama would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax on so-called " Cadillac " insurance plans <p> Obamacare includes a 40% tax on so-called " Cadillac " insurance plans . In August 2013 , unions that supported the passage of Obamacare complained about this tax . <p> 238 ) Made medical care for special needs children more expensive <p> In August 2013 , it was reported that Obamacare would make it more expensive for the parents of special needs children to pay for their childrens medical equipment and specialized private schools that cater to their medical needs . <p> 239 ) Responded to the Benghazi attack by going back to bed , and then later got up and headed off to Las Vegas for a fundraiser <p> In September 2012 , after Obama found out that U.S. citizens were being killed in Benghazi , Libya , he went back to bed . After he got up in the morning , he went off to Las Vegas for a fundraiser . <p> 240 ) Illegally delayed the caps on out of pocket health care payments without Congressional approval <p> As it was passed by the House and Senate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pocket payments that people pay for health care , and these caps were legally required to take effect in January 2014 . <p> Because Obama imposed this delay without it first being approved by Congress , Obamas action was illegal . The President does not have the legal authority to change an Act that was passed by Congress , without that change first being approved by Congress . What Obama did here is not the act of a President whose power is limited by a written constitution , but is , instead , the action of a dictator . <p> 241 ) Holds a double standard when it comes to supporting " gun free " zones <p> " Eliminate armed guards for the President , Vice-President , and their families , and establish Gun Free Zones around them " <p> " Gun Free Zones are supposed to protect our children , and some politicians wish to strip us of our right to keep and bear arms . Those same politicians and their families are currently under the protection of armed Secret Service agents . If Gun Free Zones are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be good enough for politicians . " <p> 242 ) Outlawed the low-premium , high-deductible health insurance that some people prefer <p> In August 2013 , it was reported that Obamacare would bring an end to the low-premium , high-deductible health insurance that some people prefer . <p> 243 ) Lied about how many people he had helped to protect from mortgage fraud <p> In August 2013 , it was reported that less than one month before the 2012 election , the Obama administration had lied about the number of people that it had helped to protect from mortgage fraud , as well as the total amount of money involved . In August 2013 , when the truth was revealed , Newsbusters reported : <p> " Thus , the number of defendants fell by 80% from what DOJ claimed less than a month before the presidential election . The number of victims fell by 76% . The amount of losses involved dropped by over 90% . " <p> 244 ) Falsely said the NSA review was being conducted by an " independent " body <p> In August 2013 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation of NSA surveillance . <p> However , three days later , it was reported that this so-called " independent " investigation would be run by James Clapper , who had falsely testified to Congress that the NSA was not collecting information on U.S. citizens . <p> 245 ) Used tax money to pay for a separate flight just for his dog <p> In August 2013 , Obama forced taxpayers to pay for a separate airplane flight just for his dog Bo . <p> 246 ) Closed off public roads so he could buy books <p> In August 2013 , Obama had public roads closed to the public so he could go to a bookstore . Why did n't  he just order the books online ? <p> 247 ) Gave illegal EPA exemption to one oil refinery , and would not say which refinery it was <p> The EPA has a very expensive ethanol mandate that applies to all oil refineries . However , in August 2013 , it was reported that Obama had given one oil refinery an exemption from this mandate . <p> This exemption is illegal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress . And secondly , the Constitution requires that federal laws apply equally to everyone . <p> In addition , Obama refused to say which refinery it was that received this exemption , which is completely contrary to his repeated promises of " transparency . " <p> 248 ) Created new fines for charitable hospitals that give treatment to uninsured people <p> In August 2013 , it was reported that Obamacare creates new fines for charitable hospitals that give treatment to uninsured people . <p> " Unfortunately , in too many of our hardest-hit communities , no matter how hard a child or her parents work , the life chances of that child , even her lifespan , is determined by the ZIP Code she grows up in . This is simply wrong . " <p> However , let 's consider two groups of people in the U.S. The first group has a poverty rate of 2% . The second group has a poverty rate of 76% . <p> The first group consists of people who followed all three of these steps : <p> 1 ) Finish high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Wait until age 21 and get married before having children . <p> The second group consists of people who followed zero of those three steps . <p> Among people who follow all three of these steps , the poverty rate is 2% . <p> Among people who follow zero of these steps , the poverty rate is 76% . <p> ( My source for that information is this article , which refers to this PDF , and the relevant data is on page 15 of the PDF . The study uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau . ) <p> 250 ) Nominated a telecommunications lobbyist and Obama fundraiser to head the FCC <p> In May 2013 , Obama nominated Tom Wheeler to head the FCC . Wheeler had previously been the head of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association , which is a lobbying organization for the cable TV industry . He had also been the head of CTIA , a lobbying organization for cellphone carriers . In addition , he had also been a fundraiser for Obama . <p> A secretive U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration unit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive database of telephone records to authorities across the nation to help them launch criminal investigations of Americans . <p> Although these cases rarely involve national security issues , documents reviewed by Reuters show that law enforcement agents have been directed to conceal how such investigations truly begin " not only from defense lawyers but also sometimes from prosecutors and judges . <p> The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to " recreate " the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated , a practice that some experts say violates a defendants Constitutional right to a fair trial . If defendants do n't  know how an investigation began , they can not know to ask to review potential sources of exculpatory evidence " information that could reveal entrapment , mistakes or biased witnesses . <p> " I have never heard of anything like this at all , " said Nancy Gertner , a Harvard Law School professor who served as a federal judge from 1994 to 2011 . Gertner and other legal experts said the program sounds more troubling than recent disclosures that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The NSA effort is geared toward stopping terrorists ; the DEA program targets common criminals , primarily drug dealers . <p> " It is one thing to create special rules for national security , " Gertner said . " Ordinary crime is entirely different . It sounds like they are phonying up investigations . " <p> 252 ) Threatened internet service providers with contempt of court if they did not install surveillance software <p> In August 2013 , it was reported that the Obama administration had pressured internet service providers to install surveillance software , so that it could monitor internet traffic without a warrant . Internet service providers who did not cave in to this pressure were threatened by the Obama administration with contempt of court . This violated the Constitutions ban on warrantless searches . In addition , the executive branch does not have the legal authority to declare contempt of court , as this power is reserved exclusively for the judicial branch . @qwx170862

That 's what the controversial elitist think tank , the Club of Rome , predicted back in 1972 . Decades after its publication , advocates of world government are still pushing its predictions as a call to curb mankinds footprint on the earth . <p> Australian physicist Graham Turner has recently made news again after revisiting computer models MIT researchers created for the Club of Romes 1972 publication that sees a drastic decline in human population coming in relation to a increasing scarcity of resources . Turners basic conclusions , however , give away the agenda in plain sight . " The world is on track for disaster , " he bluntly states , while suggesting that " unlimited economic growth " is still possible if world governments enact policies and invest in green technologies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The neo-Malthusian Club of Rome has once again surfaced at a time when environmentalists are demanding world government to save the earth to present computer models it developed with MIT . It predicts a stark future where limited resources like oil , food and water supposedly trigger a crash that ends with a precipitous reduction in the human population . The graph , while failing to provide actual numbers on the Y axis , appears to show a world population level in 2100 approximately equal to the almost 4.5 billion people in 1980 , a decline of more than 5 billion from projected peak numbers ( which could be even higher ) : <p> Of course , the Club of Rome/MIT models already predicted that the tipping point for disaster would come by the year 2000 , which , like the predictions from Sir Thomas Malthus that population would outgrow the food supply , never came . <p> Instead , this prediction for disaster reflects aspirations of the elite to stop growth , not a neutral reflection on trends that must be . As we have repeatedly documented , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-industrial society that harkens back to the feudalistic era . <p> The Club of Rome , founded in 1968 , is an " environmental " group of , by and for the elitists who want control of earth , its peoples and resources . Indeed , elitism at its height was expressed through the Club of Rome when it published in 1991 that " mankind itself " was the enemy , and mans usage of resources its destructive weapon against the planet : <h> The common enemy like would fit the bill . All these dangers are caused by human intervention , and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome . The real enemy then , is humanity itself . " Club of Rome , The First Global Revolution <p> Lyndon LaRouches Executive Intelligence Review , along with other critics , found in the early 1980s that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club of Rome founder Aurelio Peccei wanted to show . As authors Phillip Darrell Collins and Paul David Collins summarize : <h> " The motive for this deception , Peccei contends , is purely an altruistic one . Apparently , the " nobel lie " provided necessary shock treatment " to compel nations to adopt measures of population control ( Executive Intelligence Review Special Report , p. 16 , 1982 ) . In a critique of The Limits to Growth , Christopher Freeman characterized the MIT group as a collective " Malthus with a computer " ( Freeman p. 5 , 1975 ) . <p> In other words , the computer model used by the Club of Rome , like the one now surfacing , is designed not to predict the path of humanity but to steer it . Economist Gunnar Myrdal blasted the models attempt to " impress the innocent general public " while holding " little , if any , scientific validity . " <p> THE ELITES WANT A POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY <p> The Club of Romes Limits to Growth model , like Paul Ehrlichs Population Bomb , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern more than it was meant to be a literal prediction . Thus , " confirming " the model produced by MIT remains a confirmation of the intent to curb societys behavior conveniently through a world government mechanism . <p> This is the basic aim of the United Nations Agenda 21 and other " sustainable development " programs . They hinge on excitement over the depletion of resources , but many assumptions are made that either prove inaccurate , or that rule out the adoption of alternatives . <p> Consider the fact that even mainstream outlets like Bloomberg have had to concede the myth of peak oil , with new discoveries and existing sources making a mockery of claims that the fuel would disappear . Whether or not oil will remain desirable over alternative fuels is a different question , but current sources can easily last the world hundreds of years . <p> Instead , as Alex Jones and Paul Joseph Watson exposed back in 2005 , the ruse is put forward to condition society for artificial scarcity . Cutting off the average humans access to crude is quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online points out , the Club of Rome study has been constantly updated , and moreover , the current " confirmation " dismisses the use of any real alternatives . The possibilities are there , but have the elites chosen not to embrace other solutions ? Why ? <p> Tim Worstall quotes first from Graham Tuners paper : <h> To account for substitutability between resources a simple and robust position has been taken . First , it is assumed here that metals and minerals will not substitute for bulk energy resources such as fossil fuels . <p> Then adds : <h> So if we 're not running out of metals and minerals but we are substituting metals and minerals for fossil fuels then the idea that actually , the Club of Rome were quite right looks a bit odd , does n't it ? <p> The availability of clean water is challenged by many factors , but among them is the widespread contamination with pharmaceuticals and estrogen-mimicking compounds like Bisphenol-A , which have become ubiquitous in consumer life yet oddly are connected with the growing problem of infertility , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending in both human and wildlife populations . <p> Again , the elite are driving these policies . The claim of humanitys potential to over-consume at " unsustainable " levels is not without merit , but it lacks serious focus when it immediately blames the masses instead of those calling the shots . <p> MITs calculations in the Limits to Growth publication are thus a bit fuzzy for these reasons and numerous others . Its not that man is unable to destroy himself that is disputed , but instead it is clear that the oligarchical tier of humanity is bent on achieving the destruction of the bottom 80% of the worlds population . And that is simply not recognized . <p> The strategy is mirrored by Bill Gates , as demonstrated at his 2010 TED talk . There he contrives a formula predicting collapse unless mankind curbs population , energy consumption , services and CO2 output . " Probably one of these numbers has to get pretty close to zero , " Gates quips , hinting at population numbers as the key variable . <p> The elite want to frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately suggesting the negative worth of human individuals . True innovation could get us out of this dilemma , but would those in power entertain such notions ? <p> As Mac Slavo observes , it is the unsustainability of the financial spectrum that is most likely candidate to contribute to widespread death , destruction and loss of standard of living : <h> There is a strong case to be made that the issuance of trillions of dollars in debt over the course of the last several decades , much like oil , will become impossible to sustain . Since the entire system of consumption is essentially based on this debt , if confidence in this system is lost , it may very well have the same initial effect as a peak oil breaking point . Debt , even when fabricated out of thin air , is essentially a promise tied to some sort of resource . It is based on the idea that something will eventually be created by someone in order to make good on the debt . By all accounts , we the people are the collateral for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , it has gotten to the point that the debt " somewhere in the range of $200 trillion in the United States alone " far outweighs our ability to harness enough time and energy to repay the principal with interest . <p> Thus , this peak debt ' created to save us from the unsustainable resource practices we face should be just as big of a concern as peak oil or water . Because when we finally reach the limit of our debt , and it becomes clear that the collateral backing that debt is unable to produce enough yield to pay it back , we 'll have a whole new meaning for the term collateral damage .

Liberati claimed that , thanks to the huge number of Muslim migrants alongside the increasing secularism of native Europeans , Islam will soon become the main religion of Europe . " All of this moral and religious decadence favours Islam " , Archbishop Liberati explained . <p> Archbishop Liberati belongs to a growing branch of Catholic leaders who refuse to see the future belonging to Islam in Europe . They speak in open opposition to Pope Francis , who does not seem too impressed by the collapse of Christianity due to falling birth rates , accompanied by religious apathy and its replacement by Islam . <p> Pope Franciss official vision is personified by Bishop Nunzio Galantino , who was appointed by the Pontiff as the Secretary General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview in which he dismissed any religious motivation behind jihadist attacks and claimed that , instead , " money " is what is behind them . <p> There are now many Catholic commentators who are questioning the Churchs blindness about the danger Europe is facing . One is the cultural editor of the French magazine- Valeurs Actuelles , - Laurent Dandrieu , who writes : <p> " Islam has every chance massively to strengthen its presence in Europe with the blessing of the Church . The Church is watching the establishment of millions of Muslims in Europe and Muslim worship in our continent as an inescapable manifestation of religious freedom . But the civilizational question is simply never asked . By breaking away from the Europes indigenous peoples and their legitimate concerns , the Church is not only leading Europe to an impasse , it is also shooting itself in the foot " . <p> Dandrieu lists- Pope Francis gestures and speeches in favor of Islam and migrants : <p> " On October 1 , 2014 , the Pope received Eritrean survivors of a shipwreck off Lampedusa ; on 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee camp in Ponte Mammolo , northeast of Rome ; on April 18 , he used the first official visit of the new Italian president , Sergio Mattarella , to demand a much larger commitment for migrants ; on 6 September 2015 , at the conclusion of the Angelus in St Peters Square , he called for every parish , religious community , monastery and sanctuary in Europe to host a family of refugees ; on March 24 , 2016 , he chose to celebrate the Holy Thursday in a structure housing 900 refugees , and to wash the feet to twelve asylum seekers ; on May 28 , he received children whose parents died in a boat that sank , filled with migrants ; during the general audience of June 22 , Francis went down to the crowd to bring back fifteen refugees " . <p> " Islam , through the sharia , their law , wants to rule the world and allows violence against the infidels , like Christians .

The population is changing . If this keeps up , in countries such as Italy , the majority will be Muslim ( ) Islam realizes itself in the conquest . And what is the most important achievement ? Rome " . <p> The first to denounce this dramatic trend was Italys most important missionary , Father- Piero Gheddo , who said that , due to falling fertility and Muslim fervor , " Islam would sooner rather than later conquer the majority in Europe " . These concerns do not belong only to the Conservative wing of the Catholic Church . <p> Cardinal Christoph Sch+nborn , Archbishop of Vienna and a candidate tipped to be the next Pope , is very close to Pope Francis , and is a centrist . Last September , on the anniversary of the- Siege of Vienna , when Turkeys Ottoman troops nearly conquered Europe , Sch+nborn delivered a dramatic appeal to save Europes Christian roots .

Now in the last year , or perhaps also in recent years , we have seen : No , there is also evil " . <p> The head of the Czech Roman Catholic Church , Miloslav Vlk , also- warned- about the threat of Islamization . " Muslims in Europe have many more children than Christian families ; that is why demographers have been trying to come up with a time when Europe will become Muslim " , Cardinal Vlk claimed . He also- blamed Europe- itself for the Islamic takeover : <p> " Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the last period that will not continue for decades when it may still have a chance to do something about it . Unless the Christians wake up , life may be Islamised and Christianity will not have the strength to imprint its character on the life of people , not to say society " . <p> Among the Eastern Catholic bishops there are many voices raising concerns about Europes demographic and religious revolution . One belongs to the leader of the- Catholics in Lebanon , who paid an extremely high price for the Islamization of their own country , including murder and exile , and now see the danger coming to Europe itself . " I have heard many times from Muslims that their goal is to conquer Europe with two weapons : faith and the birth rate " , - Cardinal Bechara Rai said . <p> Another voice belongs to the French-born Bishop Paul Desfarges , who heads the diocese of Constantine in Algeria : " Its no surprise that Islam has taken on such importance " , - Desfarges said . " Its an issue that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a discussion of the consequences of the Islamic presence in the Western world " . Pell was echoed by- Laszlo Kiss Rigo , the head of the Catholic Hungarian southern community , who said that " they are not refugees , this is an invasion , they come here with cries of Allahu Akbar , they want to take over " . <p> On the political level , there is another a tendency , that of strong Catholic leaders who challenge Pope Francis on the Islamic question and immigration . The most important is the French presidential candidate Fran+ois Fillon , one of the first politicians who- " does n't  hide the fact that he s Catholic " . Fillon published a book entitled , - Vanquishing Islamic Totalitarianism , and he rose in the polls by vowing to control Islam and immigration : " Weve got to reduce immigration to its strict minimum , " - Fillon said .

However , there are potential roadblocks on the path to independence that may force young adults to live with their parents longer , including a weak job market , the high cost of living , significant college debt , and helping care for an elderly or disabled parent . <p> Unfortunately , it is becoming increasingly difficult for young people to become financially independent. - While they are in high school , we endlessly pound into their heads the need to go to college. - Then we urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay for it , ensuring them that they will be able to get " good jobs " which will enable them to pay off those loans when they graduate . <p> Of course a very large percentage of them find that there are n't  any " good jobs " waiting for them when they graduate. - But because of the crippling loans that they have accumulated , they quickly realize that they have decades of debt slavery ahead of them . <p> Just consider the following numbers about the growth of student loan debt in the United States <p> -The total amount of student loan debt in the United States has risen to a brand new all-time record of- 1.08 trillion dollars . <p> -In the third quarter of 2007 , the student loan delinquency rate was- 7.6 percent. - Today , it is up to- 11.5 percent . <p> This is a- student loan debt bubble- unlike anything that we have ever seen before , and it seems to get worse with each passing year . <p> So when is the bubble going to finally burst ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find jobs . <p> For those in the 18 to 29-year-old age bracket , it is getting even harder to find full-time employment. - In June 2012 , - 47 percent- of those in that entire age group had a full-time job. - One year later , in June 2013 , only43.6 percent- of that entire age group had a full-time job . <p> And in many ways , things are far tougher for those that did n't  finish college than for those that did. - In fact , the unemployment rate for 27-year-old college dropouts is- nearly three times as high- as the unemployment rate for those that finished college . <p> In addition , since Barack Obama has been president- close to 40 percent- of all 27-year-olds have spent at least some time unemployed . <p> So it should be no surprise that 27-year-olds are really struggling financially. - Only about- one out of every five- 27-year-olds owns a home at this point , and an astounding- 80 percent- of all 27-year-olds are in debt . <p> Even if a young adult is able to find a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive on. - The- quality of jobs- in America continues to go downhill and so do wages . <p> The ratio of what men in the 18 to 29-year-old age bracket are earning compared to what the general population is earning is at- an all-time low , and American families that have a head of household that is under the age of 30 have a poverty rate- of 37 percent . <p> No wonder so many young people are living at home. - Trying to survive in the real world is not easy . <p> Many of those that are trying to make it on their own are really struggling to do so. - Just consider the case of Kevin Burgos. - He earns $10.50 an hour working as an assistant manager at a Dunkin Donuts location in Hartford , Connecticut. - According to- CNN , he cant seem to make enough to support his family no matter how hard he works <p> He works 35 hours each week to support his family of three young children . All told , Burgos makes about $1,800 each month . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his two-bedroom apartment , gas for his car , diapers and visits to the doctor , add up to $2,400 . To cover these expenses without falling short , Burgos would need to make at least $17 per hour . <p> " I am always worried about what I 'm going to do for tomorrow , " Burgos said . <p> There are millions of young people out there that are pounding their heads against the wall month after month trying to work hard and do the right thing. - Sometimes they get so frustrated that they snap. - Just consider- the following example <p> Health officials have temporarily shut down a southern West Virginia pizza restaurant after a district manager was caught on surveillance video- urinating into a sink . <p> Local media reported that the Mingo County health department ordered the Pizza Hut in Kermit , about 85 miles southwest of Charleston , to shut down . <p> But as I mentioned earlier , instead of blaming young people for their failures , perhaps we need to take a good , long look at how we have raised them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke , SAT scores are at- an all-time low , and we have pushed nearly all discussion of morality , values and faith out of the public square . <p> No wonder most of our young people are- dumb as a rock- and seem to have no moral compass . @qwx170862

Bill Clinton signed the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect . <p> Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization " another Hillary Clinton-backed deal . Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO , and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State " our chief diplomat with China . She was a disaster , totally unfit for the job . <p> Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology , and I think you 'll get that apology around the same time you 'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails . <p> Another major issue in this campaign has been the border . Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities . So much needless suffering , so much preventable death . I 've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports . <p> I 've embraced the crying parents who 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants . <p> My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities . <p> But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle ?

They certainly do n't get apologies . They 'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton . <p> But they will always come first to me . <p> Listen closely : we will deliver justice for all of these American Families . We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud . <p> Hillary Clinton 's mistakes destroy innocent lives , sacrifice national security , and betray the working families of this country . <p> Please remember this : I will never put personal profit before national security . I will never leave our border open to appease donors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kills American jobs . I will never put the special interests before the national interest . I will never put a donor before a voter , or a lobbyist before a citizen . <p> Instead , I will be a champion for the people . <p> The establishment media does n't cover what really matters in this country , or what 's really going on in people 's lives . They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable , and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said . <p> Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed " she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times . <p> Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities . <p> Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border , or to our closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted . <p> Instead , every story is told from the perspective of the insiders . It 's the narrative of the people who rigged the system , never the voice of the people it 's been rigged against . <p> So many people suffering in silence . No cameras , no coverage , no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else . <p> So again , it 's not about me . It 's never been about me . It 's about all the people in this country who do n't have a voice . <p> I am running to be their voice . <p> I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future . <p> I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again " including some powerful people in my own party . Because it means I am fighting for real change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial lobbyists , the Wall Street investors , are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton . Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor . <p> It 's the powerful protecting the powerful . <p> The insiders fighting for the insiders . <p> I am fighting for you . <p> Here is the change I propose . <p> On terrorism , we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism . <p> We will use military , cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world , and the Middle East , that shares our goal of defeating terrorism . I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens : we will find you , we will destroy you , and we will win . <p> On immigration , we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening can not be performed . All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology , and we will screen out anyone who does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa . If you want to join our society , then you must embrace our society , our values and our tolerant way of life . Those who believe in oppressing women , gays , Hispanics , African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country . <p> We will promote our America values , our American way of life , and our American system of government which are all the best in the world . <p> My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees . Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term , on top of all other immigration . Hillary Clinton is running to be America 's Angela Merkel , and we 've seen how much crime and how many problems that 's caused the German people . <p> We have enough problems already , we do n't need another one . <p> On crime , we are going to add more police , more investigators , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws . <p> The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one . Their day is over . <p> On trade , we are going to renegotiate NAFTA , withdraw from the TPP , stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement , and protect every last American job . <p> Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth . <p> On taxes , we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses " creating millions of new good paying jobs . <p> We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams . <p> On education , we are going to give students choice , and allow charter schools to thrive . We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy . She does n't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process . <p> We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities " and what a big difference that will make . This means a lot to me , and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration . <p> On healthcare , we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare . Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs , premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again , and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina . We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare " at a much lower cost . <p> On political corruption , we are going to restore honor to our government . <p> In my Administration , I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information . No one will be above the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve . <p> I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office , or from any entity tied to a foreign government . <p> Finally , we are going to bring this country together . We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans . We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton , which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future . <p> If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote , the result for them will be amazing . Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership " look at the schools , look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working . It is time for change . <p> What do you have to lose by trying something new ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time . <p> Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted . Because the votes have been automatically there , there has been no reason for Democrats to produce . <p> It is time to break with the failures of the past , and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve . <p> In my Administration , every American will be treated equally , protected equally , and honored equally . We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms , and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people . <p> This is the change I am promising all of you : an honest government , a fair economy , and a just society for each and every American . <p> But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voters say our country is on the wrong track .

The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes . <p> They practically control both parties , write political platforms , make catspaws of party leaders , use the leading men of private organizations , and resort to every device to place in nomination for high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates of corrupt big business . <p> These international bankers and Rockefeller-Standard Oil interests control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country .

McFadden delivered to the U.S. House of Representatives- on June 10 , 1932 Board and the Federal Reserve Banks . The Federal Reserve Board , a Government board , has cheated the Government of the United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the national debt . The depredations and iniquities of the Federal Reserve Board has cost this country enough money to pay the national debt several times over . This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of the United States , has bankrupted itself , and has practically bankrupted our Government . It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates , through the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board , and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it . <p> Sadly , most Americans still believe that the Federal Reserve is a " federal agency " , but that is simply not correct. - The following comes- from factcheck.org <p> The stockholders in the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks are the privately owned banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all national banks ( chartered by the federal government ) and those state-chartered banks that wish to join and meet certain requirements . About 38 percent of the nation 's more than 8,000 banks are members of the system , and thus own the Fed banks . <p> According to researchers that have looked into the ownership of the big Wall Street banks that dominate the Fed , the same names keep coming up over and over : the Rockefellers , the Rothschilds , the Warburgs , the Lazards , the Schiffs and the royal families of Europe . <p> But ultra-wealthy international bankers have not just done this kind of thing in the United States. - Their goal was to create a global financial system that they would dominate and control. - Just check out what Georgetown University history professor Carroll Quigley- once wrote <p> The powers agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences . The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basle , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world 's central banks which were themselves private corporations . <p> Sadly , most Americans have never even heard of the Bank for International Settlements , but it is at the very heart of the global financial system. - The following is- from Wikipedia <p> As an organization of central banks , the BIS seeks to make monetary policy more predictable and transparent among its 58 member central banks . While monetary policy is determined by each sovereign nation , it is subject to central and private banking scrutiny and potentially to speculation that affects foreign exchange rates and especially the fate of export economies .

" The closeness of the Rothschild brothers is seen in a letter from Soloman ( Salmon ) Rothschild to his brother Nathan on Feb. 28 , 1815 , " We are like the mechanism of a watch : each part is essential .

" The boastful statement by Rothschild Bros. of London . <p> In the last century , members of the British Fabian Society dynastic banking families in the City of London financed the Communist takeover of Russia . Trotsky in his biography refers to some of the loans from these British financiers going back as far as 1907 .

The British plan to takeover the World and bring in a " New World Order " began with the teachings of John Ruskin and Cecil Rhodes at Oxford University . Rhodes in one of his wills in 1877 left his vast fortune to Lord Nathan Rothschild as trustee to set up the Rhodes Scholarship Program at Oxford to indoctrinate promising young graduates for the purpose , and also establish a secret society Royal Institute of International Affairs RIIA , which branched into the Round Table , the Bilderbergers , the CFR , the Trilateral , etc Ed for leading business and banking leaders around the World who would work for the City to bring in their Socialist World government . <p> Rothschild appointed Lord Alfred Milner to implement the plan . <p> Benjamin Freedman ( Friedman ) said this in 1961 , Washington ( he was a millionaire insider in international Zionist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also part of the 117-man strong Zionist delegation at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 where Germany was forced into bankruptcy to the Zionist BankLords and social chaos ) : " Two years into WW1 , Germany , which was then winning the war , offered Britain and France a negotiated peace deal , but German Zionist groups seeing the opportunity made a deal with Britain to get the United States into the war if Britain promised to give the Zionists Palestine . " <p> In other words , they made this deal : " We will get the United States into this war as your ally . The price you must pay us is Palestine after you have won the war and defeated Germany , Austria-Hungary , and Turkey . " They made that promise , in October of 1916 .

The German Zionist bankers Rothschilds , Rockefeller , Kuhn Loeb and the other big banking firms in the United States refused to finance France or England to the extent of one dollar . They stood aside and they said : " As long as France and England are tied up with Russia , not one cent !

Discussing the sale of Evelyn Rothschilds stake in Rothschild Continuation Holdings , it states : this requires agreement on the valuation of privately held assets whose value has never been tested in a public market .

It has been available for decades to the entire Worlds current heads of state to allow them anonymity when buying shares . Therefore , when a company publishes a share register and the Bank of England Nominees is listed , it is not possible to gauge whether the Queen , President Bush or even Saddam Hussein is the true shareholder . <p> By this method , the trillionaire masters of the universe remain hidden whilst Forbes magazine poses lower ranking billionaires like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World .

It is possible to analyze conditions that would prevail within a socialist system in which only the supreme tsar determines all activities and all the other individuals efface their own personality and virtually convert themselves into mere tools in the hands of the tsars actions . For the theory of integral socialism it may seem sufficient to consider the valuations and actions of the supreme tsar only . But if one deals with a system in which more than one mans striving after definite ends directs or affects actions , one can not avoid tracing back the effects produced by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can proceed , i.e. , to the value judgments of the individuals and the ends they are aiming at . <p> The macroeconomic approach looks upon an arbitrarily selected segment of the market economy ( as a rule : upon one nation ) as if it were an integrated unit . All that happens in this segment is actions of individuals and groups of individuals acting in concert . But macroeconomics proceeds as if all these individual actions were in fact the outcome of the mutual operation of one macroeconomic magnitude upon another such magnitude . <p> The distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics is , as far as terminology is concerned , borrowed from modern physics distinction between microscopic physics , which deals with systems on an atomic scale , and molar physics , which deals with systems on a scale appreciable to mans gross senses . It implies that ideally the microscopic laws alone are sufficient to cover the whole field of physics , the molar laws being merely a convenient adaptation of them to a special , but frequently occurring problem . Molar law appears as a condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microscopic physics is seen as a progress from a less satisfactory to a more satisfactory method of dealing with the phenomena of reality . <p> What the authors who introduced the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics into the terminology dealing with economic problems have in mind is precisely the opposite . Their doctrine implies that microeconomics is an unsatisfactory way of studying the problems involved and that the substitution of macroeconomics for microeconomics amounts to the elimination of an unsatisfactory method by the adoption of a more satisfactory method . <p> The macroeconomist deceives himself if in his reasoning he employs money prices determined on the market by individual buyers and sellers . A consistent macroeconomic approach would have to shun any reference to prices and to money . The market economy is a social system in which individuals are acting . The valuations of individuals as manifested in the market prices determine the course of all production activities . If one wants to oppose to the reality of the market economy the image of a holistic system , one must abstain from any use of prices . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method by an analysis of one of its most popular schemes , the so-called national income approach . <p> Income is a concept of the accounting methods of profit-seeking business . The businessman serves the consumers in order to make profit . He keeps accounts to find out whether or not this goal has been attained . He ( and likewise also capitalists , investors , who are not themselves active in business , and , of course , also farmers and owners of all kinds of real estate ) compares the money equivalent of all the goods dedicated to the enterprise at two different instants of time and thus learns what the result of his transactions in the period between these two instants was . Out of such a calculation emerge the concepts of profit or loss as contrasted with that of capital . If the owner of the outfit to which this accounting refers calls the profit made " income , " what he means is : If I consume the whole of it , I do not reduce the capital invested in the enterprise . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accountant considers as the profit made by a definite business unit and what the owner of this unit considers as the income derived from the operations of this unit , but also the net earnings of professional people and the salaries and wages of employees . Adding together for the whole of a nation what is income in the sense of accountancy and what is income merely in the sense of the tax laws , one gets the figure called " national income . " <p> The illusiveness of this concept of national income is to be seen not only in its dependence on changes in the purchasing power of the monetary unit . The more inflation progresses , the higher rises the national income . Within an economic system in which there is no increase in the supply of money and fiduciary media , progressive accumulation of capital and the improvement of technological methods of production that it engenders would result in a progressive drop in prices or , what is the same , a rise in the purchasing power of the monetary unit . The amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living would improve , but these changes would not be made visible in the figures of the national income statistics . <p> The concept of national income entirely obliterates the real conditions of production within a market economy . It implies the idea that it is not activities of individuals that bring about the improvement ( or impairment ) in the quantity of goods available , but something that is above and outside these activities . This mysterious something produces a quantity called " national income , " and then a second process " distributes " this quantity among the various individuals . The political meaning of this method is obvious . One criticizes the " inequality " prevailing in the " distribution " of national income . One taboos the question what makes the national income rise or drop and implies that there is no inequality in the contributions and achievements of the individuals that are generating the total quantity of national income . <p> If one raises the question what factors make the national income rise , one has only one answer : the improvement in equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one hand , and the improvement in the utilization of the available equipment for the best possible satisfaction of human wants , on the other hand . The former is the effect of saving and the accumulation of capital , the latter of technological skill and of entrepreneurial activities . If one calls an increase in national income ( not produced by inflation ) economic progress , one can not avoid establishing the fact that economic progress is the fruit of the endeavors of the savers , of the inventors , and of the entrepreneurs . What an unbiased analysis of the national income would have to show is first of all the patent inequality in the contribution of various individuals to the emergence of the magnitude called national income . It would furthermore have to show how the increase in the per-head quota of capital employed and the perfection of technological and entrepreneurial activities benefit " by raising the marginal productivity of labor and thereby wage rates and by raising the prices paid for the utilization of natural resources " also those classes of individuals who themselves did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " national income . " <p> The " national income " approach is an abortive attempt to provide a justification for the Marxian idea that under capitalism goods are " socially " ( gesellschaftlich ) produced and then " appropriated " by individuals . It puts things upside down . In reality , the production processes are activities of individuals cooperating with one another . Each individual collaborator receives what his fellow men " competing with one another as buyers on the market " are prepared to pay for his contribution . For the sake of argument one may admit that , adding up the prices paid for every individuals contribution , one may call the resulting total national income . But it is a gratuitous pastime to conclude that this total has been produced by the " nation " and to bemoan " neglecting the inequality of the various individuals contributions " the inequality in its alleged distribution . <p> There is no nonpolitical reason whatever to proceed with such a summing up of all incomes within a " nation " and not within a broader or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not rather " state income " of the State of New York or " county income " of Westchester County or " municipal income " of the municipality of White Plains ?

Geithner penned a New York Times column , " Welcome to the Recovery . " <p> Without a revolution , Americans are history . <p> As John Williams ( shadowstats.com ) has made clear on many occasions , an appearance of recovery was created by over-counting employment and undercounting inflation . Warnings by Williams , Gerald Celente , and myself have gone unheeded , but our warnings recently had echoes from Boston University professor Laurence Kotlikoff and from David Stockman , who excoriated the Republican Party for becoming big-spending Democrats . <p> It is encouraging to see some realization that , this time , Washington can not spend the economy out of recession . The deficits are already too large for the dollar to survive as reserve currency , and deficit spending can not put Americans back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , the solutions offered by those who are beginning to recognize that there is a problem are discouraging . Kotlikoff thinks the solution is savage Social Security and Medicare cuts or equally savage tax increases or hyperinflation to destroy the vast debts. - <p> Perhaps economists lack imagination , or perhaps they do n't  want to be cut off from Wall Street and corporate subsidies , but Social Security and Medicare are insufficient at their present levels , especially considering the erosion of private pensions by the dot com , derivative and real estate bubbles . Cuts in Social Security and Medicare , for which people have paid 15 per cent of their earnings all their lives , would result in starvation and deaths from curable diseases. - <p> Tax increases make even less sense . It is widely acknowledged that the majority of households can not survive on one job . Both husband and wife work and often one of the partners has two jobs in order to make ends meet . Raising taxes makes it harder to make ends meetthus more foreclosures , more food stamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks this is a solution ? <p> Ah , but we will tax the rich . The rich have enough money . They will simply stop earning . <p> Let 's get real. - Here is what the government is likely to do. - Once - Washington realize that the dollar is at risk and that they can no longer finance their wars by borrowing abroad , the government will either levy a tax on private pensions on the grounds that the pensions have accumulated tax-deferred , or the government will require pension fund managers to purchase Treasury debt with our pensions . This will buy the government a bit more time while pension accounts are loaded up with worthless paper. - <p> The last Bush budget deficit ( 2008 ) was in the $400-500 billion range , about the size of the Chinese , Japanese , and OPEC trade surpluses with the US . Traditionally , these trade surpluses have been recycled to the US and finance the federal budget deficit . In 2009 and 2010 the federal deficit jumped to $1,400 billion , a back-to-back trillion dollar increase . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this large . From where comes the money ? <p> The answer is from individuals fleeing the stock market into " safe " Treasury bonds and from the bankster bailout , not so much the TARP money as the Federal Reserves exchange of bank reserves for questionable financial paper such as subprime derivatives . The banks used their excess reserves to purchase Treasury debt . <p> These financing maneuvers are one-time tricks . Once people have fled stocks , that movement into Treasuries is over . The opposition to the bankster bailout likely precludes another . So where does the money come from the next time ? <p> The Treasury was able to unload a lot of debt thanks to " the Greek crisis , " which the New York banksters and hedge funds multiplied into " the euro crisis . " The financial press served as a financing arm for the US Treasury by creating panic about European debt and the euro . Central banks and individuals who had taken refuge from the dollar in euros were panicked out of their euros , and they rushed into dollars by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ r t i s e m e n t <p> openx:49 <p> This movement from euros to dollars weakened the alternative reserve currency to the dollar , halted the dollars decline , and financed the US budget deficit a while longer . <p> Possibly the game can be replayed with Spanish debt , Irish debt , and whatever unlucky country is eswept in by the thoughtless expansion of the European Union . <p> But when no countries remain that can be destabilized by Wall Street investment banksters and hedge funds , what then finances the US budget deficit ? <p> The only remaining financier is the Federal Reserve . When Treasury bonds brought to auction do not sell , the Federal Reserve must purchase them . The Federal Reserve purchases the bonds by creating new demand deposits , or checking accounts , for the Treasury . As the Treasury spends the proceeds of the new debt sales , the US money supply expands by the amount of the Federal Reserves purchase of Treasury debt . <p> Do goods and services expand by the same amount ? - Imports will increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus worsening the trade deficit. - When the Federal Reserve purchases the Treasurys new debt issues , the money supply will increase by more than the supply of domestically produced goods and services . Prices are likely to rise . <p> How high will they rise ? The longer money is created in order that government can pay its bills , the more likely hyperinflation will be the result . <p> The economy has not recovered . By the end of this year it will be obvious that the collapsing economy means a larger than $1.4 trillion budget deficit to finance . Will it be $2 trillion ? Higher ? - <p> Whatever the size , the rest of the world will see that the dollar is being printed in such quantities that it can not serve as reserve currency . At that point wholesale dumping of dollars will result as foreign central banks try to unload a worthless currency. - <p> The collapse of the dollar will drive up the prices of imports and offshored goods on which Americans are dependent . Wal-Mart shoppers will think they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also explode as a growing money supply chases the supply of goods and services still made in America by Americans . <p> The dollar as reserve currency can not survive the conflagration . When the dollar goes the US can not finance its trade deficit . Therefore , imports will fall sharply , thus adding to domestic inflation and , as the US is energy import-dependent , there will be transportation disruptions that will disrupt work and grocery store deliveries . <p> Panic will be the order of the day . <p> Will farms will be raided ? Will those trapped in cities resort to riots and looting ? <p> Is this the likely future that " our " government and " our patriotic " corporations have created for us ? <p> To borrow from Lenin , " What can be done ?

What fool in Washington thinks that China is going to finance US hegemony over China ? - <p> The only way that the US will again have an economy is by bringing back the offshored jobs . The loss of these jobs impoverished Americans while producing oversized gains for Wall Street , shareholders , and corporate executives . These jobs can be brought home where they belong by taxing corporations according to where value is added to their product . If value is added to their goods and services in China , corporations would have a high tax rate . If value is added to their goods and services in the US , corporations would have a low tax rate . <p> This change in corporate taxation would offset the cheap foreign labor that has sucked jobs out of America , and it would rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society. - <p> If the wars are not immediately stopped and the jobs brought back to America , the US is relegated to the trash bin of history . <p> Obviously , the corporations and Wall Street would use their financial power and campaign contributions to block any legislation that would reduce short-term earnings and bonuses by bringing jobs back to America . Americans have no greater enemies than Wall Street and the corporations and their prostitutes in Congress and the White House . <p> The neocons allied with Israel , who control both parties and much of the media , are strung out on the ecstasy of Empire. - <p> The United States and the welfare of its 300 million people can not be restored unless the neocons , Wall Street , the corporations , and their servile slaves in Congress and the White House can be defeated . <p> Without a revolution , Americans are history . <p> Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is the father of Reaganomics and the former head of policy at the Department of Treasury .
