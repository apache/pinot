Thanks to a high level of adaptability , leaders stay strong , relevant and optimistic during hard times . These hard times including periods of failure , financial problems , family or work issues , and bankruptcy . <p> Regardless of the situation , leaders aim to shape their new environments and turn their failures into opportunities . If you 're unwilling to adapt to something new , here are a few baby steps to- try- in order to become more adaptable in life . <h> 1 . Stop whining <p> What do you do when something terrible happens ? Say , I 'll handle it , ' or God , it 's the end of the world and my life ' ? <p> Majority of people start whining as soon as they find themselves in a difficult situation . It 's normal but this reaction leads to nowhere . <p> If you 're one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , learn to accept the situation , adapt to it and move on . <h> 2 . There 's no right ' and wrong ' <p> Eliminate wrong ' beliefs from your life . We used to believe that many things are wrong ' and must be avoided , but it 's not the case if you want to be successful . <p> Be bold enough to try things that others run away from . This trait has helped many successful people build companies , corporations , and fortune . <h> 3 . Improve your coping mechanism <p> The way you deal with personal and professional setbacks may significantly affect your future success . Discover your coping mechanism and consider changing some aspects of it . <p> If you usually switch strategies to overcome various life challenges , try to forge ahead , learn from mistakes and try again . Do n't run away from them . Instead , change what 's not working with your coping mechanism . <h> 5 . Have the whole alphabet for your plan <p> Successful things do n't happen overnight . And this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first three letters of it . When Plan A does n't work , switch to Plan B. If it still does n't work , move to Plan C. If 20 plans do n't work , move to Plan W or Y. This way , no change will scare you . <h> 6 . Engage in a positive self-talk <p> I 'm not telling you to sit and talk to yourself every morning or evening . That 's kind of madness , right ? But positive self-talk every now and then can help you adapt to any changes faster , especially if you have no one to encourage and support you during the rough times . <h> 7 . Stick to your natural inclinations <p> If a situation does n't come naturally and you have trouble coping with it , turn to your natural inclinations . If you 're an extrovert who draws the strength and inspiration from talking to other people , no matter whether they 're family members or total strangers , make sure you talk to them . <p> If you 're an introvert , spend some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a solution . If you 're introverted extrovert or extroverted introvert , follow your intuition and do what you feel is right to you . <h> 8 . Think big <p> You can greatly improve your adaptability by learning to think big . Break through the limitations you 've set for yourself . Let go of them . Expand your horizons . Set realistic goals and you will never feel like you failed . <p> All of these will- not only help you be more adaptable in the future , but will also show you the road to success . <h> 9 . Do n't blame yourself <p> and others , if you have this habit . Adaptable people know their personalities and they always keep reinventing themselves in order to adapt . They do n't blame themselves for mistakes , failures , rejections , traits and doubts . They do realize that if they ca n't change it , they must accept it . <p> Blaming yourself or others is just a waste of time . Focus on improvement , not the past . <h> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all aspects of life is great , but you risk ending up feeling miserable in case of a failure . Create a balanced life , instead . After all , it 's impossible to adapt to all changes in all aspects of life , no matter how strong you are . <p> When you 're balanced , you feel grounded , calm , clear-headed , inspired and motivated . Take time to look at your life , and figure out the aspects of it that you are either neglecting or paying too much attention to . <p> You know you 're in a state of imbalance when you do n't  good and- you're- stretching- yourself to fill the gaps . <h> 11 . Stop waiting <p> for the right time , right place , success , happiness , money , people , you name it . Just stop waiting . <p> When it comes to adaptability , there 's no right ' moment . You have to take action to cope with the hard stuff . You can either influence or accept it . There 's no other choice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a part of life . It 's vital for a happy life . Although some people are adaptable to circumstances by nature , you can master this skill as well . It will take time , patience and effort , but it will all be worth it in the end . @qwx77 <p> James is the CEO and founder of Entrepreneurboy .

@@2098359 <p> Just imagine for a second you could make all your dreams come true , achieve anything you want and succeed in all your undertakings . Wouldnt this be absolutely amazing ? <p> And you know what ? Achieving outstanding success actually is n't even that complicated . I am not saying it will be easy , because there will be all sorts of obstacles and challenges on your way . <p> But , the process itself is very simple . It takes only 7 steps to achieve extraordinary success and to make your dreams come true . All of those 7 steps are crucially important and none of them should be neglected . <p> #1 : Define your goals and become crystal clear about what you want <p> First , you need to become clear of what you really want . Sometimes , we think we desperately want certain things , but upon deeper reflection , we realize that those things are not really that important to us . <p> Once you are clear about what you want , write down your goals . Be as specific as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write and talk about your goals as if they were already realized , because at a more subtle level they are already reality . <p> Do n't  just write down your goals and forget about them . Take at least 5-10 minutes every day to " get into the energy of your goals " . Read your goal definition once or several times a day . If you want , re-write your goals or add additional elements and ideas . While reading your goals , feel as if they were already your reality , add all your emotions and make them come alive . <p> #2 : Dismiss all thoughts and beliefs that are not aligned with your goals <p> Everything starts with a thought . Certain thoughts lead to success , others lead to failure . If you want to achieve your goals , you need to become aware of your thoughts and beliefs and change them if necessary . <p> This is n't really very difficult , it is only a matter of practice and becoming more aware of your thoughts . <p> For example , if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thoughts like : " I will always be poor " , " money just slips to my fingers " <p> First , learn to become aware of all those thoughts that are not aligned with your goals and whenever they arise , just dismiss them . Simply refuse to follow those streams of negative thoughts and replace them with more positive ones . <p> For example , say : " no matter what , I will make it things are already getting better for me nothing can stop me and I will easily overcome all obstacles " <p> You wont be able to completely change the quality of your thoughts in one or two days . But , if you really want to , you will be able to do it in maybe 2 or 3 months and from there on your life will change completely . <p> As often as possible during the day , ask yourself if your thoughts are aligned with your goals and if they are not , simply dismiss them and replace them with better ones . This quickly becomes a habit and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #3 : Add some fuel to get there quicker <p> Once you are able to control your thoughts , you are already moving towards your goals with pretty big steps . But , you can move even faster , by adding some energy to the process . <p> I am talking about your e-motions ( energy in motion ) . The strongest emotions are love and passion for what you are doing . However , at the beginning it is not always easy to build up those strong emotions that will pull you forward almost effortlessly . <p> That 's why you need certain tools that help you to get into the " flow " . And , one of the best tools are visualizing and day-dreaming . Take a few minutes several times a day and visualize yourself as having already accomplished your goals . <p> Add all your emotions see it , feel it , hear it Make it as lively as possible . And , most important , have fun day-dreaming and enjoy it as much as possible . It is very important to let go , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy what you are doing , you are doing it 100% right . <p> If you cant fully enjoy it , you probably have to play a bit more and be less serious . By all means , do n't  treat this as an exercise you have to do x times a day in order to get <p> If you are not in the flow , if you are not enjoying it , it wont work . <p> #4 : Believe in your success <p> If you cant believe in your success , you wo n't succeed . However , if you are starting out on a big project it is perfectly normal if you cant fully believe in your success right from the start . <p> Belief usually grows over time . You learn to control your thoughts , you prepare and re-program your subconscious mind by reading and visualizing your goals every day , you have a bit of success here and there and you start believing more and more in the materialization of your goals . <p> Ask yourself , what keeps you from fully believing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on from your parents , teachers , friends and they usually can be destroyed fairly easily . <p> Whatever you want to achieve , there probably has already been someone , maybe even hundreds or thousands of people who already did it . Many of them may have even done it under circumstances that were more complicated than yours . <p> If others can do it , you can do it as well . Read some biographies and success stories and you will realize that all those hugely successful people have n't necessarily been more talented or intelligent than the average person . They did n't  necessarily have any of those big connections , many of them do n't  even have a college degree <p> #5 : Develop the discipline to do what needs to be done and take action <p> No matter how much you visualize and how well you control your thoughts , if you do n't  take action , nothing will happen . <p> Ideally , the taking action part should happen naturally out of the love and passion for what you are doing . But , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting , or you may have periods where you feel a bit less passionate and that 's when you will need some discipline to get going , to get started and to take some action . <p> But , this does n't  necessarily mean forcing and pushing yourself for months and years . No , just a slight push here and there to get started . The more you practice discipline , the easier it gets . <p> Also , you will realize that most of the time you will need some discipline only to get started . Usually , you will get into the flow after only 10-15 minutes and from there on , taking action is easy and fun . <p> Yes , in order to achieve big things you need to take massive action . But , I 'm not talking about years of hard work , I 'm talking about inspired action that naturally flows out of your passion and feels like play and fun . <p> Do what you love and learn to love what you need to do . There is no point in wasting years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be a reward somewhere in the distant future . <p> #6 : Just take one little step after another <p> If you jump on a big project , you may quickly feel overwhelmed . It may seem to be impossible to get from where you are at the moment to where you want to be and you may start doubting if you will ever succeed . <p> The problem is , our limited conscious mind oftentimes can not grasp how to overcome certain challenges and it says : " It is not possible ! " <p> Do n't  listen to it . Just follow the process think thoughts that are aligned with your goals , visualize and see yourself as having already achieved your goals , take one baby step after another And actually , that 's really all you can do . If you follow this path , your bigger , subconscious mind will find ways to make your dreams come true . <p> Be patient , success does n't  happen overnight and it never happens in a linear fashion . For quite some time , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your success are opening . <p> You meet the right people that help you to drive your project forward , a brilliant idea pops into your head seemingly out of nowhere , the media start talking about you there are thousands of ways and possibilities . <p> All you need to do is to keep on moving forward and to take one small step after another . <p> Never forget : All big achievements are the result of thousands of tiny baby steps and not just a few big steps . <p> #7 : Have faith in the process and do n't  judge your current situation <p> So , you changed the quality of your thoughts , you have fun with your daily visualizations , you take a lot of action However , your outer reality still seems to be the same . What is wrong here ? <p> You may have " practiced " certain thought and core beliefs over years , maybe even decades and it takes some time to get this energy out of your system . <p> Just be patient and do n't  worry too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary , and they will change . What you experience right now , is nothing but a reflection of your past thoughts and feelings . Be assured , your outer circumstances will soon align with your new inner vibration . <p> Unfortunately , many people lose their faith at this stage and fall back into their old habits of negativity and all the great work that has been done so far is wiped out . <p> Even if you would not be able to realize your dream , would n't it be worth it to replace negative , destructive , worrisome thoughts with positive and uplifting ones ? <p> Wouldnt it be worth it to spend a few minutes every day visualizing yourself as someone happy , healthy , successful ? <p> Wouldnt it be worth it , finding your passion and having fun taking action on your ideas and inspiration ? <p> Do n't  worry , this 7-step process works and it already helped thousands of people to succeed . But even if it would not work you would still greatly benefit from it . <p> No matter what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , health and vitality , finding your dream partner , having a hugely successful professional career those 7 steps always work and you can use them to achieve pretty much anything you want . <p> However , the biggest reward is n't so much the final achievement , but the path itself . The biggest joy lies in experiencing your own transformation . Watching the " old you " turning into the " new you " , which is courageous , full of passion , equipped with iron will power , joyous and happy <p> The final outcome , the achievement of your goal is only the icing on the cake . Experiencing yourself as the architect and master of your life and realizing that you can achieve and materialize anything you put your mind on is actually far more delicious than the final act of holding the fruits of your achievement in your hands . <p> Written on 10/24/2013 by Robert Spadinger .

@@2098362 <h> 10 Steps to Handle Relationship Conflicts <p> Every relationship experiences some conflict . Some experience more than others , some are playful , and some are hateful . Then there are those that are never ending patterns of conflict that seem impossible to break . <p> If you do want to stop the cycle of conflict , consider these 10 steps to bring harmony back to your relationship . Note that this does n't  only apply to parents and girlfriends , these can apply to conflicts at work as well . <p> Cool Down Time . If you 've found yourself in a heated argument , the best thing you can do is walk away for a little while . Blow off some steam with a walk or by talking things out with a clear headed friend . If you just need some rest , take a nap or a meditation nap . <p> Before going separate ways , take a deep breath and agree to discuss the issue later . The whole goal of separating should be to come back together with a better ability to work things out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in your positions , always remember the humanity of the other person . Keep in mind their weaknesses and frailties . Think about the respect you want and then give it unconditionally to the other person . Be kind even if you are angry . If that makes you cry instead of screaming , you 'll probably find that yourself getting closer to the true root of the issue . When you get to the root , you can start solving things . <p> Start with Yourself . Ask yourself what part of the argument is your responsibility . How did you contribute to this argument ? What can you do to resolve it ? Do you need to apologize ? Do you know how ? This video taught me the 3 steps to a proper apology : <p> I 'm sorry . <p> It was my fault . <p> How can I make it right again ? <p> What 's It All About ? From your perspective , what is the argument really about ? What would the other person say the argument is about ? What common goals do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a resolution ? <p> Needs vs . Wants . Figure out what it is that you want . Then ask yourself , " what do I really need ? " Go for what you need and be flexible on your wants . A need is something you cant live without and a want is more of a preference . A resolution does n't  mean you get everything you want , but hopefully you get everything that you need . If you cant get what you need then you may need to re-evaluate the relationship . <p> Compassion and Empathy . How is the other person feeling ? How would it feel to be in their shoes ? Be honest . What are their fears behind the anger ? Focus on the good qualities in the other person and consider what their goals are . <p> Wisdom and Strengths . What are the best qualities of this person ? What wisdom do they possess ? Everyone is smart about something . How can you tap into that wisdom to help you move forward out of conflict ? What can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to Be Right . Conflict can be hurtful and damaging to a relationship when allowed to run wild . Take a step back to view the big picture . What do you really want ? What is your goal ? At the end of your life , how will you view this argument ? What will you wish you did ? How can you emerge from this conflict and return to a light and peaceful state ? <p> Mutual Caring . What good things do you want for your partner ? How can you help that person get what they need while you get what you need , either actively or by taking a step back ? <p> Good Times Together . Often we can get into a pattern of conflict with partners and friends when we are not finding time to share fun together . So once the immediate conflict is resolved or at least semi-resolved , take some action that will have long-term benefits . Schedule in fun time together on a regular basis . A good place to start is once a week . Designate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No discussion of trigger topics , just fun . Enjoy ! <p> How do you resolve conflicts ?

@@2098366 <h> 8 Harsh Truths that Will Improve Your Life <p> They say life is what we make of it . By the end of this post , I hope to have helped you decide whether that statement is true or not . <p> There is no doubt that life has its ups and downs . However , how we deal with them can sometimes make all the difference . Today I want to share eight harsh truths that Ive come to learn from life . There 's also a message in each that I think we can all learn from , and when applied , will improve our lives infinitely . <p> Some of these lessons may be old-hat for you . If so , look for ways to refine the idea to ensure your getting the most out of it . On the other hand , you may completely disagree with an idea or two and that 's great ! Let us know your thoughts so we can all learn from each other . <p> Friends Come and Go When I was in high school , I always imagined spending most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized I had to move to college , that all changed . Once again , I made some close college friends but left them all behind when I moved from the UK to South Africa . <p> Friends will always come and go in your life ; even though I 'm back in the UK now , all my friends are in university around the country and not exactly in meeting distance . It can be a hard thing to accept , but many of the friends you spend time with now , might not be around in the next few years . <p> Important Lesson:There are an abundance of amazing people out there for you to meet and build relationships with . If you do n't  have many friends , do n't  stress , there are literally billions of friendship possibilities . <p> You Wont Always Get What You Want I remember one Christmas when the only thing I had asked for was some second hand turntables for DJing . I did n't  ask for anything else so I was pretty sure I would get them . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save for 10 months on my own in order to purchase them. - <p> You wo n't always get what you want in life : people are going to be late , people will let you down , items you want wont always be available . <p> Many People Will Love You , but Many Will Not Whether you are a celebrity , a charity worker or just a normal guy , there are going to be people that love you and what you do , but there 's also going to be plenty people that do n't  like you . There are many possible reasons such as jealousy , similarities to them , or just not being someones type . <p> Important Lesson : Not everyone is always going to like you , and that 's fine . If people want to spend time talking about you then that is their problem . You are perfect as you are . You should n't need everyone to like you to have some form of self-esteem . <p> Nobody Can Transform Your Life Like You Can Wouldnt it be lovely if we did n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read a paragraph of a blog post and become a perfect public speaker ? Or , would n't it be nice if our friends could do daring things , and we would benefit from them as well ? - <p> The support and help of others can only take you so far , you 're going to have to do your own thing to make big changes in your life situation . <p> Important Lesson : Do things for yourself and learn to stand on your own two feet . People you rely on wont be around forever , and you do n't  want to have to use others as a crutch to get anywhere in life . <p> You Are Going to Fail I built more than 7 websites before I created one that actually started making me any money . I even put hundreds of hours into my own company that I actually closed down last month . Whether it is exams , projects , companies , or even the odd pub quiz , there are times when you will fail to meet your goals. - <p> As the saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Important Lesson : You can learn a lot from others , but it is your own failures that are going to teach you the most valuable lessons in life . Learn from your failures , embrace them , and use them to drive you on to success . <p> Rain Will Sometimes Cancel Play On some occasions when you have your shorts on and you 're ready for the beach , its going to rain . Or , when you get to that first hole and you 're ready to tee off the clouds will open . Things are n't  always going to go how you would like them to. - <p> Important Lesson:Dont stress about the things that you ca n't control . Learn to live with things that happen . You cant change the past , but you can change how you react to things . <p> There May Be No Tomorrow At least , not for you anyway . We never know what is around the corner , a car crash , a heart attack ; heckeven the end of the world is possible . Let 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are 70 years old , that 's certainly not always the case . There will be one day that is our last. - <p> Important Lesson:Make the most of each day . Make sure the people you care about actually know it , do n't  worry about little matters , just make sure you spend time doing the things you love . <p> Someone Else Will Always Have More Whether it is money , partners , friends or even blog subscribers , there will always be areas where other people have more than you . That is n't to say you cant become abundant in whatever you want ( i.e. someone always had more money than Warren Buffett until 2008 when he was noted to be the richest man in the world ) . - <p> The wanting of more actually holds a very important lesson <p> Important Lesson:Just because someone has more , that does n't  mean they are happy . Read the biography of any celebrity and they will tell you they enjoy their process of earning money , rather than what money can do to make them happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not what the thing you love can get you . <p> BONUS : Linking all the lessons here together is actually quite simple , and I can share the majority of what you need to know to enjoy life in a few simple bullet points : <p> Live life for the moment- <p> Accept what is , even if things do n't  go your way- <p> Happiness is here , right now if you stop resisting and start accepting- <p> I hope you all enjoyed my slightly unique take on the topic of improving your life .

@@2098372 <h> How To Be A Better You , In 14 Steps or Less <p> In theory we all want to be better ; better friends , better spouses , better people , whatever . <p> But getting there is easier said than done . <p> When you think about becoming better do you picture becoming someone else ? Someone you admire ? <p> If so , you are looking at it all wrong . <p> In order to become better you need to focus on being a better you , not changing yourself into another person . <p> That just wo n't work . You are unique , one of a kind , and priceless . However we can all use improvement . Do n't focus on becoming perfect or rich or famous . Even if you could it would n't make you a better you . What are some realistic steps you can take to be a better you ? Try these fourteen : <p> 1. - - - Work Hard " I know , it seems counterintuitive , but hard work does pay off . There is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean you should buckle down and do your nine to five job for twelve hours . That 's not what I mean . Working hard can mean working on a project or hobby , cleaning , taking care of kids , or whatever you do that makes you feel like you have accomplished something worthwhile . Working hard does not mean burning yourself out either . If you are cranky and mean when you talk to other then you are not working hard , you are just wearing yourself out . Hard work makes you feel positive and uplifted , like you can accomplish anything . Find out what makes you feel like this and then pursue it . You may change your mind several times throughout your life and that 's okay too . Remember that change is normal . <p> 2. - - - Have Friends You Can Talk To " Another thing you need to be a better you is good friends . I am not talking about party friends , or shopping friends , or football buddies . I am talking about real relationships with real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can talk to about anything and vice versa . Sharing your problems and victories is an essential part of growing as a person . These friends can help you stay on the right path and keep you from wandering off . They can keep you accountable and build you up when you feel like a failure . They can also help you to think straight when you get tired and burnt out . Friends are more important than you would think . It is worth your time and effort to find some good ones . <p> 3. - - - Let Go of the Bad " The first step to being happy is letting go of the bad things in your life . Being a better you means you need to let go of what is holding you back . Often times the hard times , the hurts , the pain , the injustices we have gone through have a way of holding us down . Like an anchor they hold us in a sea of confusion no matter how hard the winds of change blow . Cast off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . It does n't matter what happened in your childhood , your teens , your younger years or even yesterday . What matters is what you choose to do with today . Hurts can blind us to opportunities in the present , can hold us back out of a sense of fear , and can keep us from being who we really are . Letting go is not easy but it is doable . Do not keep those hurts in mind . Release them and keep your mind on the future and the present so that you can be fully there . <p> 4. - - - Adapt to New Normals " Even in the present there will be things we do n't like . Hard bosses , difficult situations , hurtful comments can all weigh us down . However there is something great about being human . You can adapt . Fighting change is a lost cause . Change will happen whether you like it or not . Instead go with the flow and see where it takes you . Even if you do n't think it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The point is to adapt without losing track of who you are and what your standards are . By keeping your center in the midst of change you can learn what you are really all about and what wo n't change even when everything else does . <p> 5. - - - Forget the Word Should " In my life I have burdened myself unnecessarily with the word should ' . I should be a better person . I should do more of this and less of that . I should be there for them . I should get more done . Should and more are deadly terms . They imply that what and who you are is not enough . However this is a lie . You are human and the only thing you should be doing more of is being more YOU . Most of us are doing the best we can at the moment . We might not feel like we are doing our best , we might even berate ourselves for not living up to our potential ' but if you back away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking in that way is just holding you back . Embrace what you are doing and let that be enough . <p> 6. - - - Now is the Time " Looking to the future is all well and good , but do n't let future plans cloud your now . Now is the time to follow your dreams and become a better you . It is hard to disregard things like enough money , enough knowledge , etc. , but there will NEVER be enough . You can spend your whole life saving , learning and wishing for a dream that you never accomplish . Instead , make your dreams a reality now . Even if it is just one step towards your dream you will be that much closer . Plot out the steps and break it down into things you can actually accomplish . Then every day will be now and every day you will be closer to living your dream and being a better you . <p> 7. - - - Embrace Emotion , But Act on Logic " I have always been a logical person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . It was disheartening and futile . Then I turned it around and let my emotions have the reigns . Chaos ! Finally I figured out that there must be a balance . To be a better you , you must embrace both emotion and logic . Logic helps you to make effective plans and get ahead . Emotions help you to understand what it is you dream about doing and being . Together they offer the complete picture of who you are and what you want out of life . Only by embracing both can you succeed . <p> 8. - - - Turn It Off " Shockingly , being connected all the time is not good for you . How can you figure out who you are when you are being bombarded with other people telling you who you should be ? Turn it off ! The cell phones , the television , the internet , music , social media , whatever it is . Being alone , truly alone , and quiet is a great way to think clearly and focus on what your own thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the madness or let yourself be drowned out by the noise of others . It is simple . Just turn it off . <p> 9. - - - Be Consistent " Everyone has their ups and downs . Some days you feel energetic and happy , other days you feel down and lethargic . However the best way to function in all circumstances is to be consistent . Do you smile and say hello on good days ? Do it on bad days too . Keeping consistent is a great way to even out your moods and become more centered . It might seem fake and trite at first , but you will find that once you have a pattern set you are not weighed down by should have dones ' and regrets . Living every day consistently means you never do less than your best , even when you feel less than your best . <p> 10. - - - Find Your Happy Place " Everyone should have a happy place . This is a place where you feel peaceful , protected , at home . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love being outside . Any tree can be my happy place . Some people love being in their car , others love to take long , hot baths , still others like a cozy reading corner . Find what makes you happy and take time every day to enjoy it . It will recharge your batteries and help you to remember who you are . <p> 11. - - - Dance and Sing " As silly as it seems , dancing and singing along to your favorite songs can help you to be a better you . Even if you are not good at it you can still enjoy it . Music lifts you up and movement makes you feel alive . Embrace the silly and release your body to do what it loves ! <p> 12. - - - No Such Thing as Perfect " Another big obstacle I have had in my life is a struggle for perfection . I have always thought that if I was just perfect I could fix everything , do everything , and make everyone happy . However perfection is far beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is perfect someone else will be able to do it better , faster , or find something wrong with it . Perfection should not be your goal . Instead , try to think about balance . Doing what needs to be done instead of doing everything . You can easily overwhelm yourself by trying to take too much on . Take on only what is important ; what is worthyour time and effort . In doing so you not only become a better you , but you also allow those around you to become better too . <p> 13. - - - Step Out of Your Comfort Zone " You will never learn or grow without stepping outside of your comfort zone . As people we get comfortable in a certain situation , even if it is not good for us . Stepping outside of this can seem scary , but in truth it is usually very good for us . From attending a new social event to finding a new job to starting a new hobby there is always something you can do to learn and grow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown most as a person ? It is usually when you stepped out on aledge and pushed yourself to try something new . <p> 14. - - - Help Someone Else " Last but not least , helping others is a great way to become better yourself . By getting out of your own head and sympathizing with the needs of others you can understand yourself better . Do n't be a closed off person too wrapped up in your own needs to see what is really out there . Making connections and forming relationships is whatit is all about . No man is an island and by helpingothers you can form connections that will last . You can start small as even helping one person can make a big impact on both your life and theirs . <p> As you can see , there are many ways to become a better you . You are one of a kind and your ambitions and talents should not be wasted simply because you are too afraid or too comfortable to step out there .

@@2098386 <h> How To Make Sure That People Do n't  Take You For Granted <p> You are always going to deal with situations where people just do n't  seem to be grateful for all that you do for them . You are always going to encounter people in life who take advantage of you and take you for granted . <p> This maybe the case in your personal life as well as your professional life . Some of these people may work with you , or they maybe your bosses . <p> Others may be people who claim to be friends . Still others may be people who are a part of your family or maybe your relatives . They might even be your romantic partner . <p> Being taken for granted never feels nice in life . It feels even more terrible when you are giving it your all because you love the person . So how do you deal with people who are ungrateful and pretty much use you all the time even if your very existence is crucial to their lives ? <p> Here are 5 ways in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted . <h> 1 ) Tell them how you feel <p> Initially you need to give people the benefit of the doubt . Sometimes these people do not even know that their actions are hurtful or that they are mistreating you . They may not be a bad person but they might lack the ability to see things from others point of view instinctively . <p> So initially , it is a good idea to let them know clearly that you feel you are being taken for a ride . If you feel people at work are using you and are not paying you enough , then tell your boss about it. - Why would any of your superiors raise your salary if you make it appear like you are perfectly happy working for much less than you deserve . <p> If you are not happy with the way your partner is treating you , then first you need to tell them . Do n't  expect them to be all knowing beings who are supposed to know the moment something begins to bother you . <p> Many people often expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . On the other hand their partners often have no idea what they did wrong. - If you are upset with your partner with the way they are treating you , then tell them , and tell them clearly ! <p> Many times , implementing this point alone maybe enough . People may understand that you were hurt and are being treated unfairly so there is a good chance that for many of you , your problem will be sorted . <p> However , there will be others who- will pay no heed to what you say . The next steps four steps will be helpful in those scenarios . <h> 2 ) Stop being a people pleaser all the time . <p> Some people have been mentally programmed with the idea that they ought to make others happy under all circumstances . They try so hard to make people happy that it backfires . <p> Instead of earning others admiration , these people are just seen as vulnerable targets that can be controlled and used . They are not respected or admired . How can one admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not asking you to be rude but you do n't  have to always be a yes man ( or woman ) to everyone all the time . I had this problem when I was young . I had been brought up with this idea that you should always be nice to people which in itself is n't a bad thing . But when you begin to over-generalize it and let people use you , it becomes a big problem . <p> There have been many times where I have had to compromise my own happiness to make others happy . But then I realized there is no joy in making others happy if it makes you depressed . <p> One of the reasons why people find it so hard to say no is because they are scared of being judged . They are scared of what others will think of them once they change their attitude and stop saying yes to everything . <p> Well , here is some information for you : <p> People will form an opinion on you NO MATTER WHAT you do . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at you and tell others how simple it is to take advantage of you . If you say no , they are going to complain about how you have now become arrogant and tough to deal with . <p> People are never going to stop forming opinions so why care what they think ? Its not like you got tons of respect for saying yes to everything earlier ! The only difference is , this time you are actually happy for choosing what you want to do instead of doing what you are forced to do . <h> 3 ) Never be too dependent on someone else <p> It is pitiful to see how the vast majority of us , especially those in corporate jobs are still slaves in a way and get little respect from their superiors despite the fact that they are hugely talented . <p> Now , do n't  get me wrong , without a doubt , even this so called slavery is a million times superior to " genuine slavery . " However , treating people with respect never hurts . <p> People say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because at least they are making money there . Now , there is nothing wrong with materialistic success . In todays world everybody needs it and they ought to . We need to bring home the bacon , right ? But the question is , at the expense of what ? <p> Will you really be pleased with what you accomplished in life if that meant being treated with contempt and losing all your dignity ? For the vast majority , the answer would be no . <p> I chose to end up independently employed and maintain my own business since I knew I did n't  need a manager yelling down my throat . Now it is a myth that in business , you are the only boss . You are , but only to an extent . You do have clients to cater to and obviously you need to address their worries . And I am cool with that . <p> What is not acceptable to me is compromising my dignity and the minute somebody goes too far , I cut them off and do not work with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so . <p> If I were in a corporate job and had an evil boss ( as most people do ! ) I would have no choice but to put my head down and deal with disrespect quietly . I would have to do it because I would be totally dependent on that person for my livelihood . <p> But because I run my own business I walk with my head held high and choose to only work with respectful people . I am far happier this way . <p> Introspect and see if it is possible for you to ensure that you are never fully dependent on one organization or person . Many people tolerate abuse simply because they are 100 percent dependent on someone else . <p> If you are totally dependent on them then you are putting yourself in a position where people will take you for granted BECAUSE you have no where else to go . <p> When it comes to work , see if it is possible to create multiple streams of income . If you are totally dependent on someone else emotionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from within , not from some other person . <h> 4 ) Through your absence , show how much you are really needed . <p> If you are always available for people , no matter how they treat you , in their minds your value will become cheap . The truth is that your perceived value in the eyes of the person has nothing to do with how important you are to their existence . It has everything to do with your availability for them . The moment you disappear , it is only then that they will truly appreciate your existence . <p> The most urgent and essential thing for a living beings survival in this world is not money , its not even love , its not even food or water , it is oxygen . Without oxygen you can not even survive beyond some minutes and do you ever get up and say , " Today I am grateful for oxygen ? ! " <p> Nope ! Because it is so readily available that you do n't  even notice it . <p> But if someone puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oxygen in less than a minute and be yearning for air . The only thing that you will want is some oxygen to be able to breathe . <p> From something you did n't  even notice , in less than a minute it becomes the most important thing you desperately need for your very survival . Oxygen was always crucial for you but did not value it because you took it for granted . <p> People who take you for granted are not much different . If your availability to people who are ungrateful is always guaranteed , why should they value you ? By choosing to consciously make yourself absent to such people , you rob them of the power they think they have over you . <p> You also make them value you by showing that you wont be available for them all the time . People who have some sense in their mind will not repeat their errors again as they will realize how important you are . <p> Some people will act like they are apologetic but will go back to their old ways the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case you may have to take the decision of cutting them out permanently . People who do not value your efforts for them do not deserve you to begin with . <h> 5 ) Realize that nothing is more important than Dignity . <p> Nothing is greater than dignity . Apart from being happy , if there is one that matters most in life , it is being proud of yourself , your actions and the way the world treats you . And by the way if your dignity is n't intact , happiness is not possible in the first place . This is true regardless of the cash you make or the materialistic success you attain . <p> What is dignity ? <p> Many people confuse dignity with pride . They are two separate things . <p> Pride is about trying prove yourself better than the other individual , whether by attempting to insult them or by trying to exert control over them directly or indirectly . <p> Dignity on the other hand is about looking in the mirror and being truly content and pleased with who you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a slave or a thing they can use or discard according to their desires . <p> This often happens to people in their professional lives but I see the the same happening to people in personal relationships as well . In fact , far more ! Many women as well as men choose to stay in relationships that are abusive physically or emotionally or both . <p> They may be demeaned , taken for granted and manipulated all the time . But still they choose to stay because they either do n't  see an identity for themselves , except when they are with the other individual or they are afraid of being single or they have been brainwashed with the idea that abuse is normal <p> They believe that by tolerating that kind of treatment , the other person will really value their faithfulness and adore them more . Or , in the end , understand their mistakes and change . Sadly that never happens . <p> In actuality , the individual begins respecting them even less and that only worsens things . They feel that regardless of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly accept all the crap they give you . <p> I am not saying that at the first sign of disagreement or problems , you ought to pack up and leave . To an extent , compromising is okay and is a smart way to save any relationship . <p> But you have to define limits . When they are crossed by the other person , you have to let yourself know that the last straw has been broken and cut them out of your life . <p> If you do n't  , then I am sorry to tell you , but things are never going to change . You are going to be mistreated for the rest of your life . <p> Are you really okay with that ? Start having some dignity , without pride of course . Realize that nothing is more crucial than your self respect . Do not give others the chance to keep treating you like an object they can use . <p> If you are continually being put down , offended or manhandled , whether emotionally , verbally or physically by somebody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim , the fact of the matter is in their eyes you are simply a toy over which they think they have complete force . If you are being treated with disrespect in your job all the time , then even the highest salary wont change the fact that according to your manager , you are an object , not a human being . <p> Do you truly think you can be cheerful in such sort of an existence , where your extremely presence turns into that of a thing , not a person ? Stand firm , let people know you have had enough and you wo n't give them a chance to abuse you any longer . <p> When you have a back bone , not only will you begin having a healthy self image , others will begin giving you the admiration you deserve as well . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Even if let 's say , you yourself also drink or smoke , you , or someone else in your circle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit overboard . <p> You see , even when circumstances are unpleasant and dangerous , nevertheless a true friend would tell you to stay on the better side . Theyd tell you that too much of anything is never good . In one way or another , theyd give you a solid piece of advice . <p> On the other hand , when that friend quits the above two habits altogether , you and the rest of the friends would see it and chances are high that if you 've got similar or same bad habits , you 'll consider quitting them , too . <p> In other words , your friends can make you physically healthier , for the simple reason that theyd care for you , at any rate . That 's how powerful your friends could be , sometimes without you even realizing it . <p> What 's more , did you know that studies show that cancer patients who have more close friends have higher chances of living longer than those who have less ? If that does n't  amaze you , I 'd like to hear what does . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely live longer ! <h> 2 . Friends are good for your heart and mind . <p> Friends can generally make you a happier person . They serve as an integral part of your support system , especially when you face challenging times such as traumas , stress or depression . <p> Surrounding yourself with happy friends tends to increase your own happiness ; being with unhappy friends , unfortunately , tends to decrease it . <p> Treat your friends as a part of yourself . Its never too late if you have n't thought of them that way . <p> Just imagine , the present times have never been busier . People grow their focus more and more on minding their own business . And the truth is , the rate by how many friends we make decreases as we get older . <p> Having close friends would help you keep up with that inevitable trend . Having friends would push you to live how humans should " by interacting , by being social . <p> Whether you 're the introvertish or the outgoing type shouldnt really matter . Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the crowd of strangers and mere acquaintances . <p> Your friends improve your sense of belonging and purpose . How true it is that birds of the same feather flock together ! Not only would you gain a sense of emotional security with friends , but youd also create opportunities to share your ideas , or visions , with them . <p> Being able to stand on your own is great " I believe this is a must . But support from friends gives you a different kind of motivation . Friends can help widen your perspective , especially during times when you doubt your skills and capabilities . <p> Friends are very important that in fact , some studies show that friends can improve our psychological wellbeing more than family can . <h> 3 . Your friends need you , too . <p> The benefits of having friends ca n't be denied . <p> But friendship is n't a one-way street . <p> Its an opportunity for you to take care of the people who matter to you " whether they 're your close friends or loved ones . <p> Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same basic needs and wants . <p> You can think of it this way : Your group of friends is a place you could start manifesting your purpose in life . Your friends are the people you like , admire or share common interests with . That 's why sometimes , even under any conditions " time , busyness or proximity " you still find ways to catch up with them . Sometimes you 're just not bound by conditions like these . <p> You ca n't be happy manifesting your purpose in life with other people if you ca n't be happy doing it with your friends . These other people may include workmates , business colleagues , or even strangers in the subway . <p> Friends " they are a part of you . You may be defined by who your friends are . Take care of them , and you do yourself a huge favor . <p> Think About It <p> Friends do keep you alive . They keep you sane . They could be the first people you look for whenever you seek a balance between you and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reality check . <p> On the other hand , friends indirectly tell you to take part in this thing we call life . In the midst of your busy life , accomplishments and even frustrations , your friends help you open your eyes , and remind you of bittersweet realities " but tell you that its all okay and that they 're willing to stand by you , anyway . <p> Your youth may have passed ; youth is a great time to find lifelong friends . But I tell you " if , anytime , anywhere , you meet people you can keep because of the above three reasons " keep them . Keep those people . They 're the ones youd like to share your life with ; they 're going to be worth it . <p> Speak Your Mind <p> Why would you go out to meet your friends ?

All boiled down into one list , for your convenience . Pick and choose the tips that work best for you . <p> Write down your financial goal . A large goal is not likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Type it out , print it out in large font , and post it up on your refrigerator . What is your goal ? A 50% reduction of your debt ? Complete debt elimination in two years ? Whatever it is , be specific and write it down , and do n't  forget it. - <p> Create rewards . People who are good at achieving any goal will tell you that rewards are important . Try to give yourself a treat at regular intervals , or little celebrations when a debt is paid off . Let them motivate you to succeed. - <p> Think positive . This may be one of the most important tips on this list . Positive thinking may sound corny and trite , but trust me , it works . Its actually crucial to debt elimination . If you start letting negative thoughts get into your head , it will cause you to want to give up . And debt elimination is such a long-term goal that its important that you not give up . When you feel yourself thinking negative thoughts , squash them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the saying goes , if you 're trying to get out of a hole , stop digging . Its important that you stop using your credit cards for spending , and slow down your spending , so that you do n't  get further into debt . Need to buy something but do n't  have the money . You 'll need to find the money first , or wait until you have it , instead of using credit. - <p> Make a list of debts . This is a difficult step for many , but necessary . If you 're going to tackle your debt problem , you need to know what it looks like . Make a list of all your debts , their minimum monthly payments , interest rates , and total amount owed . A spreadsheet works well for this . Then total up the monthly payments and the total amounts owed to see what the damage is . Now that you have a clear picture of your debts , you can begin to make a plan to conquer them. - <p> Reduce expenses . See what you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting on things like buying coffee ( make your own ) , eating out ( cook at home ) , or shopping ( just stop ) , or whether it be looking to cut out major bills like a second car payment or your yacht . If you can reduce expenses , even by a couple hundred a month , you can use that money to start paying down your debt . Whatever you free up from your expenses , dedicate that to making an extra debt payment ( see the debt snowball below ) . - <p> Make extra cash . In addition to reducing expenses , you should see if you can bring in some additional income . Work part time , do some freelance work , sell some of your stuff on eBay , hold a garage sale , take in a boarder , rent out your yacht . Get creative . It does n't  have to be permanent , although you might decide to keep bringing in the extra income even after you 're out of debt. - <p> Make a simple budget . This is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have to be complicated . Make a simple list of the things you spend on every month , including your minimum debt payments . Write down how much you spend on each one ( and be realistic ) . Total it up . Then add up your income , and see if the income exceeds the expenses . If not , you 'll need to reduce the expenses. - <p> Watch for irregular expenses . Think ahead to expenses that may be coming up , like Christmas and birthdays , or insurance or home repairs or car maintenance or back-to-school shopping . These are things that do n't  happen every month , but that will definitely be coming up . Budget for them , saving a little so that you are prepared . Its best to include a small amount in your monthly budget for irregular expenses like this , so that you have the money when you need it. - <p> Save an emergency fund . This tip might seem strange in a list of debt elimination tips , but its actually very important . Without at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing your debt . The reason is that when unexpected expenses come up ( and they always do ) , if you have no emergency fund , the first thing you 'll cut is your debt elimination payment so that you can pay for the unexpected expense . Either that , or you 'll use your credit card and get further into debt . Try to save up $1,000 in a savings account to pay for these unexpected expenses and ensure that your debt elimination goes smoothly . Once you 've saved up that $1,000 , put it all towards debt. - <p> Stop using credit cards . Many of us have a problem with credit cards . If you 're the type to pay your balance in full each month , and not carry credit card debt , you can skip this tip . If you do n't  pay your balance in full , cut up your cards or hide them and stop using them . The interest is extremely high , and its way too easy to use a credit card. - <p> Use cash . Instead of putting all your expenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each payday , withdraw the amount of cash needed for your spending expenses in the simple budget you created ( see above ) . Pay your bills online first , then withdraw the cash for groceries , gas , and other spending . When you run out of cash , you 're out . Its that simple. - <p> Use a debt snowball . Popularized by financial adviser Dave Ramsey , the debt snowball is a simple method that works well for many people . First , identify at least $100 that you can use as your " debt snowball " . Use this amount to increase your payment on your smallest debt , while paying the minimum on your other debts . Soon , your smallest debt will be paid off . Now take the total amount you were paying on that debt ( the " debt snowball " amount plus the minimum payment for that debt ) , and use it as your debt snowball amount for your next smallest debt . Continue to do that , with your debt snowball amount building up as the debts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alternate strategy ( and a popular one as well ) , is paying the highest interest debts first , as this will save you a little money in interest. - <p> Automate your minimums . Make the minimum payments for each of your debts automatic , so you do n't  even think about them . Either allow the companies to deduct the amount automatically out of your account , or use your banks online bill pay feature and make them automatically recurring payments. - <p> Make the debt elimination payment a bill . The extra payment you 're making on one of your debts ( see debt snowball tip above ) , on top of the minimum payments , should be treated as a bill , not as an optional expense . That means , when you pay your bills , be sure to pay the debt elimination payment along with the rest of the bills . Do n't  let it be optional at all. - <p> Get lower rates . Either find a balance transfer for your credit cards that will lower your interest rates ( read the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your current credit card companies to lower your rates . Many credit card companies are willing to lower interest rates if you tell them that you will move to a competitor with lower rates. - <p> Monitor impulse spending urges . Impulse spending is the culprit that leads us to get into debt , and often keeps us there despite our desire to get out of debt . Learn to monitor your urges , so that you 're aware of them and can control them . Often , when you get the urge to buy something , your heart beats faster and your breathing gets a little heavier . If you can get past these urges , you can control your spending. - <p> Use a 30-day list . A good tool for controlling impulse buys is to use a 30-day list and to stick to it . Every time you get the urge to buy something that is n't absolutely essential ( and by " essential " I mean things like groceries , not the latest iGadget ) , write it on the list with the date you wrote it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it until 30 days have passed . Often , the urge or need to buy that item will have disappeared. - - <p> Stop shopping . Do n't  go to the mall or other usual shopping hangouts . Do n't  go places to " shop " only go to a store if you have something specific to buy ( a need , not a want ) and do n't  buy anything else . Get in , then get out. - <p> Do n't  buy online either . Shopping applies to online shopping sites , such as Amazon or eBay . Its so easy to buy online that many of us do it way too often , and do n't  realize how much we actually spend . Stay off these sites if possible. - <p> Eat at home . If you tend to eat out a lot , try cooking for yourself instead as much as possible . Make a weekly menu of stuff you like to eat that 's not difficult to cook , make a list of the ingredients you need , shop for them , and then cook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is OK , but if you can make a dent in your dining out spending , you can often free up a lot of cash for debt elimination. - - <p> Maintain your focus . One of the hardest things about achieving a long-term goal such as debt elimination is the tendency for our focus on that goal to fade away . Focus is the key to achieving any goal , and to achieve a long-term goal , you have to find ways to maintain that focus . Having a debt-elimination partner , or joining an online forum , is a good way , as is posting your goal or a picture of your goal somewhere visible . Also keep a debt diary or email yourself reminders every so often . Do whatever it takes. - <p> Leave yourself wiggle room . Its unwise to eliminate all extra spending and dedicate it all to debt elimination . That 's a recipe for disaster . You have to give yourself some spending money to eat out or buy things now and then ( but much less frequently than before ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Brown bag it . If you eat out a lot for lunch , try packing a lunch and eating at work . This can save a lot of money over the course of a month . It requires buying stuff to make for lunch , and a little time in the morning ( or the evening before ) to pack it , but its worth the extra effort . Bonus : its usually healthier too. - <p> Find free entertainment . Entertainment is another expense that can greatly hurt your debt elimination efforts . And its one that you can reduce drastically in most cases . Instead of going out at night , or going to a bar , or going to the movies , or whatever you do for fun that costs money , find ways to have fun for free ( or at least for cheap ) . Staying home and reading or doing fun things at home , or going to the park , or exercising , or spending time with family or friends , can all be a lot of fun without costing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The big expenses , like housing and auto , can often be reduced by a large amount if you examine them carefully and give them some thought . Of course , making a reduction in these expenses is n't as easy as cutting out your morning latte , but they can make such a big difference that its worth the effort . Housing costs , for example , should be no more than 33 percent of your household income ( as a general guideline of course ) , including mortgage payments , property tax , and both property and homeowners insurance . Shop around for lower insurance rates , refinance your mortgage , or look for ways to reduce utility costs. - <p> Look for bargains . Some people are born bargain hunters , and the rest of us have to learn the skill . Whenever you 're going to purchase something , take the time to do the research , find the best prices , look out for sales , even ask for discounts . If you can get bargains on your purchases , you can reduce your expenses by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . Instead of buying something when you need it , see if you can find someone else who has the item but does n't  need it . Send out an email to friends and family , letting them know what you need . Or look on craigslist.com or freecycle.org . If you cant find it for free , try finding a used version of it for cheap , at garage sales , thrift shops , eBay , etc. - <p> Debt free ? Save , then spend . When your debt is finally paid off , save 60 percent of what you were using to pay debt , and enjoy the other 40 percent . This will allow you to feel the freedom of being debt free while saving for your other goals. - <p> Educate yourself . If you 're going to tackle a problem like debt , its best to arm yourself with information . Do some research on the web , read " Your Money or Your Life " , read Dave Ramsey . Go to the library instead of buying these books. - <p> Get creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending much is an art form . It can be done with a little imagination and creativity . Find new ways to meet your needs without spending a lot . It can actually be a lot of fun. - <p> Spend 60 percent of your income . A good guideline used by many people is to make your necessary monthly expenses equal only 60 percent of your gross income . For the other 40 percent , divide it among savings , debt payment , and spending. - <p> Be patient . Debt elimination does n't  happen overnight . You did n't  get into that debt in a month , and you wo n't get out of it in a month . For many people , it can take several years . While you may be enthusiastic about eliminating your debt , and want to do it right away , realize that you 're in this for the long haul . Now settle in to your new lifestyle , and savor the thought of being free of this debt burden. - <p> Enjoy yourself . If you absolutely hate your new frugal lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learn to enjoy yourself , enjoy finding ways to be frugal , and reward yourself for eliminating debt . Youll be much more likely to stay in it for life . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098390 <h> A Work-Life Balance ? 8 Steps to Help You Juggle It All <p> We want to be productive and hard working , but we also want to be good friends , siblings , parents , and significant others . <p> And sometimes its very hard to be all of those things at once . <p> Before I discuss my thoughts on keeping it all balanced , I first want to note that its pretty much impossible to keep everything together all the time . <p> There are going to be times when we ca n't be at work because we have to care for a loved one or deal with a personal issue.There are going to be times when we miss out on a fun event because we have to focus on a work deadline . <p> Balancing work and the rest of your life is no easy task . <p> We all make mistakes and we all are forced to make unpleasant choices from time to time , but the key is to do the best you can . <p> And , to help you do that , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1. - Decide what 's most important to you each day. - <p> Each morning ( or , better yet , the night before ) think about what you really want to accomplish that day . Is the most important thing completing a big project ? - <p> Try to narrow your day down to a few important tasks . After those tasks have been completed you can then move on to less pressing things . <p> Remember to think about the day in terms of your whole life " family , friends , you , work , etc . I 'd advise keeping one planner or organizer for everything so you 're sure not to miss anything important . Deciding what 's most important every day helps you to gain focus and to tackle the most important tasks . <p> There are plenty of things I put on my " To Do " lists that really do n't  need to done immediately . Of course these should n't be ignored , but make sure you do the most important things first . <p> And , in order to do them first , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few minutes out of your hectic schedule " to identify what really matters today . <p> 2. - Try to keep everything very , very organized. - <p> Now , this is advice coming from someone who loves being organized . <p> To me , organization is effortless because I 've been doing it all my life . In fact , when I 'm not organized I feel panicked and unsettled ( yup , that 's the perfectionist in me coming out ! ) . As much as I adore organization , I understand it does n't  come easily to everyone ( or almost anyone I know ! ) . <p> For some people it seems like its the absolute hardest thing in the world , but believe me , its worth the effort . <p> Think about how much time you 'll save if you know exactly where everything is . <p> As a basic principle , everything in your home and in your workspace should have a place and you should do your best to always keep something in its place ( yes , this is much more difficult when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but do the best you can ) . <p> When you know where things are , when you can actually see your desk or your bedroom floor , you 'll feel a lot better about everything. - <p> Trust me. - <p> Organization cuts way down on stress because you know where to find things and you do n't  have that frazzled , where-are-my-keys feeling . There are tons of great resources online for organization and I highly suggest you check em out if you 're having trouble in this department . <p> 3 . Delegate as many tasks as possible to others. - <p> I am a terrible delegator . If I have to get something done " whether for work , for a party , for a friend or family member , etc . " I want to do it . <p> I feel if I give someone else a task I need to do it wont be done the way I want it to be done so I have a hard time delegating . <p> But delegating can be an absolute lifesaver when you 're dealing with an overwhelming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do every day ( write em down if you have to ) and then consider who would be able to do these for you. - <p> Could your kids pick up some of your slack when it comes to cleaning the house ? - Could you afford to hire a housekeeper if itll keep you saner ? - Can you ask your spouse to take care of something that you usually handle ? - <p> Are there people in your network always asking to help but whom you always turn down ? Whatever you do , do n't  turn down help unless you really , really need to do a task yourself . <p> Do n't  feel guilty if you cant do it all yourself either. - <p> Almost everyone who 's working ( and especially those freelancing ! ) has a million things going on and cant do everything all the time . <p> Look around " I bet you there are a lot of people who would be willing to help you out if you just let go of control a bit and realized that delegating does n't  mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give yourself mini-breaks whenever you can. - <p> No matter what your job is or what 's going on in your life , you deserve a break . We all deserve to have a break every once and awhile. - <p> However , this is probably is n't possible for most people ( especially if you are working as a solo freelancer ) , but there are alternatives " " mini-breaks , " if you will . What is a mini-break , you ask ? Well , a mini-break can be anything you want it to be ! <p> That 's the beauty of it ! <p> A mini-break can be a walk around the block at lunch , a day off of work ( kid-free ) , a night out on the town , or an afternoon spent outdoors. - <p> A mini-break can be a spa day , a weekend getaway , or a stop on the way home for a much-deserved snack. - A mini-break can be a quiet night alone , a small party with friends , or a morning sleeping in . A mini-break can be whatever you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a break. - <p> You need to take a step out of your routine and relax for a bit . It may seem like , with a million things going on , you really cant afford to spend time being unproductive , but when you take time to relax and refresh yourself you 'll be a much better friend , family member , and significant other " and you 'll be more productive when working . <p> 5 . Make every moment of the day count. - <p> When were dealing with a day , were dealing with a mere twenty-four hours . And , if you 're anything like me , you like to spend a lot of those hours sleeping , which leaves us with not all that much to work with . Which is why its so , so important to make every moment count . <p> For example , let 's say you have to close your office door in order to work and do n't get to spend as much time with your children as you would like . <p> At the end of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and tuck them in before you crawl into bed yourself . Sure , that 's not ideal , but you can make the best of it . If you only have an hour or two with them , make that the best hour. - <p> Do your best to put your other responsibilities and tasks aside for that period of time and focus on spending time with them . The same goes for your work. - <p> When you 're working , focus on the task at hand . Give yourself a specific amount of time to work on a project and devote all of your attention to it , pushing from your mind whatever personal issues you might currently be dealing with . <p> We ca n't be everywhere at once , so focus on being where you are right now . When possible , isolate yourself in a space that allows you to focus on the present moment " work in your office , spend time with your children in their playroom , eat dinner in the dining room . <p> Having set areas for specific tasks will help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A lot of places seem to becoming more and more flexible with the way work is conducted . Because of this wonderful invention we call the Internet , people can work from home or on the road or in a different country , which can be a good and a bad thing. - <p> Your clients might find lots of ways to be involved in your process without the limitations of being in their own office . But it 's up to you to manage expectations . <p> When you begin a project , clearly state when you will be available and when you will not. - <p> Also set reasonable expectations as to when the project will be completed " and do n't be afraid to ask for more time if you think it will take you longer than they would like . <p> You want to do the best work possible , and you should make that clear to your client . In addition , try negotiating household chores , tasks , and duties with the members of your household . Can your roommates or significant other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you figure out something that you could offer in return for more of the chores being done by someone else ( for example , a raise in allowance for a kid who makes sure the house is tidy ) ? <p> A word of advice : be prepared. - <p> If you go to your client or roommate/significant other with a negotiation , make sure you have solid support for your suggestion . Providing reasons for why you need more time or help will help you get what you want " and ultimately make for better work on your part . <p> 7 . Do n't  put off things you can get done today. - <p> If you can do something right now , do it . Usually things we put off are things we can get done right now . Do n't  put something off until tomorrow because you " do n't  feel like doing it . " - <p> Not feeling like it is not an excuse . Some things ca n't be done today ( such as those that require input from another person or appointments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a lot of the tasks we face on a daily basis can be done today and should be done today . <p> Whenever its possible , I do my best to finish a task by the end of the day so I can start new tasks the next day . <p> The same goes for personal situations and relationships . If you want to have connections with others , you have to put in the work. - <p> Do n't  put off sending an email or calling a friend . Do n't  cancel plans if you can help it . If you are n't  terribly i 'll or completely worn out , make sure you use the time you have after finishing your work for the day to be productive with life activities . Spend time with friends . <p> Snuggle with a family member . Call up your parents just to chat . Unless its literally impossible to do it today , do n't  say , " Oh , yeah , I 'll get to that tomorrow " <p> 8 . Allow yourself the freedom to say " no. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " yes " more often , I think a lot of people have trouble saying " no . " When a friend or family member asks you for a favor it can be really hard to say " no. " - <p> When a client asks if you can take on another project it can be even harder to say " no . " <p> But its okay . Its okay to tell others that you cant take on anything else . Its okay to admit that adding one more thing to your workload is going to send the quality of your work ( and your sanity ) down the drain . <p> Personally I 'd much rather someone say " no " to a request of mine than have my request bring added stress and unhappiness to his/her life , and I 'm sure you feel the same ( and keep this in mind when someone says " no " to you and you do n't  understand why ) . <p> Its not easy to admit that we cant do something ( especially when we want to ) , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always come to you with requests and then you will completely overwhelmed and , eventually , you wont be able to handle the pressure. - <p> Its much better to say " no " every once and a while and keep yourself balanced than it is to say " yes " to everything and feel like you never have time to relax . When you receive a request , seriously consider if you can do it . If you cant , be nice , be honest , and just say " no ! " <p> Wrap Up <p> As I mentioned above , its not always possible to have a perfect balance . Sometimes work is going to be a priority. - <p> Sometimes family and friends will come first . Its not easy to balance it all " especially when you 're working as a freelancer . <p> However , it is possible to have some amount of balance in your life " and a great deal of that depends on you . <p> You must set expectations and manage not only your clients , but your friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be at times to keep everything in perspective and balance work and life , it 's possible do so and , with the help of the eight steps listed here , I know you can do it ! <p> Written on 11/1/2012 by Dani. - Dani is the creator of PositivelyPresent.com where she shares her personal stories of living a positive life , including tips and tricks on how to make the most of every day .

Its about how you conduct yourself , your attitudes towards others and your actions . <p> Regardless of whether you are a teenager , a student , a new member in your team/company , or someone starting out in the industry , you can be well respected by others . In this post , I share 10 ways on how you can be a well respected person . These 10 ways can be carried out no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do In every field of work , the most highly regarded people are those who are the best at what they do . Everyone loves competent people , especially those who present their best work all the time . If you 're just starting out in your profession , that does n't  mean you 're not deserving of respect . Its about starting small and building from there . <p> When I started my personal development blog 2 years ago , no one knew me . Of my early audience , I remember some people would discount my work because of my age , saying I had no experience and shouldnt writing on such topics . Such comments are normal since they did n't  know who I was , just my age and my brief background . Rather than letting these stop me , I built my reputation , one step at a time , via producing the best content and planting seeds everywhere . Over time , people began to register the value I was providing and they developed respect for what I was doing . Today , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that 's because they recognize my abilities and what I have to offer . <p> Its through gaining experience and improving that you establish yourself as the best and earn the respect from others . Its not an overnight process , but the respect people have of you after that will be steadfast . <p> Respect others Respect is 2-way . If you want others to respect you , youve to respect others first . If you 've ever come across someone who is n't being respectful to you , I invite you to think of just one person you 're not being respectful to in your life now . Chances you 'll find at least someone . Rather than harp on how people are not respectful to you , work on being respectful to those people you 're treating shabbily . Itll help you reach new heights in your relationship with others . Whenever someone is rude to me , I think of how I might be rude to someone else and mend that relationship . Its creates a positive shift in my relationships. - <p> Honor what you say No one likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one who is honest in his/her communications and can be trusted to do what he/she promised . I believe integrity is the first step to being our highest self . I always ensure I live up to my commitments and deliver beyond what I promise . If due to some reason you cant honor your commitments , make sure you address them accordingly to the other party and make up for it. - <p> Be open to criticisms Contrary to popular belief , being respected does n't  mean you wo n't receive criticism . In fact , its quite the opposite . The more known you are in your work , the more criticisms you 'll receive . My blog readership has grown over 4 times in the last 6 months . Just as I 've received a lot more positive feedback than before on my posts , I 'm also receiving more criticisms . Its not about rejecting criticisms but about being able to handle criticisms gracefully . People respect someone who is able to handle negative feedback and turn it into something positive . If you need pointers , here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with respect Its funny that many of us seek respect from others , yet we do n't  even respect ourselves . Have you ever beaten yourself up before ? Do you love yourself wholly and unconditionally ? Do you treat yourself poorly by not getting enough sleep , proper diet or exercise ? If you do n't  respect yourself , you ca n't hope to get respect from others . Start off by loving yourself . The love from others will come subsequently. - <p> Conduct yourself professionally This includes dressing well , being well-mannered , using appropriate language and having social etiquette . If you have n't attended a social etiquette class before , itll be useful to do so . Even if you intuitively know what they teach in the class , its great as reinforcement . I attended a few etiquette classes when I was a student , including wine appreciation , dining etiquette , how to conduct yourself in a 1st meeting , etc . I personally found it helpful . The things taught inside are not rocket science by any means , but it helps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dos and do-nots. - <p> Do n't  bad mouth others Whether its in a professional or social setting , its not appropriate to bad mouth people . You certainly do n't  earn respect this way . If you 're unhappy with a certain individual and what he/she is doing , talk to him/her and work things out . Do n't  talk behind his/her back . This is the kind of behavior that attracts gossip and negativity . Not only does it reflect badly on you as a person , it also hurts the other party , whether you realize it or not . Be honest and transparent in your communications. - <p> Stand up for what you believe in Have you ever come across people who simply agree with whatever others say without much thought ? I have , and it gets meaningless after a while as they just say yes to everything . Personally , I have more respect for someone who disagrees ( civilly ) and stands up for himself/herself than someone who parrots others . Likewise , it is by having your own opinion and a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't  be afraid to stand up for what you believe in . At the same time , make sure you do it in a respectful manner to others. - <p> Be yourself Along the same lines as #8 , be yourself . Its better to be an original version of yourself than an exact duplicate of someone else . People respect individuals who are original . Too many people try too hard to be someone else they are not and in the end they do n't  have a sense of identity . Discover who you are and what you stand for . What the world needs are more people who are true to themselves , not clones of each other. - <p> Be a role model to others Actions speak louder than words . Are you a role model to others by way of your behavior ? Do you uphold yourself to the highest code of conduct ? You gain respect by walking the talk . The most respected person is the one who inspires others to achieve their best and enables them to unlock their highest potential . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods above resonate with you ? Do you have any personal experiences on how to cultivate respect from others ? Feel free to share in the comments area . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098392 <h> 7 Ways to be More Productive and Less Busy <p> It can be hard to see the difference between being productive and just staying busy . But there is a difference a big difference . <p> Its possible to be busy all day long and at the end of the day feel like you have n't accomplished much . We all know what its like to feel overwhelmed by all the things in our lives that pull us in different directions . Yet it 's important in life to feel like we are getting somewhere , not just treading water . <p> So here are 7 ways to stop being just busy and start being more productive ! <h> 1 ) Get up and go to bed at the same time every day . <p> A regular sleep routine helps us sleep better , and getting rest is one of the most important things we can do for our physical and mental health . Having a routine in the morning and at night is also important . It can be as simple as enjoying your morning coffee in silence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditating for 15 minutes or reading a chapter from a book can do wonders to relax our minds before going to sleep . Keep in mind that research has shown that it 's important to disconnect from electronics at least an hour before bedtime . <h> 2 ) Arrive at work a few minutes early . <p> Use that time to plan out your day and organize your workspace . Having the things you 're going to need ready for you can really help save time throughout the day . Review your deadlines and progress on projects , then make a to do list for the day , and determine at what times you 'll check email or other small tasks so they wo n't eat up too much time . If you do n't work in an office , you should still take a few minutes to write out a to do list for the day . This will help you have a clear vision of your day and make it easier to stay on track . <h> 3 ) Try to get a few small or easy tasks out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completing some small things first thing , you 'll have already accomplished some of your to do 's for the day , as well as freed up time to really make progress on the bigger things . It also feels good and is motivating to see that you 're being productive and making progress . <h> 4 ) For longer tasks , be sure to take short breaks about every 45 minutes or so . <p> Set a timer with your cell phone to remind you , if necessary . Taking breaks is actually something we all should be doing all day long . Sitting for long periods of time is not healthy for our bodies , and actually can hinder productivity . Walk around a bit and stretch your legs . Then when you return to the task at hand , you 'll be able to concentrate better . <h> 5 ) Get outside . <p> Spending some time outdoors can do wonders to clear our minds , energize and refocus us . If possible , take a walk outside at lunchtime or for a break in the afternoon . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening can really help our minds and bodies relax . Overall , though , spending time outside doing things we enjoy at any time is rejuvenating , which translates into sharper focus and more productivity . <h> 6 ) Make three or four clear priorities for yourself each day . <p> If you have too many priorities , you 'll be really busy , but probably not that successful . In order to be productive we have to prioritize , make time for , and concentrate on the most important things in life to us . Saying , " yes , " to every opportunity that comes our way is a recipe for not being very productive . So before saying " yes , " make sure it fits your priorities . <h> 7 ) At the end of the day on Friday , take a few minutes to plan for Monday . <p> This way you 'll be free to fully enjoy your weekend , concentrating on the things and people who bring you happiness , rather than thinking about dreaded Monday . And come Monday you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These take a bit of planning , but theyll become a habit for you in no time .

@@2098393 <h> 3 Keys to Staying Focused &amp; Reaching Your Goals <p> Its easy to drift . Life is hectic for all of us and if were not intentional about our direction in life we can easily wake up one day and wonder how we got where we are . <p> A common complaint I hear from people , men in particular , is regret over not having done something in their life that they had always wanted or planned to do . It was n't their intention not to do it , but they also werent intentional enough to make sure it happened . <p> Being able to stay focused on a goal or direction despite all of lifes curveballs is a necessity for success . Its the people who develop the skill of staying focused no matter what 's happening in their life who are successful . Less successful people have the tendency to allow the distractions of life to take them off course . <p> One of the main reasons this happens is because our minds can easily drift away from the present and off into the past or out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do today that were able to change our tomorrow that preventing this mind trap is so important . Unfortunately , our minds often tend to drift back into the past or off into the future when today is uncomfortable . <p> A couple of people that I am counseling give good examples of what this loss of present focus can look like . Beths divorce was finalized almost 3 years ago , but she still thinks about her ex-husband every day . Sometimes its an old photo or song that triggers her to go back in her mind , but other times its things she 's still holding on to . For instance , he had this negative label he used to use to describe her and she still has that in her head as a definition of who she is . So whenever she struggles at something today she brings up this negative label from the past . <p> Chuck is unhappy in his marriage . One reason he feels this way is because he does n't  find his wife attractive ( I wont get into all of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ) . So Chuck fantasizes about what it would be like if he was with what he calls a " hot babe . " Whenever he sees an attractive woman he thinks about what it would be like if he was married to her . <h> 1 . Do n't  Look Back . <p> While its helpful for us to learn from our mistakes , its important that we do n't  spend more time in the past than is necessary to learn those lessons . A good distinction to note is whether our purpose for thinking about the past is to learn from it , or to escape back to it and live in it in our minds . <h> 2 . Do n't  Live in the Future . <p> Okay , obviously if we have to look forward or we wont know where were going . And some looking forward is necessary to set goals and develop plans to meet them . However , living in the future is a whole other thing . Again , a key distinction is our purpose for thinking about the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red flag . <h> 3 . Stay in the Present . <p> Living in today does n't  mean we do n't  look back or forward , but we do n't  do it to the point that it robs us of today and we do n't  do it to escape today . We have to continue to remind ourselves that the only way tomorrow will be better is if we stay focused on the present . <p> There are times for all of us when staying focused in the present can be difficult . However , to be successful in life and to get to where we ultimately want to go , we all need to consistently practice these 3 keys to staying focused . @qwx77 <p> Dr. Kurt Smith is the Clinical Director of Guy Stuff Counseling &amp; Coaching , a Northern California counseling practice that specializes in helping men and the women who love them .

Whether it is in your personal life or your professional life , you can anticipate changes that you will have to adjust to .

Find Your Inspiration in Life <p> Recently , I heard an incredibly interesting and shocking true story about this guy named John , who worked for a very large mortgage company and was not very talented in anything he did. - <p> His first job for that company was sorting all the correspondence in the mail room , and he got fired within just 3 months after he had started . <p> Afterwards he went to work for a processing department , and was fired from that department too . He tried to work as a mortgage banker as well no luck there either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that company . <p> One day , the manager , who was supervising a big group of mortgage bankers , suddenly quit , and the team remained without a leader . No one wanted to apply for that position internally since the managers position was quite stressful , with a huge amount of responsibility and pressure for achieving team and company goals . <p> Well , guess what ? John applied for it . <p> Since there were no other candidates for the position at that time , and the HR officer did not want to hire an outsider which would have taken a lot of valuable time while the team was without a leader , believe it or not John got the position . <p> A few months down the road , John became the most successful manager and mortgage bankers leader in the company , who showed the highest results in team production and far exceeded his companys expectations . <p> He has been making a 6 figure income ever since and has never been happier at his job . <p> I was in a shock when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it and realized that Johns failures were not necessarily failures . They were merely stepping stones to his success . He just had not known before what his inspiration or dream job was , and indeed sometimes it takes a while to figure that out . <p> So , if you want me to answer my own question of why the road to success is always full of failures , then I 'd like to answer it with my favorite quote , which is truly inspiring : <p> " What is the secret to success ? Never give up ! Its only when you give up that you fail . Everything else is just a short setback on your way to success . Giving up is the only failure in life ! " <p> Here is another great success story . <p> 2 . Talent and Hard Work <p> Have you ever heard the saying : - " Genius is 1% talent and 99% hard work " ? I think it was Albert Einstein who said that . <p> Another guy named Adam , who was only 18 , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few dollars in his pocket right after World War Two . <p> He was originally from London and life in England was quite hard after the war . Adam had always dreamed of coming to the United States and living a better life . <p> He stayed for a couple of months with one of his distant relatives and worked as a gardener in sunny California , saving all the money he could . Adam was a very bright and intelligent kid and was eager to go to college , but the money he saved would never have been enough even for one school semester . <p> He kept working really hard until one of his rich clients , the General , noticed what a hardworking kid he was . <p> He talked to him for a while and , amazingly , offered to be Adam 's sponsor if he wanted to go to Stanford . Adam could not believe his blessing , but he unquestionably took this opportunity and just a few years later graduated from Stanford with honors and became a CPA . <p> Quite soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L.A. and was making a great living . He got married , bought a nice home and had a son . <p> A few years later , the changes and the politics in the company saw him quit his job , and he decided to move out of crowded L.A. to a more laid back Arizona . <p> Shortly after , Adam and his friend started a scrap metal company in Phoenix . After being in business for just a few years , they became multi-millionaires . In their best years they were making 15 million dollars a year . Adam invested most of his money in the stock market and used the rest of it to travel the world . <p> He is retired now and still likes to travel and cook his own gourmet meals from scratch and takes a power walk for an hour every single day . I went for a walk with him once and could hardly keep up with him . <p> And he is 78 ! <p> The morale of the story is " Do not wait . The time will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and work with whatever tools you may have , and better tools will be found as you go along .

@@2098401 <h> 17 Ways To Remove Stress From Your Life Once And For All <p> Modern life can be stressful but there are some key things you can stop doing that will remove stress from your life and give you back your sense of calm . <p> 1 . Stop being so hard on yourself . You will mess up sometimes . Learn from it , and let it go . You 're never going to be perfect and get everything right . Stop expecting yourself to . Instead , notice the things you are good at , that do go right , that do n't mess up . Notice your funny quirks , little talents and goofy features . Love them for their own sake . Notice all of the ways you 're pretty cool and stop sweating the other stuff you 're not yet good at . <p> 2 . Stop being so hard on the world . Unrealistic expectations are one of the root causes of unwanted stress and pressure . Life will not go smoothly so stop expecting it to . Accept life with all its glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late and traffic lights will be on red at times . Accept it . You ca n't control it so why get frustrated by it ? Breathe and let it go . <p> 3 . Stop being so hard on other people . We are all as different on the inside as we look on the outside . But so often we get frustrated because other people react differently to how we 'd want them to . Especially as more often than not , we 've not even shared with them how we would like them to behave . Does it really matter if your Mum smooth 's down your hair whenever you see her ? Or that the guy you work with talks about his reptile collection at every opportunity ? We 're all weird , wonderful and unique in our own ways . Most people are not trying to deliberately frustrate you- they 're just trying to live their lives like you are . <p> 4 . Do n't give others the power to control your emotions . How many times have you said he 's really winding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If you take those thoughts to their logical end you 're suggesting that your emotions are in the control of other people . They 're not . You 're not a puppet waiting to have your emotional strings pulled by whoever you come into contact with . You ca n't control other people but you can control your response to them . <p> 5 . Give up letting the reptilian you run the show . Our brains roughly consist of 3 areas " rational , emotional and primitive . It 's the primitive bit that kicks in when we feel threatened and produces what 's known as the fight or flight ' response . <p> It 's designed to help us fight off or flee from dangerous situations " like being attacked by a wild animal . Unfortunately it still kicks in even when it 's not life threatening " like your boss asking for the report a day early . <p> The reptilian brain is doing its job by shooting a load of adrenaline through your system but you do n't have to respond to it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation is truly life threatening and when it 's not . How to do this ? Learn how to release the adrenaline and engage your rational brain . Questions are good for this " ask yourself how important the situation is on a scale of 1-10 ( 10 being life threatening ) , how important it 's going to be in 3 months time ? <p> 6 . Do n't let life fool you into thinking you are helpless in the face of challenges " you 're not . Take charge . Do n't blame circumstances or other people " blaming only wastes precious time and energy . Ask yourself how YOU can improve the situation and do it . ( Oh look at me getting all bossy ! ) <p> 7 . Give up on holding grudges . Forgive and let go . Holding onto blame and anger towards others acts like a poison in our souls . The crazy thing is , if I 'm still angry at my ex-boyfriend who cheated on me 15 years ago the only person who 's even aware of that is me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of us do n't do that " we stew and hold onto those resentments like a warm blanket while the other person gets on with their life in ignorant bliss . As Buddha said , holding onto resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die . Let it go and free yourself from the burden . <p> 8 . Stop settling for a life of boredom , dissatisfaction or frustration . If you really , really hate your job " find another one . If you hate where you live " redecorate or relocate . If you 're dissatisfied with your relationship do something about it " choose to love that person , work on your relationship or move on . Stop making excuses for not taking control and living your life ( it 's the only one you 've got after all . ) <p> 9 . Remove all or nothing thinking . You do n't have to give your life a complete do-over to find fulfillment . Find some activities , passions and people that light you up inside . <p> 10 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be what you feel like doing , especially when you 're tense but it 's the bomb when it comes to releasing endorphins ( happy brain chemicals , ) and increasing alpha waves " the electrical brain patterns associated with calmness . Getting a little sweaty never hurt anyone . <p> 11 . Do n't run away from your feelings . Name your emotions , acknowledge them and accept them . Notice them without judgment . You 're going to feel sad , angry , downright demented sometimes " do n't judge yourself for the emotion , just be curious about where it 's come from and whether it is appropriate , effective and helpful to you . Only then can you begin to do something about it . <p> 12 . Give up pushing through exhaustion . If you 're getting overwhelmed or caught up in one particular issue or stressful situation " take a break . Go for a walk , listen to some music , read a book " just give your brain a rest from thinking about it for a while . You 'll be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stop sweating the small stuff . Remember what is truly important to you " yes things will get stressful at times but often we get ourselves stressed out about the small stuff ' as Robert Carlson calls them . On a scale of 1-10 ( with 10 being life ending disaster ) how important is the thing you 're stressing about ? How important will it be in a month 's time ? 6 months time ? 6 years time ? <p> 14 . Give into your fears and take them to their logical conclusion . What is the very worst-case scenario ? Could you survive it ? Most of the time we spend so much time being fearful of what might be that we do n't stop and examine whether we could handle it or not . Most of our fears are of the fear itself . The very worst is extremely unlikely to happen , and even if it did , you would likely handle it . <p> 15 . Surrender your phone/tablet/laptop . The temptation to be connected at all times means we are never truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything " we can just look it up . We do n't need to day dream " we can keep ourselves occupied at all times . Which means we never truly switch off either . Our brains need time to rest , to recharge and to be calm . Give yourself the givt of boredom now and again . <p> 16 . Ban technology from the bedroom . Sleep disturbances are endemic with more and more of us experiencing insomnia , interrupted sleep or just plain sleep deprivation . A key cause of sleep disturbance is technology like phones , TV 's laptops and tablets in the bedroom . It 's not just that we 're using tech late at night but what this does to our circadian rhythm ( the system within our bodies that tells night from day and keeps our sleep patterns in check . ) Our bodies are diurnal " meaning they are awake in the light and sleep in the dark " the light from tech devises , coupled with the fact that we are using them right up to the minute we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in preparation for sleep . Your bedroom needs to be a sanctuary for rest and rejuvenation . Think of it as a calm oasis in a hectic world . <p> 17 . End excessive worrying . Worry is mental rehearsal for disaster .

@@2098405 <h> How to Increase Concentration " The 5 Key Steps <p> Do you find your mind invariably straying to some happy moment in the past , a pleasant song you 've recently heard , or a movie you 've seen , or a book you 've read etc. ? <p> Most of us do , so do n't  worry . <p> For most people , concentration does n't  come naturally . ( That includes me . ) <p> That 's why today Ive decided to share a few tips and tricks with you to make this age old art of concentration easy for you . <p> 1 . Remove the clutter <p> Put away all those papers that are now lying in a jumble on your desk . <p> When you look at your desk and find it in a complete mess , this sends a negative signal to your mind-obviously a cluttered desk is not a welcoming view . <p> But as soon as you 've managed to get it uncluttered and tidy again , you 'll find the view itself provides you with some amount of positive boost-its like your desks telling you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling you by giving you that clean look ! <p> 2 . Keep disturbances out <p> This includes locking the door of your room if possible , switching off the cell phone , and taking measures to prevent any other disturbance that you might foresee . <p> Now many people have told me , they 're just too busy to keep their cell phones off while trying to concentrate . <p> If this is the case with you , keep your phone on silent mode . This will make sure you later know who called , so that you can call them back . <p> 3 . Keep distractions out <p> Youve already made sure that others wont disturb you . But what about yourself ? Keep out distractions as much as possible to prevent your own mind from straying . <p> This could include turning off the computer ( gasp ? Read on. ) , so that you 're not able to surf the web , turning off the television , the radio , the music system etc . <p> Now what if you 're working at the computer ? Then you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry ; I 've made that easy . See the next point . <p> 4 . Use the 5-minute strategy <p> This is a strategy you can use to get rid of virtually any bad habit . In relation to concentration , you can use this to stop yourself from surfing the web , chatting , leaving your work to watch TV , calling a friend and other similar distractions . <p> Whenever you feel the urge to , say , surf the web , tell yourself , " I 'll surf the web in 5 minutes . " Not surfing the web for the entire period while you 're working at the computer is difficult . But 5 minutes is easy , is n't it ? <p> Now after 5 minutes , chances are you 'll forget about the urge you felt . Even if you have n't , all you have to do is to tell yourself not to give in to your urge for just 5 more minutes . <p> I think you 've got it . You have to repeat this process till the urge goes away , which usually happens after just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now you can use this same strategy to make yourself do your work . <p> If you think you 're going to have to work for an hour , it will feel overwhelming . So again , tell yourself , " For the next 5 minutes I 'm going to do ( your task ) . " <p> This will work exactly like before . And after two or three ( Its a little more in this case ) such periods , your concentration will come naturally . <p> 5 . Take a break <p> Yes , finally-the fun part . <p> Our concentration wears off after every 1 to 2 hours . So rather than trying hard to pull back your concentration when you feel it slipping , take a break every once in a while . A good rule of thumb is 5 minutes after working for an hour , or 10 minutes after 2 hours , whichever suits you . <p> During these periods our mind rejuvenates itself . So when you go back to work after any such break , it becomes a lot easier for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to concentrate , try these simple techniques .

@@2098408 <h> How to Stay Awake at Work or School <p> Have you ever been so tired you almost fell asleep at work ? Did you ever wish you could just crawl under your desk and take a nap like George Costanza ? <p> Whether you were partying too hard the night before , up late feeding a newborn baby , or some other energy draining activity , you 've got an emergency that needs to be addressed pronto ! <p> Here are some steps you can take to make it through the day . They range from total retreat to commando " cowboy-up " tactics . Use the ones that will work for you and bookmark this for the next time this happens . ( Cause you know it will ! Doh ! ) <p> 1 . Go Home " Sick . " This is total retreat . Head into your bosss office and tell him or her that you are not feeling well and need to leave . Save this for only the most extreme situations . If you came into work there was probably something that needed to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oclock , then this can be a sweet relief . When you get home , get into bed and ditch the guilt . Go to sleep and start over again tomorrow . And then make a plan to have a better day tomorrow . <p> 2 . Staying Awake in Lecture Hall . This is can be a really tough one . The best way to handle this is with multiple tactics : <p> If allowed , bring coffee , discreet snacks , and gum . <p> Even if you are not a note taker , start writing down everything the teacher is saying to keep your mind alert . <p> Pain . This is kind of an emergency procedure . If you cant stay awake consider pinching yourself . I know its a little strange , but pain can keep you awake . <p> Stimulating Thoughts : think of something that makes you happy or makes you feel good . Ill leave it at that . <p> Online activity : this was n't around when I was in college , but I would imagine if you 're in the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and read Dumb Little Man . <p> Entertain Yourself : see if you can summon your extrasensory powers by willing someone to look at you . Or try across the room flirting . Why not ? <p> Do n't  do these things unless you want to fall out of your chair snoring and drooling : <p> Rest your head in your hand . <p> Rest close your eyes . <p> Lay your head down . <p> 3 . The Work Nap . If you are lucky enough to have a workplace that has an area for naps and if your workload can wait , then go ahead and take advantage of that benefit . Shoot for a 20-30 minute nap to take the edge off your exhaustion . A shorter nap will prevent you from waking up groggy . Bring some kind of an alarm with you such as your cell phone , or ask a colleague to wake you . <p> 4 . The Work at Home Nap . If you work at home , being sleepy on the job is not as much of a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from becoming a habit . And actually the habit is only a problem if it interferes with your productivity , clients , or your family . If you successfully incorporate napping into your schedule , then go for it . But if it becomes something that cuts into your work , try to only do this if you are so tired you cant get any work done . <p> 5 . The Work at Home Nap with Kids . This is similar to situation number 2 , because your " boss " is your kids . If the kids are young enough , try to get them to nap with you or nap when they nap . Of course do n't  leave young children unattended . If you 're afraid you cant stay awake , call a friend , family member , or babysitter to come over and help you out . Lastly , you can always try #5 , The Meditation Nap if you need to stay awake , but also need to get some rejuvenation . <p> 6 . The Meditation Nap . This is not a sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of renewal that you get after a short nap . In a nutshell a meditation nap is conscious quiet rest time . here 's how you do it . <p> Take the rest of the time to empty your mind of everything . A good way to do this is to mentally repeat one word or phrase such as " empty the mind " or " peace " or " om " or whatever works for you . As thoughts come into your mind , notice them like clouds going by in the sky , but do n't  grab hold . Just keep coming back to your word . <p> At the end of your allotted time open your eyes , take another couple deep breaths and stretches . Optional : Lightly place your hands over your eyes during part of the time . This helps eye strain tremendously . You can also try giving yourself a face and head massage . Here is some additional info on meditation naps . <p> 7 . Physical Movement . When people are sleep deprived , exercise can increase alertness . This is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to meet deadlines . Instead of giving into the head nodding and eyelid drooping , get up and get out for 10 minutes . Do some type of brisk physical movement like walking , jogging , jumping jacks , push ups , etc . If there is a stairwell , jog up and down the stairs 5 or 6 times . <p> 8 . Get Help from Colleagues . If you have some buddies at work , confide in them that you need their help with staying awake . See if there are any things you can work on together . Talking with co-workers will help keep your mind engaged and alert . <p> 9 . Pace Yourself . If you are just mildly tired , a good strategy is to simply take it real slow . Do n't  be too ambitious . Just take one thing at a time . And conserve your energy by avoiding conflict . Then at 5pm , zip on out to get home so you can rest ! <p> 10 . Take Multiple Breaks . If your work does n't  give you unlimited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up and walk . And when you take your breaks , close your eyes for 5 minutes . Try splashing some cold water on your face before heading back to your work . <p> 11 . Stimulate the Mind . Find something to laugh about periodically during the day even if it is as simple as your ridiculous predicament . Find something that is interesting , fun , stimulating , or otherwise pleasurable to think about . Focus your mind on these thoughts as much as you can during the day to keep your mind awake . <p> 12 . Eat Frequent Snacks . Healthy is best . Protein is good for energy that wont make you sleepy . Avoid sugar because it will give you a little boost , but then when the sugar crash comes it will be harder to take given your sleepiness . Try not to eat too much or too little . If you 're really hurting and cant do healthy , perhaps a steady stream of chocolate might do the trick . = <p> 13 . Caffeine . The key here is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results if you spread it out slowly over the day . This will keep your mind alert enough to stay awake , but it wont jolt you too much which could end up making you more tired later . <p> 14 . Commando . If your butt is on the line today , you need to get serious about staying awake which means you need to combine several of these tactics along with awakening your inner drill sergeant . Start with some fuel . Get some healthy food to eat during the day . Line up some caffeinated drinks that you can sip throughout the day . Each hour or half hour do 5 minutes of moving , stretching and deep breathing . Stay around people to keep your mind alert . If you have a buddy who can help keep you awake seek them out ! And give yourself a a prize at the finish line to look forward to by planning a treat for making it through the day , even if its simply slumping into bed when you get home . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098409 <h> 9 Proven Ways To Charge Up Your Motivation <p> Yeah , me too . Even though I 'm always motivated and all ready to take action on my goals , I have times when I feel disconnected with my inner muse . No matter whether you are Seth Godin or Robert Kiyosaki , all of us have our own down times where we do n't  feel like doing anything . It happens . Our productivity plummets to an all-time personal low as we drag our feet around on things we should be doing . It can be frustrating . <p> When left unchecked , this lack of motivation can get out of hand . Rather than let your productivity yo-yo based on your mood , you should learn to get in control of the situation and counteract with self-motivation strategies . Below are my 9 strategies to deal with situations of low motivation , and they have been proven to work wonders for myself , my readers and my clients . <p> Design your vision One of the biggest reasons why we are not motivated is because we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we are trying to achieve . What are you working so hard for every day ? What do you want to get out of this ? What is your dream outcome ? What are your end goals ? What will excite and spur you to move forward ? <p> While I 'm busy writing and growing my blog , The Personal Excellence Blog , every day , I never lose sight of my end vision . My vision is to have a reader base of millions , travel around the world to speak to people , launch my books and touch the lives of people everywhere . I may not be there yet , but I know I 'll reach there as long as I keep working hard . For example , after 1.5 years , The Personal Excellence Blog is now read by over 100,000 readers a month and I 'm an established personal excellence coach and speaker in my country ( Singapore ) . Even just typing about this now is making me feel very inspired by what 's ahead . With a big vision , it spurs me to create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get clear on the WHY Lack of motivation can come from losing sight of the " WHY " why we do the things we do . We are so busy with work and managing different areas of our life that every day turns into a routine of activities . It becomes a race to get as much done , without consciously evaluating why we are doing all these things . <p> Why do you live ? Why do you do the things you do ? Why do you slough away at work ? What is it for ? What do you want to get out of it ? These are all important questions to ask ourselves , and important questions to have answers to . If you do n't  have the answers , perhaps its time to seek them out . <p> Discovering my life purpose in 2006 has given me endless drive in life . I discovered my passion in helping others to achieve excellence and live their best life . This realization has led me to make bold life decisions , such as quitting my regular , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal development . Since then , I have started The Personal Excellence Blog , coached hundreds to achieve excellence in their lives and started The School of Personal Excellence ( my training school ) . This " WHY " drives me every day to reach greater heights and accomplish more . <p> Have deadlines Your goals should come with deadlines so that you will be spurred into action . After all , by Parkinsons Law , work takes as long as the amount of time we give to it . Not setting a date can cause us to slack off and dwindle on the task . If we set deadlines , we will be triggered to get things done by that date . Specifically when do you want to achieve this ? What is your cut-off date ? Subsequently , set the deadlines for your weekly and daily tasks too . <p> Some of my clients told me they do n't  want to set deadlines as they do n't  want to stress themselves into achieving the goals . That 's a cop-out . Stress from deadlines is only because you attach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are meant to be reference points so you can achieve them . You should strive to achieve them , but not beat yourself to a pulp if you do n't  achieve it . Commit to your deadlines , but do n't  attach yourself to them . <p> Take a rest Sometimes when we feel unmotivated , its cue for a rest . Just like a car with no fuel needs to be refueled , if we run out of energy , we need rest . I was in a slump before and it took me a couple of months to realize it was because I was n't resting at all . I was just working day-after-day and my mind and soul rebelled by taking a hiatus . I could n't get new ideas for my writing and some items on my task list became chores rather than enjoyments . <p> So , stop doing whatever you are doing and take a breather . What are some of your hobbies ? Spend some time doing them . Get away from your computer too . Engage yourself in things that interest you . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , listen to music , rest , watch a movie , etc . Simply relax . Itll give you renewed focus and energy . <p> Do things you love Sometimes , lack of motivation is a sign from our subconscious that were not doing things we love . Do you spend a good portion of your time doing things you do n't  like ? This applies to anything , from hanging out with people you do n't  like , or doing work you are passionless towards . <p> You do n't  need to do things you do n't  like to do . If you feel dead towards something , then stop doing it . There 's no point doing things you do n't  love . Life is too short to be spending it that way . Create an action plan to get out of things you do n't  like and move towards things you love . As long as you keep yourself stuck with things you feel dead towards , you will forever be held back by them . <p> For example , after working 2 years at my last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I was working in brand management and skincare , which was very different from my passion to help others grow . I loved weekends and hated Mondays . I would be hauling myself out of bed and dreading my feet to work during weekdays . Finally , I told myself this was it . I submitted my resignation letter and left in Sep 08 . I never looked back ever since . <p> Soak yourself in motivational materials Surround yourself in inspirational materials , such as self help books , podcasts , inspirational stories of people , inspirational speeches , motivational quotes and personal development blogs like Dumb Little Man , Zenhabits , Lifehack and Seth Godins blog . Every morning , I set aside some time to read personal development blogs as well as people who inspire me . In my room , I have motivational quotes plastered on my noticeboard , and I have my vision board of my biggest dreams and goals in life .

Want to grow your business ? Benchmark yourself with some of the top people in the industry . <p> Hang out with motivated people As Jim Rohn says , you are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with . Do you notice that when you are around positive people , you become more positive afterward , even when you are by yourself ? Similarly , when you hang around motivated people , their vibes will rub off you naturally too . Its kind of like diffusion . You will get motivated and be triggered to take action . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas and feel more stirred than usual to act on my goals .

I love living my passion , exercising , nightfall , the morning air , sunrises , my friends , my room , my elmo ( a birthday gift when I was 15 ) , living a vegan lifestyle , and many , many more .

@@2098412 <h> 9 Secrets to Cooking the Perfect Turkey <p> It is that special time of year again , when we spend lots of time in our kitchens , and make fabulous feasts for our family and friends . Whether you are cooking for a crowd , or just having an intimate dinner with your significant other , it pays to incorporate some turkey cooking tips to help ensure a juicy and tasty bird . <p> Roasting a turkey is much more difficult than many other types of poultry . A turkey has a much larger breast in comparison to the rest of the size of the bird . This means that the breast of the turkey will dry out before the rest of the bird cooks through . Commercial turkeys have been breed to have huge breasts because that is what consumers want . The modern commercial turkeys breasts are much larger than those of wild turkeys . <p> This is a dish that you only prepare once or twice a year , and you will probably be entertaining many friends and family too , so why not try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips that I have picked up over the years : <p> Pick the right Turkey The first secret to the perfect bird is to get a good quality turkey . If you have a large budget , there are online stores where you can purchase wild turkey breeds . You can also find a free range organic bird at your local organic grocery store . Or , for a small budget , just get the frozen sale bird from your local grocer . After all these tricks , we will make even the cheapest bird juicy and delicious . <p> Another consideration when picking a bird is its size . It is much better to use two little birds , than one huge old bird . Large old birds are tough , and will be very difficult to keep juicy through the long cooking process . <p> Brine The next secret to the perfect bird is to use a brine . Using a brine helps to moisten and flavor the bird . Most brines are made with 2 gallons of water , 1 cup of salt , 1/2 cup or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would like to add . When preparing the brine , you dissolve the sugar and salt in the water , and then ice it . When the brine is ice cold , you add the turkey , and let it sit in the brine for at least 6 hours , and up to to 24 hours . When you remove the bird from the brine , you have to rinse it very well . If you do not , the bird will be too salty . <p> Flip it Another secret to a perfectly juicy bird is to roast it upside down . Placing the breast side down will allow the juices from the fatty part of the bird to baste the breast during the cooking process . This does not produce a very pretty bird at all , but it tastes great . I have only done this method once , because appearance is important to me for my holiday turkeys . <p> Where to cook The next secret to a juicy bird is to use a counter top portable roaster . This will free up your oven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear by this method . I started using mine a couple of years back , I could n't be happier with it . You do have to use a smaller bird with the roaster , but the bird wont dry out , and stays much juicier . <p> Changing Heat The fifth secret to a delicious bird is to first start the roasting process in a very hot oven , about 450-500 degrees for the first 30 minutes of cooking . For a perfectly browned bird , rub some cooking oil on it . Rub the oil all over the turkey , after you have patted the skin as dry as possible . <p> Cover it The sixth secret to a perfect bird is to cover just the browned breast for the rest of the cooking time in aluminum foil . This will protect the breast more from not drying . Be sure to leave the rest of the bird exposed . <p> Know the temperature The next secret to a perfect turkey bird is to use an internal thermometer during the cooking process . An oven probe thermometer with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep tabs on your bird , without opening the oven repeatedly and losing your precious heat . This will ensure more even and faster cooking . You put the thermometer in the thickest part of the breast and set the thermometer to 161 degrees . The turkeys internal temperature will continue to rise to the magic 165 degrees while it is resting outside of the oven . <p> Hold the Stuffing The eighth secret to the perfect bird is to never ever put the dressing in the bird . By the time the center of the stuffing is up to temperature , the bird has been overcooked , and the breast will inevitably be dry . Instead , use fruits , vegetables , or herbs and wine in the breast cavity to help moisten the bird . You can even do a beer can turkey , but you will have to use a small turkey , about 8-10 lbs . If you insist on using a giant bird , you will have to use a big beer can , like Fosters . <p> Do n't  rush to eat The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes out of the oven . You should tent he whole bird with aluminum foil , and let it rest for at least 15 minutes . I have read an ideal resting time is half the amount of the cooking time . So I make sure to rest the bird for as long as I can hold my family back . <p> Using all or some of these secrets will hopefully help make your holiday bird a bit juicier this year . Hope you have a tasty Thanksgiving turkey bird . <p> Written on 11/23/2009 by Angelia McGowan .

@@2098416 <h> 10 Ways to Stop All That Drama in Your Life <p> As you grow up you realize that being honest and straightforward does n't  mean you blurt out everything that comes into your mind . You have two choices , either you learn to be diplomatic or if that route is too political for you , then learn to keep quiet ! If you choose neither then you will only create trouble for yourself . <p> 2 . Do not give advice unless asked for <p> While we can never watch our near and dear ones suffer. - Unless you are a parent you better keep your opinions to yourself . No one likes to hear how he or she should lead his or her life . Plus , the advice would always be better received when the other person is open and asking for it . <p> 3 . NO ! You do not know what is best for everyone around you <p> All of us think we know best how the world ( which includes our friends and family ) should operate , and what is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! God gave everyone brains for a reason and there is something called destiny . <p> 4 . Do not over-commit yourself- <p> When you try to please everyone and be everywhere - all the time- you end up making a lot of people mad . Do not commit to more than what you can handle else- you end up with frustration and disappointments . <p> 5 . Prioritize <p> The solution to #4 would be to learn to prioritize . For example , Parents anniversary comes- before- your girl friends boy-troubles . Brothers birthday *should* come- before- a date with your boyfriend etc. etc . They seem like common sense but seldom are . When you do n't  prioritize , you ask for trouble . <p> 6 . Be Honest <p> It is not always easy to be honest and sometimes one might indulge in false praises and promises but in the long term both have the potential to land you in trouble . It is better to say nothing at all than to sing false praises . <p> 7 . Mind your own business <p> In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's business . If it does n't  concern you then do not try to solve the problem . Let go of that Super-Man/Wonder-Woman Complex . You are not sent on this earth to solve everyone 's issues . Just focus on improving yourself and the world will be a better place . <p> 8 . Learn to say- NO ! <p> Now , this requires special skills because even when someone asks for advice ( #2 ) or is requesting you to poke your nose in their business ( #7 ) you have to be smart enough to recognize when to say- NO ! - and politely retract yourself from the- situation . <p> 9 . Be Kind &amp; Courteous- <p> So far it might seem that you have to be a real cold-hearted human being to keep your life simple . That 's not really the case . More often than not just by being compassionate , yet firm , you can keep yourself at an arms distance from the- unpleasant encounters . Case in point Not everyone is your best friend . You are not about to die for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an end if you are not at the beck-and-call of each one of your friends . Maintaining a courteous distance can go a- long way . <p> 10 . Most importantly , do n't  gossip ! - <p> This is pretty straightforward and does n't  require an elaboration . Gossip leads to rumors and miscommunication. <h> 7 COMMENTS <p> One of my pet peeves with internet writing : lack of proofreading ! It causes the reader to spend soooo much more time trying to decipher the real meaning of a sentenceand it 's exasperating . Please go back and proofread this article for the errors . Oh , and there 's an error , also , in the author 's Bio post . Grrrrrr . <p> I personally went with the Navigator over the Dyson because I do n't  believe that I should have to spend $300-$500 on a vacuum to get decent results . The musical screw-up sent me fans into shocked silence . For instance , the DC33 possesses similar power but lacks in ease-of-use etc . <p> This is a great article ! Thank you for sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's so hard when people are just so rude . But I know how a little bit of niceness can go a long way and even make things better for me in the long-run .

@@2098417 <h> Seven Ways to Create More Time In Your Day <p> Do you ever feel like you have way too much time on your hands , and far too little work and life to fit into it ? Unless you 're a teen on summer break , I reckon its unlikely ! Most of us would love to have an extra couple of hours in each day . With two more hours , we could find time to exercise , to read some of the books that are gathering dust on our shelves , to spend time with the kids <p> But , unless you 're lucky enough to find a magic genie who can stretch your days to twenty-six hours long , you 're stuck with the same twenty-four hours per day as the rest of the world . So how can you create more time in your day ? Here are seven magic ways : <p> Get Up Earlier Okay , this ones not exactly genius ( or even genie ) level . Get up fifteen minutes earlier . If you 're like most folk , your morning probably feels rushed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , grab a hasty shower , maybe get some breakfast if you 're lucky , sort out the kids/cat/partner and dash off to work . <p> Getting up just a bit earlier can give you some breathing space . Perhaps itll give you time to actually sit down and enjoy your breakfast for once . Maybe you can use that fifteen minutes a day to read through that book or stack of journals that you keep meaning to get to . <p> Create a Plan <p> At the start of your workday , before you even check your emails , make a plan . Jot down the three most important tasks you want to accomplish that day . Put a big star next to the most important . Now , before you get into the busy work of emails and photocopying and tidying your desk , start on that important task and see it through to the end. - <p> Surprisingly few people take the time to plan their workday , and end up spinning their wheels on a number of low-priority tasks without really accomplishing anything big . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to keep similar tasks together . When you switch from one thing to another , your brain takes a few minutes to catch up and settle in : constantly jumping between answering emails and writing a report and tidying up your desk just means you 'll lose track of where you 'd got to . You might feel like you 're working super-efficiently ( because your mind is buzzing all over the place ) , but you 'll actually be wasting a lot of time. - <p> If you need to answer a number of emails , do them all at once . The same goes for phone calls , filing , photocopying and other similar tasks . <p> Block Out Chunks of Time Do you have some big project that youd love to get round to ? Maybe its writing a novel , starting a business , training for a marathon , decluttering your home whatever your particular venture or goal , you never get around to making progress. - <p> The best way to tackle big projects like this is to force them into your schedule . Spare time does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious effort to create it . Block out a weekend afternoon , for instance : tell family and friends you have another engagement that day . Then storm on ahead with that project . Trust me , you 'll feel great for having made a start . <p> Do n't  Multitask Although multitasking feels efficient " because it feels busy " it actually loses you time . By sticking to doing one thing at a time , you 'll be much more focused and able to produce your best work : there 's nothing efficient about rushing a job which you then end up having to redo. - <p> Stay Focused When you are working on a task , make a conscious effort to remain focused . Sure , you 'll have intrusive thoughts like maybe I should check my email or this desk could really do with tidying . Just recognize that those thoughts are impulses which you do n't  need to give into . If you think of something while you 're working on your task like I really must phone Joe , then just make a note on a bit of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get on with the task at hand. - <p> You 'll accomplish much more by working in a deliberately focused way than if you let yourself jump around from task to task as things come to mind . <p> Finish Work On Time Finally , one of the best ways to make more time in your life is to finish your work on time ! If you work for an employer , make an effort to leave the office on time " at least a couple of days each week . ( I know this is difficult if your workplace has a long-hours culture ) . - <p> If you work for yourself , you need to be even more self-disciplined , as your work is likely to be very easily accessible when you 're at home ! Some good ways to create a boundary at the end of the day are to keep your work separate from the rooms in your house where you relax . You could also schedule something social in the evening ( perhaps meeting friends for a drink ) so that you cant get caught up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do with an extra ten hours every week ?

@@2098430 <h> 4 Keys To Speaking Your Mind With Confidence <p> How many of us have believed we should remain quiet , instead of consistently fighting for our truly remarkable ability to vocalize our thoughts ? While its true that listening to others at least some of the time , can transform you into a well-respected person , sometimes echoing your voice into distant territories can change the world . Too many of us believe we are not worthy . But the most timeless route to demonstrate your infinite capabilities , and endlessly interesting thinking , is to open your lips and express something confidently . <p> Confident people know they have an advantage , because they 're more likely to meet potential friends , travel to out-of-this world places , and have life-changing experiences , than those who are the exact opposite of them . Regardless if you 're afraid to talk or cant go a minute without talking , I 've learned some key methods of becoming a more confident human being through countless moments of keeping silent . Read on to start living a more self-confident lifestyle today ! <p> Practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have spoken at least once , but instead mumbled a jumble of incoherent language . Just recall how many times you 've muttered um or an uh , and werent able to define what you 've wanted when you nervous about something . Its not a big problem until it often gets in the way of getting what you want . Notice how people might have gotten what they wanted , and you had much less of a say of your own wants , simply because you werent able to articulate your desires clearly . Confident people know how important language is , and how it is both a tool to tear down hidden assumptions and a barrier to positive change . Do n't  expect people to read your mind . A good tip is to take a public speaking course online or at a local community college . You 'll likely not only learn how to speak clearly , but learn how to speak better in general . <p> Set clear boundaries for yourself : This is especially important , particularly if you want to become more confident to discuss what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to help clean their house an hour each day for five days . What exactly do you want ? In other words , your request is n't something that you kind of want . You could set a boundary of only vacuuming and cleaning dishes an hour , for three days a week since you 've had a back injury recently . Imagine how much you would lose if you werent willing to simply disagree and come up with a more practical plan . Now say you 're trying to help tutor a student . You could set a clear boundary of only helping them if they choose to read their textbook first . If you did n't  tell the student that , imagine how they might have begged you to solve every problem without trying to help themselves first ! Confident people are not only good at getting what they want , they 're good at knowing what they truly want . Try to learn how to set more maintainable goals , using devices such as SMART goals . Knowing how to set goals will help shape what your boundaries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for your own needs and wants . After all , no one is willing to take responsibility for what you need or would like to have , but you . People who are n't  confident blame others , when they could take responsibility for at least some of the issue . They think the world is too overwhelming for them to handle , so they refuse to step in and instead sit in the sidelines . You cant always wait for someone to help you , so you have to take the initiative to help yourself . Confident people will be afraid at times , but they still do it , because they know that the benefits greatly outweigh the pain and fear . Make an effort to look after your ambitions , desires , and cravings . Instead of putting the blame on someone else , ask yourself " what can I do to change this ? " Start making an effort to take responsibility for your own actions by living a healthy lifestyle and being mindful . If you do that , a strong-willed voice might very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Speak to please yourself : Have you ever felt like people expected too much from you ? Many of us expect others to act a certain way , and conform to a certain label , so that they can meet our expectations . I say to abandon that . The next time you want to speak for something , think of how you alone will benefit . What will you alone gain ? What new ideals , or ways of thinking will you reap ? Its always good to do nice things , but you should want to become more confident mainly in order to satisfy yourself . Confident people want to please themselves , while not wanting to step on others peoples feet . Start planning and writing your own bucket list , and think about it for a little while , perhaps while walking briskly or having a shower . Do whatever you can , and edit it if you need to . It will help acknowledge what 's truly important to you , and cause you to want you to make yourself happier . <p> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more confidently around other people just by reading this alone . You 'll need to practice for days , and possibly even months , if you truly want to become assured , assertive , confident , whatever . Although all of this might seem too overwhelming to digest , it will become a lot easier if you learn how to respect yourself first . In fact , taking care of who you are yourself is arguably the most crucial method of not only speaking up for yourself , but becoming a more accomplished and enriched human being . Confident people also surround themselves with confident people , so motivate yourself to hang out with other people . And finally if you can speak , you probably can speak confidently .

And even if we know why we should drink water , its not a habit that many people form . <p> But there are some very powerful reasons to drink lots of water every day , and forming the habit is n't hard , with a little focus . <p> The thing about it is , we do n't  often focus on this habit . We end up drinking coffee , and lots of soda , and alcohol , not to mention fruit juices and teas and milk and a bunch of other possibilities . Or just as often , we do n't  drink enough fluids , and we become dehydrated and that is n't good for our health . <p> I 've made drinking water a daily habit , although I will admit that a couple of years ago I was more likely to drink anything but water . Now I do n't  drink anything but water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once in awhile a beer with dinner . I love it . <p> Here are 9 powerful reasons to drink water ( with tips on how to form the water habit afterwards ) : <p> Weight loss Water is one of the best tools for weight loss , first of all because it often replaces high-calorie drinks like soda and juice and alcohol with a drink that does n't  have any calories . But its also a great appetite suppressant , and often when we think were hungry , were actually just thirsty . Water has no fat , no calories , no carbs , no sugar . Drink plenty to help your weight-loss regimen. - <p> Heart healthy Drinking a good amount of water could lower your risks of a heart attack . A six-year study published in the May 1 , 2002 American Journal of Epidemiology found that those who drink more than 5 glasses of water a day were 41% less likely to die from a heart attack during the study period than those who drank less than two glasses . <p> Energy Being dehydrated can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dehydration of as little as 1 or 2 percent of your body weight . If you 're thirsty , you 're already dehydrated and this can lead to fatigue , muscle weakness , dizziness and other symptoms . <p> Headache cure Another symptom of dehydration is headaches .

There are lots of other causes of headaches of course , but dehydration is a common one . <p> Healthy skin Drinking water can clear up your skin and people often report a healthy glow after drinking water . It wo n't happen overnight , of course , but just a week of drinking a healthy amount of water can have good effects on your skin . <p> Digestive problems Our digestive systems need a good amount of water to digest food properly .

Exercise requires additional water , so be sure to hydrate before , during and after exercise . <p> How to form the water habit <p> So you 're convinced that water is healthier , but youd like to know more about how to make drinking water a daily habit . <p> Here are some tips that have helped me : <p> How much water ? This is a debatable question . What 's clear is that the old recommendation of " eight 8-ounce glasses a day " is n't right , for several reasons : that amount includes all dietary water intake , including food and non-water beverages ; it also ignores a persons body weight , which is an important factor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick or exercise . Its also not good to just drink when you 're thirsty you 're already dehydrated by then . Best is to form a routine : drink a glass when you wake up , a glass with each meal , a glass in between meals , and be sure to drink before , during and after exercise . Try to generally keep yourself from getting thirsty . <p> Carry a bottle <p> A lot of people find it useful to get a big plastic drinking bottle , fill it with water , and carry it around with them all day . I like to keep a glass of water at my desk , and I drink from it all day long . When its empty , I fill it up again , and keep drinking . <p> Set a reminder <p> Set your watch to beep at the top of each hour , or set a periodic computer reminder , so that you do n't  forget to drink water . <p> Substitute water If you would normally get a soda , or an alcoholic beverage , get a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at social functions . <p> Filter Instead of spending a fortune on bottled water , invest in a filter for your home faucet . Itll make tap water taste like bottled , at a fraction of the price . <p> Exercise Exercising can help make you want to drink water more . Its not necessary to drink sports drinks like Gatorade when you exercise , unless you are doing it for more than an hour . Just drink water . If you 're going to exercise , be sure to drink water a couple hours ahead of time , so that it will get through your system in time , and again , drink during and after exercise as well . <p> Track it It often helps , when forming a new habit , to keep track of it it increases awareness and helps you ensure that you 're staying on track .

You 're not alone.Over the years , I 've encountered my fair share of difficult people . People who do n't  turn their work in as promised , people who do n't  show up for meetings , people who stick vehemently to their views and refuse to collaborate , people who push back on work that they 're responsible for and more . Even as I run my own business , I work on collaboration projects and there are times where there are difficulties in getting a consensus because everyone is so firm in their views . <p> Years ago , I used to get bothered and worked up over such situations .

Hiding is n't a permanent solution . What 's more , in the context of work , its usually difficult to avoid or hide from someone , unless you quit from a job totally .

Losing your temper and flaring out at the other person typically is n't the best way to get him/her to collaborate with you . Unless you know that anger will trigger the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy to move him/her , it is better to assume a calm persona . <p> Someone who is calm is seen as being in control , centered and more respectable . Would you prefer to work with someone who is predominantly calm or someone who is always on edge ? When the person you are dealing with sees that you are calm despite whatever he/she is doing , you will start getting their attention . <p> Understand the persons intentions . I 'd like to believe that no one is difficult for the sake of being difficult . Even when it may seem that the person is just out to get you , there is always some underlying reason that is motivating them to act this way . Rarely is this motivation apparent . Try to identify the persons trigger : What is making him/her act in this manner ? What is stopping him/her from cooperating with you ? How can you help to meet his/her needs and resolve the situation ? - <p> Get some perspective from others . In all likelihood , your colleagues , managers and friends must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will be able to see things from a different angle and offer a different take on the situation .

We are just getting going and there are more useful workplace strategies ahead . <p> Let the person know where you are coming from . One thing that has worked for me is to let the person know my intentions behind what I am doing . Sometimes , they are being resistant because they think that you are just being difficult with them . Letting them in on the reason behind your actions and the full background of what is happening will enable them to empathize with your situation . This let 's them get them on-board much easier . <p> Build a rapport . With all the computers , emails and messaging systems , work sometimes turn into a mechanical process . Re-instill the human touch by connecting with your colleagues on a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Get to know them as people , and not colleagues . Learn more about their hobbies , their family , their lives . Foster strong connections . These will go a long way in your work . <p> Treat the person with respect . No one likes to be treated as if he/she is **28;0;TOOLONG . If you are going to treat the person with disrespect , its not going to be surprising if he/she treats you the same way as well . As the golden rule says , " Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . " <p> Focus on what can be actioned upon . Sometimes , you may be put into hot soup by your difficult colleagues , such as not receiving a piece of work they promised to give or being wrongly held responsible for something you did n't  do . Whatever it is , acknowledge that the situation has already occurred .

When all else fails , escalate to your manager . This is considered the trump card and should n't be used unless you 've completely exhausted your means . Sometimes , the only way to get someone moving is through the top-down approach , especially in bureaucratic organizations . Be careful not to exercise this option all the time as you would n't want your manager to think that you are incapable of handling your own problems .

To give them their proper titles they are Narcissists and at the extreme end of the spectrum Psychopaths . The tactics above will have no effect whatsoever on these types of people , and articles like this one have a tendency to create dysfunction and blame on the innocent others who are not Narcissists or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or some highly developed " interpersonal skills " to get along with or handle these people .. psychiatrists and prison wardens are often polled on this subject and their experience tells them there is nothing that works if there was , they would not re-offend . <p> It is high time that HR and the boardroom faced the reality that charming bullies , Narcissistic and Psychopathic people in positions of power got to the top not because they deserved it or worked for it but because they terrorised everyone better and more worthy out of the way . HR has a duty of care responsibility to challenge up with dignity at work , with codes of conduct for meetings and project reviews and by challenging organisational design . A complex matrix structure organisation is the preferred Psychopath / Narcissist environment . A normal environment in contrast has an absence of blame and scapegoat culture , a tradition of long service , treating those at all levels with dignity and respect , and a focus on employee wellbeing this includes long term rewards like a great pension programme rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return to Personnel which was founded in employee welfare rather than the corrupted HR which so often these days more accurately stands for " Henchman Resources " to protect those at the top regardless of how evil their deeds . <p> Cutting pay at the top also helps as it forces Narcissists who want short term rewards to go elsewhere . Often the best performing managers and leaders are mild mannered types who do not dominate or charm but reason , logically strategise and lead . These are the kind of people we need more of at the top , not the high drama , ego centric divas we currently focus on today . If you have an investment in any company read the annual report , the more arrogant the leaders are the more you should be worried about your moneyLehmann Brothers , RBS and Enron were arrogant , short term focussed and had many narcissistic values embedded in the corporate culture , if you value your money , pressure the organisation to reduce benefits at the top and strengthen them at the bottom , that 's the key to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Narcissists and Psychopaths causes physical damage to your brain and results in zombie like dissociation which HR euphemise as " employee disengagement " . This is actually the early stage of post traumatic stress disorder which is well documented in the literature of the children exposed long term to Narcissistic and Psychopathic parents e.g. Pete Walker , the ACE study etc . In the UK there is health and safety legislation around a duty of care . Employing Narcissists and Psychopaths causes damage to others so if your employer exposes you to this they are guilty of negligence .

If they are not let go of , they build up , causing emotional constipation.We end up lugging around the equivalent of a bag of crap strapped to our backs , which weighs us down and can easily end up spilling on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , because there becomes too much for us to manage . <p> To free yourself , you must choose to put down the bag of crap . <p> Take responsibility for your own well-being . Give yourself the freedom to let it go and express it in a healthy , safe manner without judgement , shame or blame for what comes out " remember , most of it is just crap . <p> Like our digestive system , we do need to clear the build-up of emotional waste every day if we want to feel truly happy and healthy . <p> Here some simple ways that you can help yourself to release your energetic waste and soothe your body to re-establish balance . <p> Strong , deep breathing This is the body 's most obvious mechanism to let go of stress and tension ; the intake of oxygen , which is then taken into the blood and sent to the muscles , cleansing any toxins ( built-up tension ) . The out-breath let 's go of some waste.By taking long , deep breaths with the conscious intention to both breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can quickly alter our emotional and physical state . Try counting for four deep , long in-breaths through the nose and out through an open mouth , deliberately making a noise as you do so . <p> Get active Tension is blocked emotional energy , which can build up in our muscles in key areas , such as the legs , shoulders , neck and back as a response to our nervous system and the impact of stress hormones produced every day in the brain and body , which are continuously responding to life 's stresses.The body needs to be active to release the blocked energy and change it into kinetic energy ( movement ) to flow freely once more . Try walking , running , dancing , gardening or swimming " anything that gets your heart pumping and muscles working . <p> Beat up your bed or go boxing/kick-boxing Do n't be afraid to physically release your anger , as the body is naturally designed to let it out . However , do take responsibility for being an adult and do it in a safe , contained way.For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can beat up your bed ; pile up your duvet and pillows and , using another cushion , vigorously beat up the pile and give yourself permission to add some verbal expression too . Bed beating is also a great , safe exercise for children and teenagers to release frustration . <p> NB : Tidying up your bed afterwards is important to help you calm down and re-settle . DO N'T FORGET TO BREATHE . <p> Scream , shout and swear Verbally express your frustrations and tension in the privacy of your parked car , in a field or by the sea " just open your mouth and express yourself freely and loudly without judgement , blame or shame about what comes out . <p> Scribble Get some paper and strongly- colored- pencils or pens and simply allow yourself to scribble like a kid , with enthusiasm , and fill the page .

Then rip the sheet up into tiny pieces and throw it away . <p> Write in a journal Use a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel and what is annoying you or stressing you . Do n't worry about spelling , grammar or handwriting ; just jot down your thoughts without censoring them .

Perhaps you could listen to emotive music or watch a sad movie to help put you in the mood . <p> Laugh Watch something funny that is guaranteed to make you laugh . You could also try going to a comedy night . Give yourself full permission to belly-laugh and express your laughter openly without shame or embarrassment . <p> MeditationMeditating can sound difficult , and people often struggle with focusing on their breathing , so I would suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chair , close your eyes and focus on what you can hear inside yourself and outside yourself , for a count of five slow breaths ( listening to some soothing music can help ) .

Talking honestly and being listened to by someone we trust allows us to express the energy we feel in our emotions . Rarely do we need advice ; often , we just need someone to really listen to us . <p> Give and receive hugs When we have warm physical contact with another being we trust , whether that is a human or an animal it soothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love drug ( oxytocin ) which slows the production of the bodies stress drugs ( cortisol and adrenaline ) resulting in deeper breathing , lower blood pressure and relaxation.Having a massage is a good substitute for this , and can be beneficial for both releasing muscular tension and soothing the nervous system . <p> Have a bath/shower Water is very soothing for the whole body , so take some time to relax in a warm bath or shower .

@@2098441 <h> 6 Simple Strategies to Stay Happy <p> It is a fact that if you want something too badly , it is likely to evade you . And this is truer for happiness than anything else . The reason why happiness seems to evade the millions of people searching for it is because they are looking in the wrong place . <p> Most people look for happiness " outside " themselves and not " inside " . Some feel that they would be happy if they could afford a house of their own . Others feel that they just have to own all the latest gizmos to finally find happiness . <p> There are some who may not seek happiness in material things but they are still not looking in the right place . They feel that they would be happy if they found the right life partner or if their children loved them more . Even in such cases , these people are searching for happiness " outside " themselves . <p> Have you ever wondered how most infants are extremely happy almost all the time ? Physical discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are transient and last for only a few minutes . The reason why infants are almost always in a state of natural happiness is because they are in constant awe of nature and the world around them . Unfortunately , it is the society , parents , friends , teachers and relatives that influence them with regards to what happiness should mean . <p> It may be difficult to undo all the layers of perception that have formed on the mind over time . However , it is never too late to try and address the issue and train your mind to be happy . There are some tips that can help you in shedding your inhibitions and breaking away from the shackles of predefined definitions of happiness . <p> Accept yourself " One of the key reasons why people are unhappy is that they do not really like or love themselves enough . It is essential that you accept yourself as what you are without any caveats and conditions to attain happiness . Do n't  get too critical about yourself " your looks , your brains , your capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself as you are . You will realize that once you are comfortable with what you are , others will accept you more willingly . <p> Happiness is a state of mind " It is important that you understand and appreciate that your happiness lies within . Consider this " no one can make you unhappy if you have decided for sure that you will be happy in every situation . If you have made up your mind to be happy , you can always seek out the positive aspects of a situation and remain happy . Life may throw challenges at you but solutions will come faster and to you if you face them with a smile on your face . <p> Prioritize your life <p> " As we grow older , the demands that various people and circumstances they lay on us increase . While on the one hand your job pressures increase , you may also feel the need to spend time with your family and children . At the same time , you may also want to enjoy life personally by doing the things that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off on a mountaineering trek . <p> It is important that you learn how to balance the various responsibilities that you may have . If any one of these tasks becomes paramount , you are likely to ignore the others . For example , if you get extremely preoccupied with your work , you family life are likely to miss you . On the other hand , if you are too consumed with your plans for your various hobbies , your job and family are likely to suffer . You may achieve momentary happiness but neither of these situations can result in happiness in the long run . <p> Take care of your health " an unhealthy body can not be the home of a happy mind . It is important that you understand the strong link between physical health and mental happiness . If you are fit and healthy , you are likely to exude positive energy . <p> Stay in the company of happy people " Ensure that you seek out people who are happy and cheerful all the time . Being in the company of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divert your mind towards negative thoughts . Avoid getting into the sulk mode by choosing the company of happy people . <p> Be grateful " Saying a small " thank you " for what you have can make a lot of difference . When you make it a habit to be grateful , you seek out the things that you do have . This helps you divert your mind from negative thoughts of what you do not have . This does not mean that you give up trying . On the other hand it encourages you to think of future goals and achievements in a positive manner . <p> Take time off to enjoy nature , life and the small things that we take for granted on a daily basis . A beautiful sunset can bring you joy , if only you would take a few minutes out of your daily schedule and look at it.Written for Dumb Little Man by Vishal P.

@@2098442 <h> Michael Jordans 10 Secrets To Reaching the Top <p> Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player that ever lived . Was he genetically predisposed to be faster and stronger , or was it his iron discipline that was responsible ? <p> After completing my masters degree in Biomedical Science I can say , with some facts and knowledge to back it up , that genetics only partially added to the phenomenal talents of this outstanding athlete . He competed against people that were taller , stronger , faster , and younger than him . Despite the challenges he still came out on top . Let 's take a look at the grains of wisdom that put him at the top of his game as well as his businesses.Michael Jordans 10 Success Secrets <p> Take Responsibility <p> " Some people want it to happen , some wish it would happen , others make it happen . " <p> Throughout his life , Michael Jordan had the honorable quality of taking responsibility for his own destiny . That means that he took action while others paused to ask questions , gather more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have mentors , but essentially it was his wrists that snapped the ball into the hoop . <p> One of the biggest causes of procrastination is the problem of hesitation . Sometimes people over think , and over analyze , which prevents them from taking that first step that will carry them one thousand miles . If you want to increase sales by trying a new technique , you will never know unless you try . This can apply to baking cakes , meeting singles , or anything that you can wrap your mind around . <p> Fail Freely <p> " I succeed . " <p> Can you believe that Michael Jordan missed so many shots and lost so many games ? I thought he was the best ! Well , he is indeed the best , and its because he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to get past his plateaus and persevere . That 's another big reason for procrastination . When we think well fail , we do not attempt . A good solution is to consider what the worst case scenario of failing would be , because once you do that , its never as bad as when the scenario was an unknown . Worst-case scenario is not that you 'll die , its that you lived a miserable ( or comfortable ) life as a coward . <p> Commit Yourself <p> " The game is my wife . It demands loyalty and responsibility , and it gives me back fulfillment and peace . " <p> Till death do we part , just me and my goal . I know in my heart that this is my role . When you give yourself fully and remove all other distractions you gain an invaluable level of attention to detail that will pool in resources you did not know you were capable of harnessing . <p> Enjoy Your Game <p> " Just play . Have fun . Enjoy the game . " <p> So many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs because they did n't  find their love , or just simply do n't  have the knack for taking pleasure in what they have . Consider the fact that you spend more time in your place of work than you do in your place of worship and with your family combined . By not being excited about , or getting full enjoyment out of work , you are cheating yourself from having a life of design and a life of fulfillment . I do n't  have a solution for your life , but I think you know which sacrifices you need to make , and are willing to make , in order to have the life of your dreams become your reality . <p> Play To Win <p> " I play to win , whether during practice or a real game . And I will not let anything get in the way of me and my competitive enthusiasm to win . " <p> Why bother playing the game of basketball , work , or life if you are n't  planning to win ? Do you even know what a statistically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look like ? If you 're in the game to make money does winning mean being the richest man in the world ? If you 're in the game for your family does that mean that you see them often and share the joys of life over a vibrant laugh ? Whatever your game is , make sure you define what a win looks like , and play to win . <p> Be Selfish and Humble <p> " To be successful you have to be selfish , or else you never achieve . And once you get to your highest level , then you have to be unselfish . Stay reachable . Stay in touch . Do n't  isolate . " <p> Take notes from Michael Jordan , first be selfish until you get on top , and once you are on top be humble and grounded . Being selfish in how you jump over people and slam dunk in their face , whether you are an athlete or business person . In a family setting this would mean taking care of your personal health before worrying about the well-being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are of no use , or even worse a burden , to your family . This is why in case of an air plane emergency they tell you to put the air mask on yourself first and then on your children . <p> Find Your Way Around <p> " Obstacles do n't  have to stop you . If you run into or work around it . " <p> Anything in life that is dear to us is worth so much because of the time and effort we put into acquiring it . This goes for championships , businesses , and most importantly our relationships . One thing that determines how hard we 've had to work is the amount of obstacles that were thrown in our way . Next time there 's an obstacle , do n't  let it hinder you , think about the fact that whatever you 're trying to reach will be that much worth it on the other side . <p> Make Your Own Expectations <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , then you never will change the outcome . " <p> The number one thing that will literally ruin your life is if you live it by someone elses expectations . Every single person is different and has their own views on what 's best , which follows what their goals are in this life . By listening to the voices of others , instead of your own voice , you are effectively submitting to live your life for the sake of accomplishing their goals . Set your own expectations , meet your own goals , and live your own extraordinary life ( or do n't  ) . <p> Now , Take One Shot <p> " I never looked at the consequences of missing a big shot . . . when you think about the consequences you always think of a negative result .

This act could take away our focus , paralyze us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing what is at hand . In life you can take one shot at a time , then another , and from this all your dreams will come true .

@@2098443 <h> How To Be Smart <p> Too many people think that intelligence is a gift of nature and that there is little anyone can do to improve theirs . IQ tests have managed to confuse many of us , leading us to believe that intelligence is largely fixed . It is not . <p> Just like swimming , cooking , dancing , and just about anything else , being smart is a skill that requires training . Unfortunately , our schools neglect to give us some of the most essential tools for being smart . <p> So how did I discover these tools ? It happened when I started working on my PhD . I did n't just want to do just any kind of research , I wanted to do research that mattered . The problem was that I had no idea how to do research , never mind research that mattered . So , I decided to try and understand professors that did important work . For years , I watched and I learned , and I am proud to say that I figured it out " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured it out , I was able to produce about four times the amount of work required to complete a PhD and still spend a lot of time with my family , friends , and on my hobbies . I will now share with you some of what I learned . <p> Practice Self-Critical Thinking We are all familiar with critical thinking , the act of questioning the assumptions of arguments that are put before us . Critical thinking is an invaluable skill " without it , we all become gullible and easily manipulated . The problems is that , we usually only apply critical thinking to other people 's ideas . When we apply critical thinking to our own ideas , its power reaches a whole new level . I call this self-critical thinking . Once you find a flaw with your argument , see if you can come up with a better idea . If you practice self-critical thinking , then you will find flaws in your arguments before anyone else . By practicing self-critical thinking , your intellect will amaze you . <p> Be Persistent Smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can do it , and so they keep trying until , finally , they succeed . You might know that Thomas Edison failed thousands of times before he succeeded . What you might not know is that just about all scientists experience failure on a regular basis . They spend months , even years , trying to find answers , until finally something works out . So if you want to be smart , be persistent . <p> Learn to Present Your Ideas Two people can have the same ideas , and the same views and opinions , and yet only one of them might be considered smart . We often forget that everyone is busy with their own lives ; they do n't have time to think about and analyze everything we say . If we do n't sell our ideas , virtually no one will recognize their merit . So , if you want others to know that you 're smart , learn how to present your ideas . - Speak clearly , articulate your words , and most importantly , let your enthusiasm about your ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most brilliant scientists spend half , yes , half , their time on presentation . If they find it worthwhile , so should you . Finally , learning to sell your ideas is not only good for your reputation , but it also can help others . If you have something to say , say it well , so that others can benefit from your message . <p> Finally , let me add that in order to be smart , you must also believe in yourself . We are all a lot more similar than we appear . Those who appear smarter than you simply had the rights tools and used these tools to exercise their minds .

@@2098445 <h> Learn To Eat Less And Feel More Satisfied <p> I do n't want to be too cheeky , but let 's face it " chances are you 're looking to lose a few pounds . You can admit it you know . I wo n't tell anyone . And besides , who is n't ? Most of us are in the same boat , or have been at some stage . This so-called epidemic is no surprise , if you think about it . After all , it 's been a long while since the days when we had to hunt for our food and occasionally go without . In fact , the situation now is pretty much the exact opposite of those caveman days . Wherever you look , there 's food . On every corner abound temptations and treats . And it seems that just about every event you attend offers up endless amounts of the stuff . You just ca n't get away . <p> And whether you 're someone who simply likes to indulge in good food or whether you 're doing your best to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I can help . <p> The truth is that there are certain approaches to eating that you may not have come across " ways to feel fuller and more energized by eating less food . Even better , there are a several very particular types of food that are actually designed to satisfy with just a small amount . I 'm sure you can already think of one or two of these , but let me refresh your memory . Rest assured " eating for weight loss and for health does n't mean you 'll be stuck chowing down on nothing but raw veg or salad and whole-grains all day long . Quite the contrary <p> Include Smart Fats At Every Meal . It 's true that each gram of fat has around 9 calories , compared to 4 for each gram of carbohydrates or protein . But who said that 's a bad thing ? When you choose good fats , not only does this dense amount of energy keep you feeling full for longer , you can actually boost your metabolism and spark endless bouts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The smartest fats for satiety and metabolism are those that include some essential Omega 3 , such as grass-fed rich proteins , eggs , walnuts and oily fish . Coconut oil is also a wonderful fat for burning fat and providing satisfaction , and avocado or extra virgin olive oil in just small amounts will definitely turn an ordinary salad or meal into a belly-filling delight . <p> Do n't Forget The Power Of Protein One of the best things about protein is that despite its low calorie per gram rating , it 's extremely energy-dense . This means it fills you up and keeps you full . In fact , protein is even said to trigger the satiety hormone PYY . And it does n't take much . <p> For example , if you usually choose a protein-free breakfast such as cereal , oats , fruit or yogurt ( okay that has a little protein , but not much ) , and you find yourself hungry again after just an hour or two , then try simply adding a boiled egg to your morning meal . You 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep going through even the busiest and most active of mornings . The same rule applies for lunch , for dinner , and even for snacks ( nuts or organic dairy are both good here ) if possible . <p> While many people eat protein in the evening , lunch can often be more sandwich or salad based . Nothing wrong with that , but you can make it last longer simply by adding some fresh fish , some chicken or beef strips , or even another egg to your meal . And that 's far better than being overtaken by hunger pangs later in the afternoon and giving in to candy ! <p> Choose Organic Whenever Possible According to this article organic food is significantly higher in minerals and antioxidants than conventional produce " up to 60% in fact . And sure , there are no doubt a myriad of studies stating that organic is no better than supermarket fare but I simply do n't buy it . Not least because the proof is quite evident in the taste of organic food . If you 've ever compared an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what I mean . It just tastes more real , does n't it ? And when it comes to satisfaction , it 's not about the quantity of food you eat , it 's about the nutritional value of that food . <p> Food higher in vitamins , minerals , enzymes and antioxidants fills you up more . This explains in part why we 're capable of working our way through an entire packet of cookies and still not feeling satisfied , despite being more than full . Choose organic or free-range foods and you just may find yourself eating less and losing that urge to sneak extras in between meals . <p> Eggs " Nature 's True Wonder Food Many health experts consider eggs to be one of nature 's only truly whole foods . A free-range or organic egg is high in essential omega-3 fatty acids which are crucial for metabolic function , energy , and mental focus . Make sure you eat the whole egg " it 's the yolk that contains the good cholesterol , the greatest amount of omega-3 , and over 6 grams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbeatable ( no pun intended ! ) " they 're easy to pack and eat on the go . I often hard-boil a couple the at night if I know I have a busy day coming up . <p> Healthy Junk Food If you 're going to choose something that you know to be unhealthy , why not be smart about it ? Chocolate-based candies , for example , are a smarter choice than purely sugar-based " the fat and small amount of protein in the chocolate will minimize the sugar high and result in a lesser insulin response . Chocolate-based candies with nuts in them are even better " at least the nut constitutes a real ' food . And if you can go so far as to choose dark chocolate with nuts , well " that 's almost healthy ! <p> A similar rule applies to savory snacks . As odd as it sounds , it makes far more sense from a health point of view to enjoy meals that are digested slower , lower the glycemic index of the meal and thus leave you feeling full for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other form of natural fat . For example , choose a lightly-creamed pasta over a tomato based pasta , do n't hold all the cheese on your pizza , and be sure to add a teaspoon or two of real butter to that mashed potato . <p> Are You Getting Enough Water ? There 's evidence to show that those pangs of hunger could be nothing more than a cry for water . Unfortunately , your body wo n't tell you in advance that you 're becoming dehydrated " once you get that urgent thirst you 're actually already well and truly dry on the inside . Considering that even very mild dehydration can impair mental function and focus , I 'd say this is a pretty serious situation . <p> If you find yourself often hungry before meals and know that you 're not honestly drinking adequate water , try upping your intake for at least a week . Aside from a short-term need for more bathroom breaks ( do n't worry , you will adapt ) you might just find that it 's not always food your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to smart snacking . The best part being that nuts and seeds are extremely yummy ! Aside from that , they 're an excellent source of protein , of fat , and of low-GI carbohydrate , and walnuts and Brazil nuts even contain omega-3 . These factors combine to mean that just a small handful can easily tide you over in that long gap between lunch , overtime , and dinner . <p> While fruit is fine for an afternoon snack , it can result in a sudden energy-high followed by increased hunger . Add some ( raw ) nuts and seeds to the mix and you 'll feel fueled for hours . As far as I can see , there 's only one catch here " it 's hard to stop at just a handful ! I get around this by bringing only small containers of nuts out with me each day . If I keep a huge packet with me there 's nothing that will stop me eating them all , and while it definitely fills me up , it does add up to a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Gravies Many pre-bottled or pre-prepared sauces and gravies are little more than sugar , cheap oils and synthetic chemicals . For this reason I encourage my clients to avoid them and make their own sauces from scratch . Sure , it takes a little more time but is n't your time better spent preparing healthy sustenance rather than frequent snack-trips to the corner store ? Satisfying and healthy stir-fry sauces can be based in simple herbs and spices like chili , ginger and garlic , and added to either coconut milk or raw honey and peanut butter . Pretty easy " and delicious . If gravy is your thing , do n't be afraid to use a gravy powder but be sure to add the blood and juices from your meat or you may be missing out on vital nutrients . <p> Slow Down That Chewing This might be the simplest but most effective technique that I can share with you . Did you know that people who eat too fast tend to overeat at every meal and have a higher likelihood of weight problems ? If eating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most likely setting yourself up for failure in this area . It really does pay to take at least 10 minutes to focus solely on your food .

Not such a bad idea . <p> To obtain true nutrition and satisfaction aim to chew it up to the point where you can actually drink your food . This might take you a few weeks to get the hang of but be sure to persevere . <p> Choose Foods You Instinctively Crave Sometimes all the rules and logic in the world mean nothing at all if you simply have an urge that ca n't be shaken . And it might be that your mind and belly are 100% set on something that you know is only going to provide a few minutes pleasure before throwing your energy and hunger all over the place .

Anyone can do that . What I am talking about is having the courage to- act on your plans . Its going out there and implementing your ideas so that you can succeed faster . <p> That 's how successful people operate . They let their mind free and then support their amazing ideas- by taking action . <p> My advice would be to promise yourself that the next time you get a brilliant idea that can help you succeed financially , think it through thoroughly and then go for it ! <p> Do n't  hesitate . That 's what losers do . <h> 3Asking Questions Is a Waste of Time <p> If you really need to know the answer to something , you should ask , right ? <p> Wrong . <p> Personally , I avoid asking people questions , especially if I could easily find the answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking others for answers , you start to rely on them . Relying on others limit- you , which is exactly what you want to avoid if you- want to overcome limitations . <p> Another reason you should stop asking questions is because the answer is probably within you already . Oftentimes , we ask questions only because we seek others confirmation and not the answer itself . <p> That 's why I say , if you dig deep down within yourself , you 'll be able to find the answers . Therefore , follow your guts and trust no one but yourself . You are the only one who truly- knows what you want . <h> 4Stop Doing What Others Do <p> Let 's say you got 2 choices : <p> 1 . Get- hired by a company 2 . Create- a company yourself and hire others <p> Most people would choose option 1 because that 's the norm and that 's what the majority does . This is exactly what I want you to completely stop doing . In fact , I recommend that you start playing around by doing one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As an example , If I were to say if I like Donald Trump or not , I could play around by saying " yes " when everyone else answered " no " . Of course , I- will have to argue- about my choice after , but that 's part of the game . <p> Playing against the norm is a great achievement because that means you 'll no longer be limited by the rules society places on your shoulders . <h> 5Believe With All Your Heart <p> If you stop believing in what you preach and practice , its just a matter of time- before you meet the wall . You have to believe in your ideas so strongly because when the going gets tough , your mind will do one thing and that is to lie to you . <p> Ignore your thoughts and say " I believe ! " instead . <p> Every big star , - every big name , and every successful- human being- on- this planet- used to be big believers as well . In fact , do n't  take it from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You do n't  become what you want , you become what you believe . " Oprah Winfrey <p> As you may have noticed , all these rules have something in common . They appeal to you on a personal level because success is an individual process . <p> There are no limits when you do n't  limit yourself .

@@2098465 <h> 7 Tips on How to Improve a Childs Working Memory <p> Sometimes , a child will have a hard time keeping a single bit of information in their mind while they are doing something else . If this is the case , they could have issues with their working memory . <p> Working memory refers to the use of information stored in ones short term memory . It is an important skill that kids use when they are learning and is vital for following directions with multiple steps . <p> These are some things that you can do in order to help improve your childs working memory . <h> 1 . Encourage Reading <p> When a child takes part in active reading strategies , they are likelier to have an easier time forming long term memories . Active reading strategies include not only taking notes and highlighting like most students do , but also speaking aloud and answering questions about the material that they are reading . <h> 2 . Visualization Skills <p> When the child is reading something , have them pause and ask them to imagine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As an example , ask them to set the table for a few people and ask them to picture it in their head . Have them draw this , and then describe it . As time goes on , they will be able to describe a scene- without drawing it . <h> 3 . Memory-Boosting Foods <p> Healthy fats , like those in fish , contain omega-3 fatty acids . These foods help improve memory for both short term and long term future . <p> One serving of fish per week has the ability to reduce a decline in memory by about 12% . The ideal serving is 3 ounces of fatty fish one time per week , at least . If fish is not an option , you may consider the pill form instead . <h> 4 . Ask Them to Teach You <p> Teaching another person- involves being able to make sense of information and then mentally organizing it , before being able to say it aloud . <p> When your child is learning a new skill , ask them to show you how to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . <h> 5 . Play Games Using their Visual Memory <p> There are a ton of matching games that can be played , or you can use something simple like a magazine or newspaper . Have them circle a certain word as many times as they can in one minute . Reading billboards on the highway and license plates on cars is always fun . <h> 6 . Break Information Up into Smaller Blocks <p> It is a known fact that information is easily remembered when it is broken up into parts , like phone numbers and social security numbers . When a child needs to be given directions , either write them out or give them one at a time . Writing assignments can be given using a graphic organizer so that the child will be able to remember what is going to be asked of them . <h> 7 . Play Cards <p> When playing card games like Uno , Go Fish , or Crazy Eights , the child will have to not only remember the rules of the game , but will also- need to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have . Have them help shuffle and deal the cards as well , and eventually they will be able to explain the rules and start a game all on their own . <p> Our working memory is what is used when you solve a math problem in your head , or successfully follow directions with multiple steps . If you believe your child is having problems with their working memory , it is never too late to begin implementing these suggestions that are great for the whole family . @qwx77 <p> Sasha has been a blogger for nearly 10 years .

@@2098468 <h> Why Surrendering Is Critical To Overcoming Obstacles In Life <p> Would you like to unleash the power within yourself that will enable you to achieve impressive results in whatever facet of life you focus on ? <p> The key is to surrender . <p> When most people make a decision to change a certain aspect of their lives , it 's more like a wish than a steadfast decision . A decision , on the other hand , is an important component in how we approach this concept of surrendering for success and overcoming obstacles . <p> The word decision comes from the same root word as incision which means to cut ' . When you make a decision , it is literally cutting out all other possibilities . So , when we decide to improve relationships , make money or lose weight , we start making specific moves towards that goal . <p> When we come across oppositions or challenges , we can often become derailed- even by our own willpower . We become less excited and increasingly frustrated which can make us feel a bit hopeless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ways in overcoming obstacles in life . <h> How do you stay on track and keep going ? <p> Surrender to the process . Recognize the frustration for what it is and surrender to the fact that obstacles happen for a reason . They do n't  just pop out for you to learn a lesson or change your approach , but , ultimately , they help you get closer to your end result . <p> Do n't let disappointment take over or wear you down as it can only make you eventually give up . Instead , surrender to the idea that deciding to pursue your goals means you are agreeing to cut out obstacles that can impede you . <p> This may require you to be more open-minded , learn new things and see fresh opportunities . Just do it ! Those things will help you evolve into the kind of person required to reach your goals . <h> What 's the difference between surrendering and giving up ? <p> Surrendering is different from giving up . <p> Giving up is what most people do . They take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their old ways . Surrendering is what successful people do . They acknowledge the process and steadfastly decide to follow it through , surrendering to the path ahead . With this mindset , you 'll be able to accept and plow through challenging or frustrating scenarios like a bulldozer . <p> When we truly surrender to the outcome , we surrender to the process . When you get to that point , you wo n't care about the roadblocks anymore . You care about the result . <p> In other words , you have to open your mind to new possibilities . Normal activities bring about normal results . Very few people have their ideal body , a huge bank balance , and amazing relationships . Those who have one , or all of these things , have committed to trying an out-of-the-ordinary approach . These abnormal activities have created abnormal , enviable results . <p> Once I truly decided that there was no other possibility for me an overworked , underpaid mechanic than to become a highly successful entrepreneur , I surrendered to that outcome and to whatever emotional states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to regroup and restart , then so be it . <p> This decision led me to build a multi-million dollar business . Since then , I 've progressed to achieving my body and fitness goals and I 've also cultivated my dream marriage . I 've created a truly extraordinary life ! <p> The person who has decided to be successful does n't beat themselves up about hiccups along the way ; they just get busy creating what they desire . People who are living their purpose do n't have the luxury of feeling sorry for themselves ; they forge ahead and take the steps required- in spite of it all . <p> To start overcoming obstacles in life , you should surrender to the journey that is being revealed to you with each step you take . You 're beyond the point of questioning whether its worth it or not or whether it 's as easy as it should be or not . You just need to continue doing it .

Henry Ford and Steve Jobs also had a bumpy journey to success . These icons are perfect examples that the road to success is anything but smooth . <p> Failure is inescapable and inevitable .

Looking at it in the right perspective , failure does n't mean it 's all over .

It only throws two choices in your way : either give up or fight again . It 's up to you to decide and take the call . You can choose to opt for the easy way out , step back and quit or make the hard choice of picking yourself up , getting back on your feet and starting all over again .

There 's no shame in it . Everyone fails sometimes . <p> Things wo n't always pan out the way you want them , but the sole responsibility should always be yours to take . You must be accountable for your actions , choices , and decisions . Never blame others and hold them responsible for your failures .

Look ahead , move on , and give yourself a chance to recover and rebuild yourself . <h> 7Develop mental toughness to triumph over failure <p> Setbacks should not dishearten or break you . Failure is not an end in itself so , do n't let it steal your confidence . Train yourself to take bad hits in life . Use failure to learn , grow and better yourself .

To facilitate and make the process faster , you must fight all negative thoughts that cross your mind and fill yourself with positivity . Look back and reflect on your own life how you faced past failures and overcame them . <p> Nothing can inspire you more than your personal experience and your own success story . You know you have dealt with it before and can do it again . <h> 9Let go of fear <p> When you experience failure , one thing is sure .

In most cases , failure happens because a person was n't able to prepare well , did n't plan properly or was ill-equipped .

@@2098476 <h> 3 Powerful Strategies On How To Improve Concentration <p> Youve identified your most important task ( MIT ) for the day , grabbed a cup of coffee and sat down to work on it . Ten minutes in and the urge to check your email , send a text and visit news sites kicks in . You do your routine check and get back to your MIT and , after another 10 minutes , you are on your routine check again . <p> Sounds familiar ? <p> Most people think this is normal and this way of thinking forces them to spend way more time on a task than it actually requires . No wonder why work weeks are n't 40 hours anymore . <h> On Focused Attention <p> The ability to focus for a long time on a single task is diminishing in 21st-century knowledge workers despite it being one of todays most valuable skills . It 's not something you put on your resume but its something you actually use on a daily basis to get stuff done . <p> I 've always wondered how come I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . I noticed that most of them allow all kinds of distractions while working so they end up spending way more time to complete their tasks . <p> We all know what these distractions are and they are n't going anywhere soon . So , instead of talking about distractions , we will focus on the solutions to help you get more things done in less time . <p> Today , I am going to share three powerful strategies that I have implemented and tested in my personal and work life . These are the strategies that taught me how to improve concentration . <h> 1Redefine Your Friendship with the Internet <p> The Internet is the core of all distractions , so let 's start with it . <p> These days , most of us have social media , emails or instant messaging apps open while working on a task that requires a lot of brainpower . <p> Most people think they can focus on a cognitively demanding task while surfing the internet and receiving constant notifications . It 's a huge misconception and research has proven it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to look at how you are using the internet . Is it making your life easier or is it distracting you from your most important task ( MIT ) on most days ? <p> If it 's the source of distractions , then you need to set new terms . This requires three elements . <p> A. Get notified on your own terms <p> Do n't let an email message from a coworker or social media notifications ruin your flow . <p> Turn off notifications from all social sites as well as your email on your smartphone . If you really want to get notified , choose to receive notifications only for emails or messages that are extremely- important . <p> If you ca n't turn off all notifications on your phone , at least minimize them . Decide what is important in your life . <p> B. Acknowledge FOMO ( Fear of Missing out ) <p> While working on a task , we all have a tendency to check social media or news sites because we feel like we are missing out on something important if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it really disrupts their ability to focus . <p> Instead of checking social or news sites 633 times during workday , have a couple of times during the day when you can go all in on it . Try it out for a couple days and notice how liberated you 'll feel . <p> C. Build a cave <p> If you have an option to work in a separate space , such as in a closed door office or just away from your colleagues , then turn that space into a focus cave for a couple of hours . Here 's how cave environment looks like : <p> -+ Tasks to be worked on has been identified already -+ No distraction ( electric or human ) allowed -+ Brain music ( ex : brain.fm ) for focus is on with earphones -+ Coffee/Tea is ready to be sipped <h> 2Schedule Your Training Sessions <p> Learning how to improve concentration is like going to the gym to lose weight or build muscles . To improve focus , you need to have training sessions throughout the workweek as well . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done at the same time is to use the good old Pomodoro technique . No one can beat Pomodoro technique when it comes to focusing . <p> -+ Select your MIT. -+ Set the timer for a specified time ( example 30 min ) . -+ Work on one task for the set time period with no distractions allowed . -+ Take a quick break of 5-10 mins and then get back to another session Tip : Take a break away from your <p> Tip : Take a break away from your workspace . <p> You can download a Pomodoro timer easily from the internet . I use a tool called Tomighty . <p> If you can do 4 to 5 sessions of 30 to 45 minutes a day , you ca n't even imagine how much stuff you can get done . Beginners find it hard to complete 4-5 sessions , so if you ca n't , do n't get discouraged . Just start with 2 or whatever is comfortable for you . <p> If you are a beginner , you wo n't be able for focus for 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't used to it yet . Just start with a small number and increment from there . <h> 3Learn to Multitask <p> So far , hundreds , if not thousands , of research papers have proved that multitasking is bad for the human brain . Am I stupid to recommend multitasking then ? No . <p> Even with all the research and literature proving multitasking is bad , more and more people are getting into it every day . One common complaint people have is that they have so much to do so they have to multitask . <p> To make a better use of it , learn how to differentiate your tasks . Some of them can be done simultaneously but others require intense focus . <p> For example , you can easily fill out a status report while chatting with your colleague on an instant messaging tool . On the other side , there are tasks , such as writing software design documentation , that require 100% focus and ca n't be done effectively while multitasking . <p> So , the takeaway here is to look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense focus and use Pomodoro technique to go through them . <p> Pro Tip : Use afternoons for multitasking and morning for tasks that require focus . <h> Steps On How To Improve Concentration <p> Here are the step-by-step instructions on how to apply these three strategies to- increase your concentration : <p> 1 . Before you start anything else at work , look at your tasks and identify those that require 100% focus and which tasks can be completed while multitasking. 2 . Select your MIT ( most important task ) . 3 . Make sure all notifications are turned off , except highly important ones . 4 . Set your Pomodoro timer to your desired working time . 5 . Work through that time and resist the urge to give up , browse the internet or check your phone . 6 . Once the time is over , take a break for 5 to 10 mins . Step away from your desk and get some fresh air if possible . 7 . Return to your desk for another intense session . Continue with your existing task or start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your most important tasks , you can continue completing the other tasks on your lists which you can do even while getting interrupted . <h> Conclusion <p> It sucks to be late for deadlines or to stay late at work just because you cant finish your tasks due to all the distractions . However , if you follow the methods outlined above , - I can promise you that you can accomplish your tasks in half the time . Now , imagine having extra time for things you love to do because you learned to curb distractions and save time due to improved focus . <p> What are the common barriers that prevent you from focusing on a single task for more than 30 minutes ? <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098477 <h> 11 Secrets To Building High Self-Esteem To Find Happiness <p> A high self-esteem means you know what you 're worth and can hold your head high when others are losing theirs .

But , how are you going to run 26.2 miles when you get winded running for the bus ? <p> The truth is that anyone can complete a marathon if he or she trains properly. - He only needs to have the desire , time and the right tips on how to train for a marathon . <p> " Anyone that takes the time to prepare for a marathon can do it , " says Shelly Glover , coauthor of The Competitive Runners Handbook . " You can run a marathon without training properly , but you wo n't enjoy the experience . " <h> Getting Started <p> If you have never run before or you run very infrequently , Glover advises that you start running regularly for about a year . You can build it up to 15 miles a week . Other experts , like David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beginners should have , at least , five months to train . <p> That includes one or more months of doing three-mile runs several times a week and then four months to train in earnest . <p> For people who run regularly , most training programs last three to five months , depending on the runners strength and ability . The more time you give yourself to train , the better experience and the less risk of injury you 'll have . <p> Plus , the more time you spend training , the more confidence you 'll have when you run the race . Physical ability is important , but your mental outlook is even more so . <p> Most importantly , you need to be in good physical shape before training . If your strength , flexibility or overall health is weak , you 'll need to work on that . You can consider weight training , yoga or a visit to your general health-care practitioner beforehand . <h> The Training <p> " The journey to the marathon is as important as completing it , " says Glover . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-growth , the level of discipline and organization you need it all helps you believe in yourself . " <p> Weekly training schedules for beginners generally begin with four to six runs per week that total 15 to 20 miles . For the succeeding weeks , you need to increase your mileage by 5 to 10% , up to 40 miles a week . <p> The weekly long run is the most important aspect of the training . First-time and casual marathoners should gradually increase the length of their weekly long runs . They need to complete at least three runs of 18 to 20 miles prior to the marathon . <p> Your last long run should be completed two weeks before the marathon , leaving the last week or two to recover from your training . This will enable you to peak on marathon day . <p> Charity Curley , 32 , describes herself as " sort of a runner " before she made the decision to run in the New York City Marathon . Running a marathon has always been on her lifes to-do list . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Marathon stragglers one night that she decided to go for it . <p> " I was standing on the curb , unaware that it was the day of the marathon , and I saw people cheering for a group of very tired-looking walkers and slow runners , " Curley says . " These were people who were really committed to finishing , even if it took them seven hours to do so . It was very inspiring to me . " <p> She entered the lottery for the New York City Marathon in 1999 but did n't  get in until 2001 . During those two years , she became a runner , building up to regular seven-mile runs . She followed one of the six 18-week training programs offered from New York Road Runners , which targeted both first-timers and advanced marathoners . <p> " It was like a recipe , " Curley says of the weekly running schedule . " I picked the one that looked like it fit me the most and followed it to a tee . " She also found the lectures offered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just less than four hours , a time she was very pleased with . <h> Cross Training <p> Glover is not a big fan of cross-training . She believes that the most important thing to do to train for a marathon is run . <p> However , she does admit that strength and flexibility are important factors in conditioning . She also believes that yoga and weight training are helpful in preventing injury . Other marathon coaches do recommend cross-training to help build strength and stamina . <p> According to the New York City Marathon Website training guide , you can replace up to 25 percent of your mileage with other activities . This includes biking , swimming or other aerobic non-weight-bearing exercise . But , you must do these non-running activities at a pace that will- help you achieve the same mileage and <h> Shoes and Clothing <p> Knowing how to train for a marathon is only a part of the preparation .

Most runners stores have knowledgeable salespeople who can help you find the proper shoe for your foot and stride . <p> Keep in mind that not all running shoes can fit everyone . The shape and arch of your foot will dictate the type of shoe you should purchase . <p> You should replace your sneakers after every 500 miles of running . During your training , you should consider getting two pairs of shoes so that you do n't  wear them out before the race . <p> You do n't  want to get new shoes just before the marathon as you need to break them in . Glover suggests making sure you 've run about 100 miles in them , including one long run . <p> Women also need to invest in a good jog bra that fits well . Glover warns women runners that their breast size might change during training due to weight loss or muscle gain. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leaving marks or you notice the bra moving too much while you 're training . <p> Because your training ca n't be put on hold due to inclement weather , its also a good idea to treat yourself with an all-weather gear .

When you have a newborn at home , you cant afford to go without any essentials . Find as many sales as possible in your local grocery stores .

Something that can make you special or better than everyone else ? <p> Of- course , almost everyone wishes , in one way or another , to have some secret potential to unlock . Well , what if I told you that all your superhero dreams of unlimited power , potential , and unmatched skills are completely attainable ? <p> Now , you might probably be thinking that this is another cheesy scam . Well , its not . I 'm not trying to sell anything either . <p> I am trying to tell you the simple yet spectacular secret to success : mental toughness . <p> You may have probably heard of this before many times , but let me give you a new perspective . There are two kinds of talent in this world : talent you are born with and talent you develop . <p> Think of Mozart , Einstein , and Stephen Hawking . These are examples of people born with an amazing talent- or just pure genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially you and me , right ? <p> This is where mental toughness comes in . <p> You see , we all know that if we want something , all we need to do is work hard to obtain it . Easier said than done , but it makes sense . The problem with doing this is the universal law : nothing is free . Ever . <p> We might be willing to give up some time and hard work to achieve a goal , but to truly achieve that goal , we need to understand what it is going to cost . This is mental toughness . It 's not just mentally pushing yourself to endure through the hard times , but it is knowing what you are willing to give up , the challenges , and rewards . <p> Let me give you an example . I love to run . I run quite often and have even done races and triathlons . A friend of mine coaxed me into training for a 50-mile race50 MILES ! ! ! <p> For some reason , I agreed ( probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this demon of a race for several months . But , I ran into a problem . <p> You see , training so hard for so long tends to take its toll on the body , especially the tendons , ligaments , and joints . I have developed a pretty bad case of runner 's knee ( if you are a runner you will understand ) , and have put a lot of thought toward what I am going to do about this 50 miler . <p> Should I keep training and risk further injury ? Or should I quit ? - Well , if I am truly mentally tough , I will push through and suck it up , right ? Wrong . <p> Being mentally tough does not mean being an idiot . Being mentally tough means you see all your options and do the math . For example , with that situation , I can look at the problem as if there are only two perspectives : injure myself or quit . <p> I can consider what needs to be done to continue and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my injury and still complete it ? Yes . It would hurt like hell and maybe give me a permanent injury , but , yes , I could do it . But , do I want to take that risk ? No , I do n't . <p> So how can I achieve my goal without so much risk and pain ? I can treat the injury , let myself heal and then resume training . Is this a perfect plan ? No , I may still be injured and unable to race when the scheduled date arrives but that does n't matter . Why ? Because I have an entire lifetime to achieve this goal . <p> The point of this story and article is to give you a new perspective of what you can and can not do . Can you climb Mt . Everest ? Some of you reading this will say no . BUT YOU CAN , you just do n't want to . <p> Can you do 1,000 pushups in under an hour ? Right now , maybe not . But , eventually , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> You must understand what you are giving up ( time , sweat , pain ) and the worth of that to you . This is mental toughness . This is the power of the mind . Your body can do just about anything , you just need your mind to guide it . <p> How do you eat an elephant ? One bite at a time . If you want to be successful , then you must endure through the hard things . But more than that , you have to understand things in a simpler way . <p> One plus one is two . Pain plus sweat can give you a healthy body . Hard work plus schooling can give you a successful business . Walking one step millions of times can get you across the country . Swimming one stroke over and over can take you across the ocean . <p> Think about these things . If you want to be successful , remove yourself from your body and win with your mind .

Its about learning genuine things about a- place and its people . <p> While there are various ways to achieve that , every method provides a different level of exposure to people . Some prefer to go around a place in groups wearing matching outfits and led by a tourist guide with a flag . On the other hand , there are people who prefer to be low-key tourists when traveling . <p> Tourists must be at terms with the fact that they can never be locals when they are just visiting . This , however , does n't  mean that they ca n't experience a place as authentically as locals know it to be . To give you an idea , here are some tips to help- you travel like a local . <h> Get to know the place in advance <p> It is handy for travelers to go to the library or use Google to research about the place they are planning to visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to the area and try to learn from their experiences . Knowing an area in advance is probably the most important preparation any traveler can do . <h> Do n't do a bus tour for the entire journey <p> If you really want to get more out of your trip , its best if you do n't  fully rely on tours to take you everywhere that 's on your itinerary . Although bus tours are informative and entertaining , it will cause you to miss out on handling transactions on your own . <p> Some might think that 's a good thing since negotiating with other people and dealing with foreign currencies is intimidating and confusing . With package tours , a tourist will need not worry about itineraries , meals , tickets , transportation and stops . What they just need to do is join the tour . <h> Make friends with a local <p> It is common for travelers to visit a foreign land and not know anyone from the place .

Although convenient , this will not give you a legitimate feel of the place . <p> If you want to live like a local , even for just a short period , then you should consider living with the locals .

That is why it is best for travelers to get to know a place beforehand so that they can have a good idea on how to go about the city . After all , it is better to use public transportation if you really want to experience what locals do and how they go about their everyday lives . <h> Dress the part <p> Another important reminder for anyone traveling to a different country is to dress the part .

Sometimes , it is good to take a little detour , change something in your itinerary , get lost a little or be spontaneous . Doing these things , however , does not mean you have to be reckless . Be cautious , but be ready to wander .

While we desperately want to hear others telling us sorry , many times we turn this simple job into a chicken and egg game or use it to put blame on others .

For instance , you can kiss , hug , and even start tickling them . Who will remain angry at you if you are behaving this way ? However , to avoid making the situation worse , do not go overboard . Instead , start small and move up gradually until they give in . Wait until your partner has cooled off from the thing that made him/her mad . <h> 4Use puppy eyes <p> This is the reason why dogs get away with so much when they are still young .

Once you do this , they will know that you are genuinely sorry about what you did and that you value the relationship . <p> Well , these are some of the best ways to say sorry .

When we think about someone who undergoes hardship , we often think about those who are impoverished , disabled or marginalized in some way . What we fail to think about is subjective hardship . <h> 1What is subjective hardship ? <p> I define subjective hardship as the hardship that someone internalizes . Often , we can not see these hardships . But , just because we can not see them , does not mean that they are not real . Just because someone might seem fine on the outside , does not mean that person is not having real pain on the inside . <p> If a child from a high-income household expects hundreds of presents each year , and one year that child receives less than expected , there is a good chance that child will be undergoing subjective hardship . <p> Now , you might be thinking that this spoiled kid is not undergoing any hardship and that 's exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives has increased in recent years .

We have to reframe how we think about hardship to better understand what factors are leading to the increase in mental health service use . <h> 2Developing empathy for hardship <p> One of the best ways to understand how people conceptualize subjective hardship is to listen . Active listening is the key . Simply listening to someone who is going through some form of hardship , without judgment , could make all the difference . When we fail to account for subjective hardship , we forget that we are human . <p> Humans live and die by the expectations they create for their society , community , and families .

However , because we feel like no one will be able to understand the pain and what we are going through , we often hide them.That attitude is the barrier that we need to break down . Other people will only be able to understand you if you let them in . <p> Showing vulnerability is the easiest way to get another person to open up to you .

What we know less about and what we need to learn more about is subjective hardship . <p> No one has a perfect life . Because we place such a high value on money and material possessions , we often forget how important personal relationships , health , and moods are . No one deserves constant stress , anxiety or sadness . It is the right time- that we step up and show empathy for others . <p> The simplest way to show empathy is to listen to someones problems . Ask about what 's going on in their lives . Try kindness and aim to develop trust . <p> There is a good chance that person will return the favor in the future .

Bear in mind , however , that when you do invest in improving on a weakness , you are likely to hit a plateau . <p> So , what do you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Changing your approach can raise the ceiling in your area of assumed weakness . <p> As Gary Keller , in his #1 bestseller book entitled The One Thing , said , - " Natural ability can only take us so far before we hit our achievement ceiling . Models and Systems will help you break through that ceiling of achievement . " <p> You may never be a world-class lumberjack , but a chainsaw will take you further than an axe . Trying a new approach may be what you need . <p> A University of Florida basketball player , Canyon Barry , used an unconventional underhand free throw style to hit 42 shots in a row , setting a school record . <p> You might not look cool to some using a different approach to raise the ceiling of a weakness , but who cares . Just keep hitting your own free throws . <h> Just because it does n't come naturally to you does n't  mean it 's a weakness <p> Most things do n't  come naturally . They need to be learned . If you are struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your innate ability . <p> This is where a growth mindset ( believing that most basic abilities can be developed ) over a fixed mindset ( believing that things like intelligence or talent are fixed traits ) really makes a huge difference . <p> As Carol S. Dweck said in her book , Mindset , - " In the growth mindset , experiencing difficulty simply indicates the need to put in more effort . In the fixed mindset , difficulty means you do not have the- ability . " <p> A reader who wrote to her also commented the following : <p> " We should be careful not to view failure as a proof of stupidity but rather as a lack of knowledge , skill or experience which can all be remedied " <p> Can you raise the ceiling of that assumed weakness with a different learning approach and mindset ? Think about it . <h> The one thing worse than a weakness <p> The real thing that is going to hold you back is your bad habits . I believe that is the one thing that 's likely to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits can dampen your strengths and amplify your weaknesses . <p> A key element to embracing our weakness is facing those accompanying bad habits head on . It will not only help you raise the ceiling on a weakness , but its likely to boost your strengths , too . <h> Ready to maximize your potential ? <p> It does n't  feel good to know you are living below your potential . Mediocrity is not a crown to be worn proudly . Although its true that some things do n't  come naturally to you , it does n't  mean that they have to hold you back . <p> Freely admit your weaknesses and be transparent with them . Embrace the peace that comes with that decision and do n't  be afraid to ask for help . If you feel like your progress is slowing down , its when you change things up . Just believe that you can raise the ceiling of that weakness . <p> Be sure to kick those bad habits and just go maximize your potential ! @qwx77 <p> Sho Fola is a Software Engineer-turned-blogger who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stronger sense of significance and purpose .

While some seem to be lucky enough to be successful in an instant , there are people who have to work really hard to achieve their desired status in society . <p> It all comes down to the Hierarchy of Needs , how you approach each tier and how you can make the Law Of Attraction work for you . Once you understand these things , crazy levels of success can be yours ! <p> The Hierarchy of Needs breaks down human nature into- these five facets : <h> Physiological Needs <p> The first requirement for humans is our physiological needs . They are the basic things we need for survival , like oxygen , shelter , and food . Once we meet these needs , we can then move on to seeking the second tier . <h> 2 . Security and safety <p> This tier includes employment , money and being able to proactively provide for yourself and your family . If we fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humans , can bend our morals and values to obtain them . Take , for example , stealing food so your family can eat . <h> 3 . Love and belonging <p> This level involves love , intimacy , family and friendships . <p> A lot of us have our physiological and security needs handled most of the time . Once those things are obtained , we 're free to go for the next need in the hierarchy . <h> 4 . Self-esteem <p> This includes gaining confidence , achievement and respect . <p> This is where gaining recognition for your work and what you do play a big role . This is where you achieve real wealth which you can freely enjoy as you go higher in the hierarchy . <h> 5 . Self-actualization <p> The top part of the hierarchy is self-actualization . This is the- full expression of your creativity , where everything you do is an expression of your deeper self . <p> Before you can reach the top tier , you have to go through the lower levels first . You 're not really going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . <p> The hierarchy of needs explains a lot about life . <p> Today , we live in a world where we can easily find like-minded people who can lift us up and allow us to be who we really are . This has made tier 3 much easier to obtain . No matter where you live , you 'll find other people- you feel connected to . <p> But , culturally , our thoughts and behaviors are still stuck in the past and they wo n't make progressing that- easy . This is where those bold , driven and extreme people surpass many in their pursuit of their pie-in-the-sky goals . <p> There 's a hidden system within this structure that , once known , can allow you to transform your life . Once you apply the Law Of Attraction in relation to the Hierarchy Of Needs , you 'll attract circumstances , people , and opportunities that will allow your life to go where you desire . <p> My tip : - Skip tier three , focus directly on those top two levels and let the Law Of Attraction go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , - everything else will be easy . <p> By shifting your attention to the self-esteem and self-actualization levels , you 'll instantly start attracting the people and vehicles that will help you- be successful . <p> Be bold , driven and a bit crazy as you focus on gaining self-esteem and reaching self-actualization. - The rest of the hierarchy will fall into place for you in the most wonderful way. - Knowing how to be successful is only a part of the process .

Perhaps you 'd like more mentorship or opportunities- to develop new skills . Are you thinking about- getting a fatter paycheque at the end of each month ? <p> Whatever it is that you want , there 's a good chance you wo n't get it easily- unless you know the best tricks in persuading your boss . If that is the case , here 's a quick guide to help you out . <h> 1Understand Their Point of View <p> Before you ask for anything , work out why you have n't already been given it . Mapping out your boss ' mindset on this issue is important- since it can help you find a way to counter his- arguments . <p> Generally , you know your boss well enough to get a feel of how he- thinks , especially when it comes to making- big decisions . Despite this , - make sure you still ask him . As long as you frame your request- in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to answer your questions . <h> 2Collect Compelling Counter-Evidence <p> To get what you want , you need to be able to show your boss both that it 's a good idea and that any concerns your boss may have wo n't be a problem . This involves collecting evidence . <p> If you 're looking for a career or salary boost , you need to prove you deserve it . Hunt down performance reports , output statistics , glowing reviews from clients and so forth . Similarly , if you want support for a new way of working , then find reputable studies and surveys- that can back up your idea . <h> 3Present It As A- Benefit To Them <p> As wonderful and deserving as you undoubtedly are , if the work change you crave only benefits you , it- wont be on top of your boss ' list of priorities . <p> If you can find a way to present it as a gain for the- business , he s going to be keen to hear you out .

If you can argue that your suggestion will create improvements in those areas , you 're likely to be- a winner . <h> 4Make It Easy To Implement <p> By this point , you should have built such a persuasive case that your boss is , at least , open to considering the idea . However , - managers are busy people and if you let your boss go away without giving it much thought , it 's possible that- hell find the idea too ambitious . <p> To stop this from happening , lay out a quick and easy way to put your idea into practice and volunteer yourself for any of the required legwork . Talk about how the transition from your current position would work- and how any predictable problems that are likely to crop up would be surmounted . <h> 5Make It Time-Limited And Reversible <p> One of the reasons why all of us , including managers , are so scared of change is that it can be difficult to correct- if anything- goes wrong . To encourage your boss to be bold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . <p> This will give you and your boss enough time to see if the project will work for- the business . Trial periods are much easier to agree to . They 're easy to extend , too . <p> Allowing your boss to backtrack might seem like a risk , but it makes the initial agreement much more likely . As long as you can prove that your idea will work , it 's unlikely that your boss will force you to revert back to your previous position or working condition . <h> 6Play Devil 's Advocate <p> No matter how persuasive your argument is , your boss is still likely to throw some criticism at your- idea to check its value . Avoid getting caught off-guard by assessing- your own idea first . Finding the holes in your proposal can give you the opportunity to prepare either a solution to a potential- problem- or a convincing reason why the benefits still outweigh the cons . <p> It can actually be an effective technique to bring up some of these negatives while talking to your boss .

If you might be making any of them , then follow the tips on how you can avoid them . <h> 1Putting on a show <p> What you 're doing : We all feel the need to present the best of ourselves to a date and , in a way , perform for them . We understandably want to make sure that we come across as likable and leave a great first impression . With this , it is easy to cross the line and give a false representation of who we truly are . <p> How to stop : Rather than focusing on how you are coming across to your date , just try to be present in the moment with them . Be yourself , listen to your date and be engaging . This will help you to be able to decipher how you feel about your date instead of just wanting them to like you enough to go for a second date . <h> 2Being superficial <p> What you 're doing : Putting too much emphasis on a person 's looks or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eventually fade away and the relationship wo n't have enough of a solid foundation to stand on . <p> How to stop : Take the time to learn what your date 's core values and morals are .

However , it is important to pay attention to their behavior and trust your instincts when dating . <p> How to stop : If your date is rude to the waiter , talks about himself the entire time or gives you a bad feeling in your gut , trust that as a warning sign and do n't continue seeing them . If something bothers you on an early date , it will really irritate you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on chemistry <p> What you 're doing : If sparks are flying , then that is great , but do n't equate chemistry to love or compatibility . Things like physical attraction and charisma can all lead to chemistry , but that does n't necessarily mean the two of you will make a good pairing in the long run . <p> How to stop : Take the time and ask questions to find out more about the person you 're dating . It 's great to laugh and have a physical connection . Just make sure you are also getting to know who the other is as a person and that the things he cares about are also things you care about . <p> Early dating should be a fun and a pressure-free experience . The purpose is simply to get to know the other person and learn if the two of you could connect on a deeper level .

@@2098526 <h> Factors to Consider When Selecting the Appropriate Financing Option <p> Startup capital is hard to come by . Even with your savings , you will soon realize that you need a capital boost and that is when you will have to choose between the two common means of funding- " debt and equity financing . <h> What are these two funding options ? <p> Essentially , what these two options ask is whether you ( 1 ) need to take a loan for capital or ( 2 ) get an investor willing to invest in your company . Either option has significant business consequences , hence the thorough considerations . <p> Under debt financing , you will borrow money from a lender at an interest and you will be expected to repay the money after an agreed duration . On the other hand , equity financing is where you trade the ownership of your company for investment funds . Often , equity investors include venture capitalists and angel investors . <p> As a result of the disparity associated with these business financing options , you can not get funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , keep in mind the following factors : <h> 1Amount needed <p> How much capital does your business need ? The amount of capital required by your business will always determine the means of raising the money . It does n't make sense to look for a venture capitalist when your business needs only a small financial injection . Therefore , when in need of a small amount in capital , debt financing is the best alternative . <p> Venture capitalists and other investors make big investments and it is a financially sound decision to look for them when in need of a big sum of money . <h> 2Urgency <p> Loans are viable funding solutions when in urgent need of funds . Although there are associated costs , the urgency of the need supersedes the associated transactional fees making debt financing a great approach . Some of the easily available and affordable debt financing options include SBA loans or borrowing from peer-to-peer lenders online . <p> In the meantime , all forms of equity financing require time .

Do you have big expansion plans ? Do you foresee rapid growth in business and are in need of a big boost ? You need equity financing . <p> Equity lenders often look at a business 's potential for growth and how they can make greater returns for their investments . If you foresee this and are looking for financing to get you there , then you need to start your search for equity lenders . You will need to prepare a comprehensive business plan , detailed financial projections , and reports of the business history . These are essential for venture capitalists or angel investors but unnecessary in debt financing . <p> For equity financing , you also need to have a strong management team , a strong marketing acumen , and passion for your business . These will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> Although venture capitalists own a stake in your company , they will offer excellent and professional advice and guidance to your business meaning that you will avoid unnecessary pitfalls and mistakes . Equity investors are highly experienced and they will be the best mentors for your business . <p> Just like many other millennials running startup businesses , you may find yourself ridden with student loans and other debts . Besides providing help with the business , equity lenders will guide you on how to get control over the many debts . The most effective and the commonly advocated debt management strategy is debt consolidation . <p> The option of debt consolidation gives control over repayments by reducing the number of loans payable monthly and also the amount payable monthly at the end of the debt repayment period . With the lower interest rate charged on the debt consolidation loan , you will be at a better position to manage your debts and expenses . Besides personal loans , debt consolidation is an effective debt financing alternative for student loans , outstanding creditor bills , and credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking for a- big investment from venture capitalists , then you should come to terms with the fact that you will have to share your company with an investor .

You should note that a loan may not be enough to get you the necessary funding . <p> When in need of expertise and the guidance of an equity investor alongside funding , then , you will have to clearly highlight that fact and ask for funding to be repaid . <p> Besides getting bank loans and asking for mere funding from investors , you can take advantage of platforms offering crowdfunding . You should also consider talking to your friends and family , or get loans from non-governmental institutions , microfinance organizations or even getting the affordable government loans . There also are accelerators for startups that one can benefit from . <h> 5Interests and fees <p> When taking the debt financing option , you have to keep in mind the interest rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is determined by your credit score .

Be smart , get the lender 's amortization schedule , and determine if the loan will be expensive or affordable at the end of the repayment period . <p> In conclusion , your choice will depend on your personal interests , the urgency of funding , the cost of funding , and future implications on the growth of the company .

This means gathering information that will be relevant to the conversation . <p> For instance , if an employee is constantly late to work , make sure they understand the attendance policy . The more information you have , the better . You do n't want to go into a meeting unprepared for the conversation . <h> 3Do n't Talk Down <p> It is extremely important that you do n't talk down to your employee . If you belittle or say hurtful things , nothing will get better and the relationship between the two of you will deteriorate . <p> The end goal of every meeting should be to come to a mutual understanding and hopefully solve any problems that have arisen . If either party feels like they are n't valued , nothing will be accomplished . <h> 4Be Objective <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see him . This can be hard , especially if you have a good personal relationship with him . To remain objective , make sure to address the issue head on , come to a conclusion and move on . <h> 5Exercise Confidentiality <p> If an employee comes to you with an issue , respect his privacy . If a specific issue only concerns one employee , leave it in the room where it was discussed . The last thing you want is workplace gossip spreading around . <h> 6Offer Suggestions <p> Presenting the issue objectively is important but do n't leave it there . Make sure you also offer help and suggestions to the struggling employee . <p> This is much more helpful than just listing reasons why someone is n't performing well . Offer your help and mentorship if you need to or be a leader and look after your team . Take the initiative to provide your valuable insight and help those around change and achieve their goals . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098531 <h> What to Eat During Pregnancy <p> Are you stressed about maintaining a proper diet now that your baby is on the way ? <p> With so much conflicting information floating around , it can be very difficult to make up your mind . You are likely to receive tons of advice from a wide range of sources , like your friends and family , on what is considered healthy during pregnancy . <p> To lessen your stress , attached below is a list of what to eat during pregnancy . These foods are simple , yet they can help you get the well-balanced diet you and your baby needs . <h> Why is it important ? <p> Eating the right foods during your pregnancy is extremely important for the simple reason that you are now eating for two . An improper diet can adversely affect the development of the fetus , physically and mentally . <p> While weight loss during pregnancy is generally not advised , its also not a good idea to gain so much weight . It can lead to- gestational diabetes and other complications . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you need to ensure that your diet plan contains sufficient minerals , vitamins and other nutrients to supplement the growth of your baby- as well as the changes your body has to go through . <p> Here are some examples : <h> Eggs <p> Eggs are just great . For something that is not very high in calories , they sure pack a punch . They contain vitamins A and D , calcium , iron , potassium and even proteins . <p> A single egg has around 6 grams of protein , which play a critical role inside the human body . Since every cell is made up of protein , its sufficient intake is crucial for the growth of the baby and your own body . <p> Eggs are also rich in choline , which promotes your baby 's brain development . They can also reduce the risk of neural tube defects . <p> However , there are two things you need to be careful of when consuming eggs during pregnancy . <p> Eggs yolks are high in cholesterol , so you need to monitor your total cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always remember to cook your eggs thoroughly to avoid salmonella infection . <h> Salmon <p> We all know that salmon is a great source of high-quality protein which plays an important role in the baby 's development . Salmon is also an oily fish that is very rich in omega-3 fatty acids . <p> Most diets , including those of pregnant women , lack omega-3 fatty acids and have an abundance of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids . This imbalance can predispose them to cardiovascular diseases , cancer , and autoimmune disorders . <p> This makes the intake of omega-3 acids essential during pregnancy . Apart from that , the acids help promote the development of the brain and eyes of the fetus , too . <p> Due to the presence of mercury in fish , it is recommended to limit their intake to 340 grams per week during pregnancy . Salmon has the minimum concentration of mercury and is generally considered to be a safe option . <h> Yogurt <p> Yogurt is made up of dairy and has all of the nutritional benefits of milk . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones and teeth . Calcium is critical for a healthy heart , muscles , and the blood clotting process , too . <p> Women need around 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily during pregnancy and after the baby is born . It reduces the risk of pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia . Yogurt also contains probiotics , which are good bacteria that benefit the digestive system . <p> During pregnancy , your digestive tract slows down to increase the amount of nutrition absorbed from foods . This can lead to constipation and increased risk of hemorrhoids . So , make sure to add yogurt into your pregnancy diet . <p> However , be wary of packaged yogurt products that contain high amounts of sugar as they can cause excess weight gain during pregnancy . <h> Lean meat <p> Lean meats , such as chicken , are excellent sources of protein , iron , choline and vitamins . <p> During pregnancy , your body requires twice as much iron to facilitate the increase in blood volume . Iron is used to make hemoglobin and helps move oxygen around the body and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary for fetal and placental growth- during pregnancy . When there 's not enough iron , a woman becomes at risk of premature delivery as well as giving birth to a child with autism . <p> A diet that includes lean meats will help increase the amount of iron in a pregnant womans body . However , it can be difficult to get the recommended daily dose ( 27 milligrams ) from lean meats alone , especially for those women who develop an aversion to meat during pregnancy . <h> Sweet potato <p> Sweet potatoes are rich in vitamin A , C , dietary fiber , potassium and vitamin B-6 . Pregnant women require 700 milligrams of vitamin A daily and- sweet potatoes have 1922 milligrams of vitamin A per cup . One serving is more than enough to satisfy the daily requirement . <p> Apart from vitamin A , it also contains vitamin C , which is essential for the absorption of iron and the growth of the baby . <p> As mentioned before , the digestive system slows down during pregnancy which can cause certain problems . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the risk of constipation . Also , vitamin B-6 can limit morning sickness . <p> Sweet potatoes , however , should be consumed in moderation as excessive levels of vitamin A are associated with birth defects . <h> On making substitutes <p> Pregnancy can make food choices extremely difficult , especially with all those cravings and aversions . To make sure that you receive proper nutrition while satisfying your cravings for certain foods , you need to pick healthier substitutes . <p> If you feel like having a hot beverage on a cold winter night , go for a raspberry leaf tea instead of coffee . Feeling down and need some ice cream ? Have a cup of frozen yogurt with berries on top . Want something sweet ? Have a piece of dark chocolate rather than regular chocolate . <p> If you have an aversion for meat , try lentils or spinach to load up on your iron reserves .

@@2098532 <h> The Truth About Political Polarization And Its Relation To You <p> Youll have to deal with it when you are debating with friends and- family or making big decisions in life . You can either be a conservative fighting for free enterprise or a socialist fighting for wealth redistribution . <p> The truth is , it does n't really matter which side you choose because , at the end of the day , conservatism and socialism are two sides of the same coin . <p> To dive deeper into this , I will be using the hermetic premise of polarity . If you would like to know more about hermetic premises , you can check out my book : 8 Lessons to Succeed at Anything . <h> POLARITY <p> The premise of polarity states that polarity exists in everything and that there is no definitive line that separates two polar opposites . Just think about temperature ( hot/cold ) , wealth ( rich/poor ) , health ( skinny/fat ) and even the economy ( inflation/deflation ) . Political polarization is true as well . <p> As a coach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to be Rich ? ' and , as expected , everyone immediately raises their hands . But , the truth is that people do n't really want to be rich , they just do n't want to be poor . Being rich is just their way of running away from being poor . <p> Politically speaking , conservatives are just running away from what they want from socialism and socialists are running away from what they do n't want from conservatism . <h> LAW OF RHYTHM <p> Think of the law of rhythm as the swing of a pendulum . It covers equal length on both sides in the same amount of time , regardless of any circumstances . <p> When you engage in polarity , you activate the law of rhythm . <p> A friend of mine whose life goal was to become rich frequently finds himself poor more often . His life has become a rhythmic cycle of being poor , rich and then poor again . <p> In politics all around the world , you would often find two major parties competing for power . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as one party comes into power , the pendulum hits its maximum position and the swing back begins ( their downfall ) . At this time , the opposition does anything and everything they can to gain power back , which inevitably does happen at one point or another . <h> WHAT YOU RESIST PERSISTS <p> Its a common reaction to run away from things we find dangerous , unpleasant or unwanted . However , when we do run away , it reinforces the fact that what we do n't want is dangerous , unpleasant and unwanted . <p> For example , in a recent conversation I had with this extreme French socialist , she told me that what she wanted for the world was wealth redistribution for everyone . I asked her why . <p> She answered by saying that the rich have too much and they should share with the poor . As an example , she told me that she works on a rich mans boat and that the money she makes helps her live the life she has . She told me that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted . <p> I followed up this example of hers with a series of questions to see what she was truly running away from ( resisting ) . It turned out that she was unconsciously running away from the fear of failure . She believed that she was too incapable of becoming rich . <p> Therefore , to deal with her own fear and incapability issues , she demonized the rich and wanted to bring them down to her level . And her way of achieving this would be supporting and voting for someone who would bring up taxes for the rich and have more benefits for the poor . <p> Her decision is to back a regime that will discourage entrepreneurs and businessmen from conducting business and generate income , leading to a fall in the economy . This , as a result , can leave the government with not enough money to pay for benefits , leaving people poor and incapable . <p> In terms of conservatives , a good example is Donald Trump who wants to bring the USA back to the good old days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant country in the world that has everything under control . <p> He and his voters are unconsciously resisting change because of the fear of losing control . His strict immigration policy is one good example . He fears that too many immigrants from different cultures and backgrounds will change the way the country is . <h> FINDING WHAT IS IT THAT YOU TRULY WANT <p> Usually , people think that the solution to polarity is balancing the two opposing forces . In reality , however , a proper balance can never be achieved . As long as you are on a polarity , you will always experience oscillations . <p> The only way to escape polarity is to : <p> 1 . Become aware of the polarity you are in and to identify what you are running away from 2 . Identify what you truly want , while being free of what you do n't want . <p> Consider this : <p> The extreme socialist from the previous examples realized that she wanted wealth redistribution because she felt incapable . That gave her the freedom to realize that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also opened her eyes to the fact that a socialist or a conservative government would have little or no impact on her in relation to achieving her dream . <p> In conclusion , you can have a million reasons why you should be a socialist or conservative but you do n't really need to be either . When you realize what you truly want , you 'll find a way to get out of any political polarization you 're in . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098538 <h> Tension And Resolution : How To Make Success Effortless <p> Success has a different meaning for everyone , but , fundamentally , it means achieving the results that you want . It can involve finances , relationships and other personal goals . <p> Almost everyone struggles to be successful and most people associate the struggles they experience as as essential to their- success. - You can see this- more commonly in social media. - Youll find people constantly talking about hustling ' and working hard ' . <p> Although working can help you achieve your goals , its not really always the case . Some people worked really hard but still fail to get what they really want in life . <p> For example : <p> When I first started out coaching , I was ( still am ) passionate about business coaching- and so I planned my next move . Through an intuitive process , I realized that my next step was to make a status on Facebook to offer- my coaching services to businesses . <p> I never really trusted social media to give me the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And to my surprise , one of my friends got in touch with me and said that her dad was looking for a coach- for his business . <p> SIMPLE ! <p> After the easy part , I encountered a bit of difficulty when I was preparing my presentation . That is the point where I realized that hard work is necessary for success but it should be handled at the right time . <p> But , why is that ? <p> This can be explained by one of the hermetic premises I taught in my book 8 Lessons to Succeed at Anything ' . - This book covers 8 premises that can support you in creating the results that you want , regardless of what your circumstances are . <p> For this article , I will be covering the premise of Tension Seeks Resolution ' . <h> Tension Seeks Resolution <p> Tension is as common to life as breathing these days . We are always tensed up about something . <p> Basic human instinct suggests that if you experience tension , you 'll be compelled to resolve it . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping . <p> Tension has always had a negative perception from society . In reality , however , tension can be a great driving force for creativity . <p> Without tension , therell be no energy ; without energy , therell be no creation . <p> here 's an example to help you understand tension better . <p> Imagine that I have an elastic band between my two index fingers . The more I drive my fingers apart , the more the band stretches and the more energy ( tension ) it has . <p> Elastic bands tend to come back to their- original shape/position . For the one in my fingers , this can happen in 3 ways : <p> -My hands get tired and I let the stretch go . -The elastic band breaks . -I let it go from one finger and it flies off in the direction of the other finger . <p> If the elastic band is n't stretched , then it is n't going anywhere . <p> You can see a very simple example of this in the life of a student . <p> It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an exam . You can give him- a couple of days , week , month and even a year , but hell probably not- start studying or working hard till he comes close to the deadline . It is tension that makes- students work hard and pull off all-nighters . <p> In general , there are 2 types of tension : <h> 1Psychological Tension <p> Psychological tension consists of your fears , anxieties , anger , sadness- and similar emotions . This tension is the first to show up every time you go for something important. - It comes from your unconscious limiting beliefs about yourself- and the world . <p> For example : <p> I am not a very outspoken person . Personally , I- do n't like putting- myself out there in public where everyone can see me . I am always afraid of embarrassing myself that I initially only told a handful of people that I had become a coach . <p> So , guess what happened when I had to put out that status on Facebook offering my services ? <p> I panicked and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not do this . I had almost convinced myself that it would n't work and that I would get nothing out of it . <p> But because I was trained , I knew that it- was n't reality . It was just my fear telling me that I was insignificant ( my limiting belief ) . So , I went along with posting the status anyway and , as a result , the company that contacted me became my first very big client . <p> The effects of people acting out on their psychological tension can be seen and have been seen all over the world , especially with people such as Robin Williams . These people have psychological tension that is- so big and out of control that they were forced to- commit suicide . <h> 2Creative Tension <p> The second type of tension is creative tension . It happens- when you establish where you are and where you want to be . It- involves taking very specific actions . <p> For example : <p> Recently , my partner and I found ourselves in a situation where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we had nowhere to go . We planned on going to her dad 's place and live in the spare room , but he refused . <p> And because we had assumed that he would let us stay , we ended up spending the money we had which could have gone for rent . The situation was bad. - We could have been homeless and living in- the airport in 3 days . <p> This created a lot of tension for us , especially psychological tension . To set up creative tension , we chose what we wanted- and it was to live in a supportive and affordable place . We were extremely tensed and panicking for 2 days that we could n't find anything- except a small room 50 km away from the city . <p> This is when we decided to just let go for a bit and go out to have a coffee in a nice coffee shop . This is when my partner came up with the idea of texting a client of hers who was a local . <p> It was not long before- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' shown a very nice- room by a friend of hers a week before . It was- affordable and located in the center of the city . She immediately gave us the contact details and within 24 hours we rented it . <p> So , do n't just do something for the sake of solving an issue . Wait for the right moment to take the right action . <p> But , how do you do this ? How do you set up this tension ? How do you make it work ? <h> Imagination <p> The brain does n't know the difference between imagination and reality . For example : Thinking of having sex will have the same effect on you as having sex . <p> If you imagine where you are and where you want to be , it will create both psychological and creative tension for you . You can use them- to propel you towards your goals . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098539 <h> Why We Need More Warriors ( And How to Become One ) <p> In today 's world , many aspects of masculinity have been called into question . I think we can all agree that masculine drives to dominance and force have led to much violence , corruption , trauma , and suffering in the world . I see these manifestations as unhealthy aspects of the Warrior spirit , which is inherent in all men . <p> Healthy Warrior spirit is positive and necessary for men " a heroic striving to become more , slay one 's own demons , protect others , speak truth the to power , and stand up for what 's right in the world . I believe one of the most important challenges for men today is learning to cultivate and harness their Warrior spirit as a force for good , for change , and for supporting the best in themselves and others . <p> So how do we find our Warrior nature ? And how can we distinguish between our healthy and our destructive Warrior instincts ? <h> The Warrior and the Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Heros Journey is omnipresent in the genetically driven archetypal forms that arise from all cultures . For men , embracing his Warrior nature and transforming through quests into the Man of Wisdom is at the heart of the masculine Journey . <p> The Hero , when he finally heeds an authentic call to action and embraces his Warrior self , develops , strengthens , and clarifies through ordeal and struggle on the road to becoming a Man of Wisdom . <p> We become the Warrior when we are willing to endure discomfort and put ourselves at risk for our principles . 17th Century " Sword Saint " Miamoto Musashi maintained that resolute acceptance of death in serving your purpose " your current mission " is the signature hallmark of the Warrior . Principle over comfort and safety seems to be a central organizing principle in most teachings about the Warrior and Man of Wisdom , and is consistent with the evolutionary roots of the archetypes . I 've also found it to be true for my clients and me over the last forty-three years and fifty-five thousand therapy sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness , discerning what 's true or false , and feels more moved to serve others development and less absorbed with testing himself , he s often transitioning into Man of Wisdom . <p> Why is the Warrior archetype so necessary for men ? Male competition and dominance are built into the human genome just as it is in chimpanzees , walruses , wolves and countless other species . This instinct is met putting purpose ahead of personal comfort or safety in critical situations . <p> The Heros journey " the universal human attraction to being on a mission " often involves an initial transition into the Warrior who , through traveling the road of trials , transforms into the Man of Wisdom . <p> The hero in the heros journey by definition expands his Warrior nature . He hears a call to action , says " Yes ! " faces and defeats the threshold guardian , and crosses the threshold onto the road of trials and ordeals . The Warrior , receiving transformational spiritual guidance , feels in his heart when he s on or off his mission and adjusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ordeals lead to the Well of the World " the Belly of the Whale " where he must reconcile Masculine and Feminine , Father and Mother , Light and Shadow . <p> Dr. Keith Witts latest book on personal growth <p> As he does , his identity is progressing towards Man of Wisdom who returns through the threshold , a living bridge to the Other World . Great examples ? <p> Luke embodying the Jedi Knight into defeating and then reconciling with the wounded fatherDarth Vader . Harry Potter finding deep compassion even as he destroys Voldemort . Bill Clinton facing the humiliations of his impeachment and wounded sexuality and continuing on to serve the world in multiple ways . Einstein first surrendering to his calling to more deeply understand the cosmosin the face of much adversityand going on to be a powerful philosophical voice for unity . <p> The core of the Heros Journey is the challenge to grow or collapse under stress . We are called , we resist the call , we finally accept the call , and embark on our personal Odyssey " choosing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within and without , seeking to consume us , craving violence . Attack ! Flee ! Attack you ! Run from you ! Attack me ! Run from me ! A man discovers his Warrior nature facing such monsters guided by his principles and strengthened by his resolve . <h> How do we develop our Warrior ? <p> In mythic terms , each time we slay the monster , face the ordeal , or choose principle over comfort , we discover and deepen our Warrior self . This dynamic is at the core of the Warriors journey . <p> I was a high school athlete who wrestled , practiced Shotokan Karate , played tennis , and ran cross country . My fears of pain , opponents , injury , and failure were the monsters who said , " Do n't  risk that try-out , do n't  get on the mat with that opponent , do n't  take that ten-mile run , you will never do well in that race . " I had to meet those monsters and consume them , absorb their energy and step through the resistance thresholds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each time I faced them and stepped towards them , I found my Warrior self just a little bit " I absorbed some of the resistance power and alchemically transformed it into a little more courage to step forward the next time in service of my principles . <p> This is the beauty of merit-based hierarchies likes sports , dance , theater , and heartfelt projects , especially for adolescents who are discovering their adult identities through success and failures , temptations and ordeals . <p> This is also consistent with modern research on willpower . As Roy Baumeister details in his Willpower : Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength , willpower is resisting a lesser impulse ( like procrastination ) in service of a deeper , more meaningful impulse , and is associated with increased happiness , success , health , and love . Of three dozen personality characteristics , willpower was the only one that , at four-years-old , could predict future college GPA . <p> Also , whether we naturally have more or less willpower as children , we can develop willpower with practice . We all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in service of principle , and driven by resolve . Consciously choosing goals/principles and utilizing our superpowers to pursue them increases willpower and develops our Warrior selves . <p> Most guys are lit up by the Warrior archetype . The Warrior is someone willing to sacrifice comfort or safety for his principles . Every single time a guy endures risk or discomfort , or sacrifices in service of principle , he nourishes his Warrior nature . The desire to do this rises up in men . If you 're not true to your principles , you suffer . If you are true to your principles , you find your Warrior self each time you hold your ground , face your fear , or embody your purpose . <p> We want to find ourselves as Warriors . Many men Ive discussed this with craved this from earliest memories . I personally wanted to find myself as a- warrior when I was three , five , eleven , fifteen , and thirty " the hunger was always there . I did n't  know exactly what I was reaching for , but I yearned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and movies . Looking back I can see them clearly " Mighty Mouse , Mowgli ( from Kiplings The Jungle Book ) , Super Man , Bilbo Baggins , and The Man from UNCLE . All were Warriors serving the higher good . <p> As a boy grows from child- to teen , to man , he expands into the Warrior . He finds meaning at the edge of death " either actually or symbolically by risking injury , failure , or defeat . He takes the Heros Journey " sometimes again and again . When were tested and rise to the task , we find our Warrior selves " a blissful experience to the masculine . And life tests us again and again , leading to successes and failures , both potentially supporting our Warrior selves . <p> At a particular point in adult development , something changeswe no longer need to find our best selves as much as to consistently embody our best selves . This marks the transition in Man of Wisdom . As we shift into Man of Wisdom were less drawn to the- ordeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our misty genetic past when age diminished mens physical capacities , but experience expanded their judgment and discernment . Tribes who accessed this wisdom had distinct evolutionary advantages . <p> The Man of Wisdom naturally embodies his principles . He transmits compassion and wisdom into the world- and is moved to care . Man of Wisdom is often less drawn to competition and trials for himself , but loves to help others , especially the young Warriors . <p> Both these archetypes , Warrior and Man of Wisdom , arise in all cultures and are centrally important to most men . <p> What are your relationships with your Warrior nature ? When have you embodied your Man of Wisdom ? If you cant answer these questions , ask someone you love about when they 've observed these archetypes in you , and use all the information you gather to clarify your own masculine journey into Warrior and beyond into Man of Wisdom . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098557 <h> 5 Important Things to Check Before Buying Furniture <p> How much do you know about the quality of the sofa you- invested your money in ? Did you get what you paid for ? <p> Let 's face it . <p> There are tons of things you need to consider when you 're buying a piece of furniture. - With so many considerations , its easy to feel confused , intimidated and frustrated . In the end , we just stick to things that make sense . <p> Unfortunately , a lot of manufacturers and retailers are n't  really honest about their products . There are things that they choose not to tell their customers . As a result , buyers often pay more than the quality they get . <p> To steer clear of overpaying for furniture , you need to have the right knowledge and ask the right questions . <p> Aesthetics aside , the first thing that consumers should consider is comfort . <p> In general , there are four principal components that can contribute to comfort : frame , spring system , cushion , and tailoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comfort would follow . <p> Here are the things to look for : <h> 1Framing and Cushioning <p> Let 's start with the framing . <p> If the frame is hardwood , ask if it has undergone kiln-drying . Its the process of removing the moisture content of timber by using heat and airflow in a controlled environment . Kiln-dried wood lasts longer despite changes in humidity . It keeps wood from buckling , cracking or weakening . <p> To check the quality of the frame , feel the thickness of the board on the side of the sofa at the bottom . The standard width should be 1 and -+ inches . Thinner boards will squeak if people move around it . <p> When it comes to cushioning , the heavier , the better . This is regarding the relationship between weight and quality . <p> For the spring system , sinuous wires or S-type springs are the standard and should run from front to back . You should be able to feel the spring when you push down on the sofa . <h> 2The Tailoring <p> Checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally important . Check if the seams are even and the piping ( tube-shaped edging ) lines up . <p> For printed sofas , the patterns should match both on the sides and front . For high-end pieces , the fabric should wrap the entire piece , including the back skirt . Patterns should start from one segment and continue to the next . There should be a seam in the center of the sofas back . <h> 3Quality of Leather <p> It is important for the buyer to listen to the salesperson when buying leather pieces . If he says that it 's a leather-match or leather-like , it 's not leather at all . The way to tell the difference is to look at the base of the sofa and see if it is dyed all the way through . <p> Next , ask if the leather is top grain . Top grain is the highest quality of leather , and furniture pieces made from this material are really expensive . <p> Non-top grain leather pieces could be split and they do n't wear much . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . <h> 4Drawers and Veneering <p> Dining sets , bedroom sets , tables , and lounges should be proportional to each other . <p> For pieces with drawers , check how they are hung . If drawers are tilted , the buyer will have an idea right away about the quality . <p> To check , take out the top drawer and check if its interior feels rough . Rough drawer interior means low-quality . Furniture pieces with excellent craftsmanship usually have dust panels that stop you from looking onto one drawer from another . <p> Check also the corner of the drawer and see how the veneers match . Veneer is a decorative covering of fine wood applied on top of a- solid material , like plywood . <p> Good quality drawers are made with binders while cheaper ones are made with rollers . Checking the drawer on the upper left-hand part , where the manufacturers name is stamped , can give you a feel of the furniture quality . <h> 5Manufacturer 's Warranty <p> The warranties on wood furniture typically cover cracking and splitting for one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames . High-end types of furniture , meanwhile , should have five-year warranties on spring systems and cushions . <p> Consumers should check if they have a manufacturer 's warranty or retailer 's warranty . If it only shows the original address in tiny print at the bottom of the contract , the warranty will be void if they will move . <h> Takeaway <p> Consumers should be prudent when it comes to furniture shopping .

To safely use your medications to their full benefit , there are questions every patient should ask the pharmacist . Whereas your doctor may be limited to the time he can spend with you to thoroughly explain your medications , your pharmacist is trained to counsel you about the specifics of the prescribed drug during the course of your treatment . <p> All medications are dispensed with written information about the drug , and most of the printed information is easily understood . Occasionally , however , the medication your doctor has prescribed can cause certain conditions or side effects .

@@2098561 <h> How To Make A Successful Mobile App For Your Business <p> Despite the fact that mobile apps are very useful and indispensable to businesses , over 70 percent of apps fail . In fact , some fail from the beginning . <p> If you are wondering how to make a successful mobile app , here are the best tips to guide you . <h> Find a need <p> The biggest cause of app failure is when the app is not as useful as the developer thinks . So , before you develop any app , you need to look for a need gap and then develop an app that will bridge that gap . Apart from figuring out the demand , you should also confirm if there are no mobile apps that are already fulfilling that specific need . <h> Improve on a category <p> You can also select a category and see all the apps that are performing well in that section . Improve on them . <p> For instance , you can check out all the keyboard apps that are developed for fast typing . After your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an app that is more useful than the ones already in the market . <h> Do a proper feasibility study <p> Whether you are fulfilling a new need or creating a better app for an old category , you need to back it up with a proper feasibility study . You need to find out how much people need your app . <p> If you determine that people do not really need your app , it is better to stop and come up with another app idea . This is better than to waste time , money and effort in creating an app that wo n't really be successful . <p> It is only when the figures on the ground indicate that the app will sell that you can go ahead . <h> Avoid counter-productive delays <p> Once you determine that people will accept your proposed app , it is better to start immediately . If , for some reasons , you ca n't develop the app within three months after the feasibility study , then discard the feasibility report and conduct another one when you are ready . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You need to bear in mind that technology advances at an astonishing speed . One of the biggest reasons for this is that a very close substitute may have been developed and that will reduce the acceptability of your app . <h> Plan your marketing strategy <p> A lot of app developers only focus on developing and launching their apps . They do n't realize that marketing the app is as important as developing it . With this , you should not develop any app until you know exactly what marketing strategies you are going to use . <p> Marketing strategies also involve optimization . Since there are millions of mobile apps available right now , proper optimization will help you stand out from the crowd . There are too many apps available and more apps are still being launched every day . Without an effective optimization effort , your new mobile app will be lost in the crowd . <h> Ease of use <p> It is one thing to get users to download your app ; it is another to make them use it continuously . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease of use . <p> Your app should be very simple to understand and use . No one will waste too much time learning how to use an app when there are several other alternatives . You should ensure that your app is very intuitive and simple enough for a 10-year-old kid to understand . <p> A good way is to limit the number of features included in your app . Another method is to make use of universally accepted icons for different functions . Take , for example , the most common icon for search function which is a magnifying glass . Using another icon for that will make your app more difficult to understand . <p> Although every app should be unique , there should still be a limit to the uniqueness . <h> Make it free <p> Free apps are downloaded more than any other mobile app . So , it is highly advisable to make yours free . You can back it up with other monetization strategies , like utilizing ads . <h> Seek collaboration if necessary <p> Nobody knows it all . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is better to synergize with someone else and share the proceeds . <p> People that are great with coding are not usually half that good with designing . If you are one of those people , why not seek the service of a very good designer ? It can be disastrous to ruin hours of coding efforts with a terrible design . Thereafter , do not forget to give credit to whoever it is due when it is due . <h> Great monetization strategy <p> Some apps are great but they have poor monetization strategies . They only get to make a fraction of their financial potentials . <p> Take a game app , for instance . A game has to be very challenging , engaging and immersive to make players buy resources with their hard-earned money . If not , they will only make do with the free resources given by the game . You should adopt an excellent monetization strategy for your app . <h> Avoid too many ads <p> Some developers prefer to make money from ads . If you are thinking of doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When there are too many ads appearing on an app , it gets frustrating and annoying . It wont be long before users will begin to delete the app and that will mark the start of its downfall . <h> Consumption of little memory space <p> An ideal app should consume very little storage and memory space . Users do not like apps that consume a lot of memory . If they happen to download such apps , they will delete them not too long after . In your own interest , you should ensure that your app consumes as little space as possible . <h> It has to work offline <p> Nobody really likes to waste or spend too much on data just to use a mobile app . People can only use their data to download an app but they ca n't use their MB for that . So , they prefer offline mobile apps . As much as possible , your app should work offline . <h> Your app should conserve battery <p> Ensure that your app conserves battery power . Once a user finds out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battery power , your user will delete it almost immediately and look for an alternative app. @qwx77 <p> Melissa Crooks is Content Writer who writes for Hyperlink Infosystem , an android app development company that holds the best team of skilled and expert Indian app developers .

@@2098571 <h> 5 Things to Remember When you 're about Give Up <p> There are times when despite our hard work , optimism and good intentions , we fail to make progress on our goals . All of our efforts seem wasted . We lose hope in our abilities . We become demotivated and angry . In this negative state of mind , we persist with less than enough vigor and enthusiasm , our efforts become half-baked and the result we crave continues to elude us . <p> When this happens , its easy for us to lose hope and want to give up , telling ourselves , maybe I 'm not carved out for this after all . <p> Ive been there . But for me , giving up was n't an option . So I learn to turn thing around and see them from different perspectives . I learn that there are always other aspects weve not considered , other possibilities we 've failed to see , a different way of thinking we 've not allowed ourselves to explore . <p> If you 've ever considered given up on something you shouldnt be given up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in mind . <h> 1 . You 're still in control <p> When things are not turning out as expected , its easy to leave the reigns of control to circumstances , to feel as though you 're at the mercy of some unseen forces . But the truth is , there is no time that you 're not in control . <p> Its really up to you . You can either allow your hopelessness and negativity to weigh you down and paralyze you from moving on or you can use the one shred of will power you have remaining and try just one more time . I find that doing the later gets me back on my feet in no time . <h> 2 . It gets tougher when you 're on the verge of breakthrough <p> Our inclination is to give up or at least consider it when things get unbearably tough . But that 's because we forget that the farther we get out of our comfort zone , the tougher it becomes and the closer we move towards our breakthroughs . My people would say by way of encouragement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . <p> So why allow difficulty to break you when you can use it as a compass to guide you ? <p> Nobody said it was going to get easier . Prepare yourself for the worst and re-evaluate just how much it is you 're willing to endure . A little more persistence might be all you need to get there . <h> 3 . There 's always a different strategy <p> Sometimes our inability to make progress stems from devoting ourselves to the wrong strategies . <p> But because were trapped thinking that it stems from our own inadequacy , we fail to see it first hand . We continue to do the same things over and over even though were only getting abysmal results . We forget that even though we can control our own actions , we cant control most of the outcomes and circumstances that surrounds it . <p> Sometimes all we need to do for an outcome to change is for us to change strategy . <p> So take a look at yours , what can you do differently ? Ask someone who has accomplished something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might never get to know what really works . <h> 4 . Giving up is the biggest failure <p> Cliche as it is , you cant deny the truth to it . <p> There 's no wasted effort on your path to success . Every failure is a worthy experience . Every obstacle you 've overcome is a step forward . Why will you want to throw away everything you 've learned and endured previously just because it got tougher ? Cmon you 're not a coward . Tell yourself its too late to give up . Then get back on your feet and march on soldier . You 're making more progress than you can imagine . <h> 5 . You overestimate you own efforts <p> The emotional garbage you carry most of the time usually weighs heavier than your real efforts . <p> You spend so much time worrying and stressing over you unaccomplished goals that you start to feel you 're trying too hard when in reality , you 're hardly doing enough . This happens to me often . There are weeks when I feel like Im about to breakdown only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . <p> Its always helpful to have a plan or road-map because it helps you to stay super focused on doing the right things . Harboring negative emotions cant help you , it only slows you down . <p> It takes a great amount of patience and persistence to achieve your dreams . But you do n't  possess these qualities in abundance when you 're so eager to see results . Explains a lot , does n't  it ? So before you give yourself the thats-it-im-done speech , remember these 5 points and then decide for yourself if its still wise for you to give up . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098573 <h> 12 Ways To Make a Project Plan That Can Get Things Done <p> Do you want to know how to plan a project- so that things- actually get done ? <p> Improvisation is great for comedy , but getting a project done on time and within budget is no laughing matter . If you want to accomplish something , you have to set a course of action that ends with the successful completion of that project . <p> There are 12 steps that you need to take to plan a project , and most take place before you even begin the work on your project . Project planning takes work ! If you do n't do the due diligence and proper preparation to start your next project off right , then you 've already put a huge obstacle on your path . <p> Let 's get down to how to plan a project . <h> 1 . Know What Needs to Be Done <p> This sounds so obvious as to be silly to point out , but it 's usually the most overlooked step in project planning . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what steps are required . <p> The scope of a project can change over time , but start by defining your goals and the general tasks that need to be done to accomplish those goals . This will keep you on target and not veering off on time-wasting tangents. <h> 2 . Who Are the Key Decision Makers ? <p> You need to know where the buck stops , so to speak . Who are the important decision-makers , and the one who initiated the project ? Do you know for sure what they want from the project ? <p> You need to communicate with all relevant parties at the outset of your project to get their input so you can set your project up for success . <h> 3 . Set Up a Team <p> You know what you want to accomplish in the project , and now you have to figure out which people are able to help you complete all your tasks . Be sure you 've defined key roles and identified people for every step of your project before you even start . <h> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ define a timeline at the very beginning of any project otherwise you have literally infinite amounts of time to complete it . Rarely is that the case in reality . Most of us have deadlines , and even if we do n't , we ca n't afford to pay people indefinitely for their services . <p> Define a clear deadline based on the tasks you outlined and the people you 've assembled . Get them to estimate how long they think their part of the work will take . If you ca n't finish the project in the time you have scheduled , then you 're going to need to go back and reevaluate your resources and other items to ensure your project will be done on time . <h> 5 . Create Milestones <p> You 've got your goals , your task lists and your team 's estimates . Now which of those tasks , when completed , might mark a major milestone in the overall project ? Are there different phases of your project , like construction starting or QA or launch parties , that could be considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in project management software so you can always keep the big picture into focus and track progress over time . <h> 6 . Break Down Major Tasks <p> Look at those milestones and your starting task list and see if any of those tasks can be broken down into smaller steps . The reason is you want to make sure you 've defined all the relevant steps in order to control the production of your project , and you have n't overlooked anything . These tasks can then be assigned to your team . <h> 7 . Create a Schedule <p> Congratulations , you 're finally at a point in the planning when you can actually draft a schedule ! <p> This is the first time you 're going to try and coordinate all the various pieces of the planning puzzle you 've been working on . This is when you take all your tasks and assign to people with clear due dates . <p> Remember , as plans move along , things will change . That 's okay . The goal of a schedule is to help you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 8 . Track Your Progress <p> You ca n't make a plan and set it in concrete . The refinement process is never really over until the project is complete . But you ca n't refine what you ca n't see , so it 's crucial to monitor the progress of the plan . There are several ways to do this . <p> If you use project management software , you can track the plan in real time with your team . Or there are project templates you can download and use to plug in your plan . These help you compare where you are in the project against where you thought you 'd be at this time in the project , according to your plan . <h> 9 . Always Be Documenting <p> The only way to keep up with the constant change that always occurs in the process of production is by having clear and steady documentation of that process . This saves you from making mistakes based on miscommunication or misunderstandings , and it helps you document anything that might go wrong . <p> Keep track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for project communications so you have only one source to reference , instead of emails and texts and spreadsheets all scattered around . <h> 10 . Communicate Progress &amp; Successes <p> This is important for you , your team and your stakeholders . By keeping everyone on the same page , you insure that everyone is working together and not against one another , and you help remind people that you appreciate their input and help . <p> By taking the time to plan in detail , you do a great service to yourself , your team and your project . For one thing , you reduce the headaches you 'll have to deal with as project leader . You 'll also make it easier for your team to do their job . And stakeholders will feel more secure knowing that you 've got a plan that you 're sharing so they can stay abreast of the project in real time . That 's a plan everyone can get behind . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098574 <h> Self-Acceptance : The Key To True Happiness <p> In middle school and high school I struggled with finding my identity . I was convinced that I was ugly , stupid , and worthless . I continually thought that to truly love myself and be happy , I had to basically become a different person . <p> Throughout this time I made major changes to myself . I changed my hairstyle , got new clothes , and started to get in shape . <p> At first , it seemed to work . I was happier and seemed to be making more friends and getting more attention . As time passed by , though , I began to realize that I still did n't  love myself . <p> Although I had become the sort of person that I thought was worthy of love , I still did n't  believe that I was worthy of love . <p> I soon came to realize that changing things about myself did not change the way I felt about myself , so I began to search for a different solution. - Over the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  have to become lovable , I already am . I do n't  have to be good enough for people to like me , I just have to be me . <p> This belief that you are worthy of love just the way you are is known as self-acceptance . <h> What is Self-Acceptance ? <p> Self-acceptance is not the same as self-esteem . While self-esteem focuses on how valuable you see yourself as , self-acceptance takes a slightly different route . <p> According to thefreedictionary.com self-acceptance can be defined as , " an acceptance of yourself as you are , warts and all " . <p> When someone accepts themselves , they accept all facets of themselves . The good , the bad , and even the ugly . When we are self-accepting , we learn to even love our flaws . <h> How does our Self-Acceptance Influence our Happiness ? <p> Now that we 've defined self-acceptance , you might still be asking : how exactly does self-acceptance impact our happiness ? <p> Well , according to Robert Holden , author of Happiness Now ! : <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your level of self-acceptance determines your level of happiness . The more self-acceptance you have , the more happiness you 'll allow yourself to accept , receive and enjoy . In other words , you enjoy as much happiness as you believe you 're worthy of . " <p> So basically : self-acceptance = happiness <p> If you accept yourself you are inevitably setting yourself up to be happy . <p> One the most important aspect of self-acceptance is that it is unconditional . Very often we only love ourselves when we are doing well or when we accomplish a goal . <p> Self-acceptance , on the other hand , teaches us that we should love ourselves no matter what . Even if we fail or make a mistake , we are still valuable . This , in turn , allows our happiness to be unconditional as well . Our joy is not based on whether or not someone likes us . It is based on who we are , not what we do or how people perceive us . <h> How to Accept Yourself <p> Now you know what self-acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to we develop self-acceptance ? <p> Like any other skill , self-acceptance is something that we build up over time . Many people are taught to accept themselves at a young age and never struggle to be self-compassionate . Others of us are constantly struggling to love ourselves for who we are . <p> We are all at different levels of self-acceptance and some of us will be able to learn it faster than others . <p> There are many guided meditation practices that center on the theme of self-acceptance . While meditation in and of itself will likely lead you to an acceptance of yourself , guided practices will likely help more . <p> For great guided meditations about self-acceptance and other topics , I highly recommend Calm for iOS and Android . You can also access these guided meditations on Calms website . <p> A second way to help generate acceptance for yourself is to change the way you think . Our thoughts are ultimately what controls our perception of ourselves . They are the root cause of our lack of self-acceptance and often the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that struggle with self-acceptance are plagued with negative thoughts . Psychologist often refer to this as our inner critic . Our inner critic is that voice inside that is constantly telling you that you are n't  good enough . It tells you that you 're unattractive or inadequate . <p> From Sources <p> A helpful way to combat this inner critic is to actually engage with it in conversation . This is a tip I learned in Dr. Aziz Gazipuras book the Solution to Social Anxiety . <p> Let 's say you just you turned in a business report to your boss and he rejected it . Your inner critic will likely start acting up . To have control of your critic , address it as if it were an actual person : <p> Critic : Wow you really screwed up this time . I told you hed reject it . You 're terrible at what you do . <p> You : Actually , I think I did a pretty good job on my report . Maybe it was just not what my boss was looking for . <p> Critic : Maybe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The entire report was crap . Have fun with getting fired . <p> You : Fired ? You are making lots of assumptions . Why are you so angry ? Did you get fired from your job recently or something ? <p> This type of dialogue is extremely therapeutic . It is most helpful when done at the exact time that your critic is acting up , or at least shortly after a negative experience . These conversations are best had in written form and should be kept in a journal . <p> These are just two of many ways that you can begin to build up your self-acceptance . <p> It is important to remember that you path to self-acceptance is a journey . You will have setbacks along the way but you 'll make progress as long as you stay persistent . <p> Self-acceptance is a beautiful thing . Practicing it will bring you happiness and will make you less vulnerable when facing criticism . <p> If you need a reminder on how to accept yourself , I would like to share a quote from Amy Bloom : <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098582 <p> Its important to treat it as a useful experience , learn as much as possible and move on no matter how difficult things get . <p> I 've always been fascinated by success stories . <p> People just like you and me who went above and beyond and succeeded in life because they really wanted to . <p> How did they do it ? <p> Let 's check out a couple of success stories ; perhaps we can learn something from them . <p> 1 . Find Your Inspiration in Life <p> Recently , I heard an incredibly interesting and shocking true story about this guy named John , who worked for a very large mortgage company and was not very talented in anything he did. - <p> His first job for that company was sorting all the correspondence in the mail room , and he got fired within just 3 months after he had started . <p> Afterwards he went to work for a processing department , and was fired from that department too . He tried to work as a mortgage banker as well no luck there either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that company . <p> One day , the manager , who was supervising a big group of mortgage bankers , suddenly quit , and the team remained without a leader . No one wanted to apply for that position internally since the managers position was quite stressful , with a huge amount of responsibility and pressure for achieving team and company goals . <p> Well , guess what ? John applied for it . <p> Since there were no other candidates for the position at that time , and the HR officer did not want to hire an outsider which would have taken a lot of valuable time while the team was without a leader , believe it or not John got the position . <p> A few months down the road , John became the most successful manager and mortgage bankers leader in the company , who showed the highest results in team production and far exceeded his companys expectations . <p> He has been making a 6 figure income ever since and has never been happier at his job . <p> I was in a shock when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it and realized that Johns failures were not necessarily failures . They were merely stepping stones to his success . He just had not known before what his inspiration or dream job was , and indeed sometimes it takes a while to figure that out . <p> So , if you want me to answer my own question of why the road to success is always full of failures , then I 'd like to answer it with my favorite quote , which is truly inspiring : <p> " What is the secret to success ? Never give up ! Its only when you give up that you fail . Everything else is just a short setback on your way to success . Giving up is the only failure in life ! " <p> Here is another great success story . <p> 2 . Talent and Hard Work <p> Have you ever heard the saying : - " Genius is 1% talent and 99% hard work " ? I think it was Albert Einstein who said that . <p> Another guy named Adam , who was only 18 , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few dollars in his pocket right after World War Two . <p> He was originally from London and life in England was quite hard after the war . Adam had always dreamed of coming to the United States and living a better life . <p> He stayed for a couple of months with one of his distant relatives and worked as a gardener in sunny California , saving all the money he could . Adam was a very bright and intelligent kid and was eager to go to college , but the money he saved would never have been enough even for one school semester . <p> He kept working really hard until one of his rich clients , the General , noticed what a hardworking kid he was . <p> He talked to him for a while and , amazingly , offered to be Adam 's sponsor if he wanted to go to Stanford . Adam could not believe his blessing , but he unquestionably took this opportunity and just a few years later graduated from Stanford with honors and became a CPA . <p> Quite soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in L.A. and was making a great living . He got married , bought a nice home and had a son . <p> A few years later , the changes and the politics in the company saw him quit his job , and he decided to move out of crowded L.A. to a more laid back Arizona . <p> Shortly after , Adam and his friend started a scrap metal company in Phoenix . After being in business for just a few years , they became multi-millionaires . In their best years they were making 15 million dollars a year . Adam invested most of his money in the stock market and used the rest of it to travel the world . <p> He is retired now and still likes to travel and cook his own gourmet meals from scratch and takes a power walk for an hour every single day . I went for a walk with him once and could hardly keep up with him . <p> And he is 78 ! <p> The morale of the story is " Do not wait . The time will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and work with whatever tools you may have , and better tools will be found as you go along .

Or do they just think differently than we do ? Maybe they just have different ways of viewing the world in which they live ? <p> Perspective is going to serve you very well , no matter which struggles you face , chosen or otherwise . <p> One of the only definite powers given over to mankind is the ability to choose our own attitudes in any given situation . As Holocaust survivor Viktor Frankl put it , to " choose our own way . " <p> This is n't Pollyannaism . There are people all around us suffering because of real problems , and you may even be one of them . <p> This is also not meant to downplay the seriousness of whatever you 're struggling with , but instead , to convey the idea that problems are never going to disappear completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all we receive are better problems to solve . Its simply unrealistic to expect a life without any problems . <p> And as you 'll see , problems can actually make us happier ! <h> THE STOIC PERSPECTIVE <p> There 's a branch of philosophy called Stoicism that I return to quite often . One of my favorite books of all time , " Meditations " was written close to 2,000 years ago by the Roman Emperor , Marcus Aurelius . In it , he says things that could be very helpful to you , like : <p> " Do n't  ever forget what proportion of the world you make up . " <p> " Nowhere you can go is more peaceful , more free of interruptions , than your own soul . " <p> " Is it your reputation that is bothering you ? But look at how soon were all forgotten .

Its focusing on what you are n't  already , instead of the powerful individual which you already are . <p> Cultivating this internal locus of control is also essential to being happier even when seemingly besieged by problems . <p> With a simple " flip " in the mind , - you will see that : <p> 1 ) That desiring a positive experience is actually a NEGATIVE experience because its based on lack . <p> And <p> 2 ) That accepting a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising our personal power . <p> In the end , everything positive in life is achieved by battling past the associated negative experience .

Our problems , concerning things like parenting children , supporting our families , making our mark on the world , are all indications of what is most important to us , and most important to our own happiness . <p> So the question becomes : " What pain do you want in your life ? What are you willing to struggle for ?

Yes , you are going to die , but that 's only because you are fortunate enough to have lived . <p> If you think about this long enough , all of your problems will come into crystal clear focus . <p> Instead of death being this negative , oppressive thing that is the source of all of our problems , we can turn it into our biggest source of gratitude . We can live immediately , and in so doing , a lot of our smaller problems will disappear on their own . <h> MOVING FORWARD <p> If you 're avoiding being uncomfortable or uncertain , then you 're giving up being alive at all .

@@2098587 <h> 10 Keys To Becoming a Better Communicator <p> A few weeks ago , I met up with an acquaintance , B , for lunch . Throughout the lunch , I could n't help but feel there was some sort of communication breakdown . He would cut me off even though I was still talking . He kept offering unwanted advice and opinions , even though I was not asking for help . It became quite frustrating just 15 minutes into the conversation . After 30 minutes , I stopped sharing and nodded away to everything he said . <p> After the meet-up , I reflected over the situation . It was clear that there were fundamental problems in the communication . <p> For one , there was a lack of active listening on Bs part . He did n't  sense I was n't asking for his opinions and kept pushing his way through even when I was shutting out . Unfortunately , he came across the wrong way even though he had his best intentions . On my end , I was too single-minded in my communication to receive Bs well-intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when he did n't  respond in that manner , I began to tune out of the conversation . <p> Its easy for us to accuse others of being poor communicators , poor listeners or poor speakers , but the thing about communication is that its not one-sided its 2-way . You cant accuse someone of being a poor communicator without you being a poor communicator yourself . <p> Through this experience , I learned 10 important keys of communication which I 'd like to share with you here : <h> Be receptive to what others say <p> While its good to enter the communication with a clear objective of what you want , do n't  be so focused on it that you tune out on important messages the person is trying to communicate . Do n't  expect the answers to come in a certain manner and certain style . Have a focus and at the same time keep your mind open . <p> Even if the people come across as critical , learn to deal with critical people and be open to criticism . Many people are quick to shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of valuable advice and feedback . Do n't  take criticisms personally . Look for the message in the criticisms instead . Ask yourself : " What made the person say this ? What lessons can I take away from this ? How does this relate to my situation ? " With an open mind , you can have more answers to what you seek . <h> Look out for the subtext <p> Subtext is the underlying message of the communication . Its more well-known as " reading between the lines " . Many misunderstandings between people ( especially between females and males ) occur because they take each other too literally , vis-a-vis responding to the subtexts . To sieve out subtexts accurately , you have to listen actively to what 's communicated and be observant . Watch out for hand gestures , body language , speed of voice and tonality of voice . The most important points of the communication are usually not openly articulated . Knowing how to read the subtext will take you a long way in building great relationships . <h> Be positive <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotions , such as love and kindness . Have you ever communicated with emotionally stingy people ? These people are critical all the time . They keep harping on a small mistake and pinpointing every " issue " they can find . It feels suffocating and draining to be around them . <p> On the other hand , being an emotionally generous person makes you more endearing to be around . Focus more on the positive areas and not the negative ones . Show genuine care and concern for the persons well-being . Give praise where its deserved . People will look forward to interacting with you because they feel happier and uplifted doing so . <h> Respect the person <p> Any successful communication can only take place with mutual respect . If you do n't  respect the person first and foremost , itll show itself during the conversation . <p> Acknowledge the persons background , expertise and capabilities . Acknowledge the persons position as the owner of his/her life . Even if its a colleague you dislike , respect him/her for what he/she has done . How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect you ? That 's going to be how the other party feels . Not only that , you cant expect others to respect you if you do n't  first respect them , can you ? <h> Maintain eye contact <p> Looking at the speaker in the eye is a reassuring way of letting the person know you are there and listening . You do n't  have to be staring 100% of the time . Just maintain the gaze long enough whenever he/she looks over , and give a reaffirming nod every once in a while . You do n't  want him/her thinking you are zoning out when you are really listening . <h> Do n't  interrupt the person ( unless there is good reason ) <p> Do n't  cut in unnecessarily . Even if the person is long-winded , at the very least give him/her a few chances to fully express himself/herself before jumping in . Sometimes , you may think you know what the person is going to say next , but you may actually be wrong . There have been times when the other party says something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ive been out with people who are extremely long-winded they can literally go on-and-on for 30 minutes , talking and talking , without realizing the people around have switched off . When you face such people , let them finish talking for the first few times . If subsequent replies are as lengthy , then chances are the person is very fogged up in his/her thinking pattern . Help him/her zoom down to the answer through the right questions . ( Tip #9 ) <h> When in doubt , ask <p> Its easy to assume , but as the old saying goes , when you assume , you make an ASS out of U and ME . Everyone you talk to is a whole new person , so do n't  think what applies to person X will automatically apply to person Y too . Erase all beliefs you formed of others and start off the communication on a whole new slate . When in doubt , ask for more details . Get all the facts before making any conclusion . <p> A good habit is to ask a clarifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got the right message . This goes a long way in a good conversation ( and relationship ) . <h> Mirror the person <p> Mirroring is the behavior in which one person copies another person usually while in social interaction with them . It may include miming gestures , movements , body language , muscle tensions , expressions , tones , eye movements , breathing , tempo , accent , attitude , choice of words/metaphors and other aspects of communication . ( Wikipedia ) <p> Mirroring is more of a strategy to facilitate communication , rather than the key to good communication . Avoid relying on it solely , and do n't  overdo it too . Trying to mirror someone 100% will only make you look like an empty shell . That being said , mirroring does help you to ease into the right " state " for communication . The next time you speak to someone , try to mirror the key body movements . If the person is sitting in a slouched position , slouch and match your eye at the same level . If the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage him/her to open up more . <h> To get the right answers , ask the right questions <p> Every conversation is made up of questions and answers . Being a better communicator requires you to know what are the right questions to ask , so you can forward the conversation the right way . The direction of the conversation and the type of answers you get is dependent on the quality of your questions . <p> There are several types of questions . The 1st is open questions . You ask these when you want the person to openly share about something . Example : " What happened ? " or " How did the meeting go ? " . The 2nd is probing questions . These are pin-pointed to uncover more about a particular topic . For example : " What made you think this way ? " , " What are you unhappy about ? " or " What did he do to you ? " . The 3rd is close-ended questions . You ask these to get a quick yes/no answer on areas you already have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . Using a combination of these questions help you create the best communication experience . <h> Connect with genuinity <p> Ultimately , its all about genuine connection . As long as you are communicating with the best intentions , and a sincere desire to know the person better , nothing can go wrong . When I talk to others , I prefer to let my best intentions guide me , and leave other technicalities as secondary . I find that 's the most effective way to reach out . For example , even though I 've never studied NLP on a professional level , I found that many things I intuitively do in communication are in line with what is taught in NLP ( such as mirroring , matching ) . In the end , let your heart lead the way and the rest will follow . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Personal Loan eligibility varies from one lender to another and is based on your income , credit score , age , and financial stability .

As a rule of thumb , the higher your income and credit score , the more you can borrow . A few banks and NBFCs also have a limit on the amount of money you can borrow through a personal loan .

Although floating rates of interest are lower than the fixed ones , they are subject to market- conditions and may increase all of a sudden . <p> Shop around for Personal Loan offers that come with a low rate of interest . Also , go for banks and NBFCs that offer Personal Loans at a fixed rate of interest to ensure that your monthly payments do n't fluctuate . <h> A Fixed Repayment Period <p> The repayment period of a Personal Loan is fixed before your loan is sanctioned .

As a general rule of thumb , look for lenders who allow you to prepay a part of your loan without charging any extra fee . <h> Other Charges <p> Apart from the interest charges , there are some other charges that you might have to bear when you apply for a Personal Loan . <p> A processing fee is charged on completion of the loan procedure .

However , keep in mind that processing fee is generally charged by all financial institutions , and you first look for lenders who do n't charge the rest . <h> Potential Risks <p> With a credit card , you can pay off your debt over an unprecedented period of time but with a Personal Loan , the repayment period is fixed . While this is good as you can pay off your debt faster , you can land into legal trouble if you do n't pay the loan within the tenure mentioned in the contract . <p> Since there is no collateral involved , your lender can sue you in court .

@@2098597 <h> 10 Ways to Be a Better Man ( No you are n't  already doing them all ) <p> You may be a great guy and have good intentions , but until you become the man that you know you can and should be , people wo n't rush to show you more respect . <p> This is a subject that I know a lot about because it is something I went through myself . I went from being a man who was overlooked for promotions at work , rejected by women and ignored by friends to a man who is running his own successful business for the last nine years and yes , even the ladies have noticed = Along the way , I have learned a lot about what it takes to be more respected as a man . Here are my top 10 lessons : <p> 1 . Do n't Crumble Under Pressure <p> One of the things that I learned as a leader in the corporate world was that there are always times when situations become challenging and overwhelming . During those times , most people get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue and generally crumble under the pressure . However , the true leaders and those who are the most respected by others are the ones who , no matter how much chaos is going on around them , can still say , " Okay , this is the situation and this is what were going to do about it " or , " Okay , this is the situation and this is what I am going to do about it . " <p> They remain strong , clear-headed and do n't  crumble under pressure . They see a situation for what it is and work on ways to improve , correct or fix it . People naturally respect , admire and look up to those who can remain strong under pressure . So the more than you can avoid crumbling under pressure in any situation , the more respected you will be as a man . <p> 2 . Give , But Also Expect Respect in Return <p> Selfish men do n't  win the respect of other people ; most people secretly hate those who are selfish or self-centered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too generous and allow themselves be taken advantage of . You should definitely be a giving man ; you should help , you should support and you should try to help others succeed and achieve , but you should also expect respect in return . <p> If you are offering tremendous value in a work environment , then ask for a raise or to be considered for a higher position . If you are a great friend , expect and even demand that your friends show you respect and behave nicely towards you . Expect the respect . Do n't  give continuously and think that everyone will love you for it . That is n't the way human psychology works . People respect those who assume positions of respect , while also being good to those who are showing them respect . A classic example is the parent/child relationship : If a mother and father treat their child badly and demand respect , the child will usually be unwilling to give it . However , if the mother and father treat the child well and also expect respect , the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without Judgment <p> One of the reasons why I have so many close friends these days is that I love other people without judging them . I 'm able to accept people the way they are because I understand that each of us are going through our own stages of development and have our own perspectives on life based what we 've learned , who we are and what we think the world is all about . <p> Some people will do or say things that you may think are silly or na+ve , but really , its just their understanding of the world at that particular point in time . So , instead of thinking that you are smarter , better , wiser and more perfect than others , just love them without judgment . The more that you can love others without judgment , the more they will respect you as a man . <p> 4 . Have Life Purpose and Follow Through On it <p> Guys who sit around twiddling their thumbs , avoiding their true potential as a man out of fear and coming up with excuses as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of guys whom most people respect and admire . Respected men are those who are clear on what they want in life and go after it with passion , determination and unrelenting drive . No matter how big their dream is they keep pushing until they make it a reality . <p> Your life purpose is whatever you decide it is . However , what will make you more respected as a man is not simply having a life purpose , but following through on it . In other words , not giving up , not crumbling under pressure and instead staying strong and climbing the necessary obstacles on your way to achieving it . If you do n't  know what your purpose is , think about what you really want to do in life and what you most care about more than anything else , then head in that direction . <p> 5 . Be a Man of Your Word <p> Men who lie , exaggerate , cheat , steal or frequently go back on what theyve promised , are not the type of guys who are respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what they mean instead of exaggerating , lying or pretending to like someone or something when they really do n't  . Respected men promise what they can deliver and they then stick to that no matter what . <p> As a man , the more you stick by what you promise , the more respected you will be . Being a man of your word means that you also need to be a considered man . In other words , think about what you are promising to others before you actually commit to it . Only commit to what you know that you can deliver and if you cant deliver on what is being asked of you , say that right away . You will be respected for your honesty . <p> 6 . Always Be Yourself <p> Most people can sense when someone is putting on an act , pretending to like them or to be sincere . Your true self is always coming through via your body language , words , behavior and vibe , so there is no point putting on a fake persona around people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their level of thinking , while still being yourself at all times . Think about the men who you respect most in life . These men will likely be those who stick to who they are as a man , while also relating to you on your level by discussing what you are interested in life and letting you express what you see as important . They do n't  suddenly change their personality to suit you , but they do welcome your personality and allow you to be your real self around them . <p> 7 . Maintain Control of Your Emotions <p> Losing control of your emotions is one of the fastest ways of losing the respect of others . A real man is one who feels the emotion of a situation , but maintains control of his emotions . As a man , if a situation annoys or angers you , it is fine to feel annoyed by it , but it is n't fine to lose control of your emotions and become irrational . You can do that if you want , but other people wo n't respect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who feel the emotion of a situation , but retain control of their emotions . <p> 8 . Be Someone That People Can Look Up to <p> Do you look up to guys who lie and do n't  stick to their word , who hide from their true potential as a man and make excuses for their lack of success ? Probably not ! On the other hand , do you look up to men who work hard at achieving their life purpose , love others without judgment , stick by their word and maintain control of their emotions under pressure ? These are the sorts of strong men that almost everyone respects and looks up to . <p> The more of a man that you become , the more that people will naturally begin to look up to you . You will be someone that people can lean on , a pillar of strength in this world . You will be someone who can be relied on to be yourself all the time , to say what you really feel and mean and to do what is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real men you 've met in your life who behave in that way , you will notice that they are the men youve respected and looked up to the most . <p> 9 . Take the Lead in Situations <p> Taking the lead in situations does n't  mean that you always have to be the leader or that you always have to be the alpha male . However , the more that you take the lead and the more you take on the role of the alpha male in situations , the more that people will naturally respect you as a man . Being an alpha male does n't  mean bossing people around , being demanding or rude ; it just means being the one who is responsible for leading the way to achieve whatever it is you and the other people are attempting to achieve . <p> Being a leader is a lot easier than most people assume . It is mostly about empowering individuals and getting people to work together to achieve common goals . Its not about you doing all the work . As a leader , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each person is a successful , productive and happy member of the team or group , while also ensuring that you work hard and lead by example at all times . The more often you take on the lead in everyday life or in work environments , the more natural and automatic it will become for you over time . Eventually , you will get to a point where people see you as a natural leader and you automatically assume the leadership position in all areas of your life . The more of a leader you become , the more respected you will be as a man . <p> 10 . Take Full Responsibility For Your Own Success or Failure <p> Guys who are the least respected in life are those who whine , complain and unnecessarily behave like a victim in life . They blame the government , their boss at work , their competitors in business and everyone else for their lack of success . On the other hand , men who are the most respected in life are those who take full responsibility for their own success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a silver platter and they 're probably going to have to work really hard for a long time to achieve what they really want to in life . They do n't  look to find excuses or a way out from trying to be successful ; they search for the way to be successful and then follow through on that until they achieve it . <p> Getting the Respect You Deserve <p> Being more respected as a man really comes down to you becoming and being even more of a man than you are right now . Which of the 10 points above are your strengths and which ones are your weaknesses ? Focus on strengthening any weak areas and you will see that people begin showing you more respect as a man . <p> Italy chanel Bag Its like you learn my thoughts !

@@2098601 <h> How To Get Back a Normal Life After a Loss <p> When someone close to you dies , it often seems like life can never be the same again . Yet loss is a natural part of life , and it is also something we all have to face . Of course , it is never easy , but there are ways to prepare yourself and ensure that things can return to normal in time . To help you through these difficult times , here are a number of factors to consider . <h> Prepare For Deaths <p> As grim as it sounds , death is an inevitable part of life , so you should always be prepared for it . While you might not always expect it , there 's nothing wrong with planning ahead . This is especially useful during the period following the immediate death . For instance , if memorial services are planned in advance , you do n't  have to worry about it when the time comes . This is one less thing for you to worry about straight after losing someone , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quicker . <h> Think About What Others Would Want <p> When you care about people , you only want the best for them . The same is true for people who care about you . As such , you should always try and do your best in life for those around you . It is at times surrounding death that this should , perhaps , be remembered all the more . Would you want people to give up on life because you have left ? When you think about it from this side of the argument , it 's easier to see that the people you love ( and , in turn , those who love you back ) would not want you to drop everything you have . <h> Do n't Suppress Your Emotions <p> While we all mourn differently , emotions are often high during this period . However , even long after the funeral , people can still feel emotional affliction due to their loss . Many people , for instance , are familiar with the various stages associated with death , but who 's to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or a year away , do n't feel bad about having strong feelings of any sort . In fact , it 's better to let these out in a safe environment , such as with loved ones or a professional counselor , than hold them back . Exploring these sensitive issues and moving past them is a key part of getting your life back to normal , so never be afraid to talk to others about how you 're feeling . <h> Make Every Day Count <p> If there 's one thing people often learn from death , it is that life itself is something worth cherishing . This is something we learn from a very young age . In fact , in a study of bereaved teenagers , 58% said we should be nice to those we care about , because there 's no guarantee how long we will have them in our lives . As such , if you focus on what you have " such as the people still in your life " rather than dwelling on the past , you can often be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have less regrets when somebody dies , knowing that you knew them as well as you could . <h> Embrace Your Spirituality <p> When deaths occur , studies have suggested we often embrace our own existing religious and spiritual views . We are reminded of our own mortality , and thus look to our existing faith for support . If this is true , then why not do this all the time ? Why wait for a tragic event to remind us of what is important when we could live everyday this way ? Not everybody has religious beliefs , of course , but many people often have a sense of spirituality . This could be as simple as embracing nature more , coming to terms with the idea of our own death or exploring possible religious beliefs in the first place . If you start thinking about this more freely , there will be less of a change when you lose someone close that will help you to keep your life a little more stable . <p> Recovering from a personal loss is a very close subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Someone else may have already obtained the restricted callers number , and he or she may be better able to guide you . <p> While a restricted call does happen on an occasional basis , if you find that the calls are becoming harassing and you are finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you may want to have the police track the number .

@@2098620 <h> How To Get Better Sleep While Spending Less Time In Bed <p> There are two gifts I want to give you right now : more time and better sleep . To do this I will need your complete attention and an open mind . Its really not that hard but it does require a little self discipline , some patience and a willingness to make a few changes in your life . <p> Many people believe that the more time you spend sleeping , the more rested your body becomes . Well , this is often not the case . Our body sleeps in multiple cycles throughout the night , each one essential and each one very easily interrupted . Every time you find yourself tossing and turning , waking up to go to the bathroom or just being woken up , you are interrupting one of these sleep cycles and detracting from their effectiveness . So the key is not MORE sleep but BETTER sleep . <p> There 's no doubt that you need a certain amount of sleep every night to be healthy . 3 hours of even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . But what if I were to tell you that you could feel more rested than you ever have before and , here 's the kicker , knock 30 minutes to an hour off of the time you spend trying to sleep . Its one of those best of both world scenarios but , as I stated before , it will require you to take action and make the changes necessary to obtain this precious gift . <p> So let 's get to it . Here are the elements you will have to consider : <p> Diet Eating a well balanced , healthy diet will not only help you live longer but it will help you feel better throughout the day . You should eat a good balance of complex carbs , meat and vegetable protein ( of course no meat if you are a vegetarian ) and fruits and vegetables . Try to eat light meals with small snacks in between . Adjust according to your activity level but try to keep it on the lighter side if possible . <p> The 3 meals a day idea is outdated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop too low and leaves you hungry and craving simple carbohydrates like sugar and white flour . When you finally eat the meal , you will end up eating too much . Depending on when you eat dinner and when you go to sleep you may benefit from a light snack about 1 to 1 and a half hours before bed . They should be foods with a balance of carbs , fat and protein . Some examples are an apple with peanut butter , celery with peanut butter or light yogurt ( light on sugar as well as fat ) with a little granola . Try this if you think your blood sugar might be crashing in the middle of the night . <p> Blood Sugar Your blood sugar plays a crucial role in helping you not only sleep better but have a consistently positive outlook . You blood sugar is mostly affected by simple carbs . <p> If you eat a bunch of sugar , your blood sugar will spike and you will have a quick burst of energy ; this is short lived . Anywhere from 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quickly drop and you will feel tired . You may even start to feel irritable and/or depressed ( This is why maintaining a consistent blood sugar level is crucial for a positive outlook ) . This is called a crash and it is something that often happens to people in the middle of the night . Do you ever wake up in a hot sweat . Or do you ever wake up at an odd hour and feel wide awake . Chances are this is the result of you blood sugar crashing . <p> Hydration Water to our bodies is like oil to an engine . It keeps everything running clean and smooth . First thing in the morning is usually when our bodies are the most dehydrated so it is important to drink a glass or two of water right when you get up.Many people skip breakfast because they 're not hungry or do n't  have time . This lack of hunger is usually the result of dehydration . And since breakfast is the most important meal of the day it is important that you eat and drink before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from sodas and other water alternatives . Loaded with caffeine , sodium and sugar , these drinks do the opposite of hydrate . Stop drinking fluids at least 4 hours before you go to bed . This might sound hard to do but if you are staying hydrated throughout the day you should be just fine . The purpose of doing this is so you do n't  have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. - <p> State of mind Your state of mind plays a big role in being able to sleep deeply . If you go to bed with any kind of worry , anxiety , fear , sadness , even positive stimulation , you will have a hard time falling into a deep sleep . I find that reading a light book 30 minutes before you turn out the lights is a great way to turn off your brain . You may even find that your eyes grow heavy as you try to read . The goal is to go to sleep quickly and you cant do this if you try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in between. - <p> Exercise One of the absolute best things you can do for yourself as well as your sleep is to exercise . Even a 15 to 20 minute jog or brisk walk everyday will not only improve your ability to sleep soundly throughout the night , but it will enhance your mood throughout the day . Depending on your fitness level these numbers may be different so adjust accordingly . If you do n't  exercise on a regular basis you can not expect to get the kind of sleep that we are talking about today. - <p> Bed time Wake time Try to go to be and get up at the same times everyday . Over time this will set your internal clock so you will be tired when you should be tired and wake up when you want to wake up . As you decide when to sleep and wake you can look at the possibility of cutting down on sleep time . Using myself as an example let me explain what I mean. - <p> I used to need 8 hours of sleep each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After I started doing the things listed here I was unable to sleep for more than about 7 hours a night . Yet I would have much more energy and feel better than ever . What I determined was that those 8 hours were not 8 SOLID HOURS of sleep . Whereas the 7 hours I 'm getting now are a FULL 7 hours of sleep . THIS IS THE KEY ! <p> Environment Having the right environment to sleep in is also very important . Try to block out as much light as possible ( make sure the sun does n't  wake you up before you want to get up . ) Make sure that you are n't  too hot or too cold . Have a little white noise if necessary ( my wife an I sleep with fan blowing all night ) . Even consider ambient music . We also play a ambient CD in the background every night and it helps set the mood for rest and relaxation. - <p> Routine They say it takes 21 days to create a new habit . Give this at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not you want to continue . It will also take some time to completely adjust to the specific sleep patterns and whatever else you change because of this list . But once you adjust you should be able to fairly easily maintain it and reap the full benefits. - <p> Satisfaction Make sure you are enjoying the benefits that come from having more time and more energy . Take advantage of the extra time and use it to do things that you used to only wish you could do . Work on a project , set some new goals , or just relax and have some you time . The more you appreciate this new routine the more likely you will continue to do it. - <p> Helping others The final step and a great way to keep it up is to help others do the same . If you find that this information really helps you sleep better , feel better and have more time during the day , than the best thing you can do is to share this with others . As you help other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them yourselves . At the same time you will be helping someone else experience the same benefits . <p> I hope you really read through these steps and gave them some thought . Its a lot to take in and may require a lot of changes . If the end result is a healthier , happier , more productive you then it will be well worth it . <p> Written on 8/25/2008 by Eric Hamm , a technology consultant with a passion for helping others improve their lives through his blog Motivate Thyself .

@@2098621 <h> How To Create Success : 3 Essential Things You Need To Work On <p> The way you think can influence- your life to a large extent . To know how to create success , you must first have the right mindset , beliefs , thoughts and ideas . Once you are able to change the way you think , you 'll be able to turn your situation and even your life around . <p> If you are wondering how you can modify your belief system , here are three essential things you need to work on . <h> 1 . Believe in your goals <p> The first step in turning a negative belief system into a positive one is to trust your goals . You have to convince yourself that they are possible and achievable . <p> Successful people see things differently from unsuccessful individuals . <p> Instead of considering every problem as an obstacle , they look at it as a learning experience . Having a positive attitude enables them to benefit from everything happening around them . <p> In contrast , if you are imprisoned by negative thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people for your shortcomings . You 'll constantly look for excuses on why you cant make something work . <h> 2 . Visualize your dream life <p> Visualizing is a good way to train your mind to concentrate on your deepest desires . The beliefs , thoughts and opinions you impress on your mind have tremendous effects on your goals . <p> You can get your subconscious to work for you by filling it with thoughts of happiness , peace and fulfillment . Once you are able to fill it up with positivity , - your subconscious will start- attracting conditions that favor your goals . <p> This is one good example of the law of attraction . The more positive things you think about , the more positive things will happen to you . <p> If you constantly drown yourself with negative thoughts and ideas , you 'll never be able to attract the right conditions that can help you achieve- your goals . <p> Take , for example , a young boy who lived in a small town . He had a dream of making it big in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having his own office where he can write about his summer blockbuster movie . He pictured the view from his office as magnificent . He imagined seeing the New York skyline right from his office window . <p> The young boy felt positive whenever his subconscious dwelled on these ideas . He constantly recreated this dream in his mind until he received a surprise call from a long time friend who happened to live in New York . The young boy got invited to travel to the city and was able to get the career he has been dreaming of for a long time . <p> If this young boy persisted with negative thoughts , he wont feel motivated enough to continue dreaming and to take action when the opportunity presents itself . <h> 3 . Do not be afraid to fail <p> Most successful people today have experienced failure at some point in their lives . They were able to pick themselves up , dust off their mistakes and move on to get to where they are today . <p> Failure is a healthy and inevitable part of success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve your goals . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Its just a matter of whether you know it or not . What is the end objective you are looking for ? The people who do n't  know the objective of what they are doing are the ones who waste the most time . If you know your objective , you can be laser-focused and cut right to the chase . The clearer you are , the better. - <p> Create a vision . Now that you know your objective , what is your vision ? See the objective as your direction , and your vision as your destination . Knowing your objective let 's you know where to travel in , while knowing your vision helps you charge forward. - <p> Take the 80/20 route .

What 's the most effective route that will get you from where you are to where you want to be ? Take that path. - <p> Go for high impact items . There are endless number of things you can do to achieve a goal . Go for the most important tasks the ones that cause the highest impact . For example in school , I would not attend lectures if I felt they would not make a difference to my learning . As I develop my blog , I concentrate on the key tasks that make the most difference such as writing high quality content for my readers and spreading the word about my articles. - <p> Create structures to maintain your flow . If you know how motivation works , you will know it comes in bursts and waves . Its not possible to maintain a 100% full motivated state every single second . Hence , you need to create/leverage on your environment to maintain your flow . Examples are your physical environment , people you hang out with , your routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a perfectionist.Being a perfectionist is n't all that perfect if it prevents you from achieving more . Release the perfectionist mindset . Stop obsessing about the details and specifics ; they often take care of themselves. - <p> Learn from others . There are great resources , smart people , direct opportunities and top books around you all the time . Learn to make use of them . When I started out in my personal development industry and with my blog , I read materials from the experts and consulted the top bloggers , which helped me gain important insights immediately . Even today , I continue to do so as I expand my work . There is never a stop to how much you can learn from others. - <p> If it works , stick to it . If there is already a success formula that 's working , then reapply that formula . There 's no need to innovate or reinvent the wheel for the sake of it . Innovate only if there 's value in doing so. - <p> Ask for help . Most of us prefer to do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ethic , but sometimes asking for help gets us further than just doing it alone . People love to help . Many readers often email me at The Personal Excellence Blog for advice/help and I make an effort to answer their questions , because I want to see them do well too . Ask and you might get an answer . If you do n't  ask , you 'll never get. - <p> Cut out the fluff . Going for high impact items ( #4 ) means you have to cut out the fluff . There are the things that need to be done , and then there are the nice-to-do things that do n't  exactly contribute to anything in the long-run . Do n't  do things unless they are absolutely needed. - <p> Automate . Is there anyway to automate your tasks , especially labor intensive ones ? It can be the simplest things such as setting up filters in your emails and using more functional applications that get the job done better . With The Personal Excellence Blog , Ive automated several processes such as filtering specific emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Twitter/Facebook , and having automatic thumbnails for my articles . That saves a lot of time so I can get right to creating quality content for readers. - <p> Delegate . For the lower impact items that need to get done ( such as administrative activities ) , delegate them to someone else . If you are running a business , hire someone to take care of them. - <p> Outsource . If something is not your area of expertise or it can be better done by someone else , then outsource it . You only have 24 hours a day ; your limited time should be spent only in places where you can add the most value . If you are running a business , examine if there are any aspects of your work ( such as accounting , designing , programming ) that can be outsourced to others . There 's no need for you to learn and get hands-on on every single thing , especially if its not the core of your work. - <p> Wait . Sometimes , waiting may be the best solution . Things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have experienced fixes that rectify themselves when I waited a while longer . If you are stuck in a dilemma , new solutions may pop in if you pause your steps. - <p> Pick your battles . We often face roadblocks in things we do . Go up against the roadblocks only if they are worth the time and effort . That means you need to consciously weigh out the pros and cons first . Do n't  try to ram up against every barrier you face , especially if there 's nothing much on the other side. - <p> Always lookout for a better way . Do n't  restrict yourself to a certain set rule of doing things just for the sake of status quo . Study others and learn from them ( #7 ) . Review your situation regularly ( #18 ) and look for ways to improve what you are doing . Be flexible to usher in changes that can help you get more results. - <p> Stop when you are tired . I 've realized from experience that trying to press on when you are tired only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplishing more . A tired person ca n't do meaningful work . When you are well-rested , you work faster and better. - <p> Review regularly . Do a regular review of what you have done in the past week and the corresponding results .

@@2098625 <h> How to Craft a Killer Elevator Pitch That Will Land You Big Business <h> What is an Elevator Pitch ? <p> This is the 30-60 second business description of what you do and why someone should work with you . Its called an " Elevator Pitch " because it describes the challenge : " How would you explain your business and make a sale if fate placed you in an elevator with your dream prospect and you only had the time it takes to get from the top of the building to the bottom ? " <p> This article will explain the elements of a powerful elevator pitch and then walk you through how to craft yours . <h> Why Is Having an Elevator Pitch So Important ? <p> You only have 30-60 seconds to make a powerful first impression . The attention span of the average person is just 30 seconds before their mind starts wandering . The other reason is people have less time today . You need to grab them quickly or lose them forever . <h> Essential Elements of a Powerful Elevator Pitch <p> Concise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Clear . Use language that everyone understands . Do n't  use fancy words thinking it will make you sound smarter . Your listener wont understand you and you 'll have lost your opportunity to hook them . <p> Powerful . Use words that are powerful and strong . Deliver the " Sis-Boom-Bang " to grab their attention ! <p> Visual . Use words that create a visual image in your listeners mind . This will make your message memorable . <p> Tell a Story.A short story , that is . A good story is essentially this : someone with a problem either finds a solution or faces tragedy . Either type of story can be used to illuminate what you do . <p> Targeted.A great elevator pitch is aimed for a specific audience . If you have target audiences that are vastly different , you might want to have a unique pitch for each . <p> Goal Oriented.A kick-ass elevator pitch is designed with a specific outcome in mind . What is your desired outcome ? You may have different pitches depending on different objectives . For instance do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , enlist support for an idea , or earn a referral . <p> Has a Hook . This is the element that literally snags your listeners interest and makes them want to know more . This is the phrase or words that strike a chord in your listener . <h> How to Craft Your Killer Elevator Pitch <p> Write down what you do . Write it several different ways . Try writing it at least 10-20 different ways . Do n't  edit yourself at all . You will edit later . This first step is for generating ideas . Do n't  hold back . Ideas can be goofy , serious , wild , funny , or conservative . It does n't  matter . The goal is to get at many ideas as possible down on paper . <p> Write a very short story that illustrates what you do for people . If necessary , the story can be long . You will boil it down later . Paint a picture with words . <p> Write down your objective or goal . Do you want to make a sale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn a referral , or something else ? <p> Write 10-20 action statements . This is a statement or question designed to spur the action associated with your goal . <p> Record yourself . You can use Jott if you do n't  have a recording device . Jott is a free phone based service that translates your messages into text as well as providing an online link to the original audio . <p> Let it sit . Come back to what you 've written with fresh eyes and ears the next day or later on in the same day . <p> Highlight the good stuff . Listen and read through what you 've recorded and written . Then either highlight or circle the phrases that hook you with clear , powerful , and visual words . Obviously not all the words will fall into these categories . You still need connector words , but you want them to be as few as possible . <p> Put the best pieces together . Again you 'll want to write down several versions of this much tighter pitch . Tell us what you do and why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements from your story if you can fit it in . <p> Record these new ones . <p> Do a final edit cutting as many unnecessary words as possible . Rearrange words and phrases until it sounds just right . Again , the goal is 30-60 seconds maximum . <p> Dress Rehearsal . Run it by as many people as you can get to listen to you . Get feedback from colleagues , clients you trust , friends and family . <p> Done for now . Take your final elevator pitch and write it down . Memorize and practice it until it just slides off your tongue naturally . <p> Continue to improve . Over time , always be on the listen for phrases that you think could make your elevator pitch more clear and impactful . And then test it out . Every once in a while you will probably benefit by starting from scratch because things always change : you , your business , your goals , and your clients needs . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098628 <h> How to Improve Your Skills at Office Politics <p> The world is full of people who think they are going to get ahead by putting their head down and doing their work . Its a myth that good work makes a good career . Really , good office politics makes a good career . <p> But why is everyone so pissy about office politics ? You know who is good at office politics , people with empathy , people who are great time managers , and people who see themselves as part of a team . Which means , of course , that you should get good at office politics , because the people who are bad at it have dead-end careers , and spend their lives whining about how its not fair because they are so good at doing their work . <p> Realize that its about being nice Its very difficult to do office politics because you have to figure out the Venn diagram of what people are having a hard time with , and what you are particularly skilled at , and where those circles intersect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your strengths , and you need a lot of emotional intelligence to understand what other people struggle with . <p> But then , you need to actually help someone . This mean that after you 've spent all that extra time getting to know someone elses situation , you need to spend more extra time doing some work to help that person . Maybe its staying late with them to get something done . Maybe its negotiating something for them because they are bad at negotiating . It could be anything , really , but it takes time to help someone . <p> In order to get extra time to do all this , you need to be so dedicated to helping people that you need to do your own work extra efficiently to make time to be nice . What a lovely workplace , right ? Where everyone is nice to each other ? Great . You can start that right now by getting a better attitude about office politics . <p> Do n't  rely on your job competence There is great research to show that people value social skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear example : People would rather work with someone who is likable and incompetent than someone who is competent but a not likable . And when someone is a jerk , people start thinking the person is less competent , whether its actually true or not . <p> What does this mean for you ? Stop saying that you do n't  have time for office politics . Because office politics is really about being likable , and the best way to look competent at work is not to do good work as much as to be likable . So let some of the details go , get rid of your perfectionist tendencies , ( which will probably eventually make you a depressive anyway ) and start wandering around your office getting to know people . <p> Blame yourself first If you are bad at office politics , it is not because the people you work with suck . Its because you suck . You need to get better at dealing with a wide range of people . People with empathy have a strong tendency to want to understand all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competent and fun . <p> A great test of your emotional intelligence is looking at the range of people you get along with . Strong emotional intelligence means you can get along with almost anyone . So instead of complaining about being shut out of the political arena at your office , figure out how to get along with people who do n't  like you " by understanding what motivates them . <p> Go to couples therapy Generally speaking , the obnoxious things we do with our significant other are the same obnoxious things we do at work . In the office people are too well behaved to scream at you about your personality deficiencies , but at home , surely your significant other has let you know in no uncertain terms why you are annoying.A great way to figure out how to overcome your personality challenges is to go to couples therapy and practice on your spouse or whatever the person is to you . They have more patience than your boss , for one thing . For another , it feels safer . I mean , you probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked to find that the exact problems I needed to fix on with my co-workers were the problems I needed to fix with my husband . I 'm not saying I did it right away , but I learned a lot about myself. - <p> Be your true self If you want to be good at office politics , you have to care about office politics . You must genuinely want to help people and you must get personal pleasure out of figuring out peoples strengths and weaknesses . Otherwise , your energy in this arena will feel false , which is no way to connect with people .

@@2098629 <h> How to Turn Fantasy into Reality <p> Have you ever wondered what it would be like to live in Wonderland ? Or work at Willy Wonka 's Chocolate Factory ? Or have an apartment on Sesame Street ? <p> Would your life be better ? More fun ? More exciting ? <p> A while back I asked the following question on our Facebook page : Which imaginary place would you most like to visit ? The responses were quite varied ( my favorite might actually be " my clean house " ) , but here are a few classics that popped up : <p> Narnia <p> Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry <p> Mr. Roger 's Neighborhood and the Land of Make Believe <p> Wonderland <p> Charlie 's Chocolate Factory <p> Neverland <p> Sesame Street <p> Pandora <p> Munchkin Land in Oz <p> Florin ( from the Princess Bride ) <p> The list itself conjures up some great memories from my own childhood . I began thinking about all these imaginary places and wondered if they had anything in common . What made them so special that people would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And even more importantly , is there anything we can do to make the real world we live in more like those fictional places ? I decided that there definitely is , and here 's what I came up with : <p> Open Your Eyes to Wonder and Imagine the Impossible . In each of the locations listed , wonder and imagination abounds . The impossible is made possible . Although each place is rooted in reality ( that is , there are elements of each world that are similar to our own ) , there are definitely some exciting differences . Playing cards can walk . Muppets can talk . Magic is real . And , rivers are made of chocolate . <p> We need to remove the hazy gray film covering our eyes , created by years of apathy and cynicism . We think we 've seen it all , so we stop looking . Start again . See the world with new eyes . Watch a toddler on his first trip to the zoo and you will see someone who is as impressed as you 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the impossible is concerned , think about how many things we now enjoy that were n't possible just 200 years ago . The electric light bulb . Automobiles . Air travel . Space travel . Telephone . Radio . Television . Computers . The Internet . The iPhone . To the early American settlers , these inventions ( and thousands of others ) would have seemed as fantastical to them as a television that could transport chocolate would seem to us . Even in our world , the impossible can be made possible . <p> But only by the people who are brave enough to believe as many as six impossible things before breakfast . <p> Embrace ( and Learn From ) Diversity . Another thing that strikes me about these imaginary places is the breathtaking level of diversity . There are unicorns , wizards , elves , fairies , talking trees , oompa loompas , munchkins , flying monkeys , muppets , basilisks , centaurs , and even humans . ( Just to name a few . ) Each has a unique point of view and valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often tied to the level of success the individuals have in sharing those talents and working together . <p> The same is true of our own world , of course . Although diversity has become a hackneyed politically correct buzzword , there is a dizzying array of it in our world , and our willingness to work together will determine whether we will all eventually sink or swim . <p> I was recently on a jury for a very complicated trial . In the deliberation room after both sides presented their cases , twelve people with different backgrounds and points of view were tasked with coming up with a consensus . It was a challenge . My eyes were opened to some new ways of thinking and I learned a lot about people and about myself . Five hours later , we 'd reached a decision , and I think we were all impressed and proud of what twelve strangers had been able to accomplish , despite our differences . <p> It 's easy , comfortable , and very , very human , to stick close to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , we need situations that are foreign in order to grow . Whether its by traveling to someplace new , taking a class in a subject you know nothing about , or attending a party attended by people you would n't normally interact with , create opportunities to enrich your life by experiencing diversity . <p> Live a Better Story . Another thing that is appealing about these imaginary places is that the inhabitants always seem to be engaged in some epic story , a grand adventure . People do n't sit around channel surfing or balancing checkbooks or buying underwear at WalMart . No sirree Bob . There are exciting , wonderful , and dangerous things happening all the time . There is passion . There is a purpose . There are big , holy cow kinds of goals and missions in which life and death often hang in the balance . <p> There is a great book by Donald Miller called A Million Miles in a Thousand Years . ( It has catapulted into the top five most personally influential books I 've ever read . ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider the type of stories we are living . What are we striving for ? Miller argues that we are all living a story , but far too few are the stuff that summer blockbusters are made of . <p> What about you ? Are you on a mission ? Is your life leading to something great ? Are you taking risks , striving tirelessly , and undergoing your own hero 's journey ? <p> Or are you going through the motions in a vanilla-flavored rut-filled life ? If so , it might be time to start living a life on par with the heroes of Narnia . <p> Do n't  Forget That Good Always Triumphs . Some of the places I 've listed are always safe no drive-by shootings on Sesame Street but in most cases , danger and evil are ever-present . But in the end , good always prevails . The bad guy always gets his comeuppance ( or becomes a good guy . ) I think this is a big reason why we look so fondly at these imaginary locations . In our world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that evil gets off free . <p> The reality is that in the end , good will triumph in our world . It 's just not always resolved in such a neat and tidy fashion as is common in storybooks and two-hour movies . Sometimes we do n't even live to see it . But I have come to believe and experience that things do eventually work out for the best , if given enough time . There is a battle between good and evil in our world , and we must choose sides . Hang out with good people . Do good work . Believe in something bigger than yourself . And there 's no doubt in my mind that your story will end happily ever after . <p> So that 's my take . What similarities do you see between the imaginary places from our favorite stories ? And what other ways can we make our real world more like these fantasy worlds ? <p> Written on 8/11/2010 by Jason Kotecki . Jason is a cartoonist , author , and professional speaker .

You now have the magic formula ! Huzzah ! <p> But the reality is much more difficult . You ca n't just knock on the door of some super-secret club and expect to be let in the door .

That 's the wrong approach . <p> Fortunately , there are a few shortcuts , which I 'm going to share with you . <p> How You Can Meet VIPs and Top Performers <p> A major barrier which frequently keeps non-VIPs ( like you and me ) from connecting with VIPs is the difficulty of actually meeting the person . <p> But the good news is no matter your background , no matter where you came from , you can still find opportunities to meet almost any VIP . <p> As an example , take me . I did n't go to an Ivy League school . I am not famous . I do n't come from a well-connected family . My last name is not Trump ( last I checked ) . <p> And yet , I 've managed to meet two Presidents . I 've mingled with numerous high-level CEOs and celebrities . I 've interviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me an hour or so of their time , for free. - And I 've worked and socialized at a high level in various industries , from politics to Silicon Valley to Hollywood . <p> The good news is it 's easier than ever to connect with VIPs . The greater openness and transparency of the web and social media has meant there are more opportunities and tools than ever before which are available to help you meet a celebrity , powerful politician , movie star , or anyone else . <p> Here are five easy tips you can use to meet almost any VIP : <p> 1. - Record a Video of Something They Care About <p> A great way to meet VIPs and for them to get to know you is by creating a video dedicated to a topic they care about . For example , you could record a video review of their new book , or a video testimonial for a product they sell which you have purchased and found valuable . <p> The process is simple : record a short ( less than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then upload it to YouTube or your blog . Share it with them via an email , over social media , or through some other short message . ( Here are more tips on how to use your blog , specifically , to network with others. ) 2. - Interview Them <p> Here 's a simple trick ask for an interview . You can interview someone you admire for an article in a newsletter , for a guest blog post , for a podcast , or for a post on your own blog . <p> If you do want to try this strategy , then the larger the publication or website you will publish in , the better. - If you want to interview a really high-level VIP , try to publish the article in the largest publication possible . <p> I have used this strategy to interview a number of authors and entrepreneurs I admire , by simply finding a relevant and timely topic to write about and approaching them to be included in the article . <p> 2. - Write a Heartfelt Letter <p> You can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a meeting or a short response . At a minimum , it wo n't take much of your time to try. - Just be sincere and honest . People can smell insincerity from a mile away . <p> 3 . Meet at a Conference <p> Nearly every well-known VIP will speak publicly from time to time , often at different conferences and group meetings throughout the year . Traveling to one of these speaking engagements is a great way to meet that person . <p> Whatever you do , make sure your timing is right . Do n't barge up and interrupt them in the middle of a conversation , and do n't bug them before a big keynote speech . Make sure you study how to network at a face-to-face event before you show up . <p> 4. - Look for Mutual Friends <p> You 'd be surprised how few degrees of separation you may have between you and a big-name VIP . LinkedIn is a great tool for this .

Although if I ask my mutual friend to introduce me to Tony Hsieh so I can complain about my shoes not fitting , I do n't think we 'll be mutual friends for very long . <p> 5. - Honor the Person with an Award <p> Another great way to meet and get to know VIPs is by honoring them with an award or other recognition for their past service or an achievement. - For example , you could convince an organization or community group you belong to that they should give an award to a particular VIP you want to meet , and then volunteer to coordinate the event .

Grouchy , fed-up and bored are all words you could use to describe what it 's like when you 're feeling in a rut or like you 've lost that spark you used to have . Times like those are part of the deal with being human ( sorry to break it to you ) , but you 'll run the risk of losing an important piece of yourself forever if those grouchy days and off-times merge together and last weeks , months or even years . <p> Here are five easy ways to get out of the rut and get your spark back . <p> Shake Things Up If you 've established systems and routines for getting things done it certainly makes life smoother .

It does n't matter what the changes are or whether they 're right or wrong , just make a couple of simple choices that will add some variety to your day . <p> Doing things differently and changing parts of your routine instantly takes you out of the norm and allows you to shake off the things that make you feel confined . Stepping out of your routine puts you in a position where you 're able to make different choices , see things differently and get a different result . It 's the starting point for having a different kind of experience . <p> Remember Who You Really Are If it feels like your sparks gone then I 'm willing to bet that you 've forgotten who you really are , way down deep . Your values are the building blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the things that are ten thousand feet down inside you that make you you .

When vacation time comes , you may need to get ruthless . Start by making a list of what absolutely ca n't wait until your return : maybe projects with a client deadline in three days time . Get these sorted first : either finish them , or leave all the necessary instructions for someone who can . <p> Then figure out what should n't wait , but could do in a crisis . Do these before you start thinking about the " could be put off for months " category <p> Make a Check-List @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself a check-list for each one , jotting down the steps you need to take before going away .

Check out how your email system works , and set up a message to be sent to anyone who emails you while you 're away . <p> In almost every case , you should include : <p> The dates you 're away ( eg. " I am out of the office from Monday 20th July to Friday 31st July inclusive " ) <p> A line such as " I will respond to your email on my return " . <p> Details of what the person should do if its urgent , eg. " If you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Smith , email protected " . <p> In some cases , you may want to put a mobile number that you can be reached on . <p> Leave Instructions and Equipment Somewhere Obvious If you have any particular piece of office equipment ( eg. the company video camera ) that others are likely to need in your absence , make sure its not buried in the bottom drawer of your desk . <p> Write instructions about any common tasks that only you normally do : perhaps setting up an account for a new client on your web system . Its generally a good idea to document these anyway ( what if you 're sick ? ) but a vacation can spur you into action on this . <p> Make sure the instructions are stored in an obvious place . A searchable company intranet is good for this . <p> The last thing you want is someone phoning you up on vacation asking " errr , we cant find " <p> Leave Yourself a Note On your last day in the office , leave a note to yourself detailing : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What tasks you postponed until return <p> What needs immediate action when you get back into the office <p> Anything else you 'll worry about forgetting whilst on vacation <p> You might want to include a reminder to yourself to turn off your out-of-office reply : its easy to forget this ! <p> Relax and Enjoy It Surprisingly enough , your company can survive your absence for a couple of weeks without you checking your email in the hotel lobby . Most " crisis " situations at work are really just us over-reacting : its rare that anything goes so wrong that an apology ( and occasionally a refund to a customer ) cant fix it . <p> Relax and have a great vacation , in the knowledge that you left everything in the best state possible before going away . <p> Do you find it hard to leave work behind when you head off on vacation ?

Who needs it . Get your books early . If your professors havent posted them online , call the bookstore and see if they have a list . If still no luck , give your professor a polite e-mail stating you 'd like to get your books early so you can prepare for the class . Ask which books you need to buy . <p> Skim and review before class starts Review is one of your best weapons against challenging exams . Since you have your books early , spend a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the table of contents , summaries , bolded text and sidebars . Get the edge . <p> Do not change your diet eating more or less can change your concentration , energy level and ability to stay alert . Presuming you are satisfied with your current mental chemistry , avoid changing your diet . P.S. Studies show 75% of college freshmen put on 7lbs their first semester " keep lean and mean . <p> Decide your main goal Do you want straight As , Bs ? Before you can get anywhere you have to know where you are going beforehand . Choose before the semester starts what grades you want and write it down . By putting it in writing , you are setting an agreement with yourself after that , all you need to do is not break that agreement . = <p> Decide why you want to make As in your classes why do you want to be a good student ? Write up a list of reasons and then hang them in a prominent location in your living quarters . When the going gets tough and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , review this list . Add to it if you can . Reasons are what keep enthusiasm high . <p> Keep your exercise program going " Hopefully , since you are reading this blog , you have adopted an exercise program . Going to class is no excuse to stop . Stick with it for increased self-esteem , concentration and enthusiasm for learning . <p> Sit in the front row Studies have shown sitting in the front row is an easy way to improve your grades . Why ? You hear better , you have more interaction with the professors and there is no possible way to doze if you are in the front row . So choose the front row and win . <p> Reward yourself after small accomplishments When you get an assignment or test deadline , right then and there , decide on a reward for completing it successfully . I am not saying you have to get an A. Instead a small reward for simply getting through . Some ideas : A new video game , a toy , tee shirt , DVD . Pick something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish your assignment . The fun reward will carry you through to the finish line . <p> Make a habit of studying at the same time every day Humans function better at different times . When do you study the best ? Early morning , afternoon or evening ? Work on finding that out and then make a pact that you 'll study at that time every day . This works because 1 you 'll be in your zone naturally and you will be developing a habit of high quality study at that time of day . <p> Get enough sleep Staying up late at night watching TV , goofing off or drinking might be fun at the time , but leads to excessive tiredness during classes . Its tough to be enthusiastic if you are dead tired . So pick a time your fun and serious side can agree on , then stick to it . Set a reminder on your cellphone or computer if you need to .

Its not all our fault . The days of the 9 to 5 job are long over and despite huge advances in technology , our lives seem to be a lot busier compared than that of previous generations . <p> Even when I have been motivated to get a gym membership and start exercising , it only lasts for a few months . At the first sign of stress and deadlines at work , the gym routine gets kicked off the list . So here are a few tricks to include some activity in daily habits to take it from a sedentary lifestyle to a mildly active one . <p> Park far away Instinctively , almost all of us look for a spot as close to our destination as possible . Instead get into the habit of parking a block away , or parking at the farthest parking spot . If you are grocery shopping , park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly you would n't want to be caught pushing a shopping cart down the street trying to get to your car . <p> Take the stairs instead of elevators If it is one or two floors , always take the stairs . If you need to go up/down several floors then take the stairs to two floors above/below and then take the elevator . As you get used to it , increase the number of floors you use the stairs for . If you park in a level parking lot , always park in one of the higher levels and walk down . <p> - <p> If possible , walk or bike to work This is not possible for everyone , but if you live in a place where the pollution is less and your workplace is relatively close by , then choose to walk or bike instead of driving . <p> Skip the stop If your city has a subway or bus system , skip your stop and get off at the one after ( or before ) and then walk from there . You 'll get to enjoy the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maximize the benefits from your grocery trip When you go to the grocery store , make it a habit to walk the entire store . Go through every aisle and every nook and corner . Avoid the aisles that could tempt you to pick up junk food though , since that can completely obliterate any benefits of walking a few extra steps ! NOTE : if you have a spending problem do n't  do this . <p> - <p> Take a short walk-break at work Again this one depends on your work location , but ours is located outside the city and is on large private grounds . Every afternoon a couple of us go for a short walk ( 1 mile round trip ) which takes roughly 15-20 minutes . It is very invigorating and a nice break from the afternoon routine . <p> Do your own yard work This is a good one for summer time when the lawn starts to grow and you need to keep it trimmed .

You will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> - <p> Play with your kids Kids these days seem to play more video games than outdoor games like we did when we were younger . So take your kids out to the park and throw the ball around , play tag , etc . <p> Put on your favorite music and dance This is not only exercise , but also a great way to unwind at the end of a busy day . And a good trip down the memory lane for those of us who have not done it in a long time ! <p> - <p> While watching TV , pace or stretch Instead of switching channels during the ad break get up and walk about the house . Do some lunges or some simple stretching exercises . If you have stairs in your house , walk up and down the stairs a few times , during each ad break for at least one show every day . <p> Choose to walk down instead of call or email When you have a question for a colleague , instead of picking up the phone or shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not only provide some exercise but a short break for a quick recharge . <p> Walk while you talk on the phone If your job involves talking on the phone a lot , then instead of doing this sitting at your desk , get into the habit of pacing while you talk . Motion creates emotion so you may even become a better speaker by doing this . <p> - <p> Choose active entertainment over passive entertainment Instead of going for a movie , choose to go play tennis with some friends ( or at least bowling ) . Instead of playing regular video games , play with a Wii . Instead of meeting friends for a cup of coffee , catch up over a sunset walk . <p> - <p> Choose active vacations While planning vacations , pick something that involves some walking and hiking . While taking in a new city , do it by walk , instead of driving around . If golfing , skip the cart . If staying at a resort , make use of their pool and the exercise facility .

@@2098657 <h> How To Calculate Basis Points <p> Calculating basis points is a matter of performing a very basic arithmetical formula . Basis points are often abbreviated to bp or bps , and they are the equivalent of 1/100th of one percentage point , and thus it can be expressed as 0.01 percent or 0.0001 . <p> When it comes to interest rate calculations , we can multiply the percentage rate by 100 for the purpose of finding the number of basis points , and so 0.25 percent multiplied by 100 equals 25 basis points . Conversely , basis points can be converted to percentages by means of division ; for example , 125 bps divided by 100 equals 1.25 percent . <p> Basis points are widely used in the field of finance whenever very large quantities are alluded to ; for example , when the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States convenes to set the prime rate , a small increase or decrease of just half a percent is pretty significant and will be felt across the financial spectrum . Once banks are aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to price their products in basis points . For example , if the Fed decides to set the prime rate at 1.5 percent , some banks may seek to add a couple of basis points to this rate and apply it to their money market accounts . A similar situation would apply to residential finance products , whereby a funding fee or a commission paid to a broker can be set in bps , which are called " bips " in the mortgage lending industry . <p> Individuals who work in the investment banking field use basis points extensively . Wall Street and the financial industry are ruled by percentages and basis points , which provide a much needed uniformity in communications across the global financial markets . A corporate bond trader in London can offer his or her counterparts in Dallas a new issue that pays 50 bps over the LIBOR ; such an expression will help the traders in Dallas to quickly understand the price and how much this particular bond could pay . <p> Basis points have been adopted by the financial industry because they help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two percentages move against each other . When observing a significant financial benchmark such as the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Bill on a daily basis , even the most seemingly small changes can result in systemic changes , and thus it helps to evaluate them with a comfortable unit of measurement such as bps . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098673 <h> 7 Secrets of the Super Organized <p> A few years ago , my life was a mess . So was my house , my desk , my mind . Then I learned , one by one , a few habits that got me completely organized . <p> Am I perfect ? Of course not , and I do n't  aim to be . But I know where everything is , I know what I need to do today , I do n't  forget things most of the time , and my house is uncluttered and relatively clean ( well , as clean as you can get when you have toddlers and big kids running around ) . <p> So what 's the secret ? In truth , there are n't  any secrets . There are simple habits that you can develop over time that will get you to where you want to be . These are habits that you can apply to your work , your home , your kids , your hobbies , your life . Instead of giving you specifics for how to organize something specific , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can use over and over in every situation . <p> Are these obvious principles ? Sure , if you stop to think about them . Youve read them in various other places . But you might not be applying them to your daily life , and that 's where the problem lies . I 'm just providing you with a step-by-step guide to what actually works , based on my experience and that of others . <p> If your life is a mess , like mine was , I do n't  recommend trying to get organized all in one shot . Its overwhelming . Instead , start with the first habit , and work your way down . Do it a little at a time , one area of your life at a time , one area of your home or office at a time . Work on a habit for a month or so , then move on to the next one . Or adopt two or three if you think you can handle it , but do n't  do them all at once . I also recommend you set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) for organizing , at least in the beginning , until you are fairly organized and have your system down . Then , you might need 10 minutes a day , just to keep things running smoothly , and every now and then you might need to have a purge session ( every 6 months or so ) to get rid of accumulated buildup . <p> So here are the 7 habits : <p> Reduce before organizing . The mistake most people make when trying to organize their stuff or their tasks or their projects is that they have a whole mess of things to organize , and its too complicated . If you have a closet crammed full of stuff , sure , you can buy a bunch of closet organizers , but in the end , you 'll still have a closet crammed full of stuff . Same thing with time management : you can organize a packed schedule , but itll still be crammed full of tasks . The solution : reduce , eliminate , simplify . <p> If you take your closet full of 100 things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , now you do n't  need a fancy closet organizer . Same thing with time management : if you have 20 things to do today , and reduce it to just the three most important tasks , you do n't  need a schedule anymore . <p> How to reduce : take everything out of a closet or drawer or other container ( including your schedule ) , clean it out , and only put back those items you truly love and really use on a regular basis . This will leave you with a pile of other stuff get rid of it by tossing it , donating it , selling it or giving it to somebody who will love it . If you ca n't bear to part with some of the stuff , put it in a " maybe " box and store it in your attic or basement or other storage space . Label it with a description and date , and six months later , when you have n't needed any of it , toss it . <p> Write it down now , always . Our minds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't  remember things when we need to remember them , and they continually come up when we do n't  need them . Instead of using your mind as storage for things you need to remember , write it down . I carry a small pocket notebook wherever I go , and write things down immediately . Then I process the ideas and tasks later into my calendar or to-do list , so I do n't  forget. - <p> Have one inbox &amp; process . Well , actually you need two inboxes one for home and one for work . But many people have many more than that paper comes to their desk and lands in a number of places . Phone messages get placed everywhere . Notes to self are posted all over the place . Instead , have one inbox , and put all incoming stuff in there . Then , once a day ( or once a week at home if that works better for you ) , process the inbox to empty . Take an item out of the inbox and decide what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , file it , put it on your to-do list , or do it now . Do the same thing to the next item , until your inbox is empty . Do n't  defer these decisions for later. - <p> A place for everything . Related to the above tip is to have a place for each item in your life . Where do your car keys go ? You should have one place for them ( next to the door is best ) and you 'll never lose them again . Where do your pens go ? How about your magazines ? I teach my kids to find a " home " for every toy or other item in their rooms ( even still , their toys are mostly homeless wanderers , but they 're kids ) and that 's a concept that works for us grown-ups too : each item should have a home , and if it does n't  , we need to designate one . Labels can help you remember where those homes are . Now , if you find something on your table or counter top or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it does n't  belong there . Find its home do n't  just toss something anywhere . The same concept applies to information : do you have one place where you put all your information ? If not , try a personal wiki its accessible from work and home , and you can create pages for each type of information in your life schedules , goals , to-dos , movies to watch , books to read , notes on projects , etc . <p> Put it away now . Most people have a habit of putting something on a table or counter top or on their desk with the intention of " putting it away later " . Well , this is how things get messy and disorganized . Instead , put it away now in its home . It only takes a few seconds , and this one habit will save you a lot of cleaning and sorting and organizing later . When you find yourself putting something down , catch yourself , and force yourself to put it away now . After a little while , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Closely related to Habit 5 , this habit is effective because its much easier to clean things as you work or as you move through your day than to let them pile up and do a big cleaning session later . So if you 're cooking , try to wash your dishes as you use them , and wipe the counter , instead of leaving a huge mess . Same principle applies to everything we do . If its easier to do it in smaller increments , we are more likely to do it . If there is a huge mess to clean , we are more likely to be intimidated or overwhelmed by it and leave it for later . <p> Develop routines &amp; systems . If you 've gotten everything uncluttered and organized , you might sit back and enjoy the pleasantness of it . Being organized and having a simplified working environment or home is tremendously satisfying . But the problem is that after a little while , things tend to start to get disorganized and cluttered again . Things tend to gravitate towards chaos . The solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place . For example , the inbox processing mentioned above is a system : you have specific procedures for processing all incoming papers , and you have a routine for doing it ( once a day ) . All systems follow the same guidelines specific procedures and a routine that is done at a set interval ( three times a day , once a day , once a week , once a month , etc . ) . Its important that you identify the systems you have in your life ( and they exist , even if you do n't  know they do but they may be complicated and chaotic ) and write them out so that you can make them efficient , simple , and organized . Develop systems for dealing with paperwork and mail , with kids schedules , with errands and laundry and chores and exercise and everything else . Once those systems are in place , you need to be vigilant about keeping them going , and then things will stay organized . <p> Written for Dumblittleman.com on 06/07/2007 by Leo Babauta and republished on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his famous Zen Habits blog. <h> 1 COMMENT <p> After years of looking for the same things ( keys , important papers , etc . ) I decided to become more organized . You are right that it requires putting routines and systems into place taking action and forming new habits to replace the old ones . I love that having these systems takes the guess work out of it keys have a home , papers have a home and I get back my time ( and sanity ! ) : <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Do you feel like you have a lot of things to do but you cant seem to finish them ? Has it been a long time since you had a break or a vacation ? <p> If you answered yes to any of the questions , there 's a good chance you 're prone to burnout . That 's especially so if ( a ) you 're a workaholic or ( b ) you constantly receive ( and accept ) more work than you can handle . The upside is the increased work exposure helps you gain experience and develop your skills . The downside is , you neglect your mental well being , relationships , and health . <p> Prolonged periods of working without rest wears you out , without you even realizing it . Before you know it , your productivity is waning , you feel tired more easily and you are on the verge of breakdown . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is common among working level executives , freelancers , self-employed , entrepreneurs and students , because you 're directly responsible for everything and there are no work processes to guide you . Many people who are burned out for prolonged periods sink into depression which can be tough to deal with . <p> Below are 7 essential steps to avoid burnout . <p> Plan ahead Have a clear schedule . One of the biggest reasons for burnout is lack of proper planning . Thus , you over-commit yourself , sometimes having multiple deadlines running in the same time . This leads to late nights and high stress levels later on . <p> Prepare a schedule that shows what you have to do on a monthly , weekly and daily basis . Create an overview template where you can see your upcoming commitments at a glance . That way , you know periods when your plate is full and periods when you can slot in more work . Leave sufficient lead time for each project . <p> Set aside non-work/leisure time Work can never replace what non-work activities can give you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living , you probably just want to do it 100% of your time ( apart of sleeping/eating ) . I know I feel that way as I absolutely love my work . I feel 110% blissful and excited just writing personal development articles day after day , working on my blog and doing 1-1 coaching with my clients. - <p> However , there are areas of your life that ca n't be fulfilled by just work alone . They can only be fulfilled by non-work activities . For example , activities like time with your loved ones such as family and friends . Time with yourself , to go for a quiet walk or pursue your other hobbies and interests . Exercise sessions where you rejuvenate your body and mind . Vacation to take a break and regroup . These activities are important , quadrant 2 tasks , essential for your well-being . They should be planned in your schedule too and should n't be deprioritized for work . Set aside some time every week where you can work on your relationships , your health , recreation and your spiritual self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues , manager or clients have sudden , last minute requests where they need your assistance . This ripples out and causes a backlog in your own work . Without enforcing your boundaries , these will keep happening in the future . Let them know your commitments at the on-start so all of you can plan accordingly . Of course , itll be hard to enforce this 100% of the time especially if you 're working for someone , but clear communication will help move there . You have your boundaries and its up to you to enforce it. - <p> Stop overworking . Have a clean cut off for work Set a clean cut-off for your work . If you set aside X-Y time for a project , then make sure you end at Y time . Do n't  let it seep into other items on your schedule . If a particular task is taking way longer than expected , you 're probably not going to get much done with the extra hour or 2 . Stop working on it and get back at a later time or tomorrow where you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more productive when I do that. - <p> Cut off the busy work There are always fire-fighting activities and administrative tasks in every line of work . Eliminate them as best as you can and get right to the content creation . What I do is I write down all the things I intend to do for a day , then I circle out the high value tasks 20% tasks on the list that give me 80% of the value . Then I focus on them for the day . As for the remaining 80% tasks that give me lower value , I either put them off , delegate them or outsource them . When I do this , I feel I accomplished a lot more in the day . Otherwise , I get stuck in the 80% tasks that give little rewards , which is highly unproductive. - <p> Talk to someone Having a listening ear helps you to sort out mental clutter . If you 're feeling overwhelmed , share it with your friend . Ask him/her out and have a chill out session over drinks . Or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't  have to be alone in this . Youll be surprised at how ready your friends will be to listen and be there for you . You can also talk to fellow colleagues , and even your manager/teacher if you need advice from someone of experience. - <p> Maintain a healthy lifestyle Working under crunch deadlines , you might often forgo sleep to get work done . At first it seems like its okay you can just recoup lost sleep by sleeping more the next day . However , the impact of lost sleep piles up over time , to a stage when it weighs heavily on you . <p> Do n't  take your health for granted . Please make sure you sleep at least 5 hours every day . Having a proper diet and exercise regime is very important too . I used to take my health for granted , easily having days of not sleeping when I have a project deadline/workshop the next day .

@@2098679 <h> 10 Smartest Ways to Live Beneath Your Means <p> I managed to retire at age 51 , and the way I did it was to live beneath my means . <p> You can adopt this strategy too , by simply spending less than you earn . You may think that 's impossible for you , but if you make it a challenge instead of a chore , you 'll soon be creating ways to cut corners in everything you do . And believe me , it all adds up . <p> There are no secrets to this strategy . Its just common sense . Here are my 10 favorite ways to live beneath your means : <p> Whenever possible , buy store brands . Nearly half the cost for name brands goes to advertising . Usually their quality is n't any better than store brands , which frequently carry a money back guarantee . This is true not only with food , but also cleaning supplies and paper products . Even if the savings are small on an individual item , using this strategy every time you shop makes a big difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avoid prepared foods.Were all pressed for time , but buying prepared foods can be expensive . You pay extra for the convenience and get a meal full of chemicals and preservatives too . Instead , put your main course in a Crock Pot before you leave for work , or put frozen meat in the refrigerator to thaw before you go to bed . Once you learn to plan ahead , you 'll be surprised how much you 'll save . <p> Brown bag your lunch . I did this for years and it saved me thousands . Brown bagging has three benefits : Youll avoid greasy , high-calorie fast food ; you 'll save money ; and you 'll be more satisfied on your job , since lunch with coworkers often turns into gripe sessions . <p> Do n't  buy clothes or shoes with designer labels . Who do you want to make rich , some fashion designer , or you ? That trendy label will cost you at least 50% extra . Instead of impressing your friends , impress yourself by adding that savings to your bank account . <p> Use coupons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand product still costs more than a store brand , even after the deduction for a coupon , its no bargain . Most coupons are for new products companies want you to try , so be selective . You can get coupons online at sites like Coupons.com or Couponcabin.com , or search under " coupons . " <p> Buy used books instead of new . I visit two used book sales a year put on by local charities and get an armload of reading for less than $15 . I choose used books on Amazon.com . I got my copy of The Purpose Driven Life on Amazon , paying the standard $3.99 shipping and handling , but only 39 cents for a used copy . Even better ? Check out books for free at your local public library . Most libraries have DVDs and CDs , too . <p> Keep your car as long as you can.A shiny new car may impress your family and friends , but it simply costs too much . My current car is nine years old and runs like a dream because I have it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel injectors and superb rust protection , can last well past 150,000 miles if taken care of . <p> Severely restrict your credit card spending.Credit cards make money unreal . They take the thought process and discipline out of your buying . Before you know it , you 're deep in debt and getting further behind because you cant make even the minimum monthly payment . When you pay in cash and watch those bills disappear from your wallet , you become much more careful . You relearn the value of money . You question every purchase , and that 's when you become smart . <p> Reward yourself for your efforts . Your goal is to be frugal , not a miser . Small rewardswithin your budgetare a wise way to keep fun in your life . Living beneath your means takes self-control , but the emotional and financial benefits are tremendous . An occasional treat energizes you to keep up the good work . <p> Much of living beneath your means requires seeing through the false promises of prestige and fulfillment found in advertising . You 're too smart to fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer pressure , but whenever you 're doing something worthwhile , you have to stand up for your convictions . Living beneath your means is a proven way to avoid debt and the stress that goes with it . If I can do it , you can too . <h> 1 COMMENT <p> Great tips ! I loved this article .

@@2098682 <h> Make Sure Your Facebook Profile Does n't  Lose You A Job <p> Do you use Facebook ? I do too and so do a heck of a lot of other people . Including my mom , and my former boss . <p> Employers are increasingly using Facebook ( and other social networking sites ) to check up on potential and current employees . People have been disciplined at work , have missed out on job positions , or have even been dismissed due to comments theyve left on Facebook and similar sites . <p> In the credit crunch times , you cant afford to have anything working against you . here 's how to make sure your Facebook profile is n't visible to your boss and how to clean it up if necessary <p> Step 1 : Check Your Privacy Settings Do you know who might be reading your Facebook profile ? Are you really certain that its only limited to those people who youve accepted a Friend request from ? Log into your account , click the " Settings " button on the top left : then look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be in two or more networks probably a school one ( mines Cambridge University ) and a regional one ( mines London so pretty huge ) . Have a quick glance at the numbers of people in those networks : 44 thousand at Cambridge and three MILLION in London . <p> Now click on the " Settings " tab , and on the " manage " link next to " Privacy Controls " <p> Then click " Profile " . This is what mine looks like : <p> Hang on a minute " My Networks and Friends " ? Well , I 've got three hundred or so friends on Facebook but my networks cover three and a half million people : all of whom are either graduates of the same university ( so high on my list of potential networking contacts ) , or people who live in London ( where , if I was looking for another full-time job , I 'd be seeking employment ) . <p> As you can imagine , giving potential bosses ( and your past professors people who might write you a reference ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  actually use Facebook a lot and the few obligatory drunken photos of me are n't  particularly risque , so I 'm not too bothered who can see my information . But if you pack your profile with rude quotes , if your status update regularly includes how drunk/stoned/lazy you are , and if the photos of you are ones youd never want to be posted on the office noticeboard you might want to limit all of the information in your profile to friends only . <p> Why Should I Bother ? When an employer decides to check you out on Facebook prior to interviewing you , they wont be able to see your profile , photos of you , and so on . The first impression they get of you will be a professional one from the interview . Leaving your Facebook profile open to them is a bit like inviting them to come and nose around your home ( when its at its most untidy , with your stack of dodgy magazines left lying around ) <p> And if you doubt that employers do make these checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facebook Can Ruin Your Life " from the Independent ( a UK newspaper ) emphasis mine : <p> At Cambridge , at least one don has admitted " discreetly " scanning applicants pages " a practice now widespread in job recruitment . A survey released by Viadeo said that 62 per cent of British employers now check the Facebook , MySpace or Bebo pages of some applicants , and that a quarter had rejected candidates as a result . Reasons given by employers included concerns about " excess alcohol abuse " , ethics and job " disrespect " . <p> Do you want to risk missing out on your dream job because of your Facebook profile ? <p> Step 2 : Cleaning Up Your Profile You might not want to limit access to your profile to only your friends , if you use Facebook for a lot of networking . Or , you might have a lot of " friends " whove added you because they read your blog , or because they knew you in kindergarten : you never know when one of these friends might be a useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although your profile might not contain anything too dreadful ( such as admissions of just how you ended up leaving your previous job ) , things which seem perfectly innocuous could still cause employers to decide to pass on you . The recruitment site www.onrec.com offers ten top turn-offs for employers who are performing discreet background checks using Facebook and similar sites : <p> Interestingly , employers were not just concerned about alcohol or drug use , or inappropriate photos . They also used the information posted to identify those with poor communication skills , and inaccurately stated qualifications . Bad mouthing of former employers and colleagues was also identified as a concern in a large number of cases . <p> So its worth cleaning up your profile to get rid of anything that 's not contributing to the impression you want to give to employers , business colleagues and other contacts anything which undermines or contradicts your personal brand . <p> I 'm going to focus on two key areas that could be letting you down : " Your Info " and " Your Photos " . <p> Your Info <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on " Info " : <p> Have a good read through what 's listed there . You might want to update old information ( I 'm awful at doing this ) You may need to self-censor some of your " favorite music " or " favorite movies " , if you have somewhat extreme tastes in either . Think about who might read your profile here : if you 're going for a job with a right-wing political or charity body , a long list of slasher/horror movies and death metal music might not go down too well , but it could be just the thing if you 're trying to land a job with a design agency that prides itself on " alternative " styles and creating shocking , engaging concepts . <p> Some quick tips that might help you are : <p> Get rid of any silly , profane or potentially bigoted ( racist/sexist/etc ) group memberships <p> Try to list some favorite books , not just films and music . Employers will be impressed if you look well-read. - <p> Make your Quotations ones which are funny/profound , not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. - <p> Check for typos and spelling mistakes : these might seem unimportant to you , but they could be sending a negative impression to potential employers- <p> Your Photos <p> Click onto the " Photos " tab . This will show everything which someones tagged with your name . Its worth going through every single one , and untagging it if its not something you want to be associated with ! Again , use your own judgement here : an unflattering shot might be a disaster if you 're trying to become a supermodel , but could be an actual asset if you 're aiming for a career in stand-up comedy <p> Click on the thumbnail to view a photo full-size , and click the " Remove tag " link next to your name ( at the bottom , under the photo ) to remove the tag meaning snoopers cant find that photo of you : <p> For most of us , photos to look out for are : <p> Photos where you look drunk/stoned/comatose ( even if you were " just caught at a bad angle , honest " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking friends <p> Photos where someones put a really dodgy caption about you ( sadly , employers may decide against you based not only on your profile , but on what your friends seem to be like ) . - <p> Any photos containing evidence of illegal or semi-illegal activity especially if your employer or school could penalise you for it- <p> Kevin Colvin , an intern at Anglo Irish Bank , who told his employers he had a family emergency , but whose Facebook page revealed he had , in reality , been cavorting in drag at a Halloween party . <p> Photographic evidence can also be used to catch student culprits : <p> Oxford University proctors disciplined students after pictures of them dousing each other in shaving foam , flour and silly string in post-exam revelry were found on their Facebook pages . <p> Step 3 : Keeping Your Profile Clean Once youve limited access to your profile and cleaned it up , you need to keep it safe for work . In my last full time job , my boss was " friends " with a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have parents who are paying your tuition fees , you might want to make sure your Facebook account gives the impression that you 're making the most of their money ( rather than partying constantly ) <p> Some good points to pause for thought are : <p> When setting your status . Do you really want to declare that " John thinks work SUCKS " or that " Jane is thinking of throwing a sickie ? " Even something a bit less obvious , like moaning about a difficult client , could rebound badly on you. - <p> When commenting on other peoples photos , wall , etc . Think about what your words might convey to someone who was n't in on the joke or the conversation . Would you look bigoted , illiterate or plain nasty ? <p> Its also unwise to use Facebook while at work your actions are time-stamped , so if your boss sees that you 've been updating your account at 11am when you shouldve been hard at work , s/hes unlikely to be impressed . <p> Why Should I Bother ? <p> Thoughtless use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past ( though this is usually due to admission of some serious wrong-doing , such as theft from the company ) . Even if you do n't  get sacked , you might have to face up to consequences . <p> Kyle Doyle , a 21-year-old resolutions expert for telecommunications firm AAPT , bragged about his day off on the social networking site while telling his employer he was away for " medical reasons " . <p> But he was found out when his boss spotted this Facebook profile update on the day in question , August 21 : " Kyle Doyle is not going to work , f*** it I 'm still trashed . SICKIE WOO ! " <p> So head on over to Facebook , and check out the employer-friendliness of your profile .

@@2098684 <p> When there 's something you know you have to do , do you feel overwhelmed instead of motivated ? <p> How often do you think to yourself , " I ca n't deal with this right now . Ill start later today . Or maybe tomorrow . " <p> Those words pop into my own head just about every day at some point or- another . <p> Having struggled with attention deficit tendencies my entire life , I 'm a master at putting things off , or not finishing the things I do manage to start . <p> If you 're like me , as soon as somethingespecially something you 're not getting paid for feels like work , you 'll look for an out . <p> Exacerbating our desire to avoid work is that most of us have a warped sense of time . Our estimation of how long something will take to finish is often as distorted as our reflection in a fun house mirror . <p> Over the years , I 've developed the following strategies to trick myself into productivity by turning perceived work into play and shifting my perception of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youve already done . <p> I know , I know . Everyone tells you to write a list . But if list-making feels like work , you can turn it into a game . For instance , on those days when you 're feeling particularly unmotivated , start your list with things youve already done . <p> Example : 1 . Make coffee . 2 . Take a shower . 3 . Get dressed . <p> If you cant muster the energy to take a shower , go even smaller . " Brush teeth " warrants its own line item on some days . If that 's even too much , start with " Breathe . " Try getting out of that one ! ( Waitmaybe not . Please keep breathing . ) <p> Checking off tasks on to-do lists triggers a shot of dopamine in our brains . Free and legal alternatives to drugs are always good , right ? <p> Once you 've had the satisfaction of checking off a few items right off the bat , you 'll be spurred on to add to your to-do list . <p> Ive been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jotted them down in little notebooks or on random slips of paper . My old lists serve as a quirky kind of diary of productivity . These days I keep my lists on my phone , which allows me to immediately add an item without having to search for a pen and a scrap of paper . <p> OK , so you 've got your list in front of you how do you decide what to do first ? 2 . Ca n't prioritize ? Let scissors and fate decide ! <p> You may have dutifully made your to-do list , but you either cant muster an ounce of motivation or you are so overwhelmed that you are simply paralyzed with indecision about where to begin . On days like this , let fate decide for you with this game : <p> Example : Youve got family coming to town and you want everything to look perfect . But every room in your house or apartment is a wreck , with no easy starting point . <p> Start by writing downon paper this timea list of every room . ( I actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ print it out each time I have to clean the house . Along with the rooms , " laundry " is also listed since dirty clothes are usually part of the mess ) . <p> Now , cut up the list so that you have just one room on each slip of paper . Fold these all up and put them in a bowl . <p> Pick out one slip of paper and head to the listed room . Forget about the rest of the bowl and give that single room 100 percent of your attention . <p> If you 've got kids , they can join the game by picking a task out of the bowl and helping out . <p> When you 've finished the task , throw the slip of paper in the trash with a flourish and pluck your next assignment from the bowl . <p> Some days , even a single task may feel overwhelming so how do you make it manageable ? <p> 3 . Divide big jobs into smaller pieces with a creative kick . <p> Big tasks are really just a collection of small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task into bite-sized portions . You can really have fun with this if you think creatively ! <p> Example : Youve drawn " office " from your task bowl , but your desk alone looks like its been hit by a hurricane . Whatever neat piles may have been there earlier in the week ( month , year ) have merged into one big terrifying mess . You start to hyperventilate just looking at it . <p> Your first reaction is , " That 's too big a job to finish today , so I wont even start . " <p> Take a breath , then turn it into a game by visualizing a grid on top of the desk ( or floor , or other area that 's plaguing you ) . I 've even used string or ribbon to create a real grid when I 'm too overwhelmed to visualize . <p> The size of your grid squares will depend on your motivation level . The less motivated you feel , the smaller your squares should be . <p> Just look at the job one square at a time , without feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Your to-do list should state your goal : " clear three grid squares on desk . " Or , if you do n't  need quite that much structure , " clear upper right corner of desk . " <p> Then , like a horse with blinders on , focus all your attention on that little area . Starting at the top of the pile within that grid square , take it one piece of paper , one file folder at a time . No pushing papers to another square . That single square gets 100% of your effort . <p> One piece of paper at a time , one square at a time . Stop when you 've reached your to-do list goal . <p> You may be so pumped up with your progress that you want to keep going . Leave em wanting more , as they say . Take care of some of your other list items before coming back to it . <p> OK , so youve sliced and diced your tasks into tiny pieces what if you think you do n't  have time ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even if you 've divided your tasks into small bites , there are days when you believe that you do n't  have time for even a single bite . This game involves setting a timer and only spending a few minutes on a given task , since simply starting is the hardest part of all . There 's no right or wrong amount of time . Some days 20 minutes or longer will be palpable . Other days you might only be able to handle 5 or 10 minute stretches . <p> Example : Let 's stick with the impending family visit and the mess in the office . Even though you 've divided cleaning the office ( and desk ) into smaller task segments , you think it will all just take too long to complete , so why even start ? <p> Ask yourself how many minutes of full attention you think you could manage . Let 's say its a 10-minute kind of day . <p> Set your timer for 10 minutes ( or whatever amount of time feels doable for you ) . Now see how much you can accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the job , but that does n't  matter . At least you started , thereby breaking the inertia . If the task is n't finished when the timer goes off , put the slip of paper back into your task bowl and come back to it later . <p> No matter how daunting a job is , I can usually convince myself to start if I know I 'm only doing it for a limited amount of time . <p> Youll be amazed at just how much you can accomplish in a 10- or 15-minute stretch . I 've had plenty of days when I could only handle 5-minute stretches of focused attention , but was still able to feel productive at the end of the day . Those tiny bites add up . <p> For years I used a simple kitchen timer for this game . Now I use a timer on my phone with a nice zen-inspired chime that makes me happy each time I hear it . <p> What if being on the clock does n't  motivate you ? <p> 5 . Count to 10 ( or 20 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works on the same principle as the timer , but you 're counting objects instead of minutes . Defining a start and end point makes it easier to begin something you 're not looking forward to doing and gives you yet another strategy to turn work into play . <p> Example : Youve got a mountain of dishes piled in the drier rack next to the sink ( or a mountain of laundry that needs to be foldedyou get the idea ) . You tell yourself you do n't  have time right now to deal with it . Youve been telling yourself that for days now . The mountain just keeps getting bigger . <p> Start with 10 . Tell yourself , " I will just put 10 dishes away ( or fold 10 items of clothing , etc. ) as a start . " Then do it . You realize that only took a minute or so . Maybe you have time for 10 more . If not , that 's OK too . At least you started . <p> If you combine this with the timer strategy , you 'll see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few minutes time . You can clear 10 things from the drier rack in just a minute or two . You can fold 20 items of clothing in less than 5 minutes . <p> So how do you put all of this together ? <p> 6 . Mix up the games and sprinkle in rewards ! <p> On any given day , your motivation level will determine just how many of these games you 'll need to keep moving forward with your to-do list . Mix and match the strategies , and do n't  forget to reward yourself ! <p> Example : You make your list over breakfast , including the morning run and/or shower you may have already taken . You 're already on a productivity roll ! <p> You decide todays the day to tackle cleaning your basement . You divide the task into smaller segments by area , either via the grid visualization or writing down the various areas to randomly choose from . Set your timer for 30 minutes ( or some other number that wont feel overwhelming ) and get to work . <p> When your timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes spent on an enjoyable and/or fulfilling task are recommended over martinis and bonbons ( save those to celebrate the completion of your whole list ) . <p> After your break , get back to your list , perhaps taking care of a couple of quickie to-dos by racing against the clock or counting items as you put them away . Then get back to the basement , taking it just one area at a time . Keep up your rhythmtiming , counting , checking off list items , rewarding yourself as each tiny bite of time and task is completed . At the end of the day , you 'll be astonished by what youve accomplished ! <p> So Put on Your Game Face ! <p> Now that you 've got a basket full of games in hand , you can redefine your notions of work and play . <p> You can turn even the most mundane of tasks into something playful and fun ( remember the dopamine response of checking off your to-do list items ) . <p> With a more realistic notion of time , you 'll be more likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At the end of the day , when your bowl of tasks is empty and your to-do list items are all crossed off , you 'll be the high scorer ! <p> Your sense of satisfaction will be on par with ringing bells , flashing lights , and a flood of bonus points . <p> You will have left procrastination in the dust and replaced it with record-breaking productivity levels .

I do prefer the natural approach wherever possible and have found that if I abide by certain rules , I seem to sleep much better than if I do n't  . <p> For instance , if I work up until I go to bed my mind is usually restless making it hard for me to relax and go to sleep . On the other hand , if I meditate before bed , I tend to fall into a deep sleep fast without lying there for hours on end . Here are some of the things I do and please note , taking a pill is n't one of them ! <p> Meditate Before Bed Time Meditation just before bed time is the ideal sleep inducer for me . I find it helps me to calm my mind while keeping me focused . If I tend to worry about something I often find the answer in my meditation quite naturally . <p> You only need a few minutes to do this . Sit comfortably in a straight backed chair with both feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure to align your body if you do ) . Now close you eyes and concentrate on your breath . Watch as the breath flows into your body and back out . Follow mentally along on the journey and breath softly all the while . <p> Do n't  force your breathing . Also , if thoughts happen to flow into your conscience , allow them and then gently dismiss them . Do this for 5-15 minutes . The more you practice , the easier it will get and the more benefits you will feel . <p> Write Down Your Thoughts Another great way to get rid of all the daily ballast is to keep pen and paper next to your bed and write down anything that comes to mind before you go to sleep . Do n't  focus on the quality of your writing , just let it flow and empty your mind of all thoughts , regardless how unrelated they seem . <p> Some people prefer to write into a diary , while others use a normal notepad . Whatever works for you is perfectly fine . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it helps me to focus on the positive things in my life , rather than the negatives . <p> Gaze Into A Candle For 5 Minutes Going to bed in candlelight is magical . You will be transformed from the starkness of modern life into the middle ages . It helps to reflect on the day just gone and softens the environment . Light a candle as you get ready for bed and then sit and gaze at the candle for 5 minutes while you gently calm your buzzing mind . <p> Once your head hits the pillow you will probably sleep very fast . NOTE : do not fall asleep with the candle burning ! <p> Eat Enough During The Day Eat breakfast like a king , lunch like a prince and dinner like a pauper . If you got to bed on a hungry stomach , you wont be able to sleep well . It is actually rather annoying . To counter this feeling try to eat enough during the day and drink plenty of water to keep your brain cells hydrated . <p> People with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than those who are starving . Some say that it helps to drink a warm glass of milk with honey before bed . While I liked this idea when I was a kid , I 'm not exactly sure whether it really helps or simply tricks of the mind . <p> Read A Relaxing Novel Novels are great to tune out to the world around us . We can forget all about work , family , money and dive into a world of fantasy and fun . I like to read at least half an hour before I go to sleep . It really helps me to switch off my mind . <p> While watching TV is more stimulating before bed , novels are less aggressive . They further our imagination , helping us to indulge into our adventurous side , all the while knowing we are safely tucked away in bed . <p> What is your favorite way to chill out before bed time ? Have you found something to work really well to help you sleep like a baby ? I 'd love to hear about it . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Even if you are part of the 20% of Americans who actually truly enjoy what they are doing , chances are likely that you would rather be doing something else . <p> Job satisfaction rates are horrendous and one of the reasons is that people are slowly starting to realize that there is a better way to live . We are wising up to the fact that we do n't  NEED to work a crappy job and just grind out a living . <p> There is so much opportunity for anyone willing to take control of their life and commit to living a passionate life . <p> Is it that simple ? I believe it is . Is it easy ? Of course not . <p> Working The Rat Race <p> hat is it that millions of people wake up unhappy knowing that they have to go to a job they hate ? There are a number of reasons including : <p> Fear of failure <p> Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apathetic towards life <p> Willingness to accept whatever they have <p> All of the above reasons are garbage . There is no reason for anyone to fall victim to these things .

However , the drawback to this is that when you are ready to have your acrylic nails removed , it is often not very easy . There are a few good ways to remove your nails when you need to .

@@2098690 <p> Here are some practical steps you can do right now to push yourself to action.1 . Throw your hat over the wall <p> Do you remember being on the playground in elementary school when some idiot threw the ball over the fence ? <p> Then everyone got together and decided who had to hop the fence and get it ? Let 's use this example in todays life . Throwing your hat over the wall means completing an action that forces you to get started on a goal . <p> Congrats , youve just thrown your hat over the wall , now go get it . Look for simple actions that will force you to get motivated to act . <p> 2 . Make the consequences unbearable <p> Did you know most people would rather protect their assets than risk gaining more ? This is human nature but sometimes it goes against our best interest . <p> This technique is similar to the first but stands out on this principle : if you do n't  accomplish your goal , there will be consequences . <p> here 's a good example . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Facebook how you are going to post pictures of your new self in 60 days . Okay , so now you have a challenge . What will be more painful ? <p> You being sore from the gym or the embarrassment of you shirtless on Facebook ? What scenario can you create to make the consequences of not accomplishing a goal more painful than taking action ? <p> 3 . Envision- <p> There was once a man who was very fast and would race people for money in his small village . One day another man approached him and challenged him to a race . The challenger asked the fast man just how he was so fast . The man answered , " When I 'm racing , I picture a wolf chasing me . " , " Ah " replied the challenger . <p> They both lined up 200 yards away to begin the showdown . Bam ! Went the gun and the two started off . The fast man was ahead at first but then from the corner of his eye the saw the challenger blow past him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> After the race , the fast man approached him and asked how he was so fast . The challenger replied , " Well you see . When I run , I picture myself chasing the wolf " . <p> Envision the feeling of actually accomplishing your goal and then chase that feeling like the wolf . <p> 4 . Set aside something until you accomplish the mission <p> This one is pretty self-explanatory . Sometimes to just go without something is a great motivator . If I told every woman that they could not eat chocolate until they 've lost 5lbs the gym would be a massacre . <p> What 's something that you really like that you could give up ? <p> Could it be no more internet browsing until you 've written your term paper ? This is a great way to build willpower as well as motivate . <p> 5 . Start the snowball <p> What does every large snowball have in common ? They were all started by a single snowflake . This is a momentum builder . <p> What small task can you do right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal ? <p> This may be hard because if you lack the motivation to do anything in the first place .

@@2098693 <h> 7 Powerful Tips To Becoming a Better Listener <p> When people speak , do you listen ? How much of what 's communicated do you internalize ? <p> Recently , I was talking to someone who was not very present in the conversation . Even though she would nod and say " Yeah " the whole time we communicated , her follow-up comments would reveal she was n't listening 100% . <p> For example , there was a point when I talking about A , but she kept replying to me as if I was saying B. <p> I thought it was really strange , so I repeated what I said in a slower , more precise manner . But the same thing happened while she would nod and say " Yeah " while I was speaking , her reply suggested she did not get the gist of what I was trying to say . <p> At that point , I was entirely baffled . After engaging in a few more conversations with her , I realized it was a norm with her . She often nodded and looked like she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off tangent . It would seem that even though she exhibited " signs " that she was listening , she was never really listening . <p> Listening is an important skill more so than one may realize . We use it all the time at work with our managers and co-workers , in presentations , in relationships , in social settings , with our families . Believe it or not , we even use it when watching TV and films ! <p> In my work , listening is especially important . When I 'm coaching my clients , its important I listen and understand their underlying problems ( that may even elude them ) , so I could ask the appropriate coaching questions to forward them . When I 'm communicating with the readers at my blog , its important I read between the lines and " listen " to what they 're trying to say , because words alone may not convey their intended messages . <p> I 've learned that being a good listener takes more than just hearing what the person has to say it requires conscious desire , conscientiousness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 personal tips on how to be a better listener : <p> Remove All Distractions In this day and age , in our quest to get as much done as we can , we multi-task the whole time from web browsing , checking emails , replying emails , working , talking on the phone , fiddling with our phones , writing in our notebooks , etc . So when people approach us to talk , its natural we add that to the list of things were doing at the moment , vs. giving them our full attention . <p> To be honest , I do this myself , especially if its just a short or casual conversation . I think its fine if you 're able to attend to the other partys request . However , if the person is trying to tell you something important , or share something personal , you should ideally stop what you are doing and give him/her your full attention . What I do is I close the lid of my laptop ( hence eliminating all distractions ) , turn myself towards the person and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of respecting him/her . <p> Be Present Are you present when you 're around other people ? Or are you lost in your own thoughts ? - <p> In the example I shared in the opening , it was apparent my friend was not present during the conversations . Even though she would nod as a sign of acknowledgement while others were speaking , her mind was lost in her thoughts . Hence , when it was her turn to speak , her comments would be off tangent to what was being communicated . <p> To be a good listener , you have to be present . Being present means ( a ) not being preoccupied physically ( b ) not being preoccupied mentally . The former means to remove distractions , as I mentioned in Tip #1 . The latter requires you to clear your mind of other thoughts and focus on the person speaking . This means to stop thinking about the argument you had at work with your co-worker in the morning , the report you 've yet to finish , or where youre going to have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> How does one become more present ? I see it as an ongoing path , rather than one end goal . One activity that never fails me is this 15 minute brain dumping exercise , whereby I clear out mental clutter instantly . Meditation is another useful habit that helps me to be more present instead of thinking about the past or the future , I 'll be in the current moment , which is the moment we are living in anyway . <p> Wait for the Person to Finish Speaking ( in the start ) Its good etiquette to let the other party finish what he/she wants to say , before you butt in with your comments . I know there are times you feel you get what the person is trying to say and you cant wait to share your comments , but hold it off in the beginning of the conversation . Because the person may have other things to share but cant because you are speaking. - <p> I find that often times when I just sit and wait , the person will often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known if I had interjected or stepped in to speak . Once I get a hang of what the person has to say and where the person is coming from , I 'll be more open in interjecting , while being conscious of the persons needs and letting him/her go ahead if there 's anything he/she wants to say . <p> Do n't  Assume Anything An important part of listening is not to assume . When you assume , you automatically layer over what the person says with your presumptions , which makes it near impossible to have any meaningful conversation . While the person may say A , ultimately you can only hear B , simply because your mind is not open to receiving new information in the first place. - <p> When it comes to communication , err on the side of safety and assume you know nothing . In this regard , questions are your best friends ( see #7 ) . <p> Look at the Sub-Text Powerful listening requires you to understand that the words articulated in a conversation do not always represent the persons intentions . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to say , and talking is really our way of processing our thoughts. - <p> In this regard , do n't  rely too much on the words communicated , per se . Instead , look at the sub-text such as the facial expressions of the person , the tone of the voice , the body language , the choice of words , and so on . What is the person trying to say ? What do you think he/she is feeling ? What is he/she thinking behind his/her words ? Combine this with what he/she is saying to you and you 'll get a lot more out of the conversation . <p> Clarify to ensure you got what the person is saying At every stage of the conversation , clarify to ensure you got the message right . This can be done by simply paraphrasing what he/she just said , in your own words . Sometimes we may take away one message when its really something else , and its not good to assume without clarifying first ( see #4 ) . - <p> What I do is I 'd interject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as " Ok , so what you 're saying is that .. , right ? " , in which the person simply needs to say " Yes " or " No " . This helps ensure everyone is on the same page before any more new information is shared . <p> Ask Questions Questions are highly important in any conversation . Firstly , there are things which the person does not share ( either because he/she thinks you already know them or because he/she thinks they are irrelevant ) that you can only uncover by asking questions . Secondly , questions let 's you get more information about specific areas you are unclear about , such that you get a better picture of what the person is saying. - <p> My conversing style involves a lot of questions , especially at the beginning of the conversation . This is because because I see this as the " understanding " or " information gathering " phase . Rather than overshare at the start , I prefer to understand the person and get a good grasp of who he/she is , then share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my communications with others , as others quickly ease into their natural persona and open up about what they want to talk about . Because of this , it has allowed me to easily connect with others and develop meaningful relationships which is what we want to achieve at the end of the day . <p> Remember that listening is one part of what it takes to build meaningful connections with others .

They must be having a great time . If only that place was n't so expensive ! <p> So you 're here all by yourself . The office feels like one giant , empty place . While you slowly eat your food in silence , you start to wonder what your coworkers may be saying about you . <p> Perhaps they are gossiping about how poor you are because you do n't  eat out like they do . Or maybe they are starting to think you 're anti-social . Worse of all , maybe they are not even talking about you . You just do n't  really exist anymore in their world . <p> Youve simply been forgotten . <p> Want to Make Friends At Work ? <p> I 'm not talking about the random colleagues you chat about the weather with at the water cooler . <p> Those do n't  count . <p> I 'm talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with . People who knows more about you than just your job title and the latest project you 're working on . People who you can have a real conversation with on topics that are n't  work-related at all . <p> People you may even want to hang out with outside of work hours . <p> Why Its Hard To Be Frugal and Still Make Friends <p> Think of all the typical things people do with their coworkers for fun : lunches , restaurant parties , and drinks after work . There 's nothing wrong with getting to know people through those methods . Its just that every one of them costs money . <p> Sometimes a lot of money . <p> That may not be a problem if you have a fat budget to burn every month . But it just so happens that you do n't  . <p> Do n't worry , there is still hope ! I 'll teach you how to make friends even if you do n't  go out as often as you may like . <p> You see , there are plenty of activities you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've personally tried quite a few , and I 'll share them with you here . <p> How to Make Friends At Work ( On a Tight Budget ) <p> 1 . Be the Chef Of The Day . Every now and then , I would bake some goodies and bring it to the office . You 'll be amazed at how people " who normally would n't even make eye contact with you " open up as soon as there 's food to be shared . Maybe it 's because it 's free . Or maybe it 's because they 're just flat-out amazed I baked something edible . Either way , it makes for a memorable experience . And who knows ? Others may encouraged by your example to share their home cooking too . <p> 2 . Save those leftovers . Who said spending time with your colleagues during lunch involves actually eating out ? Whenever I want to catch up with people over lunch , I usually pack food from home ( leftovers are awesome for this ) and invite them to do the same . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 'll save a lot of time and hassle by not having to rush to and from the restaurant . As an added bonus , I can focus more on catching up with the person and less on rushing through the meal . <p> 3 . Who does n't  love a show and tell ? If making food isnt your thing , then perhaps sharing something you love to do outside of work may be a way to go . Perhaps you 're into soap-making , or woodwork , or making decorative pins . If so , then you can bring a few items to give away as gifts or to display at your office . Try it ! You 'll find out quickly that this is a great conversation starter . <p> 4 . Battle for poker supremacy . Playing poker or any other card games for that matter at work with my colleagues is easily one of my most enjoyable times at work . Of course , we don t play for money ( and you probably should n't either ) . Without money in the equation , everyone can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also play chess , checkers , or whatever else that strikes your fancy . Just do stuff together . <p> We are n't even close to finished yet so keep on reading for more fun and inexpensive ideas to make friends with the people you work with . <p> 5 . Work those legs . This is one of my favorites . If you want to stay in shape , start a walking group and get active for 30 minutes everyday . You get to hang out with friends and exercise , all for free . No more dragging your whiny and tired butt to the gym after work . You can now cancel that gym membership with pride ( AND save money ) . How is that for a win , win , win ? <p> 6 . Choose latte over lunch . If you want to go out but do n't want to spend too much money , go for coffee instead of a full lunch . There 's nothing wrong with a little compromise . Besides , this will be a nice opportunity to step away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fire up the latest TED talk . Everyone brings their own food , get together , and learn something or simply be entertained over the lunch hour . It can be related to work , or it can fun too . If watching TED videos are n't  your thing , then ask your colleagues what other cool things you can do as a group during break time . A group of ladies at my workplace once did a workshop on how to make handcrafted cards . Use your imagination here ! <p> 8 . Take me ( and you and everyone ) to the ball game ! Companies sometimes subsidize social events or sports teams for their employees . If they do n't  , then organize one at your local sports league with your coworkers . Group discounts are readily available for large team sports , so playing in one does n't  necessarily have to damage your wallet . The time you invest in these activities will reward you with many new friendships for sure . <p> 9 . Pick and choose your indulgence . Let 's face it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fine restaurants , it is OK to just pass sometimes . Otherwise , no amount of frugal tips will save your monthly food budget from exploding . You may just find other colleagues who secretly feels the same way as you do ( and applaud you for having the courage to say " no " ) . <p> 10 . Dare to hang out outside of work . Who said you should only hang out with your coworkers at work ? Include them in your evening or weekend plans . Ask them to join you the next time you are out with your friends . I know from experience that most people present only a fraction of themselves at work . Remove the work setting , and you 'll have a much greater chance of getting to know your coworkers for real . <p> 11 . Be generous with your time ( if you can manage it ) . We all have crazy times at work when we feel like we just cant keep up . It would be SO nice if someone would just offer a helping hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be forever in that persons debt . This is where you come in . Be that person WITHOUT being asked . People will remember you forever and would no doubt think a lot better of you afterwards . <p> 12 . Visit with no agenda attached . We 're all used to people dropping by our desks just to demand something from us . So try this instead : drop by your colleague 's desk next time just to say hi . I love how people 's faces light up when they realize I came all the way just to see how they 're doing . Of course , you have to be smart and not drop in when they are busy . Do it with genuine care in your heart , and you 'll have a new friend in no time . Be Frugal and Social <p> Yes , it is possible . <p> We all want to be part of a group , at work or otherwise . No one wants to be forgotten . No one wants to be left out . <p> Sometimes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being social . You feel like you just cant afford to do fun things at work . But if the list above is any indication , this does n't  have to be the case . <p> Try one thing from the list today . <p> No , not tomorrow because we both know you will forget and go back to eating at your desk alone again .

@@2098703 <h> 9 Immediate Tips To Stay Focused on Your Goals <p> Do you remember the new years resolutions you set at the beginning of this year ? What are they ? How are you faring in them right now ? If you 're like most people , chances are you 've long abandoned those goals . Some of you may not even recall what goals you have set . Which is unfortunate , because goal setting works ; it has never failed anyone . The only reason why goals would stop working is because the person who has set the goals , i.e. you , chose to give up on them mid-way . <p> For example , I lost about 7-8kg this year and am at my desired weight today . I 've switched from an unhealthy , junk food diet to a healthy , vegan diet which I 'm proud of today . I created my personal development blog , and built it from 2 readers a day ( me and my good friend ) to over 600k page views/month making it one of the top personal development blogs online . I 've created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and am earning a steady , passive income from it . I resolved a deep-seated emotional eating issue which I 've been struggling with the past decade . My previously sour relationship with my parents has dramatically improved for the better in the past 2 months . <p> I 'm not sharing the above to distance myself from you , or to put myself on a pedestal . Quite the opposite Im sharing the above to let you know that because I 've achieved my goals , you can achieve your goals too , no matter what they are . Its all a matter of staying focused . <p> If you constantly get distracted in your goal pursuits , here are 8 tips I have for you to stay focused : <p> Concentrate on 1-3 goals If you constantly have trouble keeping to your goals , maybe you 're spreading yourself too thin . Pick 1-3 goals that are most important to you , and stick to them . Do n't  bother yourself with any other goals until these goals are achieved ( or unless priorities shift and these goals no longer reflect what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my top priority goal is to reach out to more people through my blog , so I ensure all my daily actions ladder up to this one goal . Majority of my time in the week is spent either writing new articles for the blog , maintaining my facebook and twitter account , maintaining the blog and forums , processing my emails or creating upcoming plans . If Im caught up with something else for a long period of time , its a cue to me that I 'm off-track . <p> Such laser focus has allowed me to make much more progress , compared to when I juggle across 4-5 goals and make little progress in them . <p> Create a vision board A vision board is a collage of pictures and images that represent your goals and dreams . Creating a vision board helps you to visualize your end goals more clearly , which inevitably inspires you to take consistent action . Not only that , it also serves to remind you of your goals every day when you see the board . I 've a vision board in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every time I see my board , it reinforces my goals to me , and reminds me to take action so as to move forward. - <p> Create milestones If you just set one huge goal , it can be discouraging especially when you do n't  achieve it after a short while . When that happens , some people may procrastinate on the goal altogether which is quite unfortunate . I find its helpful to break a big goal into smaller goals , after which you concentrate on achieving the smaller goals in the short-run . Just like when you go on a long road-trip You set pit-stops to rest/recuperate throughout the trip. - <p> Create a plan If you have a plan worked out for your goal , it becomes much easier to stick to it . All you have to do is to follow the actions you have planned for the day . The best time to work out your plan is when you set the goal , because that 's when your motivation is the highest . Usually , I create my goal action plans right after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately which helps create a positive momentum. - <p> Track your results Its important for me to track the results of what I do , because otherwise it feels like my actions are not making a difference . Hence , every time I work on a goal , I will identify 1-2 performance metrics , then track those metrics daily/weekly . They are my connection to the end goal , because they let me know whether I 'm on track or off track , which in turn let 's me know whether to tweak my actions or not. - <p> Have goal buddies Goal buddies are people who share similar goals with you . They help to remind you about your goal , spur you on when you feel unmotivated , give you new ideas on how to achieve your goal , keep you on track , among others . Your goal buddies can be your friends , or people whom you meet in interest groups . Since you already share similar interests , itll be easy to find people with the same goals .

A lot of times , we abandon our goal pursuits because we get frustrated mid-way and we are not sure what to do about that . However , when we write out our thoughts , it helps us to get clarity on our issues and renews our interest in the goal . Many readers at my blog created their life journals in the blog forums and have found that to be tremendously helpful in keeping them focused on their goals. - <p> Be clear on why youre pursuing the goals If you keep giving up on your goals halfway , perhaps you were never serious in them to begin with . For me , if I 'm really serious about a goal , I 'd never give up on it I 'd keep hammering away at it , regardless of the obstacles , until they give way and I 'm enjoying the fruits of my labor. - <p> I once had a coaching client who would embark on many new business ventures , only to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Its okay to do that once or twice , but if you keep doing the whole time , something is seriously wrong . You cant forever put your life on hold for others !

TIP : Ask to see the comparisons ( called " comps " ) . High volume agents may be motivated to list your house too high because they do n't  need the quick commission . An new agent may list a home too low just to sell it quickly and get paid . Bottom line is that its your house and you need to do homework to ensure you 're asking the right price . Do not simply take their word for it.Q . Is your realty company placing pictures on your website and other listing services ? A. Of course , we can do that . TIP : Who is taking the pictures , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or can we also have the panoramic video tour posted ? Does your site require that people register before seeing the video tour ? If yes , why ? I am promoting my house and I do n't  want prospective buyers being spammed . <p> Q. Will you be at the closing or will you send a lackey ? A. It depends on scheduling . TIP : No . You are about to pay this agent some serious coin . They should be at the closing to make sure it goes smoothly . If they can not squeeze you in , forget it . <p> Q : Show me your municipal reporting on the area ? A : Um , what ? TIP : Your agent should be able to quote ( by memory ) information about the schools , local parks , park district features , etc . If not , how is he/she going to answer questions from people that want to buy your house ? If they can not do it by memory , pulling out a printout or a PDA is OK . Nevertheless they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A : I sold $3 Million in property last year . TIP : Ok great . Did he not sell another $5 Million that he listed ? Ask him to explain at least 2 instances when he listed a home and it did not sell . A good agent will have 1 story setup for you , so its important to ask for at least 2 . <p> Q : How accessible are you ? A : Buyers can call my direct line 24+7 . If I am not there , the answering service will take the call . TIP : Well ok , but let 's just use your cell phone and skip the answering service . As an busy agent , you may forget to call for messages or worse , they may not be accurate . Further , I prefer to have the real estate agent return calls as opposed to the office admin that is not as educated on real estate . <p> Q : What is your commission ? A : The total commission is 5% of the sale price . TIP : Ask what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if the buyer is just some guy driving down the street ? If the buyer has no agent , the commission should be cut in half or otherwise reduced . This negotiation will generally need to include the agents broker . No matter what they say , this % is negotiable . I had a broker agree to sell my home for 1% if the buyer was not represented and 3.5% if the buyer had an agent . <p> Q : How can I prepare to show my home ? A : Just make sure the house is clean , blinds , curtains and doors open . Also be sure the grass is cut.TIP : Also make sure you have every light in the house on . Think about the last time you went to a new model home , all of the lights are always on . Also , if there is a stain in the rug , throw a chair over it . <p> Q : Can I have the names and phone numbers of the last 3 people that listed with you ? A : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amigos . What you want here is the last 3 people that listed . NOT , the last 3 people who had their homes sold . You are interested in hearing either how good or bad this agent is . There is no better way than to ask a past customer and every agent I spoke to was very surprised to hear me ask this ( not sure why ) . <p> Please note this is not anti-real estate agent . Most of the people I spoke to were pretty good . It was a combination of 4 interviews with agents that contributed to this . <p> " Also , if there is a stain in the rug , throw a chair over it . " Yeah , because you want to deal with an ethical agent and an ethical agent will always encourage you to cover up rather than disclose defects . <p> No , the idea is not to cheat , it is to allow someones emotions to flow uninterrupted during the walk-through . When someone is walking through your house for the first time , a stain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to get someone to that point the in love point . Once there , the buyer will generally either be OK with the stain or simply ask for a couple hundred dollar credit that will pay for cleaining/replacement . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

You dread the thought of going to work another day , so in a futile attempt at making the day go away you hit the snooze button . Now it 's 6:09 am and if you do n't hurry and get out of bed you are going to be late for work . <p> Not that you really care since it is a soul-sucking job anyway , but you do need the money . You look back on your college years and reflect on all the broken promises . You were promised an amazing career if you got your degree . You were promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In reality , life is grim and the future looks bleak . You check out your Facebook page and notice a couple of your friends on vacation ; one in Italy the other in Miami . It 's been a long time since you took a vacation . You then check out your Instagram and see that your cousin is expecting a baby , and another friend just bought a house . You still live in your apartment . <p> After eating breakfast and hopping in the car you arrive at work . Your boss informs you that you got something wrong with your latest report and he expects a new one by this afternoon . More work for you . <p> You plow away revising the report when you hear a cubicle neighbor on the phone . She is talking to someone and mentions how she has been with the company for over 30 years . You have a mild panic attack as you visualize yourself sitting at this same desk , doing this same mind numbing work for 30. long.years . <p> That 's enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vision of what your life was going to be like coming out of college .

You were n't meant to waste your life away at some soul-sucking job . <p> The problem is over the years you were misled . You had the belief that if you were a good boy , and did what was asked of you , you would be rewarded with a good life . So instead of creating your own story , you lived the life that was expected of you , hoping for the best . <p> Stop living in other peoples stories ! In most of their stories , you are n't even a secondary character . You are a background character who needs to get a report done . It is time to stop , and it is time to start to- be the hero of your own story ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , create your own life ! And to be quite honest , you only get one shot at this thing called life and it 's too short to live someone else 's story . Nobody grows up dreaming about becoming R2-D2 , or Frodo 's Merry and Pippin . <p> Everyone wants to be the hero . <p> Everyone wants to make a difference . <p> Everyone wants to know at the end of the day that their time on earth mattered . <h> Create Your Life To Liberate Your Life <p> I 'm here to tell you that this is possible ! You can create your own story , and you should be the hero of your own story too ! <p> Growing up , my philosophy in life stated that if I conformed to the wishes of those around me I would have a happy life . It made sense . If I sacrificed my wants and desires for those around me , we should all be happy right ? <p> This philosophy seemed to serve me well . I went to college , got married , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until it all came crashing down . <p> I was working at a job where my bosses would constantly yell at me . They were high pressure big city types trying to make the same business model work in rural Idaho . I was miserable . <p> After a much needed vacation , my family and I came home . We went inside and my wife handed me a packet of papers filing for a separation . <p> I was blind sided . My whole life , I had lived to make others happy ! How could this be happening to me ? <p> I was mostly numb during the course of the divorce . I did n't  want to feel . I would go to work then come home and curl up in the fetal position while crying . Just to do it all again the next day . <p> With time I realized something had to change . I began a journey of discovery . Nothing seemed to resonate with me until I rediscovered the concept of the heroic journey . <p> The heroic journey is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It outlines the cycle a hero goes through in order to complete his quest . <p> I realized that my life here on this earth is a heroic journey , but I 've been playing the sidekick in everybody elses story ! As I analyzed the story structure I realized where I was stuck and what I must do to move my story forward as the hero . <h> Your story <p> Will you still play minor roles in other people 's stories ? Yes , but instead of your primary identity being a reactive one to the lives of those around you , you will proactively create a life that is perfect for you . When you create your story you set the rules for how you live a successful life . <p> Maybe going on long vacations is how you define a successful life . Maybe starting your own business is how you define a successful life . Or maybe being a good parent is how you define a successful life . <p> It honestly does n't matter how you define what a successful life is because we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully . What is important is that you understand that you can create that life ! <p> The liberating idea here is that you do n't have to buy into the idea that you have to get a house , have 2 children , and work a 9-5 job in order for your life to be successful . <p> Go back to a time when you were a child . What did you wish you could do when you were all grown up ? Go back to the time you were in college . How did you dream about changing the world once you graduated ? Those are both a couple of good questions to ponder when it comes to writing the rules for your life . <p> Imagine how it will feel for the first time proactively creating the life that you deserve , instead of reactively living somebody else 's story . <p> My wife is not a morning person . She would rather jump into a pit of snakes than wake up early . To be honest she does n't do her best work in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and evening . <p> She was working at a job that required her to be at work early .

@@2098712 <h> How Much Do Models Get Paid To Pose In Playboy ? <p> Models who pose for Playboy and other publications where they are expected to show substantial amounts of skin are not customarily paid a set or fixed rate . In many cases , modeling fees tend to be negotiable ; one of the few exceptions in this regard is the fee that a Playmate of the Month ( PMOM ) can expect . <p> Playboy , the media empire founded by American business mogul Hugh Hefner in 1953 , is known to pay their PMOM models $25,000 . For this fee , the PMOM will have to do more than just disrobe and look sexy in front of the camera . There may be promotional material created for websites as well as personal appearances for the purpose of marketing . <p> The Playmate of the Yewar ( PMOY ) is selected from the 12 PMOM models by Mr. Hefner , who also consults magazine ratings and reader polls to reach this decision .

@@2098714 <h> Things to Consider Before Getting Married <p> After 7 years of marriage I can honestly say that I would do it again without changing much . Well , maybe we would have spent our money a little more conservatively but as far as the the decision on marriage it was a perfect one . <p> Unfortunately , as I consider our acquaintances and their marriages , its clear that all marriages are not created equal . Cheating , drug addiction , financial woes , and chronic fighting surrounds us and often times we are stuck in the middle as these people come to us for advice . <p> Here are a handful of things that have become common themes . My assumption is that you 've already talked about religion , having kids , sex , etc . If not , you really need to open up the communication . <p> So before you say " I Do " , make sure you have at least considered these : <p> Ability to Compromise There are subtle changes that most people can make in their lives in order to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise phase that is critical . <p> When single , I 'd watch football games at bars every Saturday and Sunday ( and sometimes Thursday ) . Once married , I toned it down to one day . This is a manageable change that I was willing to make . However , had my wife insisted that I give up all sports entirely , I would have resisted and eventually resented her . That resent would have spread and ultimately influenced my overall attitude towards her . <p> The same is true for just about everything . The willingness of the other person to compromise today ( of the lack thereof ) and your reaction to it will prove to be a precedent setting event . If someone is absolutely unwilling to compromise on minor issues , you should expect the same for larger issues . Do n't  be shocked and appalled by it when it happens three years from now- you knew this going in and you accepted it ! <p> Money Yes , we all want it but once we have it who controls it . My wife started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dating . I actually do n't  recommend that so soon but she was bad with money and she admitted it . For us , it was a matter of getting our credit into shape ( we had 640 credit and back then , now its 800+ ) and we needed a strategy to pay off her college and my personal debt . <p> Once that debt was paid off and we moved into our house , I turned the finances back over to her after a crash course in on time payments and credit . I never looked back . I enjoyed the strategy part of it but not the day-to-day grind of bill paying . She actually enjoyed it because as a stay at home Mom , it gave her the insight she needed to plan for grocery purchases , clothes for the kids , etc . <p> So before you get hitched , what is your plan today and 5 years from now ? Who is handling what ? <p> Who cleans the toilets ? Toilets and the remainder of the housework is a constant issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fun . Setup a plan for this in the beginning . My suggestion is a weekly rotation perhaps you 'll come up with something different . The point of this is to set the expectation on both sides so that someone does n't  feel like a housekeeper . Chores need to be shared regardless of the work and income situation . Being a woman does n't  mean the wife has to handle at all . <p> The plan In talking to people , it became pretty apparent that their initial goals were in line but after the kids are born and careers take off , there is a fork in the road . I agree that all plans change and there is no way to write a script for your marriage but a lot of the confusion can be removed by having a 1 , 3 , 6 and 9 year plan . You should have this conversation now and then revisit it all the time . This does not mean you only review goals at these intervals . These are simply due dates . <p> I am often questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one is obvious . After the wedding , where will you live , where will you eventually live . Who handles what , what is the combined income , what can we afford etc . <p> At 3 years : You are no longer newlyweds and you are perhaps considering kids . Heck , you may already have a kid at this point . You need a plan for that , a plan for who works , who stays home , what type of daycare , etc . This is also around the time that your first condo or " couples house " loses it appeal . What kind of house do we want ? Where ? Can we afford that ? How are the schools ? What is Plan B if someone gets fired ? Do we know what utilities cost ? <p> 6 years : We have all heard of the 7 year itch . Therefore , it stands to reason that you have a plan set with a deadline of 6 years . Where do you want the marriage to be in 6 years ? Communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and periodically consider making adjustments based on the the success of your approach . Plans are meant to be changed . <p> 9 years : Again , where do you want to the marriage to be in 9 years ? Why ? What will life be like ? How many kids will we have by then ? Are we sending them to public school ? What if someones parent dies ? What is one of us becomes seriously i 'll ? <p> Holidays Just discuss how and where you will celebrate holidays . This is a battle for nearly everyone I know . <p> Discipline Are we spanking the kids , are we talking and coaching or are we doing both ? No matter how happy you are now , if you 're against physical discipline and your spouse is not , you will slowly learn to resent and dislike him/her each time a spanking is doled out . Discuss it NOW and avoid a surprise . <p> Ok , religion How important is it and how will we teach the kids ? <p> Communications , cheating I do n't  care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ openly state that they " may cheat " . A key here is to be undoubtedly sure that the precedent is set for open communication . If a wife is not happy , the FIRST action on her part should be to talk to the husband ( and vice versa ) . The only way to do this consistently is to talk ; not yell , not argue , but talk like civilized people . If you become enraged every time your spouse tries to talk to you , you are pushing away an opportunity to fix a problem . Take time out and actually LISTEN . Marriage is not an argument or a punishment unless you make it one . <p> There are clearly a lot of other things to consider . Bad choices are going to made regardless of how thorough you plan ; that 's life . You would n't go on a 1,500 mile road trip without putting some thought into it and your marriage should be thought of in the same way . By planning and talking , the aim is to minimize the possible obstacles by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they reach a critical , war-type , level . <p> What do you wish you discussed or planned before tying the knot ?

@@2098718 <h> 5 Quick Ways to Deal With the Confusion and Conflict Within You <p> Have you been feeling confused and conflicted lately ? Most people right now are going through a transition . There 's something going on , and you feel it in some part of yourself.You may be confused , disorganized , or even frustrated . You do n't know what 's what anymore and life does n't make sense . <p> It used to be logical and you used to know what to do , but now it 's all up in the air . I know , because I 've been there , and in this article I 'll give you five quick ways to deal with it . <p> Chaos Before a new order can emerge , there is chaos . Similarly , whenever you are about to have a breakthrough you will experience confusion and chaos . Confusion really is a prerequisite state in order for us to have breakthrough experiences . This means that whenever you feel confused , there is something happening within you . <p> It does n't  always seem like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , you will see that something has changed for the better . The same thing happens when you learn something new . At first , you feel confused and it just does n't  make sense . But when you return to the material a few days or weeks later , suddenly you understand more than you did before . <p> Acceptance Do you feel like you 're whole life is crumbling away ? Again , this is just an external manifestation of point #1 above . Whenever you feel confused , accept whatever goes on within you . It may be hard in the beginning , because it scary to face your fears and other negative emotions . Most people try to run away from their emotions , and you can probably guess where that leads . Just take a look around you and see how happy most people are ( hint : they are miserable ) . <p> Look inside , and breath into your emotions . Accept whatever is there , and get curious about what kind of shape your feelings are , what kind of color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it works when you are willing to try it . <p> Release The more you let go of the old , the easier your life will be . When you try to hold on , you suffer . Letting go means being open to new ideas . Everything is constantly coming and going . The job you once had no longer exists , but when the door closes , another one opens . <p> The problem is that most people stay and knock at the closed door for the rest of their life . Then they wonder why no one is opening the door.This does n't  have to happen , because you can open your mind , release the old and embrace the new . This is scary , because it is the unknown.And we humans tend to like what 's familiar . Even to the point where we will hold onto negative emotions and behaviors rather than let go , because they are more familiar.Its a bit scary when you put it like that , is n't it ? <p> Get Help If you want to speed up your progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about a psychotherapist . I 'm talking about something like a qualified NLP practitioner , a hypnotherapist , or even a good EFT practitioner . <p> The reason I make these statements , is because in my life , the biggest changes have happened by using NLP and both myself and my clients . You cant always see where you are stuck , and that is where another fresh pair of eyes comes in . The problem is that most people do n't  like to ask for help , because it is viewed as a sign of weakness in todays society . I used to think like this as well , but I did n't  start to really excel until I started opening up to coaching and getting feedback . <p> It might be something for you to consider , or not . Its always up to you . <p> Cycle This cycle will continually repeat itself , because that 's what cycles do . Just like a wave builds up and crashes and returns to the sea , so will your life have its ups and downs . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You will go through confusion and clarity over and over again . It 's a part of life . <p> The bottom line is that most confusion and conflict is created within you . That means that you alone hold the keys to your salvation.This is n't easy for most people to accept , which is why they might dismiss an article like this.In the end , only you can make a difference in your life , so the question is , will you ? <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Not that I do n't  know the merits of getting to the point right away in your email , its just that I need to put in more conscious efforts to make them precise . <p> The other day I was reading Leos post on disadvantages of long emails and that made me realize that I am not the only one who has this bad habit of ( sometimes ) writing long emails .

There are various other ways to improve your email writing skills , and make sure that it gets opened and read even when it reaches someone who gets hundreds of emails each day . <p> The following five tips are something that I 've learned over the past few months , and they have undoubtedly helped me a lot in improving my emailing skills . I am yet to perfect them though . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emails Except .. <p> As Leo rightly mentioned in his post , long emails ( mostly ) do n't  work .

@@2098723 <h> How to Boost your Afternoon Energy with a Power Nap <p> " When I was at NASA we gave the pilots a planned nap in the cockpit , " says Rosekind , who is a board member of the National Sleep Foundation . " While two pilots flew the plane , the third would have 40 minutes to nap . We found they would sleep for 26 minutes , which boosted their performance by 34% and their alertness by 54% . " Mark Rosekind , PhD . Source <p> Power naps are a great way to give yourself a shot of physical and mental energy in the middle of your day . Even when you get a good night 's sleep , sometimes your body just needs a rest in the middle of the day . <p> The beauty of power naps is they do not have to be long , they can be done on your break at work or during your lunch hour , and they usually leave you feeling energized . Adding this one small change to your workday could boost your afternoon productivity , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's baseball practice with enthusiasm . <p> Do not use a nap as a way to make up for a sleep deficit . Your body needs to be in deep REM sleep for a minimum amount of time so it can repair and rejuvenate itself . Rather , supplement your regular sleep schedule with a short , mid-day power nap that gives you a quick and easy shot of energy . <p> Here are the points to remember : <p> Short Naps are Best : If you have tried afternoon napping in the past only to find it leaves you feeling groggy , try sleeping for less than a half-hour . Twenty to thirty minutes is the ideal length for a power nap because your body does not have the chance to fall into any kind of deep sleep . This will allow you to wake up feeling energized rather than fuzzy . It is also short enough so that it will not interfere with your nightly sleep schedule . Do not take a nap that is going to prevent you from going to bed at night . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing your eyes for just five minutes . Even a couple of minutes of rest can give you increased energy and clear your mind . <p> Make it a Habit : Working in a nap as part of your normal daily routine will allow your body to expect it and incorporate it into its natural rhythms . In fact , try scheduling it into your calendar or using half of your lunch break . By keeping it regular , you will find it easier to doze off quickly and easy to wake up again. - <p> Get Comfortable : Some people are lucky enough to be able to fall asleep anywhere , anytime . All they have to do is stop moving for just a few minutes and bam " they are out . Unfortunately it is not that easy for all of us . If you work at home and want to try napping , get comfortable in a familiar location . Go lay in bed or on your couch. - <p> Others are able to fall asleep in the car ( but do not sleep in a hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to stop and crack your windows ) , or even behind the desk . While this is n't ideal for cubicle workers , If you have an executive 's style chair , many times you can kick your feet up , lean your head back , and close your eyes . If you are nervous about people pulling pranks on you , find an empty conference room or a vacant office with a door you can lock . <p> If , after several attempts , you are not able to pull it off , try a quick meditation break instead . Its not sleeping , but it sure is a great way to restart your afternoon . <p> Do not feel guilty about indulging in an afternoon nap . You are doing your body a great service by keeping it rested and energized . If you are afraid of getting too comfortable , set an alarm to ensure you do not oversleep . Oversleeping during a nap is going to destroy your sleep schedule and can make you feel more tired . Keep it short . <p> If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groggy . Go into the restroom and splash some cool water on your face , or run your wrists under the tap . Your blood vessels are very close to the skin in your wrists , which is why tap water running over the wrists can help raise or lower body temperature . Holding them under the cool water for a couple of minutes should help clear out the cobwebs . Supplement this with some foods that will naturally boost your energy . <p> Once you wake up from your nap , do something physical as well . Even if you go for a short stroll around the office , the act of moving will clear your mind and get you back into the right frame of mind to work . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Let 's randomly choose one and click preview : <p> After a few clicks , I find a personal calendar where a woman lists the itinerary of a guest they have flying into town for the weekend . In the notes she lists : <p> Paul arrives 6:40pm United Airlines #5687 <p> Perfect , let 's get some flight info at Travelocity . Hey ! What a coincidence she has a visitor coming to LA . That means she lives in LA , just like me . This is shaping up nicely . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and help myself to her iPod and all of the other goodies in the house . <p> Let 's go back to the calendar for some more detail . When viewing the calendar , I make special note of when this person has classes , tasks , or are otherwise not home . The screenshot below is a random illustration , however , several online calenders contain items such as , " Scrapbooking Class " each Tuesday , etc . In fact , I would be willing to bet that each of these tasks will keep her away from the house for at least an hour . <p> So at this point every reader is saying , " Great , but you have no idea where she lives . " Umm , that 's true for the next few hours . Based on the information I already know about her holiday guest , I know Paul is arriving in LA and what time he is landing .

Let 's look at previous months to see what she 's involved in ( this screenshot was removed see note at the top and bottom of this message ) . Hopefully she is not a Marine or into kung-fu .

@@2098729 <h> Five Simple Ways to Relax at Work When Stress Strikes <p> " Stress is nothing more than a socially acceptable form of mental illness . " Richard Carlson <p> Stress sucks . It is one of those things that can sneak up on you at work and explode in terrible and hurtful ways . <p> When stress strikes it is really important to have some simple techniques in your arsenal that allow you to deal with the emotions in the short and long term . <p> This way you can avoid the angry outbursts , sleepless nights and anxious binge trips to KFC that all happen because of stress . Here are a few of my favorites : <p> Find Your Breath One of the most effective and simple ways to deal with stress at work is taken from an ancient Buddhist meditation . It is called " calm abiding " and it is where you bring your attention and focus to the breath coming in and out of your nose . I talk about this a lot in Enlightening Stress Relief , because I believe it is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the office . <p> The main purpose of calm abiding meditation is to attain a state called " single pointed concentration " where the mediator can focus on any given object for as long as they want without their thoughts wandering away to other areas . Of course , this takes years to master and is not really what we are concerned with here . We are concerned with relieving stress . <p> Luckily for us , calm abiding meditation has several powerful side-effects and one of them is that i combats stress in a very efficient way by relaxing the body and mind . Calm abiding meditation is also said to have the ability to heal some minor health problems and will also clear up headaches , neck aches and other stress related issues . <p> So how do we do it ? <p> All you need to do is sit down and very slowly bring your attention to your breath . Focus on the feeling of the breath going in and out of your nose . If other thoughts enter into your mind just let them pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Just notice them and then bring your awareness back to the breath . <p> Now we are going to count 10 rounds of the breath . A " round " is one inhale and one exhale . This is a lot harder than you think because the stressed mind will jump around like a monkey whose pants are on fire ! If you lose count before you get to 10 simply start again . <p> This meditation is a short term and a long term solution . In the short term it will calm you down and cause anxious thoughts to dissipate and weaken . In the long term it will help you to manage stress and become aware of stressful thoughts as they arise . When you become more aware in this way stress becomes less and less of a dictator and you become more and more in control . <p> Get Sunlight and Wide Open Space Think about the average office ; it is a stress breeding ground . Your eyes are barraged with fluorescent light , your skin is chilled with ducted air conditioning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chattering keyboards.When you spend a lot of the day indoors dealing with the daily grind you lose a lot of perspective . A stressful event seems like the end of the world and you spend the rest of the day ( or week ! ) brooding and thinking about it over and over again . It is like there is nothing else going on in the world.When you feel like your whole world is becoming engulfed in stress and anxiety one of the simplest things you can do is go outside in the sun in a wide open space . When I was in university and exam stress was getting the best of me I would go to the very top floor of the building which overlooks the whole city with a computer chair and a coffee and just sit in the sun and look at the view . <p> The effect is wonderfully relaxing.Sunlight , for starters , has been scientifically proven to make you happier . It causes Vitamin D to be produced in your body and this is a natural anti-depressant.Secondly , the wide open spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my secret spot used to remind me that there are other people in the world a lot worse off than me , I have a lot to be thankful for and that failing an exam was n't the end of the world , etc . <p> Secondly , the wide open spaces help you get back some perspective . Overlooking the city at my secret spot used to remind me that there are other people in the world a lot worse off than me , I have a lot to be thankful for and that failing an exam was n't the end of the world , etc . <p> Being able to shift your perspective is a wonderful human quality that many people take for granted . Get outdoors to a wide open sunny spot and just slow down and regain some perspective. - <p> Get a Good Green or White Tea Everyone drinks tea but not everyone knows how amazingly good it is for battling stress . Green and White teas in particular are extremely good for your health . When I was in the Himalayas I was introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since that time I have used it extensively to calm me down. - <p> All of these teas come from the same plant but are given different names if they are prepared differently or made from a different part of the plant . Green tea , for example , is fried or steamed to prevent the leaves from fermenting whereas White Tea is made from the buds instead of the leaves . These two teas are said to be slightly more beneficial for stress related problems than the others . <p> So how does tea help stress ? <p> Tea is full of antioxidants and does wonders for stress levels on many different levels . One study has shown that people who drink tea are actually happier than those who do not . They are also less likely to get cancer and some other serious illnesses . <p> There are many definitive physiological reasons as to why tea helps stress . Chinese doctors have known it for thousands of years and now western science is backing up those claims with evidence that a cup of tea can suppress a hormone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage people to drink Dilmah tea as it is known as one of the worlds most ethical tea companies and produces the highest quality tea . Dilmah put a lot of money back into the local community and take good care of their workers . They also grow their tea in clean environments which is very important for our health . It is also important not to add any milk to the tea as the proteins in the milk can damage some of the teas goodness . <p> Try Classical Music A few years ago I discovered how much classical music could help my stress levels . I was driving home from a tough day at work and I changed the radio channel to the local classical mix by accident . Normally I would have changed it right away but that day I heard the inspiring violin of what I now know to be Vivaldis famous piece called " Winter " . I was hooked. - <p> Since that time I have experimented with all of the great classical composers ; Mozart , Beethoven , Bach and so on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a very distinct flavor . <p> Classical music is a really fantastic way to relax when you are feeling stressed and anxious at work . I recommend something that has a smooth violin sound or a melodic piano . Just chuck some on your iPod and listen to it when you feel like the office is starting to get you down . <p> Just Relax ! A lot of us are addicted to stress . I know that sounds a little silly but in many cases it is true . We are addicted to being depressed and anxious and we have decided that being stressed is normal and therefore do nothing to combat it. - <p> And to make matters worse we go over things again and again in our head . We think that if we think about " why " we are stressed we will come to some lasting solution but in actual fact it just makes it worse . Ever time you think about the stress is just seems to add water into the whirlpool . Thinking about being stressed makes you more stressed ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the mantra " Just relax ! " It sounds simple and probably a little bit silly but it is something you have to try to do . Just relax . Things are n't  that bad . <p> To help you accomplish this I want to share with you a very famous Buddhist teaching by an Indian master called Shantideva . It has helped me deal with stress and worry many times in my life : <p> " If the problem can be solved , why worry ? If the problem can not be solved , worrying will be of no help . " <p> When we look at it logically there really is no reason to stress and worry . Remind yourself of this fact and just relax !

@@2098730 <h> Calculating Your Financial Ability to Pay Rent <p> How much rent can you actually afford to pay each month ? One problem that renters often run into a few months into their lease agreements is that they find it difficult to make ends meet . This problem usually arises when landlords and tenants fail to make a realistic estimate of just how much rent can be paid each month . <p> When prospective tenants submit a rental application , they should take into consideration all living expenses . Too often , rental applications are approved solely based on the background of the applicants and their income ; this is not conducive towards establishing a clear picture of the ability of the tenant to make monthly payments . <p> Rental affordability can be calculated using a method similar to the Debt-to-Income ( DTI ) ratio estimate used by mortgage brokers and underwriters . Landlords often go by the unwritten rule of monthly income being three times greater than the monthly rent payment , which is fine as long as other living expenses are not too high . When thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as car loans , college debt , credit cards , etc . <p> Rent-to-Income ( RTI ) Ratio <p> Landlords focus on 30 percent RTI ratios , which is a calculation that is essentially the same as annual income being 40 times the monthly rent . If the monthly rent of an apartment is $1000 , a landlord will expect to see an annual salary of $40,000 before issuing an approval . It is important to note that combined income is used when calculating RTI , and thus a couple who works and contributes to the maintenance of a household can add up their incomes when submitting a rental application . <p> Calculating Home Affordability <p> A realistic estimate of how much rent can be afforded requires the inclusion of utility expenses and all other monthly debts . The idea is to choose a rental situation that actually fits an individual or family budget ; to this effect , the net monthly income should be used instead of gross pay . The sum of all monthly payments due should be divided by the net monthly pay and divided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ideally , renters should be looking at no more than a 45 percent ratio when calculating affordability . This allows for reasonable nutrition , entertainment , savings , and even investing . Alas , tenants who live paycheck to paycheck will probably have to adjust this ratio upward to 60 percent . Ratios above 65 percent tend to create financial stress . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Good stuff here , great even . But does having these things make you the best you can be ? Once you have these things , can you officially take the mantle of " best self ? " <p> No . <p> Because its not about what you have in life , but what you , but a habit . -Aristotle <p> So then , best is n't a matter of have , but habits . This leads us to our next question what habits will make you your best self ? <p> Curious ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " best " habits you can have for becoming your best possible self . <p> 1 ) Ignore what others think of you . <p> I do n't  know the key to success , but the key to failure is trying to please everybody . <p> -Bill Cosby <p> Part of success is pushing forward even in the face of judgmental eyes . <p> It can be tempting to quit our aspirations .

Even the smallest bump in the road can lead us to quitting our goals , so we need to take the proper precautions to ensure that we always have a physical advantage . <p> You can start by taking time out of your day to do some exercise . Do some push ups , jogging , squats , jumping jacks Anything to give your body a reason to stay strong and keep your energy levels up . <p> The body is similar to a car in some respects , but one is the most important : if it goes unused long enough , it stops working very well <p> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably the most important thing towards being a champion . <p> -Billie Jean King <p> Do you really want to be your best ? <p> Hmmm ? <p> Then answer this question <p> " who are you , really ?

We had loud music , laughter , banter . Bad body language was punished with push-ups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customers . <h> 2 . You ca n't fake happiness <p> It 's ineffective to fake a fantastic mood . <p> You can smile . You can make jokes . You can wave your hands around . But if you 're not buzzing with excitement on the inside , there 's just something that 's a little off . <p> Once again , the law of state transference is at play .

It 's strange and draining to be around and they 'll naturally want to get away from it . <p> It 's better for you to address your bad mood , stop feeling sorry for yourself , then start again from scratch . <h> 3 . Happiness requires momentum <p> The best salesmen knew a successful day started before the first door was even touched . <p> Training was unpaid but they still attended every day . They did n't need the knowledge . They went for the momentum . <p> Our office had high energy , high fives , shouting , singing , silliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning training sessions . <p> Then , on the journey to our terrain , the managers would maintain the momentum of that energetic training environment until the moment that first door opened . <p> If that momentum remained throughout the day , it would be easy to make sales . <p> You ca n't just crawl out of bed and be ecstatic . Often , you need to slowly inflate your state . <h> 4 . Happiness is a powerful emotion <p> All people really look for in life is to feel good . Nearly all of our day-to-day decisions are based on emotions not logic . <p> It 's why we overspend when shopping . It 's why we drink too much at the weekend . It 's why we accidentally cheat on our partners . None of these are logical choices .

Go to a place where you can have some quiet a park , a coffee shop , a library , a museum . Bring a notebook and pen . Do n't  connect to the Internet , or you may end up doing nothing all day . Now , make a list of all the commitments in your life , all your relationships , all the things you do each week this is your analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish , etc . Begin the process of revising your life . You need to take a step back in order to see the way forward . <p> Create a personal mantra . I 'm a fan of Guy Kawasakis approach he advocates creating a mantra instead of a mission statement . Do that for your life : a simple statement of a couple words that you can repeat , post up on your wall , tattoo on your bicep , that will remind you what you are about and what you 're trying to do . This should encapsulate what you want to accomplish in life . If its more than 2-4 words , simplify and shorten. - <p> Set one goal for this year . This is a tough one , because we often have tons of goals we 'd like to accomplish . I 'm sure you could come up with 10 right now . But I can tell you from experience that 10 is too many , and if you try to do all of them , you will never get them done . The key to accomplishing a goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with more than one goal at a time . In the end , you have no focus at all . The solution : choose just one longer-term goal to accomplish this year . Then , take a task that will move the goal forward that you can accomplish this week ( or within the next couple of weeks ) . Make that one task your complete focus . When its done , choose a second short-term goal to focus on , and so on , until your yearly goal is accomplished . Repeat indefinitely. - <p> Identify the essentials . What things , commitments , people , activities are essential in your life ? Make a list , and eliminate the things that are not incredibly essential . These should be the most important things in your life the things you would want around if nothing else were there . The things youd like to spend more time doing if you could. - <p> Eliminate the rest . Now identify everything else in your life that does n't  make your short list . And begin to eliminate them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  like doing ? Get out of it , because its stopping you from spending time on what 's important . Some things may be very difficult to eliminate , but trust me its possible . You control your life . You can change it. - <p> Start small . The mistake a lot of people make when trying to change their lives is being too ambitious . I know I 've been there many times . We think we can do more than we actually can . Instead , start with a really easy and small goal . Something you know you will accomplish . And then achieve it . For example , if you want to get into shape , instead of trying to work out an hour a day , try just 10-15 minutes for the first week . That might sound too easy , but its best to start small . Then , when you 're successful , you can build upon that feeling of success to get more successes . Take baby steps , and you 'll get there. - <p> Make a commitment . The problem often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other person , that were going to do something . That 's no commitment at all , and we are not accountable to anyone but ourselves . Well , I 'm here to tell you that being accountable to ourselves is very difficult because we tend to get lax and let ourselves off the hook and then feel guilty about it afterward . Instead , commit yourself big tell the world about it . Join an online forum , or send an email to everyone you know , or put it on your blog . Announce your goal ( and again , make sure its achievable or you might fail ) and then report in regularly , so you are accountable . Be sure to tell people to ask you about it , so you cant get away with not doing it. - <p> Find inspiration . One of the best ways to start positive life changes is to find someone else who 's doing it or has done it . You can find great inspiration in people on the Internet , on forums or blogs , in books , in your daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can , and emulate them . Inspiration can take you a long way. - <p> Try exercise . Often getting ourselves active can be a great way to get us doing things in other parts of our lives . It makes us feel good , alive , active , productive . It releases stress and gives us time to think . We start to become more fit and confident and happier . To start exercise , again , start small . Try to do a little every day , even if its just for 10 minutes . If you can do it every day , you will have a habit , and it will lead to better and greater things. - <p> Think positive . This was perhaps the most important change I made , and it led to many other positive changes exercise , eating healthy , organization , productivity , waking early , getting my finances in order . But it all started with learning to think positive . I squash negative thoughts like a bug , and replace them with positive thoughts . Its trite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now . We often tell ourselves that were going to do something but not today . Were going to start exercising , or getting organized but not right now . Well , its now or never . Start changing your life today , even if its just something small . If you do n't  start now , you 'll keep putting it off . And then get into the habit of telling yourself , " Do it now ! " And then do it now whether its something you 've been putting off , or something you really need to do , just do it now. - <p> Make time for yourself . One of the most important things you can do to start changing your life is to make a regular time that you spend with yourself . An hour a day is ideal . This could be time when you exercise , or read , or meditate , or write , or just take a quiet walk through nature . Whatever you do , spend it on yourself . Use part of this time to think about your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the progress you 've made so far . Celebrate your successes , and learn from your failures . <p> Written for Dumblittleman.com on 07/10/2007 by Leo Babauta and republished on 1/17/11 .

All that thinking and blog-hopping must 've burnt up absolute VATS of calories ! <p> Besides , everyone knows you ca n't beat the 3pm cravings . It 's a known fact that mid-afternoon is munchie time . So you might as well just give in . Right ? <p> Of course there is another way of looking at it " and it 's just a thought , mind you . But maybe , just maybe , I can show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster lurking inside of you . And who knows ? You just could save yourself the calories , the guilt-trip , and the buck or two you outlay at the vending machine every day . Worth giving a go ? <p> Craving Buster # 1 : Eat Breakfast . Ground-breaking advice , is n't it ? But when it comes to eating well and feeling great , the simple stuff really does work . And I know , I know " you do n't have time . You have to leave the house before dawn as it is ! And you have the kids ' lunches to organize ! Plus you have a morning meeting the second you walk through the door ! <p> The only problem with this is that your body wo n't forgive you for having a busy life " it 'll punish you . Afternoon and evening cravings are nothing more than an urgent signal for nutrition , a sign that you 've left things too late when it comes to quality food intake for the day . I do n't have to tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a source of instant energy . Shame that it causes weight gain and a host of health problems . Not to mention an annoying desire for more of the darn stuff ! <p> The truth is that if you have n't laid a good foundation early in the day then you 're setting yourself up for disaster . In fact , regularly skipping breakfast is directly linked to your risk of obesity . I 'd say that 's worth getting up 10 minutes earlier for , would n't you ? <p> Craving Buster # 2 : Food Matters When it comes to laying a good foundation I think we both know that a bagel and a large'n'syrupy Starbucks is not really what I 'm talking about . The food choices you make at any of your main meals play a huge part in your behaviors and energy throughout the rest of the day , and breakfast is of particular importance. - <p> According to Charles Poliquin , creator of the BioSIgnature hormone assessment system , and coach to Olympic gold medal holders in over 10 different sports , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stimulate your natural detoxification pathways . This not only keeps you nice and clean on the inside , it ensures you get that metabolic kick-start first thing in the morning . So why leave something so important until lunchtime or even later ? <p> When it comes to breakfast , it 's important to include some protein along with some good fat . Not only will this keep you full far closer to the lunch hour , I guarantee you 'll notice a reduction in cravings come mid-afternoon . My favorite choices are poached or boiled eggs with spinach , mushrooms , and avocado . If you 're an oats or cereal person , try adding a soft-boiled egg on the side . You 'll be amazed how this simple addition dramatically changes your satisfaction levels over the day . Organic full-fat yogurts are also a good breakfast choice , but try to add fresh fruit rather than buying the flavored versions , which are typically full of sugar . <p> Craving Buster #3 : Manage Your Stress And Get Happy Did you know that chronic stress is directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just effective advertising that keeps leading you back to that candy machine ! - <p> The truth is that your gut instinct is always to ensure survival . Seeing as stress is a reaction that evolved to help us deal with life-threatening situations ( such as war or lack of food ) , it makes sense that it programs us to eat . What better way to up your chances of survival than to have you stock up on calories ? ! The scary thing is that your stress response is so effective that it actually starts up just at the thought of stress . And it 's not as though you start reaching for the green vegetables . Quite the opposite , in fact , because stress causes an instant need ' for high-sugar and high-fat foods . Carbohydrates and sugars have the added benefit of causing serotonin ( the feel-good hormone ) to be released into your bloodstream , which is one reason why sugar binges tend to incite the desire for yet more sugar . <p> With all that in mind I 'd say you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Managing the stress of an endlessly busy life is no easy task , but " like anything " it 's one you can achieve if you invest regular effort and thought . Why not start with just 5 minutes for yourself today ? It could be as simple as taking your morning coffee outside and leaving your cell phone behind . <p> Craving Buster #4 " Get Happy Managing stress is all very well ( and if you manage to meet that goal every day then you 're a better person than I am ) but it does n't necessarily go hand-in-hand with making you feel any better , does it ? - <p> This is particularly relevant given that there 's absolutely stacks of studies showing that junk food cravings are an unavoidable response to negative emotions and poor moods . In theory this is easily fixed ( Smile ! Dance around ! Act happy and you 'll be happy ! ) , but the truth is it 's just not that simple . <p> Low moods are often a combination of two things . Firstly , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ca n't escape . And secondly , they 're a response to poor dietary and lifestyle habits . When you do n't take time out for yourself , when you forget what home-cooked food tastes like , and when exercise just seems like a long-ago dream then you really are setting yourself up for a tough ride emotionally . It takes quality nutrition to build hormones , and it 's your hormones that control your moods . Exercise , sleep , and waking relaxation all play a part as well . So you can imagine how easily a busy life and poor diet leads to a cycle of negative thinking and the constant need for instant gratification . Food cravings are a common outcome of this pattern , and can be difficult to break . Especially if you see the food as a treat , as something you 've earned for having a tough day . <p> One of the simplest ways I 've found to brighten your day and turn a bad mood is to take action in a meaningful way . If you can get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least achieved one important thing , then you can go to bed feeling good about yourself . Do this day after day for enough days and you 'll spark a chain-reaction of higher-quality living . It does n't have to be something huge either . It could be a phone call to a loved one , 10 minutes of journaling or study , a donation to a charity , lending a helping hand to someone who needs it , a long-awaited investment in your health and fitness , or anything at all that puts a smile on your face or a sense of achievement in your mind . <p> Why not schedule these meaningful tasks for 3pm ? It just might be an effective distraction technique ! <p> Craving Buster #5 : Give In To Temptation " But Do It Right So far I 've given you some tried and tested advice for offsetting cravings before they have even a chance of snaring you . But what about those occasions when all else fails and you simply can not stop picturing temptation at every turn ? We both know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for . Willpower can only get you so far and whether your cravings are truly physical or they 're just in your head , chances are they 're only going to get worse until your body gets what it needs . But guess what ? Sometimes it 's okay to give in . Just do it consciously . Make it a choice . And heck " if you 're going to go ahead and indulge , you may as well do it properly and enjoy the true satisfaction of real food. - <p> I see nothing wrong with the occasional instant energy of naughty processed foods , but it sure is n't a great recipe for everyday health . From now on , nine times out of ten when you decide to give in , I want you to start thinking high-class indulgence . None of that cheap'n'nasty sugar that leaves you feeling bad but still wanting more . Try indulging with a small piece of quality cheese , some avocado with sea salt on thinly sliced sourdough , or some natural nut butter with celery sticks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're goal is still beating sugar-cravings . If you do choose something sweet , why not try some fresh berries or other seasonal fruit . Combine it with some organic dark chocolate and you 'll really be living . The best part is that all of these treats are actually good for you ! It 's a myth that cravings can only be satiated with junk food . <p> From here on out the choice is yours . You have the knowledge and you now know what it takes . The 3pm slump might be a given in most workplaces , but it does n't have to suck you in every time . And would n't it be a great feeling to cruise right through the afternoon and into the evening ahead without even thinking about sweet relief ?

@@2098749 <h> How Does Rent To Own Work ? <p> In the United States , financing the acquisition of residential real estate almost always involves taking out a mortgage . It is not uncommon for American home buyers to go through various mortgages throughout their lifetimes and never consider alternative methods of real estate financing such as rent-to-own . <p> Few home buyers consider rent-to-own contracts because of the great influence that the mortgage market has on the real estate industry of the U.S. Lease purchase or lease option contracts put off closing on a mortgage for a while , and this is not in the best interest of the home lending industry . <p> It is important to note that rent-to-own contracts in the U.S. are not like owner-financing arrangements in Europe and Latin America , whereby sellers act as mortgage bankers and collect payments from the buyers , who may also be tenants .

@@2098757 <h> 25 everyday things I 'm doing to Save Money <p> Ever since starting Dumb Little Man , Jay has gone out of his way to elaborate on the ways I am tossing money in the garbage . He asked me to put together a list of the things my wife blew money on , he then asked her to do the same for me . We combined lists and are challenging ourselves to make some changes in the baby-steps process to frugal living . <p> Here is the list and and now we have copies on the fridge and in our cars . I was surprised that we came up with 25 things to get rid of . We certainly have some work to do . <p> 1 . Razor Blades : Come on , you pay 12 bucks for 3 blades . Thats nuts . I asked my in-laws for an electric razor for my birthday ( which is next week ) . It may not be as close a shave , but I 'm shaving for free . <p> 2 . My fitness membership : $80 per month for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is getting canceled . I will just take a walk if I ever decide to be physically active as opposed to sitting in front of a PC all day . <p> 3 . Parking in the city : on a huge sign " PARKING SPECIAL , $17.00 FOR THE FIRST 90 MINUTES " . That 's the special ? I do n't  feel very special . Actually , I feel like I am getting taken advantage of . Why do n't  I get a super-special discount if I am back in 30 minutes ? No solution for this one yet but instead of parking here for convenience , I will at least look around for a metered spot . <p> 4 . Food I do n't  eat : Let 's say you want some bananas . You go to the store and they have bundles of 9 bananas and you buy all 9 . You know you are only eating 3 of those things before they brown-out . I am going to start taking off 3 and leaving the 6 others behind . I do n't  know why this never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just found out you can buy half dozens . <p> 5 . ATM Fees : $1.00-2.50 per transaction is hitting me for $15-$20 each month . From now on , each weekend I am going to my bank and getting out enough money for the week . There is no reason that I cant plan this a little better . <p> 6 . Tips:This should not be automatic . If the server was terrible , there should be no tip . If they did their job to your expectations , tip 15% . If they clearly went above the call of duty , maybe go to 20% but tipping $5.00 on a $16 check is too much . Tough part is bringing yourself to not leave a tip I feel bad . <p> 7 . The Paper : My recycling bin each week is full of unopened newspapers . There is just no time to read them and I get most of my news online anyway . Sorry Chicago Tribune , you have to get cut . <p> 8 . Valet Parking : Although I always tell myself to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paying the $3 fee and the $2 tip , I am usually running late . Somehow in my feeble mind , I find it acceptable to pay that $5 just to get to my destination sixty seconds faster . <p> 9 . Dry Cleaning clean shirts : So I wear a shirt and then toss it in the closet on the floor even though its totally clean . After a few weeks , I pick them all up and go to the dry cleaner where we proceed to pay $1.50 to clean and press a shirt that 's already clean . I am not worried about the $1.50 , its multiplying it by 10-15 per month that adds up . <p> 10 . Convenience Charges : If we pay our homeowners insurance bill annually ( all at one time ) there is no fee .

We need to start filling up in our lower tax home-county before hitting the road . <p> 13 . Toys for the cat : My wife insists on getting a new cat toy everytime she goes grocery shopping . We honestly have a large tupperware storage bin full of stupid cat toys . The cat does n't  even play with them ! This is a complete waste of money . <p> 14 . Printer ink : When my red ink is out , I have to get an entirely new cartridge for $35.00 . Damn you HP . With all of the photo printing , this is getting expensive . The only solution here that I can think of is those refilling stations . I 'd be curious to hear if anyones used these and if there is a difference in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : So if I do n't  have a Dominicks Fresh Values card , my eggs cost $4 instead of $1.50 and a frozen pizza is n't the normal $3.00 , its $6.50 .

Delivery Fees : I do n't  plan on ordering many pizzas under my new budget , but if I do , we have to watch the " Delivery Charge " on your ticket . The driver usually gets to keep that + whatever tip you give . I fall for this every time because the only thing on my mind is getting rid of this guy so I can eat some Pepperoni . <p> 17 . Packing food : This one just happened , I took my daughter to a carnival last weekend and spent $25 on food . There is NO reason that I do n't  start packing lunches and planning ahead . This would hold true for movie theater food , bowling alley food or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to limit this to one or two per month . As it stands now , I am Tivo-ing 2 per week and I rarely watch them . Half of them get overwritten with my wifes Oprah recordings or some cartoon network stuff for the kids . <p> 19 . A/C : I need to install one of those programmable thermostats . We have the A/C set at 72 degrees whether we are home or not and the cat does n't  appreciate it . I am not sure what kind of decrease we will see in our electric bill but it has to be something . <p> 20 . Lights : This one is probably over the edge but I really thought a lot about my list here . Why do I need all of these lights in the bathroom ? I actually unscrewed half of them and can barely notice a difference . These bathroom lights are the ones generally left on all day because the kids or someone forgets to turn them off . ( see pic ) <p> 21 . Debit Card stays home : This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debit card at home . When I have to run to the store , I can easily use cash and generally do . However , my problem is that I pass a Dunkin Donuts or a McDonalds every 4 blocks and the temptation to get some coffee or a burger is just to much for me . If I donbt have a way to pay for it , I cant buy it . <p> 22 . Batteries : It occurred to me that 90% of the batteries I buy for the kids toys are not purchased because they played with the toys quietly for hour on end , its because they forgot to turn the toy off . On Day 3 , the batteries are dead . I am making the switch to rechargeables . It will cost a little more now but I have to believe I will come out ahead having 2 kids and a ridiculous amount of toys . <p> 23 . Research : I am going to look online for any non-food purchase that 's over $25 . <p> 24 . Biking It : I work 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bike there at least once per week . That 's a savings of like $6 roundtrip or $24/month . <p> 25 . The weekly menu : On Sunday night , we are going to plan the dinner menu for the week . We tend to wait until the last minute when fast food becomes the best option . Grilled Cheese Night , Breakfast night , grill night , etc . <p> We tried to stay away from coupon cutting and things like that because its not going to happen , not yet . Besides , I believe we would look at coupons as a reason to buy and using coupons to buy things that you do n't  need defeats the purpose . <h> 3 COMMENTS <p> My wife and I are expecting our first baby soon , and in anticipation of this ( and the fact that she 's staying home , thus nearly halving our income ) we 've been doing some massive cost-cutting . From that experience , here are my tips : Ditch cable . We have a 5-at-a-time netflix plan and use the heck out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely see advertisements and can practically feel my iq rising . Stop eating out . We were spending over twice as much per month on restaurant food as we were on groceries , and most of the groceries we did buy were pre-packaged heat-and-eat things . It is still a bit difficult to make full meals while were working , but once she 's home well be eating better food for less money . At the moment we still eat out occasionally , but are *much* more concious of price . Turn it off . Whenever our home entertainment center / desktop computer / other high-energy items are n't  in use I turn them off at the power strip . TVs , monitors , receivers , etc all draw power even when they 're not in use , and just by doing this our power bill has noticably dropped . Used rocks . I 'm a gamer , and previously was paying full price for new games the moment they came out . Now I wait a few months and buy either older games ( which can be discounted as much as 50% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure where you live , but if they have a Half Priced Books or similar nearby check there for deeply discounted stuff . Craigslist and eBay should also be your friends . A lot of the other suggestions are also great , particularly the library the more you use it , the more funding they can request . It does n't  sound to me like you 're in a dire situation and need to massively slash your spending to survive , but if you are then re-prioratizing is in order . Cut out any vices ( they 're pretty much all expensive ) , be a hawk for anything free or discounted , and eliminate all but the necessities . Were now banking a *lot* of money every month , and while our activities have changed , our quality of life has n't  suffered a bit . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Well , that one solution does n't  exist , but with a combination of strategies , you can get to where you want to be . <p> Now , none of these tips will turn your life around . But they can make a big difference , and when used together , your work life might just be enjoyable , productive , low-stress and high fun . And these tips wo n't work for everyone . They 're not meant to be used as a step-by-step guide . Its a list of strategies that work choose your favorites and give them a try . <p> One goal . Set a single goal that you want to accomplish this year I know that we probably want to do 12 goals , but its too difficult to maintain your focus on more than one goal , and it diffuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months , and then a single 3-6 month goal that will lead to your 12-month goal . Then choose something you can accomplish within the next 1-2 weeks that will lead to the 3-6 month goal . Now focus on that short-term goal , giving it all your energy , and when its achieved , set your next short-term goal until you 've accomplished your medium-term goal. - <p> Find your passion . All the rest of these tips are just window dressing if you find work you 're passionate about . If you 're not in a job you love , start your quest to find that job now . You do n't  need to quit your current job right away , but start doing some research on the web , think about what you 're really interested in , talk to others who are doing what you want to do . Make this your one goal for this year , and it could turn out to be your best year ever. - <p> Work from home . This is not a miracle solution , but its something many people would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it every day . Is it something you want to do ? Give it some thought , and find a solution that works for you . You could telecommute for your current job plan your pitch to your boss today , making sure to focus on how it will benefit your company . Or you could find another job that allows you to work from home even if the pay is a little less at first , you will have reduced costs from not having to commute or eat lunch at work or buy expensive work clothes , and you will also have increased satisfaction . <p> Come in early . If telecommuting is n't your thing , try getting to work 30-60 minutes before the rest of the crowd . Or even more . This might require you to learn to wake up early , but the benefits are many : you skip the morning traffic , you can work without distractions until the rest of your coworkers come in , you can get a jump start on your day , you can be ahead of the crowd and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to start your work day and to become more productive. - <p> Work 4 days . If you can control your work schedule ( or can convince your boss to change it ) , try working fewer days . Working four days a week not only gives you an additional day off , but it forces you to be more productive in the days you do work . Think about it : if you knew that you had to get your work done by the end of Thursday , you will focus more on what really needs to get done , and goof off less too . What would you do less ? Email ? Read stuff on the Internet ? Chat ? Play solitaire ? Those unimportant things fade away when your time is limited. - <p> Work 6-hour days . Same concept as above , but reconfigured . Personally , I 'd choose the 4-day workweek , but that cant work for everyone . Get in early and leave even earlier imagine the 7 a.m. -1 p.m. work day . With focus , it can be done. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you are a full-time employee somewhere , it might be . But you could either 1 ) telecommute , and get your work done in fewer hours ; or 2 ) work for yourself . Now , I 'll admit that these options wo n't work for everyone , but they can be done . And I 'll also admit that in working for yourself , you tend to work more hours , not fewer . But if you limit your hours to 20 , it will force you to focus in the same what that working four days a week does . And if you focus on only those tasks that are truly important ( see next item ) , you can get a lot done in 20 hours a week. - <p> MITs . Each day , make a list with only three items : the three Most Important Tasks you want to accomplish today . Make at least one of them related to your One Goal . The others might be something you 've been procrastinating on , or a big project that 's due today , or something similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will gain you longer-term recognition or income . Now focus on these , making sure to accomplish them . Its best to do your MITs first thing in the morning , before you get interrupted by a bunch of other things . If you do only three things today ( you could choose more or less than three MITs , but I 've found that three works for me ) , make it your MITs. - <p> Batch process . There are usually a bunch of smaller tasks that we have to do that are n't  that important . Email , paperwork , phone calls , things like that . Instead of doing those little things throughout the day , giving you busywork to interrupt and distract you from your important tasks , batch them together and do them at one set time each day . Write these tasks down on a small list , and with an hour left in your work day ( or whatever works for you ) , start processing them as quickly as possible , ticking them off your list. - <p> Telecommute 1 day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let you work completely from home , try one day a week . You could start out by calling in sick , but still getting a lot done from home . Or tell him you want to give it a try , just for one day this week , because you think it will make you more productive . <p> Freelance as a 2nd job . This is something I do , and I earn an extra $2,000 a month doing it . Its extra work , but it helps me to pay the bills ( and pay off debt and save ) . Eventually , if you get good at the freelancing gig , you could make it your full-time work . To do this as a second job , set aside some time each day for freelance work . Ive used early mornings ( I get up an hour earlier and do one assignment ) , my lunch hour , work time ( with permission ) , or evenings . If you could do 1-2 assignments a day , you will be making a decent extra income , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Brown bag it . This is n't life-changing , but I take my lunch to work every day leftovers or a sandwich , usually , with snacks such as fruits on the side . How does this help ? Well , it saves me a lot of money ( a few thousand a year ) and it allows me to work through lunch , giving me time for that freelancing gig I talked about above or perhaps allowing you to leave work early . <p> Cycle to work . Again , not necessarily life-changing , but if you can commute even just a couple times a week by bike , you will save money on gas , reduce the stress of rush-hour traffic , and get your daily exercise done at the same time . A shower at work ( or at a nearby gym ) helps make this easier . <p> Take high-profile projects . If you just take the grunt work , your boss might or might not appreciate it , but it certainly wo n't make you a star and you wo n't go very far . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make a name for both you and your company . If there are n't  any available , make your own . Be sure you can do them well , but if you do , these projects will have a huge impact on your life . The tasks on these projects should be your MITs every day . If you take on high-impact projects , you can be more productive working a half day than if you worked 10 hours a day on tasks that wo n't matter next week . <p> Automate your business . If you have your own business , or set one up on the side , find ways to make it automated as much as possible . Everything can be outsourced , from manufacturing to mailing to advertising to taking orders to customer support to credit card processing . Put your business front online , with online ordering , and give your outsourcers the ability to make decisions ( with certain limits , following rules you set ) without your approval , removing yourself from the bottleneck . If its completely automated , your business will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Now all you have to do is check now and then to make sure things are running smoothly , and make sure your money is being deposited in your bank account . Nice . <p> Bank your raise . If you get a raise ( and if you have n't in awhile , you need to make it happen by taking on high-profile projects and then asking for the raise ) , do n't  increase your spending . Take the raise and put the entire amount in the bank , making it automatically deducted from your paycheck or checking account and sent to a high-interest online savings account . Does n't  increase your productivity , but it can increase your financial stability . <p> Clear your desk . A messy desk might be the sign of a creative mind , but in my experience ( I 've tried both messy and now clean desks ) , having a desk that 's clean is much more calming , much more productive , and more organized . Most importantly , it reduces visual clutter and allows you to focus on the task at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a chunk of time , but its worth it : take all your papers ( everything ! ) and put them in your inbox , or in a pile if they do n't  fit . Now process through them , one at a time , from top to bottom , filing , acting upon , delegating , trashing each document or noting tasks on a to-do list for later ( and filing the to-be-acted-upon documents in an action folder ) . Remove other knick knacks and put any office supplies or tools in a drawer ( and empty out your drawers while you 're at it ) . From here on out , everything goes in your inbox , and you process it to empty every day using the steps outlined here . <p> Granularize . If a project or task seems too intimidating , split it into smaller tasks , and just focus on the first task you need to do . For example , instead of " Research report " , just find three sources on the Internet . You can read each of these sources and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of thinking you need to do everything yourself . Relinquish control and learn to trust others . If you do n't  think a person can handle a task , take the time to train him to do so . It will save you tons of time and headaches later . And by delegating , you empower others while shrinking your to-do list , leaving you to focus on what 's really important . <p> Eliminate . Your to-do list is a mile long . You 'll never be able to do all those things . Cut it in half by crossing out stuff that does n't  really need to be done , or delegating others . And from that list , just choose the three most important things that you need to do today . Get in the habit of eliminating as many of the tasks and processes you normally do as possible , and your work life will be greatly simplified. - <p> Clear distractions . In addition to clearing your desk , you can allow yourself to focus more by eliminating all distractions : email or IM alerts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Internet ) , phones , visual clutter around you or on your walls . Wear headphones so your coworkers interrupt you less , or let them know that you 're not available right now . Focus more , and you 'll get more done. - <p> Kill meetings . One of the biggest time-wasters in our work lives . Most of the time , a meeting could have been accomplished with an email or a phone call . Beg out of meetings ( or if you 're the boss , eliminate them ) by claiming you have a project due that you need to work on . Then be very productive during the time you would be at the meeting , and show your boss how much you got done. - <p> Email once a day . Do n't  do email throughout the day . Set one time during the day to process email , then crank through it , getting your inbox to empty ( use the same steps in " clear your desk " above ) . If you check email throughout the day , you are allowing yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sends you a request . And by sending out emails all day , you are generating even more responses in return , compounding the problem . Batch process , and you will get a lot more done . Same applies to reading your RSS feeds and checking your blog stats and reading your forums . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098769 <h> How to Manage Your Ego So You Can Reach Your Full Potential <p> The ego is one of most self-destructive mechanisms of a persons character and his or her abilities . In fact if you look at some people whove achieved massive success only to lose it all at the end of their lives , its almost always a function of the ego that results in this . As strange as the following examples might be , drug dealers , and gangsters in the movies are blatant examples of people whose egos have ruined their success . There are two characters that really exemplify this : George Jung ( Johnny Depp in the movie Blow ) and Frank Lucas ( Denzel Washington in the movie American Gangster ) . <p> If you have seen the movie Blow , you know that the life of the main character is driven by the desire to never to be poor after growing up in financial dire straits . As a result he chooses a career as a drug dealer . Early in the movie , he becomes quite successful , ending up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost everything you think would be enough in life . In fact every single time I watch this movie , I think " If he had just quit while he was ahead , then imagine how different his life would have turned out . " But , greed , and perhaps the desire to keep proving to himself that he was capable of more , ultimately his ego , led him to 60 years in prison . <p> The character of Frank Lucas ( Denzel Washington in American Gangster ) is another example of how ego got the best of somebody who could have quit while he was ahead . Although he was off to a bad start from the get go , even more so than George Jung , there comes a turning point in the movie when the ego of Frank Lucas takes over . In the desire to to keep expanding his operation Frank starts to partner with other people and eventually attracts the attention of the police . What 's interesting to note however is that there is a point in the movie where he acknowledges the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The loudest person in the room is the weakest . " Yet , he still falls victim to his own ego . <p> 6 signs that you are ego driven <p> Concern with Approval of others In his book Manifest Your Destiny , Wayne Dyer mentions that there are three tenets of self actualizing people according to Maslows hierarchy of needs . One of those is that you should be independent of the good opinion of other people . It s easier said than done , but comes with a sense of freedom and liberation that allows you to truly shine . Who you are independent of the good opinion of other people is the most authentic person you will ever be . This is the most attractive quality in anybody , in a world where people are overly concerned with looking good in front of others . Ironically I learned this in a business school class and of all places , the corporate world may seem like a strange place to not concern yourself with the good opinion of others . But if you come from a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more well liked by your corporate peers . Self actualization is at the top of the Maslow hierarchy and most leaders are self actualized . <p> Fear of asking for help If you are afraid to ask for help , or you do n't  want to ask for help because you want all the credit , then your ego is driving you . I made this mistake a few years back when I attempted to launch a job web site for MBA students . In my own bad judgment , I decided to take on the project alone after discussing it with some classmates . The desire to get ahead quickly and launch the site was the work of my ego . Ultimately , it ended up being a failure . If my ego had n't  gotten in the way , and I had worked with the other students , I would have saved a few friendships and the site might have succeeded . <p> Comparing and Competing People who are driven by ego often fall victim to what I call the comparative and competitive disadvantage . Comparing yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms . Its a perpetual losing battle because there will always be somebody better and always somebody worse than you are . Even if you are the best in the world at what you do somebody will always be right on your tail . If you keep seeing your life as a competition with those around you , then you will continually be dissatisfied and the ego will drive your life . <p> The constant need for more Greed is also a function of the ego . I think if there 's anything our movie characters could teach us , is that there comes a point where you do have everything you could possibly want , and getting more just for the sake of having it is an exercise in futility . <p> Lack of presence Ego driven people continually live in the past and always plan for the future . They never live in the moment . They are always thinking of the next great phase of their life , even when this one is perfect . By forgetting to enjoy the present , we set ourselves up to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be right This is another one of the egos most destructive functions . People who have a need to continually be right are headed for the ultimate downfall . These kinds of people will often get far in life because of their persistence and aggressiveness . But , these are also the people that will fail when they are on the brink of MASSIVE success . Their need to be right will be their downfall and years of hard work can be destroyed in minutes when this portion of the ego takes over . Leaders with this attitude ultimately alienate all those work for them , and eventually stop receiving the kind of input that can propel them forward because they are so adamant about being right . <p> When you can learn to let go of the ego , the level of success and fulfillment you will achieve will be dramatic . <p> Only with your ego in check will you have the ability to reach your full potential . <p> Written on 9/14/2009 by Srinivas Rao .

That 's why the first thing you should probably do is stop reading this article , because it will influence your mind . However , if you do choose to keep reading , you 're going to discover the power of personal freedom . <p> In this life I am free . How is that possible ? How can that be when the laws of government and gravity , and the need for food , love , and oxygen bind me ? The freedom lives in a place called my mind boy does n't  that sound weird ? <p> " Every human has four endowments- self awareness , conscience , independent will and creative imagination . These give us the ultimate human freedom The power to choose , to respond , to change . " Stephen R. Covey <p> Free Yourself In Seven Ways <p> 1 . Freedom from food . Delectable pastries , succulent flavors , and savory foods of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't  taste so good , but are necessary for our survival , induce us into a slave-like dependence . It does n't  have to be so . <p> Solution : Great men by the likes of Gandhi and Buddha were masters of the fast . They would be able to go days , weeks , and even months without food . One time , Gandhi changed the course of peace in India , and the history of the world as we know it , because his mind allowed his body to endure a fast . He was free . 2 . Freedom from money . Clothes , cars , houses , jewelry , and gadgets are all interesting little items that people are willing to directly exchange for their freedom . Credit cards expedite this process by holding us accountable , and thus slaves , to the money that we 've spend before we had . <p> Solution : Buy only that which is essential . Better yet , live off of the land . When you stop desiring and consuming , and you start living and producing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use it , instead of it using you . Being a valuable person , and creating value for the world will take you far . 3 . Freedom from government.They can control our education system , our taxes , and our economy , but it is our choice if we hand our freedom over to them our government . Solution : One solution would be not to vote , but it would be more useful if it were a unanimous decision . One in which each person decided to do what 's right , live in harmony , peace , and use their natural-born-morals to govern themselves . Another solution ? Let your voice be heard . The written word is more powerful than any government in the land . <p> 4 . Freedom from love.Love can really put a choke hold on an individual . Most people have experienced , or have seen a clingy relationship in their life . One where one person " can not live " without the other . Bards have sung songs as such , and epic battles have been fought for such love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let ourselves truly experience and accept it . It is as natural as drinking water , and when we allow ourselves to love another human being , truly , and to love ourselves , truly , we disregard our capability to be a slave to love . Instead , we become a vehicle of love , and love itself . <p> 5 . Freedom from guilt . This powerful emotion can lead us to do just about anything . Guilt has been known to create marriages and break them . Seen to make people overeat , do drugs , and become violent . In the worst of times man has taken his own life due to feelings of guilt . <p> Solution : Its going to take you feeling the pain of the guilt , fully embracing it , and then letting it go in order to rip of the shackles of this emotion . Its helpful to concentrate on what you can do right now , versus what has happened and what is not an option for you . <p> 6 . Freedom from oxygen . The need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dependence on it , is based on the concept that we are afraid to die . Death is an integral , unavoidable , and lasting part of our life cycle . <p> Solution : Freedom comes when we embrace that death will come . Accept it , and live our life to the fullest while it is still within our ability to do so . <p> 7 . Freedom from ignorance . Perhaps the worst restraints that we can experience in life are those imposed on us by our own mind . The only thing holding us back in life , really , is that which we know . Those opinions and viewpoints that we have established at some moment define how we think and the methods that we use to interpret what we experience . <p> Solution : Educate yourself . Pick up as many books as you can , read them all , and do n't  believe a word of it . <p> " Man is free at the moment he wishes to be . " Voltaire <p> Freedom : Is it practical ? <p> Is freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of society , our consumerist group-think collective . Society would have trained you to think that what I am saying is wrong , ludicrous , or even disgusting . <p> Such is expected . By being a mindless drone of the collective , one is suppressing their ability to think freely , consciously , and individually . That 's fine , I accept that for you , and you can too . However , if you choose to be a proactive person of freedom , liberty , and justice both for yourself and for all then perhaps putting your self-thinking-cap on will be the greatest gift you can ever give yourself . <p> " To know how to free oneself is nothing ; the arduous thing is to know what to do with ones freedom " Andre Gide <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

@@2098775 <h> 10 Ways to Simplify and Eliminate Waste in Your Life <p> Everyone gets too busy . They pile up their tasks , responsibilities and often over-promise while struggling to maintain any kind of work life balance . Its a hectic lifestyle that many lead and while I 've written some articles on how to simplify your life and mind to get around this , there are other ways to help address this problem with the work and tasks you face . <p> I learned a key principle while going through a training course for work and while reading Lean Thinking . The idea is to identify and eliminate waste . This can apply not only in a production environment like the book is targeted for , but in life in general . There is so much going on around us every day we need to really strive to find and eliminate the waste that consumes our valuable time in life . <p> Finding Waste When I first read the book , I did n't  connect the dots . Most people understand that creating waste in a production environment results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanded outside of work , I saw areas of waste in everything . Some of the areas I quickly identified are : <p> Repetitive communication in multiple formats <p> Entry of data or documents in multiple locations/formats <p> Dependencies between people waiting for each other <p> Tools that make development slower or difficult <p> The workplace environment with policies / procedures that exist but are not always useful <p> Rework to fix problems caused internally <p> Rewrites of software due to unexpected changes <p> Failed attempts to solve a problem <p> The list could carry on for a long time in nearly everything we do . Anyone can find waste in life and there is always room for eliminating some of it . I 've learned a couple of areas that drastically help with finding and identifying the waste we each experience . <p> Time Analysis <p> One of the best ways I know to find waste is to spend a week recording your actions in 15 minute intervals . I learned this technique from Peter Drucker in his timeless masterpiece The Effective Executive in a process he calls the Drucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notepad for an entire week in 15 minute intervals . At the end of the week , you categorize your time spent and look at the overall time spent in each of those categories . Doing this will reveal a lot of time spent on things that do n't  really have any lasting impact or importance to you or others around you . Those are the areas of waste ! <p> Ask Others Another technique is to ask others what they think you spend most of your time on . Generally the impression you give others has some foundation so someone elses opinion on what you spend your time on is going to be fairly accurate . It may not be what you want them to see or believe , but it likely has merit from normal observation . Again , you can then classify this feedback into groups ( if you ask multiple people ) and collectively review all the things you spend your time on to see the areas that you consider to be waste . <p> Review Your Goals and Passions Look next at your goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are holding you back from those ? Everything that holds you back from what is important is potentially waste . For some people , critical thinking comes naturally so its often a lot easier to explore the areas that are getting in the way of the important things in life and work . Create a list of 10-20 things that get in the way of your goals and passions and look at which of those youd consider waste . Its quite likely that most of them are . <p> What is YOUR Life Waste Anyway ? The stuff you desire , dream for and long for are the areas you wish to experience more of . Maybe these are your adventures , travels , sports , family , friends , work , hobbies , etc . Its different for each person of course and the important items in your life are the things that are often the hardest to find time to do . All that stuff that gets in the way is waste . It can seem that daily activities are endless and that most people really do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Driving to/from work <p> Paying bills <p> Doing dishes and cleaning the house <p> Mowing the lawn and other yard work <p> Preparing meals and shopping / buying living essentials <p> Most people would agree with those areas that they do n't  have any real lasting value . More debatable areas of waste are often in our pastimes : <p> Watching TV <p> Surfing the web <p> Sleeping more than we need <p> Line ups and delays for simple things like coffee and lunch <p> Work <p> These are not considered waste for everybody but there is definitely some waste here , it just varies from person to person about how they feel about those activities . <p> All the other things in life that you HAVE to do may be areas of waste as well . Do they support some other activity that you want to do and spend more time at ? Work perhaps ? What about your lifestyle and how you manage your time to commute and look after your groceries and bills ? All that is wasteful and is worth adding to your list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was inspired to expand on this topic and build this list because of a post by Andrew Bolis from Personal Hack who wrote that the biggest productivity tip is elimination . My list however , looks specifically at the physical time factor and tasks undertaken in life that are wasteful . here 's my list : <p> 10 Ways to Eliminate Waste <p> In order to eliminate waste there are many options , some simple , some drastic . Here are a 10 areas you could easily use to eliminate waste in your life . <p> Do n't  be so Patient ! Patience is definitely a virtue and it is something that most people who know me would say I have little of . The advantage of that however is that I do n't  have the patience to wait around for things . I see it as a huge waste and is an area I 've learned to eliminate . I avoid line ups at all costs . I do n't  wait in lines for simple pleasures like a drink or lunch . I 'm not a coffee drinker but I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wasting their time ! I grocery shop late in the evening when things are not as busy and lines are shorter . I go to the bank or go shopping when places first open so I can get in and out fast without having to wait in line . If you have less patience with day to day things it is easy to find places to eliminate waste . <p> Just stop doing it ! If you have the desire , motivation and will power , you may be able to simply stop doing things you consider waste . The article that is linked covers a bit more of the how to actually do this . If you can simply decide to stop something , it is the easiest way to eliminate waste from your life . Oh , and the quickest ! <p> Make Wasteful Activities More Difficult to Do You intend to kill ( waste ) 30 minutes watching TV but instead , you get drawn in and it turns into 2 hours . To prevent this , you can purposefully make a wasteful activity more difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend less time watching TV , you can put the remote in the garage for a month , or put a wall timer on the TV that automatically shuts it off every night at a certain hour . Even unplugging the TV so you have to find the cord and plug it in to use it will help you reduce the time spend in that activity since you cant as easily do the activity mindlessly . Move your couch so it does n't  face the TV , put a barricade in place that must be moved to watch or perhaps you might want to simply get rid of one or more televisions . If you have to share one or use it only in one place that is less convenient , so you wont waste nearly as much time with it . <p> This tip works for any activity that requires some object or physical device . Pushing the power button on the remote is too simple , make it tough . <p> Be more efficient Unfortunately there are many tasks we do n't  want to do , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should look to be more efficient at them so they do n't  waste as much time . If you do a bunch of things at once , do n't  prioritize your tasks or just have a huge list of things to do , you will be switching back and forth which always add some waste . Learn to prioritize tasks and find ways to be more efficient with them and you can get done those wasteful tasks quicker . Look to find efficiencies in all your tasks. - <p> Focus on Finishing with Your Waste The last thing you want is to recycle your waste . Do n't  take on tasks and activities that are wasteful without following through and finishing them . Finish them so they are out of the way for good . If you deal with some of it , put it off and then have to revisit it , you start all over and things take more and more time to complete . Put your mind to finish with your waste and look forward to then having time made for the things you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in #5 to have focus , there are often times where your mind is on autopilot and you can easily multitask . For example , while doing house work or exercising , you could easily listen to music or audio books if those are things you enjoy and it allows you to turn time spent from be wasted to something you actually value . You can listen to audio books while driving or exercising instead of having to do that time separately and you will find even MORE time for the things you love. - <p> Reduce Your Travel Time A drastic change here would be to buy a house closer to work or change jobs so you are close to home . There are other ways to either reduce your travel time or maximize that time for other things . You could car pool or use public transit so you can multitask on your commute to work with other tasks . You could change your working hours so that traveling while traffic is light enables you to commute in less time. - <p> Take time to spiritually reflect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in prayer , meditation , or spiritual study can impact your ability to focus on what matters in life . The time spent doing this wont eliminate any other areas directly ( unless it simply replaces them ) but it will definitely give you more peace of mind and relaxation that will greatly assist you in simplifying your life and eliminating the things that are not that meaningful to you . If no time is spent thinking about your purpose and life goals , you will have a hard time identifying what is and is n't waste . Commit some time to reflect on your life and use that to eliminate the areas that do n't  fit your purpose. - <p> Find Someone else to Handle Your Waste You might have put a lot of your waste items in a must do category feeling that they are necessary even though you do n't  want to do them and would label them as waste . Well , the good news is that for what you consider waste , there is often someone out there would does n't  think that or might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is especially true with service jobs such as yard work . You do n't  have to do them yourself and there are companies and individuals who would welcome the work to take care of it for you . This is an easy way ( even though it will often cost some money ) to eliminate waste. - <p> Say NO ! The most lasting way to eliminate waste is to learn to say no . Say no to buying new stuff you do n't  need , say no to tasks you do n't  want to do , say no to your habits that kill your time ! Practice saying no to things you are comfortable eliminating and work to expand that no to other areas . If you can say no to anything that complicates and adds waste in your life , you can keep time available on the things that matter to you and to keep eliminating waste you already have . You certainly do n't  need to eliminate one area of waste and just replace it with a new one . You must be able to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are the things I find work best to eliminate waste . What are yours ? I 'd love to hear if these work for you or if you have your own tools to eliminate waste . I hope this gives you a way to look for the things you can stop doing , can say no to and I encourage you to help others learn to eliminate waste as well . <p> Mike <p> Written on 9/11/2008 by Mike King .

If you have to trudge into the office 9-5 , 5 days a week , these are some suggestions to make work less of a burden and more enjoyable . <p> Maintain Good Relationships with others : The problem with an office environment is that you have no choice of the people you work with .

If you feel there is no point to your work , you will have a permanent feeling of dissatisfaction , and it will be impossible to enjoy your time at work .

A Corporate philosophy such as this can easily create a pressured work environment for their employees . However , you should feel that it is not your responsibility to take on this stress .

@@2098786 <h> Why People Complain and What We Can Do About It <p> Know any chronic complainers ? You may want to pass this on to them and if its you , read on . <p> I think its natural for people to complain .

To expect a life without complaining ( by you or others ) is unrealistic . <p> Why we complain and what we can do about it <p> Lifes not fair . I think most of us complain because we feel things are unfair and out of our control . Why do they have so much when I have nothing ? I 've worked just as hard , saved harder and I still do n't  have as much to show for it . Its just not fair. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappy . They cant find joy in any aspect of their life . Genuinely unhappy people take to complaining to express their dissatisfaction with their life and in many situations its used as a coping mechanism as well. - <p> Jealousy Most times people wont admit to this as its a rather unbecoming trait . They may also not admit to it because they truly do n't  recognize it as jealousy . This ties in with the first point of life not being fair . The emotion that can come out of that is jealousy . When you wish you had the new car , or the new job or the high salary there is a tendency to complain , either that the other people are getting this or that you 're not. - <p> Lack of empathy . A lot of times we complain because we lack empathy for others . Think about this : You complain that someone is n't doing something " right " , they should be doing it this way because that 's what we would do if we were in that position . When we lack empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other persons place . We do n't  know the thoughts going through their head or what other complexities they are facing in their lives at that moment . <p> What can we do about it ? <p> Think before we speak . Before blurting out a complaint really give some thought to what you 're going to say . Is it a complaint for the sake of complaining ? Are you really unhappy with your situation ? Is there any benefit to expressing this view point ? If you are looking for insight from the person you 're speaking with then by all means go for it . If you 're mentioning it to spark a debate or initiate a conversation , OK . Just be aware of what you 're saying and why youre saying it and also be mindful of the person you 're speaking with . Are they rolling their eyes ? = <p> Have a plan . I find it quite irritating when people complain about their job or people they work with or how they 're bored with whatever it is they 're doing at the moment . I find it even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and what are you doing about it ? " Some people have given it some thought and others just stare blankly as if to say " Theres something I can do ? " If you 're unhappy with any situation make a plan on how you can change it . How are you going to take control and make your situation better ? You can brush up your resume and start applying to new jobs . Look at how you can possibly move within the company you 're in now . Can you go back to school or get specific training for what youd like to do ? - <p> Do n't  just moan about it do something ! <p> Change your perspective . Maybe you 're complaining because you lack empathy for someone . Change your perspective and really put yourself in their shoes ( and not just in one particular situation , but overall ) . Your thoughts , expectations and judgments may change and you may see the other person in a better light and not complain so much about how they 're handling things. - <p> A change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't  have or how we do n't  measure up . First of all we should n't spend so much time comparing ourselves to others in the first place but if you do why is always with people who have more ? Why not compare with those who are n't  as fortunate as you . Look around you and really see what you have . There are a lot of people who would love to be in your position . Which leads me to my final point <p> Be grateful . Be grateful for what you have and for what others have . Life is n't a race to see who can collect the most money , cars or other shiny objects . Ever told anyone to mind their own business ? Well same goes for you . Focus on you and what makes you happy and how you can add value to your own life . Show appreciation for all that you currently have and for what you 've been blessed with . Do n't  worry about all the other people odds are they 're looking at you and wishing for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted. - <p> When we complain its usually because were so focused on what were lacking in certain aspects of our lives . The easiest way to curb our own complaining is to focus on the positive and go with the flow . <p> Do you have any other ideas on why we tend to complain and what we can do about it to make it stop ? <p> Written on 10/25/2010 by Sherri Kruger .

@@2098789 <h> How to Get Water Out of Your Ear <p> Water in the ear can be a very irritating thing . It mostly happens to swimmers , but can occasionally happen to you when you bathe or shower . Most of the time , water in the ear is just aggravating because it tickles . However , sometimes water that is dirty , or that was entered into your ear during a severe situation like a high jump into water can cause an ear infection .

Some people who do this like to twist their hair into a towel , bun or ponytail if it is wet to keep the wet hair from dripping more water into the ear . Successful positions include turning your head upside down and shaking it like you are saying " no " , or laying on your side over a towel that is wadded up to go slightly into your ear- often if just the tip of the towel touches the water , the whole amount will wick into the towel and out of your ear . <h> Heat : <p> Placing a hot washcloth behind your ears can reduce any swelling that may be happening , and change the way the water is flowing around your ears .

@@2098793 <h> How to Leave Work at Work <p> We get lots of email at Dumb Little Man but this one really hit me because I tend to get in this rut too . <p> Jay- I love the site but I have a question ( if you do n't  have time , do n't  worry about it ) . You mentioned that you are a work-a-holic and so am I. I work close to 60 hours a week to earn enough money so that my wife can stay home with the kids . Since I am so into my work , it is hard for me to leave work at work . It seems that I am always thinking about my job and its causing an unintentional distancing between me and my family . How would you recommend that I balance the two so that I can totally focus on work , yet know how to call it a day and really enjoy my family time ? <p> So as many of you can imagine , this is a tough one and as far as I am concerned its ramifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply has to do leaving work at work . So how do you do that ? <p> Here are the things that I personally do . Without them , I swear I 'd be thinking of my job or Dumb Little Man 24+7 . <p> Change your route : What I mean by this is literally " change your route home " . If you have a bad or overly stressful day at work , take the long way home . During the first half of your journey home , turn the radio off and think about what you have to accomplish at work and how you will execute . During the second half of the drive , turn on whatever music you like , talk radio , ( whatever ) and begin the process of thinking about things outside of work . Do not think about work during the entire commute , you must separate before you get home ! <p> The boss at work does not equal the boss at home : Just because you are an important guy at work does n't  mean that you get to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you live with are not paid to take your BS . If you love them , you will treat them better than those that report to you . On the flip side of this , your being an entry-level employee at work does n't  mean that at home you can get the " power trip " your ego begs for . <p> Vent : Venting is the art of blowing your lid and we all do it . Once you get home after work and kiss the kids , give yourself a 15-minute window to let it out . You should set this up in advance with your spouse but leave the time limit at 15 minutes . During that time , they have to simply listen and let you get it out . After that , you must agree that work is over . <p> Blackberry/Laptop : Occasionally we all have to work at night or on the weekends . The key here is to set an expectation when honestly important projects arise . If you really do n't  need to work , keep the electronics off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all know you will find reasons to email people or start completing tasks . <p> Questions first : When you get home , immediately ask how your spouses day went ( AND LISTEN ) . Many times their response is enough to get you to think of family tasks and break you away from work . In addition , you will probably earn some points for engaging them in the conversation . Remember , its human nature to want to talk about yourself so resist the urge . <p> Survival : Whether you believe it or not , your company will survive without you . It is key to remember this as you choose where to spend time . If it is after hours and you have n't turned off the blackberry , you have to resist the urge to get involved in something that is n't really ultra-critical . <p> No work , no matter what : This is a tough one but at my house we practice it like a religion . On Tuesdays and Thursdays from 5-10 PM I have sworn not to do work . These nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have told co-workers that I am absolutely unavailable no matter what . If I were a CEO making 10 trillion per year perhaps this would change but I am not soIm booked . <p> 25% Rule : When I plan my days , I leave a minimum of 25% of the time open . This time is used for emergencies , task lists , etc . It is during that time that I accomplish smaller tasks that I would have reserved for off-hours . <p> Get up earlier : Do n't  be a crybaby about this one . If may sting in the beginning but if you are constantly running out of time , take time from you and not your family . As your family sleeps , you can easily get some stuff done by heading to the office early . <p> These are things I do and they are tough at times because there are constantly urgent issues arising at work . The key for me was learning how to delegate and say no when I had to . Again , its not easy but with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear what you do to really get some work/home separation .

@@2098794 <h> Top 5 Muscle Tips for a Buff Body <p> Whatever it is , there are basic fundamental principles that will get you there . With so much confusion and conflicting advice in the world of bodybuilding &amp; fitness , its time to cut through the noise by delving into the scientific fundamentals that guarantee success . <p> Here are the top 5 muscle tips to take you from fat to fit ; from scrawny to brawny . <p> Progressive Overload will Guarantee your Results . The body adapts . Its been doing it for a loooonnng time and will continue to do so forever . So how do we use this to our advantage ? Well the key is to place ever increasing demand on the body , thereby forcing it to continually adapt . If you workout with the exact same weight every session and perform the same number of repetitions , how can you expect your body to grow ? <p> " The law of progressive overload simply says that you must increase the amount of reps or the weight lifted every single workout ( or as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignite muscle growth . " <p> So , if you want bigger biceps , you must increase the weight you are curling every session or the amount of repetitions . Remember : Progressive Overload = Muscle Growth . <p> Work In The Anabolic Rep Range Rep is short for repetition . A repetition is simply the process of lifting and lowering a weight again . But is there an optimum number of reps you should perform for muscle growth ? I believe there is . <p> 8-12 reps on any given exercise will stimulate most muscle growth . Lower rep ranges of say 3-6 work well for building strength but not necessarily muscle hypertrophy ( growth ) . <p> Higher reps e.g. 15 20 can indeed stimulate muscle growth but it is far from optimal . In higher rep ranges , type 1 ( slow twitch ) muscle fibers are mostly stimulated which can grow in diameter but do so to a lesser extent than type 2A and 2B fibers . Type 2A and 2B fibers will grow more in response to a rep range of 8 12 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this position on optimal reps as does Tom Venuto who states , <p> " The advantage of the 8-12 rep range is that you get maximal hypertrophy " . <p> Increase the amount of protein in your diet . Muscle = protein . In order for muscle tissue to repair itself after your weight-training sessions it needs an abundance of protein . Some beginners do n't  take enough protein and some more experienced guys take ridiculously extreme amounts of protein.So how much protein is enough to supply those hungry muscles ? Use the following formula for the most accurate daily protein requirements . <p> Lean Mass Weight ( Kg ) x 2.75 = Daily Protein Requirement <p> Your lean weight is your total body weight minus the amount of fat you are carrying . You will need to know your body fat percentage for this . If you are unsure about this , you can get a good estimate by using the Body Fat Calculator in the sidebar at MuscleHack.com . <p> Another good rule of thumb is to take 1 gram of protein for every pound of total body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 grams of protein per day . <p> My favorite sources of protein include : <p> Chicken <p> Steak <p> Pork <p> Eggs <p> Cheese <p> Whey Protein Powder Shakes <p> Seafood tuna , prawns , salmon <p> Nuts <p> Seeds <p> Increase the amount of fat in your diet . Increase fat ? ! Yes , absolutely . Increasing the amount of fat in your diet increases the amount of anabolic ( muscle building ) hormones in your body . These are : <p> Some people resort to taking anabolic steroids in order to accelerate muscle growth but you can get comparable results by implementing the ultimate bodybuilding diet . <p> Decrease the amount of carbohydrates in your diet . If you want to build muscle without gaining fat , I advise you cut down on the level of carbohydrates in your diet . With a high carb dietary approach , you prevent your body from using body fat for fuel and actually encourage the laying down of new body fat . Thats <p> Decreased Lipolysis ( use of fat for energy ) <p> Increased Lipogenesis ( creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the planet . There is the erroneous belief that in order to gain muscle , you have to gain fat too wrong . You can build muscle , in fact more muscle , with controlled carbohydrate nutrition than with the standard high carb , low-fat diet . <p> Carbs are important for muscle growth but only at the right time .

@@2098795 <h> 6 Arguments for Embracing Hard Work and Avoiding Laziness <p> Written on 8/05/2008 by Brad Isaac who writes about ditching the laziness bug &amp; achieving your ideal life at his blog Persistence Unlimited . <p> Work spares us from three evils : boredom , vice , and need . Voltaire <p> Other blog owners can relate to this . I checked my site the other morning and there were a ton of new ping-backs to one of my posts . That 's good news for the most part , but there 's always a few sites that ping back that make me scratch my head . <p> In this case , like many others , a few of the sites had copied and pasted my article verbatim to their sites . <p> They had credited me with the writing and linked back to my site , but I wondered why someone would copy an entire article and post it to their web site ? I think there are 3 obvious problems with doing this : <p> Search engines like Google penalize sites that copy content . <p> Copied could be construed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site that owns the content . <p> Why would people visit a copied site if they can just go to Lifehacker and get the same article ? <p> Ultimately , I concluded that the people who did this did it out of laziness . They were too lazy to create their own content . They were too lazy to study up about how search engines penalize sites that copy . And they were too lazy to look at how this behavior would hurt them long term . <p> That 's not to say all laziness is bad . Its good to be lazy now and again . A lazy Sunday will refresh you after a week of hard work . But that 's not what we are talking about anyway . Were talking about avoiding work altogether as if it is something bad . When in reality it is something good . <p> And to prove it , here are 6 arguments you can use to keep working if you are feeling gripped by " the lazy bug . " <p> Laziness begets lazinessLike Newtons law , an object at rest tends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , the same could be said of being lazy . When you are on the road of ease and non-work , it becomes that much harder to do what is necessary . Think about your last vacation for a second . When you came back after a week of sun and fun , did you do a back-flip on Sunday night because you were so happy that work started again the next day ? Probably not . <p> The point is that even 1 week of laziness can create a situation where work becomes less desirable . If you expand that to several weeks or months you may never get back in the game . Did you ever consider why a small percentage of people who lose a job will never return to steady work ? Its simply too much work for them to start over . <p> Work puts you in the gameBy doing your work and then some , you are in the game . We all know the person who goes to work at 9 and clocks out at 5pm sharp and goes home . Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and then some , you see more opportunities because you are in the game . Those of us who have stayed late at work know that after work is when many of the prestigious assignments are delegated . If you are one of those who is working late , you 'll get the assignments. - <p> Its a double edged sword because yes , you 'll have more work , but you get more rewards too . <p> Work gets easier , laziness gets harderLike Newtons law , if you spend too much time not working , its that much harder to get to work . Imagine if you were lazy from high school until you turned 40 . At 40 you had a great idea to start a new business , how in the world are you going to do everything needed to be done to start this business ? You have too much experience submitting to gravity . The lazy bug will have you by the throat . I 'm getting tired just thinking about it . =- <p> However , the person who works hard that same period can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They have so much experience working that the work becomes almost effortless . They know what leads to success , they know what does n't  . <p> Laziness leads to a weak mindHave you ever tried to motivate a lazy person ? I have and I 'll tell you , its no fun . One reason is you can typically motivate them for short periods but they always return to laziness . They return to ease , even in the face of overwhelming proof that their work is paying off . The reason for this return to laziness is due to weakness of mind . Excuses even poor excuses become more important than reality . <p> Personal story : <p> I remember working with a company who had an excessively lazy co-director . However , I motivated them to try a new direction with their marketing . It involved a lot of work , but I knew that in order to win over confidence of the company , I 'd have to show quick results . <p> I spent days working on the plan and putting together their first 3 mailings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " We do n't  have the staff to do all this ! " <p> I did n't  understand what she meant because I was doing all the work . Nobody else had to do anything except go along for the ride . <p> Only through getting the other director to intervene was I able to launch the new marketing plan . It was an overwhelming success to spite her efforts to thwart it . Results showed it 30% more profitable than their last marketing effort . AND we were just getting started <p> The end result ? The boss eventually won . Her consistent complaints to the others about how much work it would be and the lack of staff finally caved . And I was dismissed . My marketing plan was scrapped for the old plan . <p> You see , laziness , like a disease poisoned not only her perspective , but everyone around her . In the face of a shiny new 30% profit that could have gone toward employee raises for the extra work , or to hire someone else , the work ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak mind could not see past the 3 hours per week of work and into the arena of working a profitable business . It jeopardized the company . The boss could avoid work and could concentrate more on complaining about the rapidly dwindling accounts and cash flow . <p> Yes , laziness weakens the mind . <p> Work leads to creative solutionsLeonardo Da Vinci , one of the greatest artists and inventors in history was no stranger to work . As apprentice to the artist Verrocchio , he had to do much of the manual labor required around a Renaissance workshop . This exposure to chemistry , drafting , metal working , plaster and bronze casting , leather work and such became building blocks that would eventually lead to his concepts of the helicopter , calculator , a tank and other inventions hundreds of years before the inventions saw the light of day. - <p> Similarly , for you , work will expose you to many different skills . To be an employee today , you 'll often learn much more than the title you hold . Youll have to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills , writing , typing , research , privacy matters , health insurance to name a few . Taken separately , each skill might not amount to much , but put two or more of them together and you 've got a cottage industry . Software research assistant anyone ? How about health insurance adviser ? <p> I like to tell how I learned much of system design work by washing dishes for restaurants in high-school . If you do n't  have a system , its easy to get extremely overwhelmed . The mere sight of dirty bus tubs , frying racks and sauce spoons stacked to the ceiling will send shivers up anyones spine . I came up with a system and strategy that made the job much more manageable . This ability to build systems has served me well over the years . I can now design computer systems for companies . So something as lame as a job washing dishes has powerful merits when coupled with other skills . <p> Excessiveness of laziness can lead to crimeIts almost shocking how little the subject of laziness is related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases have a motive of " being lazy . " as the desired outcome . To put it another way , an employee attempts to embezzle $1.5 million from a company so he can move to the Caribbean and never have to work another day in his life ( be lazy ) . Putting in the work toward that same amount of money is inconceivable to this guy . Its easier to steal it. - <p> And how about the insurance fraudsters who fake accidents ? These losers end up sitting at home doing nothing for 6-12 months to prove they cant do anything so they can fool the insurance investigators into settling their claim . What do they want out of a settlement ? To do more of nothing . <p> If the motivation to commit a crime is sheer laziness , then reason argues laziness can lead to crime . <p> Overall , successful people are known for their work , not their ability to take it easy . We usually do n't  sit around marveling at someones napping skills . ( Hey , did you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nap he took ! He s really going places ! ) <p> And although I do not advocate workaholism , I do suggest people consider putting in more than the average 40 hour work week .

@@2098796 <h> How to Deal with a Workplace Bully <p> Remember your high school bully ? The jerk who used to throw people in trash cans ? That burly kid that used to dunk peoples heads in the toilet and give them swirlies ? And remember the grand tradition of wedgies ? <p> I once thought that bullies only existed in high school . I used to believe that the " real world " was full of civilized , kind people and the whole idea of " bullies " did n't  exist for adults . <p> The sad fact of the matter is this : yes , most adults are pretty civilized . And I still like to think that kind people make up the majority of the population . But bullies still exist . And its a very real problem when you find yourself the victim of one in the work place . Dealing with a bully at work is entirely different than it used to be in high school . You cant gather your friends around you for protection and you cant ask your mom to talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that must be handled with care . <p> What does bullying work look like ? Bullying is a deliberate attempt to control or undermine you . It typically happens over a prolonged period of time and it can severely damage your self esteem and confidence . It can be subtle or overt . It can take place in private or in front of others . The circumstances can vary greatly from person to person . Here are some examples of bullying behavior at work : <p> A co-worker or supervisor constantly complains to other team members that you are n't  pulling your weight . They make jokes at your expense and accuse you of making mistakes you have n't made . In private they constantly belittle , insult and even threaten you . You feel frightened , angry , ashamed and embarrassed . <p> Your co-workers isolate you and do not keep you informed of things that are happening in the office . You are left out of meetings and team activities . Your input is ignored or immediately written off as not being good enough . You feel that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or supervisor dismisses your ideas then later takes credit for them . You feel like a character on a bad sitcom duped by the oldest trick in the book. - <p> A co-worker or supervisor asks others to keep an eye on you , making it apparent that evidence of your mistakes is highly rewarded . You feel edgy , nervous and paranoid. - <p> A co-worker or supervisor is verbally abusive , yelling and criticizing you . They personally attack your character and attempt to intimidate you . You feel frightened , angry and abused. - <p> How do you handle a bully ? <p> Bullying can not be ignored . If you feel you are being bullied , here 's some steps to follow : <p> Evaluate the situation Its important to trust your instincts in situations like this . If you feel bullied , you probably are a victim . But look closely at what is happening around the person in question . Is everyone afraid of them ? Do they have a reputation for this sort of thing ? Are you not the only one experiencing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them and find out how they feel . Theres power in numbers . <p> Make notes When something happens , write it down . Keep a log of every insult , every back stabbing move they make . Documentation is a very powerful tool . Write down dates and times and exact quotes if you can. - <p> Do n't  play their game Its easy to let someone push your buttons and fly off the handle at them . Do n't  let this happen . Do n't  stoop to their level . Remember that this is a professional environment and show some respect for your work . Try your best to ignore the bully and their actions . Do n't  let yourself be baited . Chances are , the bully is looking for a reaction . When they do n't  get one , they may eventually stop. - <p> Stand up for yourself It may seem like a contradiction after the last point , but do n't  let yourself be walked on . You can ignore the bully without sitting down in the middle of the road . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone is piling irrelevant work on you , respectfully say no . It will take some time to find the right way of doing this , but it can ( and should ) be done . If you are being left out of meetings , bring it to the attention of the group . Tell them how it makes you feel and what the consequences are to the job . Keep your interactions professional and respectful always , no matter what they hurl at you. - <p> Call in the Big Guns If you 've done all you feel you can do , take the issue to your Human Resources Manager . Take your documentation with you and address the issue from a work perspective . Elaborate on how the behavior is damaging your work . Inform them of how important the issue is , stressing your desire to continue working in a comfortable , safe environment. - <p> Know when to fold Once you 've asked for help and nothing changes , you may need to consider the possibility of leaving . No one advocates such a decision because it simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with their behavior . But you have to think of yourself in all of this . Its not worth it to stay in a negative environment just to prove a point . If the bullying is damaging you physically ( i.e. you ca n't sleep , have knots in your stomach or panic attacks ) you need to seek professional help . There are also legal steps you can take to help you . Investigate your options thoroughly before making any decisions . And always remember that you deserve a friendly , peaceful environment to work in . We all do . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

As important as people are , and I 'll talk more about this soon , there are other factors that greatly contribute to the quality of your life . <p> Here I will guide you through a few of the things that I do to help me see my life in a beautiful light . <p> Sunlight . Being in constant sunlight does much for your body , mind and soul . Contrary to common believe , sunlight can actually help to prevent certain types of cancer . The vitamin D that it will generate in your body will strengthen your bones . The chemical reactions that will happen inside of you will actually make you happier . That 's why there is a huge benefit to early to bed , early to rise . You 're spending more of your waking moments in sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flower power for a reason , and this is the reason . <p> Enhance alertness with sunflowers : Yellow light waves stimulate the brain , making one alert , clearheaded and decisive . And because people generally associate yellow with the sun 's rays and daylight , helps people feel more optimistic . <p> Relax with bells of Ireland : Green affects the nervous system , allowing people to breathe slowly and deeply , slowing the production of stress hormones and helping the heart relax . <p> Boost confidence with irises : The color indigo stimulates the brain 's pineal gland , which is the regulator of sleep patterns . Indigo also helps to free the mind of worries , fears and inhibitions . <p> Get a good night 's sleep with delphinium : Blue triggers the production of melatonin , a brain chemical that helps with relaxation and sleep . Blue also stimulates the thyroid gland to release thyroxin , a hormone that regulates metabolic rate . <p> Prevent allergies with orange daisies : Orange strengthens the immune system and the lungs , which can ward off spring allergies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digestive system and can stimulate the sexual organs . <p> Relieve stress with lilacs : Violet has a cooling effect , alleviating " hot " conditions like heat rash and sunburn , and suppressing hunger and balancing metabolism . It also stimulates the pituitary gland , the part of the brain that releases tension-fighting beta-endorphins . <p> Healthy Food . This is absolutely vital because the stuff we put in is n't just fuel , it is n't just pleasurable morsels of food , its actually the building blocks from which our body is constructed . Would you want your body built from the ground up using potato chips , cup cakes , and chocolate shakes , or with lean cuts of protein , with fresh nutrient dense vegetables ? <p> Friends to Play . Youve heard laughter is the best medicine ? Well friends are the best source of that . There is a good time and place to be introverted , particularly when you 're trying to focus and get things done . On the other hand , being extroverted , making lots of friends and socializing with amazing people is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grow . <p> Person to Love . Having a person to love , such as a significant other , or a family member can all the motivation you need to create ambitious goals and have big dreams for yourself and your loved ones . Having intimate relationships in your life makes everything seem better than it really is . After all , our perception is our whole reality , so we might as well fill it with beautiful things , people , and thoughts . <p> Room to Grow . We all need room to grow , physically , mentally , and spiritually . If we confine ourselves to a static definition , instead of a possibility , then we are greatly limiting ourselves . That is to say-by staying open minded , we put unlimited options before us . For example , by saying we are only good at math , we are limiting ourselves from excelling in other areas . By saying we are smart , and able to learn new skills quickly , we are able to take on and accomplish anything . <p> Exercise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You feel good because you 're working towards a goal , doing something good for your body , and being proactive in your future . Since your brain is part of your body , your strengthening your physical brain , as well as building fortitude by keeping at it when it gets tough . <p> Integrity . An environment of integrity is one that you create for yourself when you become your word . Be genuine . Give power to your words ! This means saying who you are and being that person with yourself and with others . We are not perfect , but by having integrity , we can recognize times in which we are not being our word and objectively evaluate our actions . This can be so empowering because it dismisses denial in favor of understanding . <p> Respect Those Around You .

@@2098800 <h> Do You Have Too Many Goals ? here 's How to Prioritize Them <p> There 's a good chance that you 've got too many . Its a classic productivity mistake " and an understandable one . We all want to achieve the best were capable of , and experts advise us to set challenging , even " audacious " goals . <p> The problem is , having ten simultaneous goals is worse than having none at all . You 're likely to end up frazzled and frustrated , as you 'll feel that you 're never making enough progress . <p> The cure is simple : cut down your list of goals to something much more manageable . But if you 're a bit of a goal-setting junkie , how do you even begin ? <p> Step #1 : Write Down All Your Goals Record all the major goals that youve currently got on the go , or that you 're hoping to start . You might want to divide this list into " personal " and " professional " categories . <p> Its up to you what counts as a " goal " . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can accomplish it in a day , its not really a goal ) and that it should go beyond your regular daily routine ( " go to work " and " pay bills " do n't  count ) . <p> Take enough time to do this properly : you may find that you have unfinished goals nagging at you from months or even years ago . <p> Step #2 : Choose a Good Method of Prioritization Do you feel a sinking sense in your stomach when you look at your list ? If so , youve definitely got too many goals . Its time to cut down and focus on one thing at a time . <p> To do that , you need to know how you 're going to prioritize your list . There are several methods you could choose : <p> Most important goal first . This has the advantage of letting you tackle something truly worthwhile ( perhaps even life-changing ) " but it can also be a bit daunting , especially if you 're not always too good at follow-through . <p> Smallest goal first . This can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt " a small win at the start motivates you to go on to bigger and greater things . The drawback to tackling small goals , though , is that you might never get round to the big ones . <p> Big impact goal first . This is n't necessarily the most important goal , but its the one that makes an immediate and large impact on your life . If you do n't  have much energy and you 're unfit , regular exercise could be a big impact goal that empowers you for others " like a career change or new qualification . <p> Its completely up to you how you choose to prioritize , and you may want to consider all of the above three factors . A great first goal would be one that 's important and has a real impact , but that is n't too big . You want to see results within a few weeks or months , not within years . <p> If I could only achieve ONE thing from my goals list over the next few months , which thing would I choose ? <p> Write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your primary goal : you can work on others too if you want ( see the next step ) " but this goal needs to come first . <p> You may want to set a deadline for this goal , if its smallish . If its a large goal , set milestones and dates . For instance , if you want to get a new qualification , you could set yourself the task of applying to a particular course by a particular date . <p> Step #4 : Optionally , Choose One " Two Other Goals You may want to pick a couple of other goals to pursue , using the same method of prioritization . ( Ask yourself , if I could do one more thing etc . ) <p> If you can , make these goals complementary to your top one . For instance , if your main goal is to lose weight , a second goal of " exercise regularly " would work well . <p> Avoid having three big goals that all take up a lot of time , energy or money .

@@2098801 <h> How to Lose Less on Your Vegas Vacation <p> If you ai n't  just a little scared when you enter a casino , you are either very rich or you have n't studied the games enough . VP Pappy <p> Later this Spring my wife is off to Las Vegas . Her annual Vegas trip gives her some much needed and deserved R&amp;R ; we have two kids and her full time job is dealing with them ! <p> While I love my wife , I do n't  love that she comes home with nothing but the lint in her pockets . Sure , she has fun out there and clearly there is a cost to fun . However , is it impossible to come home with a little cheese left over ? After all , I could use the winnings ( or non-losings , if you will ) as a reward for my hard work . I mean , this DLM thing is n't a piece of cake especially when I still have a normal job ! <p> So to break this spell , I am coaching her on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bets on , how to manage her money , etc . Trust me , she is never going to do all of these , but creating this list became fun so if she does a couple , I 'm happy . <p> Here is what I came up with . If you have some extra tips , please add them in the comments . <p> General Tips <p> Slow it Down : If you have five or six hours of casino time ahead of you , go to a game that takes a while . Trust me , you are not in a race to blow your wad . Games like Blackjack are one-and-done ; each hand , even at a full table , might take 2 minutes . On the other hand , a single thrower at the Craps table could be there for 10-15 minutes . Even if you only play the pass-line , the game is exciting and offers a way to slow down the pace of your losses . ( More on individual games in the next section ) - <p> Time : You will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never know that the sun is setting or rising . Wear a watch or set a timer to alert you to the passing hours . At some point , your brain fatigues and so does your decision making ability . Set some limits and head to the pool. - <p> Drinks : Do something to ensure you are n't  drinking more than one drink per hour . If you want to get hammered , that 's fine , but do so in the bar and away from the in-bar video poker machines . Trust me , not following this point will lead to you waking up in the morning asking where your $500 went . Remember , the drinks are free for a reason. - <p> Cashing in : If your bankroll for the evening is $1,000 , DO NOT get $1,000 in chips right when you get there break it down . Keep 50% of your bankroll in cash and toss it into your purse or the front pocket of your pants ( front pockets are tougher for pickpockets ) . Take the other 50% and get some chips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : mentally , itll be easier for you to walk away with cash versus chips , and secondly , once you have all chips , its difficult to get your money back ; dealers will not cash you out . To get cash back , you are forced to find the cage which entails walking by eighty other game tables , cheering crowds , waiting in line , etc . That 's a lot of temptation that you can avoid simply by retaining some cash . <p> ATM Card : Leave it in the rooms safe . Enough said . Do n't  bring it down to the casino. - <p> Winnings : How many times have you heard someone say , I was up $500 but I gave it back " . Well , use that 50% rule . When you win something , take half of it , stash it , and commit to leaving it alone until you get back to the hotel room . You still have your original bankroll and half of your winnings to play with . Why not plan on leaving with some money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at the old ladies using these things , they are smarter than you . I went to Vegas three years ago and after 4 days , I was down $200 . After at least 25 hours of gambling , I considered this a winning trip . Point being , I did n't  win a ton of money or lose a ton . However , I was flagged in some database and for the next year I was getting emails that contained crazy discounts : everything from free airfare to massively discounted rooms . Use the card , get discounts and comps. - <p> Do more : Seriously , do more than just gamble . Here is a list of 10 cool things to do in Las Vegas . Do n't  like those , here are 10 more ideas . Should I continue ? - <p> Help : Do n't  gamble with your mortgage payment or your familys food money . Gambling is entertainment , just like the movies ; its not an income source . If you have a problem , get some help . Please . <p> Games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular games in Vegas . I am not making any promises , heck , you will probably still lose it all . However , the lesson I want to get across is this : Learn the game , learn the odds . Would you invest in a company without knowing how they operated ? NO . Would you take a job without knowing anything about the company ? NO . Well , then why gamble without knowing the games and knowing how to win ? <p> Slots : I have to admit , for as lame as these things are , the newer slot machines with interactive screens and bonus rounds are pretty fun . Having said that , you control nothing . All of the reel stops are set by the software on the machine , therefore , your winning was the result of the software and so were all of the " I almost won " moments . The software is set to keep you on the edge of your seat so when you get 2 matching symbols when you need 3 , know that the machine is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win there is no almost . <p> One point that is worth discussing is the betting lines . When you walk up to a $0.25 machine , your $0.25 is buying you the lowest payout . In order to get the max payout ( you know , the huge number in blinking lights ) you have to bet max lines . On some machines its 10 lines , on some its 20 . If you go with 10 lines , your single pull will cost you 10 x $0.25 or $2.50 per spin . That 's slightly more than the quarter you planned to spend is n't it ? Odds : Plan to lose unless you sat at the right time . General payouts are anywhere from 80%-98% depending on the casino . <p> Roulette : This is my wifes favorite game ( which , in my opinion , is why she always loses ) . Its the easiest game to learn , I mean you are simply picking the number that you feel the little ball will land on . There are 38 numbers to choose from so stare at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its magic.Odds : The house has a 5. x% advantage over the player. - <p> Blackjack : Yes , there is skill to blackjack . While you have no control over the cards you , the dealer or the other players receive , you have a helluva lot of control over what you do with them . I am not going to give a full tutorial here but this is definitely the game that I have personally had the most success with . Here is a good place to read up on Blackjack strategy.Odds : This somewhat depends on the number of decks and the table rules , but all-in-all , the casino will have an .4-.6% advantage over the player in Blackjack . This is a pretty slim advantage. - <p> Let-it-Ride : Think of Jacks or Better , 5-Card Stud but 3 cards are community and they are flipped one at a time . Instead of betting with each flip , the flips give you a chance to reduce your existing bet or choose to let it ride . It is fun , it takes no skill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bet small until the table fills up . For more detail than you need , here is a good resource.Odds : The house has a 3.5% advantage over the player . <p> So the clear lesson is to choose the game with the lowest house advantage . If you hate blackjack , which has one of the lowest house advantages , move on and find something else . Once you have chosen the game you think you 'll like , study it . My hope is that you 'd do this before perusing the airports book store because at that point , its too late . There are tons of books that you can read ahead of time . Then , practice with a buddy or by playing on a free gaming site . <p> Good Luck ! <p> By the way do not take pictures inside casinos . They will ask you to leave . <p> Jay <p> Written on 3/24/2008 by me , Jay White , the founder of Dumb Little Man and an all around average guy . <h> 1 COMMENT <p> It is the dream of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@2098803 <h> How to Cope with a Difficult Work Environment <p> Youve read the reports about the economy , the jobless rate and the difficulties involved in finding employment . The statistics indicate that the world economy still has n't  pulled out of the recession and finding a job especially if you 're older is harder than ever . <p> So you probably do everything that you possibly can to keep your job , even if the work environment is miserable . Most employees have to deal with a difficult work environment at one point or another but some individuals seem to be able to cope with the situation better than others . <p> Its never easy to work well when your boss or co-workers are making life hard for you but there are a number of strategies that you can use to diffuse various situations and hold onto your job while retaining your sanity . <p> 1. - - - Do n't  become emotional when dealing with criticism . This can turn into a war of egos and no one wins . When someone attacks you they want to bait you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attack-react-attack . Acknowledge a critical comment and move on . When you do this you take the wind out of the attackers sails . If you can manage to say " I 'm sorry , " by all means , go ahead and say it . There 's not much that someone can say once you 've said " I 'm sorry " and , in a very real sense , it puts the power back in your court . <p> 2. - - - Ask the attacker for advice . Speak calmly and try to make it seem as though you really want to know what the person thinks . Basically , youve just shifted the power out of their hands and into your own . <p> 3. - - - If you 're having difficulties with your boss take a proactive approach and affirm how the boss wants things done . Make it clear to the boss that you 're amenable to changing your style , but you want to confirm what s/he wants so that everything is clear . If possible , get an outline of what the boss wants in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4. - - - Go out of your way to do more than the minimum required . Regardless of whether you 're sweeping the floors in a fast food joint or preparing reports in an office setting , there are always ways for you to go above and beyond your basic responsibilities . Do n't  preen , but do demonstrate that you value your job and that you 're a valued employee . <p> 5. - - - Do n't go to up the chain of command unless you 're prepared to leave the job . Appealing to a supervisor is not an effective way of dealing with a difficult co-worker or boss . It will only increase the possibilities for conflict and you may get a reputation as a backstabber or a whistleblower . Go up the chain of command as a last resort but be prepared for unpleasant consequences . <p> 6. - - - Try to develop a Plan B. Send out resumes , take on part-time clients in evenings and on weekends and generally create a situation in which you feel that you have some control over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 7. - - - Your boss and co-workers like praise as much as anyone . Do n't  speak while the fire is hot , but during down-times , spread words of praise . " I was amazed at how well you handled that client " and " I learned a lot when I read your report " can go a long ways toward restoring harmony in the work environment . <p> 8. - - - If you see that a co-worker or a supervisor is about to throw a fit , get out of the way . Excuse yourself by saying that a client is waiting for you or text someone and ask them to call you and then explain that you have to take the private call elsewhere .

I was expecting to get a scholarship that I did n't  get , went on a trip that I probably shouldnt have gone on , and bought a certain someone special a present I could n't afford . That 's $4k in the hole , and no regrets , but a bit of a mess to clean up after . <p> I 'm proactively trying to get myself out of the hole before I start dental school next year ( see update ) . Once I start , I 'll be about $70K-$90K in the hole per year , so it wont really matter , but it matters now . My goal is to get my credit card paid off , save up a small emergency fund , and establish a few passive streams of income before school starts and I 'm a slave with no spare time . <p> I 'll get into a couple of ways I 'm earning money right now , but the general point is that self-improvement does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some ways to improve yourself are free , some are cheap , and some actually earn you money ! <p> Talk is cheap . Actually talk can be worth anywhere from a few cents a minute on skype to free if you 're face to face . Being broke is a perfect opportunity to work on your relationships . You do n't  have to take your friend , or romantic interest on a super expensive date , you can do something simple like get to know what they 're really about and what 's going on with them . People like nothing more than to talk about themselves , and they 're willing to pay professionals a lot of money to just listen to them , so you could be delivering a lot of value to your friends for free ! - <p> Exercise burns . Exercise burns your calories , but it does n't  have to burn your wallet . You can invest in a $30 pair of cross-training sneakers , which can last you awhile if you do n't  run through swamps and they 're practical for several sports . I maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for life ( after paying $60/month for 3 years awhile ago ) , so I do n't  see myself canceling that . However , you can create a 30-minute morning routine without any weight , using just kalesthetics , and maintain a healthy lifestyle for nothing. - <p> Bottle it . Invest a couple of bucks towards a large waterbottle , or reuse a plastic one you bought earlier , and fill it up with filter/tap water . Drink nothing but the water , avoiding alcohol and coffees which dehydrate you , make you fat , and add up in cash-money if you 're a consistent consumer . Its a great way to keep your organs optimally hydrated while saving a lot of money . <p> Explore . Find areas around your house , such as local parks and landmarks that you can go to for free . You 're out there getting your daily walk , taking in the fresh air , and paying nothing to enjoy mother nature . This is a great way to spend time alone , with a friend , or to get to know a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking can improve your overall health , focus , and feelings of well-being . I actually journaled how I felt for 30 straight days of 30 minute walks and it was enlightening to see the full progress after the 30 days. - <p> Reading is free . That 's a big statement to make considering I have shelves and shelves worth of self-improvement books in my room that have a combined cost of hundreds of dollars . However , there 's always the library that has a large selection of great books and audio tapes that I like to frequent . Return books on time and it does n't  cost you a penny. - <p> Work on skills and talents . Some skills and talents are quite expensive to indulge in . Painting requires expensive utensils , racing requires fuel , singing may require instruments or recording equipment . Other skills can be worked on while saving or earning you money . Want to practice social skills ? Work at a nightclub on weekends . Want to improve your cooking skills ? Volunteer to cook at an elderly peoples home in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlet that works for you. - <p> Cook your own . The best way to get healthy food into your system is to cook that food , instead of eating out at a restaurant . Find a cheap place , such as a farmers market , to purchase fruits and vegetables . Make these the cornerstones of your meals , taking up at least 90% of your caloric intake . Youll save money , you 'll fill yourself with nutritious food , and you 'll be able to impress friends or a date with a frugal meal that you created with your own hands instead of spending money on restaurants. - <p> Character development . Use this opportunity to do some journaling and introspection . Decide what kind of person you want to be , with what kind of virtues and ethics . Decide how you want to be seen by people , and how you would like to treat others . Create a list of rules that you will not budge from which will slowly but surely take you towards your goals. - <p> Volunteer . This can be a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to earth people . You 're actively spending time improving the quality of someones life while absorbing joy from the experience . Wow , what a great deal . They should start charging to volunteer . In my case I 'm volunteering/interning twice a week at one of the dental schools I applied to . There 's no doubt that I 'm helping them out there but I 'm also learning a lot and most importantly networking with great contacts. - <p> Writing Pays . Invest a little bit of money into a personal website . You do n't  have to pay more than $3-5 per month , and you can find a free theme to use . Either create a blog about something you 're passionate about , or use it as a portfolio of your writing . Survey all the websites that write about topics you would be interested in , and start submitting your writing . Unleashing you 're creativity through the process of writing is an excellent way to improve your train of thought. - <p> I 'm pretty much doing all 10 of these , and more , to the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having to say no when your friends go out somewhere expensive is n't fun , but its what needs to be done .

@@2098809 <h> Stuck in Anger Mode ? Use it to Fuel Your Drive for Change <p> Everyone knows that anger is a destructive emotion that causes all kinds of harm , to ourselves , to other people , and the world at large . Yet despite our knowledge that anger is unhealthy , and despite our best efforts to get over it , sometimes we get stuck in an angry rut , and we cant seem to let it go . <p> The good news here is that anger is a powerful energetic force , and it contains tremendous intelligence . Normally we think anger is just this terrible , immature emotion that we should never experience , that we should be beyond that . Yet if we can utilize the energy of anger , riding its energy rather than it riding us , the possibilities for positive change are huge . <p> When you 're stuck in anger , try flipping it around in a kind of " anger energy aikido " and use it to fuel your path of personal growth . Rather than adding further negativity to the negativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anger , uncovering the energy and intelligence buried there . here 's a few suggestions to help you do this : <p> Exercise Your Anger Take your anger out for a workout . Use the powerful energy in the anger and go to the gym , get on your bike , or go for a run around the block , or whatever your exercise routine is . Channel all that energy into some kind of physical activity , burning it up , rather than letting it burn you up. - <p> Play Out Your Anger Channel your anger into a creative process . Get out the paints or the clay or the notebook , and start expressing your angry feelings into some kind of tangible , earth bound shape . This gets the anger out of your brain where it causes all kinds of problems , and into a healthy expression , where it can move and transform into something creative and useful . You might even get insights into the causes of the anger , and this may even help you to let it go. - <p> Use Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , examine it to find what 's causing you to be angry , and then change the cause or causes . One way to do this is to use a writing process . Begin by writing your experience down without editing it , just getting all the heavy aggressive stuff out on paper . Then ask yourself , Why am I angry at this situation ? Reflect for as long as you need , and write out your response. - <p> Once you have some understanding of what 's causing your anger , you 're now in a perfect position to do something about it . The next question is : What can I do in this situation to make positive change ? The options will usually fall into three categories : change your response to the situation ; change the situation ; exit the situation . Think about what possibilities might work best for you and for the situation as a whole , and then take action . <p> Change Me , for You Anger holds a strong conviction that we are " right " . We feel so righteous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we stifle it with the self absorption of anger . To flip it around , think of someone you 've wronged in the past . Think back to a time when you were hurtful to another person . Then pick up the phone , get them on the line , and offer a sincere heart felt apology , regardless of how long ago it was . This may sound like a very weird idea , but chances are that the person at the other end of the line will appreciate your call and they 'll soften up to you , whether they remember the hurt or not . This will flip your self righteousness around to " other " righteousness , and will benefit you as well as the other person. - <p> Get Intimate With Your Anger The writing process in number 3 is one way to discover the message in your anger . Another method is to encounter your anger face to face . Look your anger directly straight in the eye and ask it , " What are you trying to tell me ? What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anger is a wake up call . Its there yelling at us , " Somethings not right here . LOOK ! ! This needs to CHANGE ! " Fearlessly step into your anger , naked without any filter , and ask it to reveal its message to you . Normally were so busy reacting to our anger that we do n't  actually pay attention to it . Flip the pattern of running from your anger , and face it head on so you can see where its coming from . <p> Normally we think anger is just this terrible , immature emotion that we should never experience , that we should be beyond that .

You can also use their age , gender and habits as criteria . <h> 2 . Start with your friends or- co-workers <p> My first customers were actually my friends and people I 've previously worked for . Since they knew me personally , it was easy for them to give me a chance .

@@2098815 <h> The Effortless Way to Achieve Any Goal <p> Written on 8/21/2008 by Michael Miles . Michael is nearing addiction to personal growth , communicating , and increasing personal wealth . If you like him here , you 'll love him at his blog Effortless Abundance . <p> We all want to grow . Whether that means being more successful , having more control over our lives , being more financially secure or being happier and more content . One thing we know for sure , day dreaming will not get us there . <p> We need to have goals and we need to work towards achieving them . But so often the things we want to achieve seem so far off and so difficult that we either give up before we 've begun or we fall at the first hurdle . Achieving our goals , however , does n't have to be like this . Here are a few suggestions for tackling goals without a lot of stress . <p> Be a visionaryWhat will your life look like when you have achieved your goal ? First , you must want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . If you do n't have this conviction , then you do n't really have a goal , just a dream . There 's nothing wrong with dreaming , but if you do n't take it to the next step , you can not achieve anything . <p> A visionary is not someone who simply has grand ideas , important though these ideas are . True visionaries have every intention of turning these dreams into reality . Ask a hundred people what , specifically , they want to achieve in the next ten years , and most will not be able to answer . Part of my job is interviewing people , and this is a question I almost always ask , and I have almost never come across a person who gave me a good answer . Most people , it seems , do n't get past first base.Take inspiration from those who have gone beforeYou think it 's too hard to quit smoking ? Millions of others have done it before . I have done it . Winston Churchill said that success is going from failure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you years to achieve something and , in those years , you might fail a thousand times . But you need to pick yourself up , dust yourself off and keep going . If you do n't keep on trying , you 'll fail for sure . <p> Inspiration in available in spades . Look though this blog , for example . Read about the lives of famous successful people " you 'll find that in almost every case , that person suffered many failures along the road to final victory . So do n't lose heart " keep on going and , when you feel like throwing in the towel , take onboard another scoop of inspiration . <p> Prepare well : have a planIf you want to get from New York to LA , you need a plan . You need to decide whether to fly , drive , or take a train , when to set out , what to take for the journey , what to do when you get there , how long to stay , and so on . You might not plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea . You can not achieve your goal without a plan . You do n't need to construct a military campaign and spend hours every week poring over your goals , but you do need to give some thought to the process.Break your goal down into small stepsMany goals seem very difficult to achieve . Climbing a mountain , building a successful business , becoming wealthy " all are grand enterprises . But the mountain can only be climbed one step at a time and wealth is usually accumulated one dollar at a time . <p> You will need to break down your goal into lots of smaller mini-goals . ' Think of a habit as an example . Let 's say you want to give up sugar . You could go cold turkey , and this may work for you , but usually , habits can be slowly reduced until they disappear . Start by having one sugar free day a week , then two , then three and so on , until you are only eating sugar now and again or even not at all . <p> Set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall goals ( which I believe I can achieve ) and then I set quarterly and yearly goals going out for the next five years . Working on these small goals will soon add up . A dripping tap soon fills the bucket . <p> Stop strugglingWe 're often led to believe that hard work is a necessary component of success . I do n't believe it . If work is a chore that you have to endure to achieve your goals , then I think work is a bad idea . It is a kind of struggle , and struggling gets you nowhere ; like the fly caught in a web , the struggle only enmeshes you further . As far as I 'm concerned , the puritan work ethic is a disaster " it makes us unhappy and gets us nowhere : it turns us into mice running in a wheel . <p> Twenty five hundred years ago , Lao Tzu , the semi-mythical author of the Taoist masterpiece , the Tao Te Ching , wrote Great good is said to be like water , sustaining life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing is left undone ; the way of nature rules by allowing things to take their course . ' <p> Anything can be achieved given vision , proper planning and persistence . Nowhere is great effort required .

She wants to be rich , not only monetarily , but in life , love , health , etc . Visit her popular blog at Attraction Mind Map . <p> Emotional abuse may not leave scars , but it can cause pain for much longer than physical harm . Many women especially believe that just because they do not suffer from physical abuse by their spouse or partner , they are safe . However , it is not necessarily the case . The scars are mental and can cause a lot of grief and unhappiness . Although more women appear to suffer from emotional abuse , this does not mean that men do not experience mental torture either . <p> Emotional abuse happens when the other party erodes your sense of self esteem and literally , has a hold over your mind . Your sense of self worth shrinks so much that you no longer dare to challenge what is being said about you . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of them are not true to begin with . Your partner spins a web of lies to control your behavior and for his or her own selfish motives . It is possible that he or she has an inferiority complex to begin with . <p> Perhaps , there comes a time when you decide that enough is enough . You refuse to be held hostage by your mental torture . And you want to move on . Fortunately , it is possible to overcome emotional abuse and regain the confidence and control that you may have lost to an abusive partner . <p> Dissociate from the pastThere is no point lamenting about what has happened in the past . It is over . Do not deny it either . Just accept that it has happened and that you are now on the road to emotional health . You may not have exercised control over your past but you can take charge over your own future from now on . Look at the past as lessons that point out what you no longer want for yourself . <p> Admittedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trauma caused by an abuser , but gradually , you will discover an inner strength and resilience to build a bright future . A change in environment may be helpful for you to de-associate from your past . <p> Build self-esteemAbusers are constantly hacking away at your self-esteem . When you come out of an abusive relationship it is essential that you rebuild your sense of self-worth . You need to recognize that you can be strong and capable of independent thought . <p> Surrounding yourself with people who value you is an important part of the healing process . Form your own support group or join an online community that helps support its members to gain strength . It is vital that you remember what makes you a unique and valuable person . <p> You hold the powerEmotional abusers do what they do to gain power over you . Consequently , you feel that you are being controlled and watched over every single movement that you make . You fear making decisions . In fact , you find it difficult to make one without consulting your partner . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . <p> The important thing is to understand that you are the only person who has power over yourself . One reason why you have been subjected to emotional abuse is that you have handed your power over to your partner . In reality , no one can make you do anything if you do not let them . Realize that only you hold the power . Look for ways to empower yourself . <p> You know what is right for youYou are the only person who knows what is best for you . An emotional abuser will want you to make decisions that are self serving for his or her interest . However , such a decision may not be in line with yours . As much as you care for a harmonious relationship , you need to take an alternate decision if your inner knowing tells you otherwise . <p> Hence , it is your job to take care of your own needs . It is not about being selfish , but about establishing certain boundaries . No one leads your life for you . Do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only control yourselfOne reason that many women stay in abusive relationships is because they think they can help their partner change . A period in time will lapse and they would find that they remain stuck and with no signs of improvement in their partner . <p> The truth is that you can not make anyone change , you can only control the way you react to them . Instead , focus on improving your own life . In doing this you will discover your own self worth . You can then decide whether or not your partner is compatible with your new lifestyle . <p> Spend Time Setting boundaries and expectationsPeople often expect a speedy recovery after being in an abusive relationship . If they do not allow themselves enough time to heal they will often fall into another abusive relationship . It is clear to see that they have not learnt their lessons . They continue to attract the same kind of relationships that have them feeling needy . <p> Hence , it is important that you spend time setting boundaries and expectations for treatment in future relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision that you do not want to enter into any unhealthy liaisons any more . If you are clear in what you want , you are more likely to attract a loving and kind partner , unlike the one that you have been used to . <p> Do what makes you feel goodInitially , you will feel free from coming out of an abusive relationship . However , you may start to experience insecurity because you do not know how to occupy your time . For this reason , it is important that you do not hang around by your phone , hoping that your partner will call and beg for forgiveness . <p> Instead , find things to do that makes you feel happy . Take a class or pick up a hobby . Try to recall what it is that you have always wanted to explore . With no one telling you what to do or holding you back , the possibilities are endless . <p> In conclusion , it is important to have a vision of who you would like to become once you have regained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for role models . No longer will you be controlled without your permission . Most definitely , do what it takes to gain a sense of self empowerment . <p> Do not be afraid to ask for assistance from others either . You need time to heal and getting some form of support is always a good idea . You have the choice to make things right . Your future is bright ; do not let anyone take that away from you ! <h> 2 COMMENTS <p> Unbelievably naive . Use your money making mumbo jumbo in areas that do not patronise and harm others . You clearly have no understanding of emotionally abusive relationships . surround yourself with those who value you emotional abusers systematically strip all these people from your life , you are truly isolated by them . truely no one can make you do anything you do n't  want to do what utter nonsense , did you ever try surviving when you and your childs access to food or money depends entirely upon placating an abuser ? you are the only person in control of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family courts are commonly used by highly skilled narcissitic abusers to prevent any possibility of successfully escaping the abuse without putting a child at further risk .

No matter how much I learn about this topic , there are still occasions that my face turns red and heats up like the sun . <p> Notes : A lot of people will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 'll never look at the audience . While the perception ( covered later ) of eye contact is important , not making sense is worse . Make yourself a solid outline to follow using keywords that you 've practiced . While you clearly should not stand there reading a piece of paper , glancing down at an outline is perfectly acceptable . <p> Eye Contact : For those that are timid , simply do n't  look at people in the face . What I mean by this is that while you have to give the impression that you are glancing into peoples eyes , you do n't  have to look INTO them . What I do is glance at foreheads and haircuts ; its a helluva lot less intimidating . While you are doing this be sure the scan the entire room , looking right , left and center . If you are in a small conference room , this is a little tougher to manage but the smaller audience should offset some of your fear . In this case , I generally bite the bullet and look directly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , your speech must be tailored to what the audience is expecting to hear . However , there is a way to accomplish both . <p> If your audience is waiting to hear about how many widgets your website sold and you want to talk about how many servers you have and how they handled X amount of page views , learn to combine the facts so that your message gets out while the audience hears what they want ( i.e. " Our 2 data centers equipped with XYZ handled 6 trillion page views resulting in 3 sales . These 3 sales represented an 80% increase in revenue ) . Doing this will eliminate the blank stares and boredom that often comes with listening to someone lecture/speak . As long as you can manage the merging of audience interest and yours , both side get what they want . <p> Pause : When I first started speaking to large groups , my sole goal was to get done with the speech quickly while hoping that the information stuck . That 's not very smart . A better way is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absorb the information . All we are talking about is the amount of time it takes for you to take a slow sip of water ( which I hope you brought to the podium or conference room ) . <p> Mumbler : Do not be a mumbler . I am not saying that you have to speak like Julius Caesar and make loud proclamations , but you should speak confidently . For those that are n't  confident , the only way to really learn this is through practice . Get a digital recorder and recite your speech several times until you learn how it sounds best . When you listen to the playback , put yourself in the audiences shoes and actually ask yourself if you would be bored listening to it . For that matter , ask your spouse , girlfriend , whomever . <p> Um Factor : In the last point I mentioned how using a recorder would help you gauge how well you sounded . Well , keep the recorder handy because you assignment is to record your speech and then listen to it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be surprised and how often you say it . Saying um is something you naturally do to allow your brain time to catch up to your mouth and it sounds terrible . At my job I have a Senior Manager of Something and he s brilliant , but he says um constantly during his speeches and it makes him sound , well a less smart . <p> Anticipate : As we mentioned , people are coming to listen to you because they value your opinion on a particular topic . However , if your speech allows for audience questions , there is a little unknown element in it for you . I generally try to anticipate what audience questions will be and then have a separate note sheet for those answers . If I do n't  know an answer , I immediately admit it and ask that we take that subject offline . This gives me time to grab a subject matter expert to answer the persons question without throwing me offtrack . <p> Show up early : This one may not do anything for you but I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at the venue early and check out the surroundings . <p> Where will I be standing ? <p> Do I have a wireless mic allowing me to walk the stage or am I stuck at a podium ? <p> Where is my presentation going to be viewed ? <p> The more I know ahead of time , the lower the chances that something will throw me offtrack . <p> Stick with the plan : This one is tougher than you 'd think . As you are speaking and following your outline , an idea will inevitably pop into your head . Your idea will insist that you go off track and speak about something you had n't  planned for . Unless you are totally comfortable up there , resist the urge . <p> Practice : Weve mentioned a few times already that listening to yourself talk on a recorder can help reduce ums and prevent mumbling . It also helps gauge transition and flow . In a separate session that your um-detection , listen to how you are transitioning from point-to-point . These transitions should be gradual as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to holding up a stop sign to the audience because their brain is trying to stop and understand what just occurred . At some point , they will not be able to catch up . <p> Coffee : This last one was something that my Father taught me a long time ago . If you have to drink coffee to get the energy to conduct your talk , be sure to chase it down with water . To him ( and me ) coffee dries out your mouth and it makes speaking for a long period of time very difficult . Also , and I already mentioned this , be sure you bring some water with you . In addition to getting rid of any lingering cotton-mouth , you will be able to build in the small delays we mentioned . <p> Like I mentioned , these are the little things that I used to ease my fear of speaking . Overtime , the need to use all of the tools diminished simply because I got more comfortable in front of groups . However , a few stick with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx79

@@2098829 <h> 5 Signs It 's Time to Drop that Negative Person From Your Life <p> It 's a hard pill to swallow when we discover that we ca n't get along with everyone . <p> We all like to think that we are highly likeable and that anyone would be lucky to have us in his or her life , whether it 's as a friend , boyfriend , girlfriend , acquaintance , etc . <p> But sometimes people 's actions towards us tell us something to the contrary . Instead of valuing and appreciating our characteristics , talents , and skills , they criticize , take advantage of or just outright do n't care about them . <p> It seems obvious to rid these types of people from our lives but logic does n't always win out in this decision . If we are emotionally attached in some way to these negative people , we will look past the lack of respect and kindness they demonstrate towards us . We would rather continue to try and win them over than to walk away with the knowledge that we deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it because it does n't want to feel that it 's not good enough or deserving of this person 's approval . <p> Perhaps the most challenging part is not kicking these difficult people out of our lives but rather knowing whether or not we should . Emotion often clouds our judgment , leaving us confused whether a particular person 's actions and behavior is deemed unacceptable and worthy of us walking away from the relationship altogether . <p> But sometimes , making this decision is the best thing we can do for our happiness and general wellbeing . <p> So how do we know when it 's time to pull the trigger and wave goodbye ? Here are five signs to look out for : <p> 1 . ) They are concerned solely with what you can do for them . These people are often willing to put forth very little effort into the relationship unless they will benefit directly . Selfishly , they feel the relationship is built off of the fact that you have something to provide them with . If you withdraw whatever that certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less often , well , that may be a sign . <p> 2 . ) You walk away from time spent with them feeling depleted and unhappy . You know that feeling after spending quality time with a person you genuinely connect with ? It 's like a drug . When you truly connect to another human on a deeper level , you 're left feeling energized and exuberant . The exact opposite is true when you spend time with a negative person . Whether they talk about themselves the entire time or speak negatively of you , you 'll be left feeling exhausted and depressed afterward . <p> 3 . ) They rarely , if ever , ask questions about YOU and what is going on in YOUR world . This is the most telling sign , in my opinion , that it 's time to give someone the boot . Some of us are better trained than others at inquiring about the life of another person . Upbringing and personality alone can dictate our ability to focus more on the other person and less on ourselves . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all capable of showing interest in another . If someone is continually talking about what is going on in their world while making very little effort to show any interest in yours , it may time to evaluate whether this person is worth keeping around . ( Note : Sometimes these people are unaware of just how self-centered they are coming across . You may want to first bring this to their attention and then if they still are n't willing to change , walk away . You 'll learn a lot about the other person just by their response to your concern ) . <p> 4 . ) You do n't like the person you are when you 're around them . This one is pretty black and white . People either better or worsen us . The hard part is acknowledging that a friend or boyfriend is bringing out a side of us that we really dislike . It 's not easy , especially when you truly care for the person . But the relationship we have with ourselves should come first and if we are associating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reason enough to put an end to it . <p> 5 . ) Your life without this person would be easier if they were n't in it . There are certain people we have in our lives that we know we simply could not live without . These people bring something into our world that just makes it better . If they unexpectedly walked out of our life , it would undoubtedly be a huge loss . On the other hand , if the thought of life without a particular person makes it appear happier , easier , and more joyful , there 's your answer . We 're smarter than we act sometimes but we know deep down when people are keeping us from living our best life possible . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

To do this effectively , you have to be productive . <p> Even such awesome and super productive bloggers as Seth Godin think on increasing their productivity level . This problem is not new , and everyone looks for tips and tricks on better blogging , reads guides , searches for inspiration , etc . <p> But do they realize the decision they seek is right in their backyard ? Its all about writing workplace organization . <p> This question is quite tricky , as some bloggers may start objecting this statement : " A mess at my workplace helps me work and inspires me , so go to you-know-where with your organization ! " <p> Okay , let it be . Some bloggers prefer working in a mess , for example " and it does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exception to the rules . We all need a workplace organization to work better , and here come the way how to do it right and make a writing space work on bloggers productivity . <p> Divide a Room into Two Zones <p> In his article for Inc.com , Neil Patel mentioned this trick already . No matter whether you blog from home or office , try to create two zones , computer and non-computer ones , in your room . <p> A computer zone is that with your desktop . Its where you spend a lot of time at the computer , writing your blog posts and thinking on new creative ideas . <p> A non-computer zone is where you work too , but it does n't  contain any desks , computers , and office stuff : you use it to relax from writing or do something that does n't  require a keyboard . You can scan documents here , work at your laptop lying on a cozy sofa , communicate with blog editors or audience , etc . <p> Now you should think on organizing each of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where you spend the most of your working time , so you should think about organizing it carefully . Top moments to pay attention : <p> 1 . Your writing desk . The first and foremost thing is keeping your desk clean : hide all extra items into drawers , leaving those important for your writing work . All you need is a computer , a lamp ( lighting matters ) , a cup of green tea ( it helps to stay focused and boosts productivity ) , and a live plant for both decoration and inspiration . <p> 2 . Your chair . Bloggers spend a lot of time sitting , so its important to buy a comfortable chair and adjust it to support a lower back . Ellipticals influence different sets of muscles , so you should think about having them , too , as they are perfect for those spending hours at writing desks .

It will serve for relaxing , but it does n't  mean you will not use it for searching ideas and doing some writing work , too . To make a non-computer zone of your workplace productive , try to remember the following moments : <p> 1 . The color of your walls . Blue and green are the best colors for walls in offices and home working places : they are soothing , they increase effectiveness , and they give the sense of well-being . So , if the color of your room is white , gray , or beige , its high time to change that . <p> 2 . The lighting of your room . Different color temperatures influence your productivity in a different way : if you want to boost it , you better choose a cold light of 3500K-4000K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relax or prepare for going to bed , a warm light color of 2700K-3000K would be the best choice . <p> 3 . Inspiration boosters . Do n't  forget to add some inspiration to your writing workplace . It can be whatever you find interesting , motivational and inspiring : pictures , photos of your family members , books , funny quotes , etc . Bloggers are creative people , and they will hardly write something worth with no muse around . <p> Never forget to care about a comfortable place to write your blog posts and become more productive to share your wisdom with readers . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098832 <h> How to Remove Skin Tags with Duct Tape <p> Skin tags , also known as acrochordons in medical jargon , are small flaps of skin that appear on the body . Currently , the reason that these appear is unknown . However , they are more likely to appear in people who are very young , very old , pregnant , and diabetic . These skin flaps are usually painless , and cause no problems for people who choose not to do anything with them . Though some people choose to leave them , others find them unsightly and want to remove them . Some will choose to get them surgically removed , while others will try home remedies . Duct tape is a popular choice as a home remedy , and is very simple to use . While not everyone finds it successful , many swear by this solution . Here is how to use duct tape to remove skin tags : <p> 1 . Gather your supplies . In this case , they are simple . All you need is a skin tag , or more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Wash and dry your skin completely , then cover the clean , dry skin tag and the area around it with a piece of duct tape . Smooth it completely to ensure that there are no bubbles or wrinkles that will let air into the area . The theory behind duct tape removal is that it suffocates the skin underneath , causing the skin tag to die . Because of this , its a good idea to not make the tape around the tag too big , so that the skin you want to keep is n't damaged in the process . <p> 3 . Wait until the tape begins to loosen , then check the skin tag . If it is still alive , it will remain attached . If it is not , it will fall off . If one round of duct tape does n't  work , replace it with a fresh piece after washing and drying the area again . Do this until the skin tag finally does fall off . <p> 4 . If you want to speed the process , try a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include painting the skin tag with nail polish to suffocate it , and tying a string around the base of the skin tag as tight as you can . Do this before adding the duct tape to the skin tag , and repeat it each time that you replace your piece of tape . <p> 5 . Though this may work the first time , sometimes it takes multiple times to work . If your skin tags grew while you were pregnant or i 'll , and you are now healthy , they are unlikely to return .

@@2098840 <h> How Do I Stop My Belt From Squeaking When I Start My Car ? <p> The sound of a squeaking belt in a cars engine can be caused by weather conditions , leaking fluids , maintenance issues , or wear and tear . The magnitude of sound can range from a soft squeak to a loud and noisy squeal , and it may occur while starting a cold engine or during normal vehicle operation . This is an issue that requires attention but does not pose danger or immediate risk of major damage . <h> Locating the Source of the Noise <p> The number of belts in an engine will vary according to the make and model . To determine which belt is making the noise , the best practice is to ask an assistant to start the engine while taking a look under the hood . Modern vehicles typically have one or two belts : A single serpentine belt that drives several components or a separate one for the alternator . Older vehicles may have a series of belts : A main drive belt and separate ones for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> It is generally easier to determine when alternators are the cause of the squeak since they tend to be closer to the top and front end of the engine . After turning off the engine , the belt can be visually inspected for wear and tear , and it can also be checked for tension by pushing down on it . Loose belts are more likely to squeal in warm weather , but if the belt appears to be tight and in good shape then the issue may be the internal bearings of the pulley . <p> The same visual and tension check can be performed on the serpentine belt . There should be enough tension to allow the belt to be pushed down about three quarters of an inch . Some hands-on car owners might be able to replace the alternator belt , but the serpentine belt may require a trip to the auto shop . Some engines feature an idle pulley that also serves as a tension adjustment device that can be dialed with a wrench . <h> Lubricating the Belt <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear and tear , closer attention should be paid to any noise coming directly from the pulleys , which will require an inspection from a mechanic . Otherwise , the squeaky belt can be lubricated for the purpose of silencing the noise . <p> Only two lubricants should be used on belts : Bar soap or belt dressing . The latter can be purchased at an auto parts store and the former should only rubbed to the interior of the belt in dry conditions . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

In fact , many homeowners prefer to simply save the money themselves and make an one large annual tax payment directly to the appropriate municipality or county . <p> Despite the added layer of bureaucracy and additional amount of work , mortgage lenders collect extra funds in escrow throughout the year in an attempt to prevent borrows from failing to pay county or city taxes when they come due .

Things happen that are truly outside our circle of influence , and so we need to relax and accept that sometimes things just happen as they will . This is part of life , and worry will not change it one little bit . <p> Stop taking yourself so seriously . If you fail , so what ? If you screw up , is it the end of the world ? Are you really so important that the world will stop turning if you get things wrong ? Life is not that serious . <p> Worry is a dangerous and poisonous thing . You must not let it eat away at you .

@@2098851 <h> How to Write a Resume That Will Land an Interview <p> Many people have n't looked at their resume in years ; they have n't needed to . But , with a shaky economy , jobs are shaking out like coins from a piggy bank . <p> If you 've been laid off or you 're worried you might be , blow the dust off your old resume and bring it back to life . Whether you are just updating or starting from scratch ( who knew those floppies would become obsolete ? ) , these steps will help you create an honest , positive resume . <p> Understand the resume 's purpose . Your resume and cover letter are tools to land a job interview . Not the job , just the interview . Think of a resume as a fact sheet and a cover letter as an explanation of those facts . Lose sight of this and you may overwrite , over explain and convolute . <p> But a resume is also your public relations advocate and should be flattering . Maybe your record is n't long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out of contention before you have a chance to talk your way into the job . <p> Once you find a template or format that makes sense for your goals and experience , do n't feel you must follow its structure exactly . <p> Delete the objective statement . Your objective is to get the job ; you know it , the employer knows it . Unless you really need to fill space , explain your objectives in your cover letter . Cover letters allow you to tailor your goals to the job you are applying for and creating a good cover letter is key . <p> Add creative space , if necessary . If you do n't have much experience , your credentials can look pretty lonely on the page . No one expects a young person to have as much to say as a person who has been working for twenty years . The results of thoughtful spacing ? An easy-to-read resume . <p> Add new activities to your resume . Volunteer at the soup kitchen or the animal shelter . Get active in your community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to work in , everyone wins . Add this activity to your resume immediately . <p> Think creatively about your accomplishments . Some of your achievements may not have happened within the confines of a job . For example , if you worked on a major research project in school , you can describe your project and the skills it developed . Here is a list of resume action words that may help jumpstart your memory . <p> List jobs first , and in reverse order . List your most recent job at the top and the rest in descending order . This is the order employers/recruiters expect to see your experience ; do n't disappoint or confuse them . A rare exception to the rule : if you are graduated from a prestigious college and you 're working at a filler job . All you Harvard degree graduates who are scooping ice cream , list your Harvard education first . <p> Omit your mailing address . Who is going to contact you by snail mail anyway ? Your email address and cell phone number is all anyone needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internet , keep some information private . Do you want them pulling your residence up on Google Maps ? <p> - <p> Figure out what keywords are relevant and use them . Some HR folks do n't read resumes any more . They have software that scans resumes for relevant keywords . Use nouns , like the names of the computer programs you know . Read tons of job descriptions and notice which words are used over and over . <p> Include accomplishments in addition to responsibilities . If you made a suggestion that your boss used , if you saved your company money , if you streamlined the work process , it counts . Do n't be shy about highlighting accomplishments on your resume . Back them up with statistics , if possible . How much money did you save the company ? What percentage of the budget was it ? <p> Keep the resume concise . Stick to one page , unless you have been working ten or fifteen years . If early jobs are not relevant , leave them off . <p> Never stop revising . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add a better word , a better phrase , a new accomplishment . Keep old versions of your resume in case you need information that you previously deleted . <p> Warnings <p> Do n't Lie . You knew this would be on the list . Employers routinely check job histories and education claims . Lies about either your job history or degree are the easiest for employers to uncover . The newly named dean of admissions at MIT lied on her resume when applying for a clerical job twenty-eight years ago . With the promotion in the works , her lies were discovered and she was fired . Never lie ! <p> Omit the Ugly . Mediocre grade point average ? Leave it off Have a 4.0 ? Put it front and center . Not all information is mandatory . Some people omit listing jobs they only held a short time or that might give them a bad reference . However , if the omission creates a gap that you are asked about in an interview , remember tip number one : do n't lie . <p> Mind the Gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . She omits her graduation year from her resume so there is no obvious hole , but no lies either . <p> Having a solid resume ready to send someone is important . Whether you need a job now or not , you never now when an opportunity will present itself and you 'll be asked to submit a resume .

@@2098859 <h> 5 Reasons To Travel When Youre Young <p> Traveling is unarguably one of the most gratifying experiences a person can have in their lifetime . Traveling awakens the soul , stirs the senses and paints the world in a new light . It may seem like a pastime for only a certain kind of person , but in all actuality , anyone and everyone can and should travel . <p> In my opinion , its better to travel sooner than later in life for a few very key reasons : <p> Traveling can help you figure out what you want to do with your life:Exposing yourself to new places , people and cultures can awaken your sense of purpose . Learning about what 's out there in the world can help you determine what feels like you and what does n't  . Its also especially useful in helping people realize that there 's no one way to live a lifetime . Every culture is different and so is every person within those cultures . If you wait till later in life , you run the risk of realizing your potential too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explore the world while you 're young . <p> It eliminates resentment later in life : How often do you hear someone much older than you comment on how they should have done something when they were younger ? No one wants to be sitting in a rocking chair at age 80 , wishing that they had taken that trip when they had the chance . Do n't  let someone or something stop you from traveling . A chance to experience the world now is greater than any excuse you can come up with for not going . Its worth it and you 'll be glad you have those memories later in life , trust me ! <p> It makes you a more interesting person : Nothing sucks more than talking to a person who has absolutely nothing to say . Traveling can create amazing memories and it serves as a great conversation starter . Youd be surprised how many times travel comes up in conversation , whether it be at a party or at the office .

Todays youth works harder than ever to achieve more than ever , and there 's no better way to reward ourselves and take time out than with a good old vacation . Remember , all that hard work is done in vain if there is n't an equal dose of play to go with it . You do n't  want to look back in 15 years and realize you wasted you 're younger years doing nothing but work , right ? So save that hard earned cash and go somewhere youve only dared to dream about- today . Turn fantasy into reality and give yourself a pat on the back .

@@2098865 <h> How to Avoid Overreacting and Acting like a Juvenile <p> Looking retrospectively , I 've made plenty of social errors by saying or doing the wrong thing . Overreaction would be an understatement and I 'm sure you can relate this to some situation in your life . The point is n't to dwell on these facts , but to learn from them and move forward to being a better person to mature . <p> By no means is this a complete list , as social interactions can occur in an infinite amount of configurations and possibilities . However , let 's look at the general ways to take control of our thoughts so that we do n't  cram them into peoples ears , do n't  make people wrong , do n't  use inappropriate force , and do n't  make people feel worse for crossing our paths.10 Ways on the Path to Not Overreact <p> Say Nothing I 'm sure you 've heard the expression , " If you do n't  have anything nice to say , do n't  say it at all . " Its simple , safe , and priceless when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Write it Down Instead of blurting out a comment or criticism , we can write it down , and revisit it in a day , and again in a week . This allows our emotions to cool and for a decision to be made based on logic. - <p> Cool Off Sometimes people get to us , especially the ones close to us who know our hot-buttons , which they press liberally and amply . Lashing out wont exactly bring the two of you closer , or make either of you feel better ( not long-term better , anyway ) , so cool off and come back. - <p> Do n't  Correct When someone is wrong , is not always necessary to correct them , especially when it could cause them embarrassment or discomfort . In such situations , its better to not say anything and let them save face , and not create tension. - <p> Uplift and Encourage Instead of pointing out the negative in what someone is saying or doing , strive to find the positive things about them . Uplift them by letting them know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Them Someone might be wrong , mean , or totally unfriendly , but you do n't  have to base the way you 're going to be , based on how they 're being . Appreciate that some experiences made them the way they are , in the same manner as certain experiences shaped you , and appreciate them for it. - <p> What Would They Like ? Ask yourself this question when formulating your response to someone . Instead of putting in your 2-cents , whether right or wrong , put in the answer that will bring a smile to their face . Today is too short to pass up any smile opportunities. - <p> Do n't  Judge Stop the machine in your head from trying to relate what people are saying to something you know to be true or not true , or evaluating their actions based on this subjective scale . Simply listen and be in the moment. - <p> Learn You do n't  know everything right ? Take this opportunity to learn from the people around you . Whether its what they 're saying , how they 're saying it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and learn . Take what you like about them and make off with it like a spy ! - <p> Life is a Game And , as such , we have to figure out the rules by which to win . An important one states that the more people we have that are friends , and think positively of us , the more chances for fulfillment and enjoyment we will have in our social interactions . Thus , be nice win at life . <p> This list does n't  do justice to all the different ways that we can react in a positive way to people . I 'm hoping that you 'll be able to help by filling in some of the ways that you would react , without overreacting or coming off as a juvenile . See you in the comments below ! <p> P.S. Do n't  send this list to people you think are overreacting . That would be in bad taste and would go against principles 4 and 8 .

@@2098866 <h> 5 Ways To Improve Your Quality of Life By Being More Childish . <p> Like a sponge ready to soak up all the world had to offer . Yet something happened in the process of growing up that turned you into a cynical , jaded and perhaps miserable adult . <p> Somewhere along the line you stopped seeing the world with a childs eyes . <p> Where there was once wonder and enthusiasm , now there is only work , bills , chores and endless to-do lists . Its not surprising that under a mountain of laundry and paperwork you havent had the time or energy to bounce around with the excitement of a five-year-old . But even terminally busy can incorporate a little bit of childhood magic into your daily life with these simple and easy to follow tips ! <p> 1 . Ask more questions . Children ask a lot of questions , up to 300 a day apparently ! Why is the sky blue ? Why do people die ? What is time ? Why are there no dinosaurs anymore ? What makes someone bad ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Moms ? Why does n't  space fall on us ? So why do so many of us adults ( or big-kids as I like to think ) stop asking questions ? But more importantly , why do we stop asking questions of ourselves ? - When you stop questioning the things that go on in your daily life " you are forever at the whim of other people . Stop asking questions and you effectively stop being in the driving seat of your own life . To take control you have to ask questions both of yourself and other people . <p> 2 . Love your flaws . Before society tells them its wrong children love showing family their bloated belly , saying " Look where all the food went ! " as they proudly poke their protruding tummy . So why not take a leaf out of their book and wind the clock back to a time when you did n't  feel ashamed of having a little extra flab around your middle ? <p> 3 . Learn something new everyday.You really have no excuse not to , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access all of the information you could ever want or need . As children we were always learning , its only when we grow up that some of us mistakenly believe that we do n't  need to learn anymore because we already have all the answers . Which of course we do n't ! So instead of sitting mindlessly in front of the TV to watch yet another episode of your latest TV addiction , you could do something interesting and productive which stimulates your curiosity , like reading a book , doing night classes at a community college , visiting a museum or learning a new language . <p> 4 . Get creative.Picasso was right when he said that " All children are artists , the problem is how to remain one once he grows up . " Children love finger-painting , drawing , crayoning walls , covering themselves in permanent marker basically anything that 's messy . But as you get older the inner perfectionist within starts to win-out , until eventually you give up on creativity altogether because you 're too terrified of making a messing up . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake they will simply paint over it or incorporate it into the rest of their drawing . But we live in a society which places such great emphasis on success that many of us finding ourselves acting only when we are certain of success wrapping ourselves in a false sense of comfort derived from the familiarity which surrounds us . So instead of running for the hills at the mere thought of picking up a paintbrush , perhaps introduce yourself slowly to whatever skill you feel drawn to , whether it be crochet or salsa dancing . Give creativity a chance you might be surprised by the results ! <p> 5 . Dream Big.When you ask a child , " What do you want to be when you grow up ? " they will tell you , " A world famous explorer ! " , " The mad-scientist who cures cancer ! " , " A pop-star ! " or perhaps even " A world-dominator ! " . Children have high hopes for their future , its only when we adults ( I scoff at being called an adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things are minimal , that they learn to have more realistic expectations of what their future career might involve . Its a crying shame that we laugh off the dreams of children as being hopelessly naive , we could all do with a bit more aspiration in our lives and reaching for the impossible is a damn sight better than sitting on your ass in front of screens all day . So let go of your doubts and let yourself think about those secret desires you hold so close to your heart . Yes , you might never reach the lofty goals you set for yourself but living a life in which you strived for excellence will leave you happier and with far fewer regrets than if you never gave them a chance and were always left wondering : What if ? <p> Blogger , crafter and candlemaker ! <p> Written on 10/7/2013 by Aimee King .

I had a summer job as a student where most of the staff were in the habit of taking a half hour walk during their lunch hour , and it was one of the happiest , healthiest places I 've ever worked ! <p> Make Your Commute Active This is n't possible for everyone , but most of us can manage to get some exercise in during our commute to and from work . If you do n't  have far to go , can you walk or cycle and leave the car at home ? ( You 'll save on gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long commute by train or bus , how about walking to the stop a little further from your house ? <p> The big advantage of an active commute is that it fits seamlessly into your day without using up extra time . Cycling is often faster than driving during rush hour traffic , and walking can be too , if you do n't  have far to go . <p> Exercise First Thing in the Morning Whenever you 're trying to establish a new habit , its a good idea to make it a priority in your day . If you get your exercising done first thing , you wo n't end up putting it off or deciding that you 've just had " too busy " a day to go to the gym . Morning exercise is often a more effective wake-up than coffee ! - <p> How about going for a quick jog before your shower , doing a routine from an exercise DVD at home , or even heading to the gym on your way to work ? <p> Exercise Straight After Work How often do you head home from work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner , only to find yourself still slumped on the sofa at 7PM ? Its often hard to get up the motivation to move once you 're home and comfy , so try going straight to the gym or the pool after work. - <p> If you can rope in some colleagues , you could get together for a game of baseball or a kick-around in the nearest park after work . Do n't  worry about skill levels ; the main thing is having fun and moving ! <p> Alternatively , book a badminton or basketball court at a nearby leisure center and arrange to meet a friend there after work . Its a healthy and fun alternative to meeting in a bar for post-work drinks , and itll come in cheaper too. - <p> Exercise With Your Kids Some of us , of course , have hectic days because were looking after kids as well as working ( or taking care of children full time ) . There are loads of great ways to get active alongside your kids , and theyll get the health benefits too. - <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going bowling ? Ice-skating or roller-blading rinks are very popular with kids too ( swallow your pride and throw yourself into having fun with them ) . Pick a weekend morning or afternoon to go on a family walk , exploring an area of countryside near you . <p> If you have very little ones , look out for parent-and-baby or parent-and-toddler exercise groups near you ( there 's a " Power Pramming " group that meets in a park near me ) . <p> What all of these point to is doing some planning , creating a routine , and sticking with it . Lack of time is one of the most common reasons we have for failing to workout or eat healthy so if you can squeeze out even 30 minutes every other day , your body will feel much better than it does today . <p> How are you fitting exercise into your life ?

@@2098868 <h> The Super Easy Approach to Decluttering your Home <p> All-in-all this was a great exercise . Although I was very skeptical , I came to terms with the fact that I simply was n't going to use any of this stuff ever again . I mean , my waist is a size 34 ? so my old jean shorts with a 30 ? waist were probably not going to be any more useful than the old GW BASIC manuals I found . <p> Now that were cleaned out , the trick will be to stay uncluttered . So let 's look at both sides : what to get rid of and how to keep clutter from piling up in the first place . <p> First , let 's unclutter . I am not indicating that you have to get rid of this stuff , this is just a sample of what I did . Maybe it will give you an idea or two . <p> Its worth nothing The first thing to hit the donation pile was my Atari 2600 , Nintendo , and Super Nintendo . Along with all the games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap . Before you say it was worth something , know that I routinely beat the heck out of these machines when I 'd lose games ( it was a long time ago , I 'm not violent ! ) . They were all pretty banged up and they have been sitting in the same spot for 10 years collecting dust ! - <p> Old School My 1993-2003 wardrobe I have no idea why I kept it this long . However , I am pretty sure that I am not going to toss on a Miami Vice/Don Johnson outfit anytime soon . If you have n't worn the clothes in the last year , it may be safe to get rid of them . The funniest part about this is that I had these old clothes jammed into the same closet with the clothes I wear today . All this did was make getting dressed each morning a battle to pull something from the closet . Now that the old stuff is gone , all I have hanging up are things I really do wear. - <p> Ex-Girlfriends Maybe I am a romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of photos and memorabilia from my ex-girlfriends . Pictures , cards , old high school prom trinkets , etc . Listen , memories are great but when you get married or even if you are a single and in your twenties , consider dumping some of this stuff . I personally found no reason to keep any of it . Its not as if I grab a bottle of Jack and reminisce about the old days . If I ever need to , I am sure my parents have plenty of pictures for me. - <p> Old Data While I did have a ton of old cassette tapes and term papers , the data I am talking about here is users manuals . Believe it or not , I still had MS-DOS manuals . Keep in mind , this was before digital anything so a DOS manual was easily 7 inches thick , in a binder , and a boring read . I even found a manual for GW Basic and the 18 install floppies for WordPerfect 3.1. - <p> Old PCs If I had old manuals for DOS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboards , monitors , etc . Even though my iPod has more memory than those PCs , I donated them . If that wasnt bad enough , I still had the boxes these PCs came in. - <p> Hogan Yes , at one point in my life I was a workout nut . Until last weekend , I kept a collection of close to 300 lbs of free weights , a full bench , bars , etc . Do you know how much room that took up ? The spider webs alone weighed 15 lbs . These went to Play it Again Sports so I could at least collect some cash when they sell. - <p> Broken stuff I had all sorts of things from broken coffee makers , to TVs , to lawn mowers . I saved all of these things because I believed that one day , I 'd use the parts for something . Come on , let 's get real . I am not Mr. Fix-it and I am not about to write an Instructable. - <p> Old Bills Do you know that I had water bills from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old paperwork everything from bills to loan applications . Before you go nuts , you should read up on what you need to retain. - <p> So there are a few things to look out for . If you do n't  want to toss it in the garbage , and you can hit up the usual suspects if you want to sell some of this stuff ( ebay , craiglist ) . <p> Next I 'll explain how we did it and how we intend to prevent a mass decluttering in the future . It may seem basic and I thought so too . However , if its so simple , why are we surrounded by junk ? <p> Skimming Rooms Do n't  skim . When you walk into a room with the intention of decluttering , seriously look in every drawer and closet empty them all out and consider every item . Heck , look under the bed too ! If you see something that has no sentimental value and has n't  been used in a year , get rid of it. - <p> Shredding We shred close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a chore when you receive 58 credit card offers each week , insurance quotes , etc . At the end of any given week , set aside time to shred . On occasion , I have actually thrown all of this garbage in the fireplace and burned it . I do n't  care what you do , just do n't  let it build up to the point of having to invest 3 hours on a Saturday shredding. - <p> Slow down We did n't  declutter the house in 2 hours , this was a full days work . Take your time and concentrate on one room at a time . Get rid of old magazines , blankets , winter coats , and anything that you honestly do n't  think will have any value in a year. - <p> When the time changes They ( not sure who they is ) say that you should change your smoke detector batteries every time the time changes to/from Daylight savings . That is our new declutter indicator as well . Twice a year , were going room-to-room and getting rid of stuff. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Target , resist the urge to buy that picture frame that 's 40% off . If you have a real need for it , fine , but accumulating stuff just because you got a deal is going to lead to clutter . We are going to try to get rid of 1 item for every new item we purchase . This will admittedly be tough . <p> Magazines When you get new phone books or magazines , recycle the old ones . This is so simple but I somehow ended up with a stack of old Business Week , Maxim , and Sports Illustrated magazines . Most were found in the drawers of the nightstand and in bathroom cabinets. - <p> Gifts We all get birthday or holiday gifts that we do n't  want . Do n't  just toss them in a closet somewhere . Either re-gift them or toss them on Freecycle. - <p> Train your Kids This has worked wonderfully . Each time my kids ask for a new toy , I simply ask them which old toy they want to donate to charity . When we get home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put it in the car so we can drop it off at a Salvation Army drop box . Not only are they learning to donate , they are not contributing to the clutter problem. - <p> Touch it once This is almost a time trick but it really applies to clutter as well . When you grab a screwdriver for example , use it and put it back in its correct spot when you are done . I was in the habit of tossing it on the kitchen counter and ultimately it ended up in the junk drawer along with a ton of other miscellaneous items . <p> If you 've found a tactic working for you , let me know in the comments . This is a tough battle and its very easy to accumulate garbage because you 're sentimental or think you 'll need it later . If you are n't  going to use something in the next year , do you really need it ? <p> Originally written in 2007 by me , Jay White , the founder of Dumb Little Man and an all around average guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and share it all over again .

@@2098875 <h> 7 Ways To Manage Your Email Like An Expert <p> Hence today I decided to list 7 simple ways to better manage your email and increase your productivity while dealing with your inbox . These are the methods that I have followed and they have helped me a lot . Before I start , I 'd like to mention that these ways are only for those who get less than 300 to 400 emails ( excluding spam ) a day . If you get more , then I strongly suggest you to immediately hire someone else like a virtual assistant , to manage your email . <p> For the rest of you , here are the ways to manage your email like an expert : <p> Set a time frame : This is very important ; it is easy to lose track of time while checking your mail . In between the deleting and replying , you simply lose track of time and find later that 4 hours has slipped by . You could probably set 3 slots of 20-30 minutes each , during different times of the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracking tools to keep track of your time . <p> Use Gmail : If you are using a different web based email then waste no time in switching to Gmail . It will make you much more productive . You could also switch to Gmail without changing your original email address , which is probably preferred . Here is an article that explains how to do it . <p> I advocate the use of Gmail , not as a die-hard Gmail fan , but as someone who has tried out various email clients in the past 5 years and found that nothing else compares . It has some amazing features including filters and keyboard shortcuts and if you use a desktop client like Outlook or Thunderbird , then Gmail also provides for IMAP access which makes life easier . <p> Prioritize using Labels / Folders : Its important to differentiate the important mails from the unimportant ones . If you use Gmail , then you can set filters which will do the job automatically by applying labels or re-routing the incoming mail . In all the other email clients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email as well . You can make folders named " friends " , " Reply today " , etc. and when you open your inbox , immediately start shifting mails to their respective folders. - <p> Be Precise : Be precise and to the point when answering emails . You could even skip Hello and Regards if you want ; I do n't  think anyone will mind it . Learn to use one-liners effectively . If you use web-based email and Firefox as your browser , then there are some add-ons like Paste Email which helps you to paste repetitive texts in forms or emails with one or two clicks. - <p> Delete Ruthlessly : You can easily conclude from the subject line of an email if its worth reading . If it is n't , delete it without thinking twice . If you slack , thinking that you probably might read it later , then believe me , that email will remain there as unread until you finally decide to do away with it . Act upon the email the first time you see it by either responding immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish at a specific time. - <p> Do n't  leave it for the next day : Try and finish replying to the emails and clearing your inbox within the time frame you decided . I know , its not always possible , especially if you get more than 100 emails a day , but if the emails go pending then the next day it becomes much more difficult for you to sift through your inbox . Think of your inbox like a snowball , the more it rolls , the larger it gets.Tip for Outlook users from Jay : If you receive an email that you want to address tomorrow , right click on it and drag it to your task pad . You can then assign a due date and a priority level . Heck , you can even assign it to someone else on your team . If you constantly do that , you 'll have a good task list to work from and a clean inbox . This will completely remove the constant inbox browsing that you 're doing now ; not only is that habit unproductive but its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time or if its a critical task , drag it to your calendar instead and actually create an appointment with yourself to dedicate time to it . <p> Replace the source : Inspite of trying out the aforementioned 6 steps , if you still find it difficult to manage your email , then check the source of emails and try to replace it with something more useful . For example , if you get tons of emails from the contact form in your website , then identify the major concern which visitors have and then publish something on your website which will help those visitors , thereby helping to reduce your incoming email flow. - <p> Email is a great tool if you learn how to manage it . Unfortunately most people are managed by their email . Get it under control by implementing some of these tips .

@@2098876 <h> 4 Ways to Start Building Great Credit <p> Good credit is a privilege that comes with great responsibility . However , - before lenders can give you this type of privilege , they need to first check on your reputation as a borrower . <p> This is where your credit scores and credit reports come into play . Having excellent credit will allow you to receive better benefits and perks with lower interest rates and higher limits . <p> But , what if you have low credit scores or- some- negative marks on your credit reports ? <p> Lenders may still grant your credit request , - but it can come with a lower limit and steeper fees . The idea is that the lower the risk you are to a lender , the better benefits you can get . <p> Here are- four of the best- ways you can use to start building- great credit . <h> 1 . Understand &amp; Lower Your Credit Utilization <p> This is where a lot of people get hung up . And since it accounts for 30% of your FICO score , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say- you have a credit card with a credit limit of $2,000 . Instead of paying it off each month , you 've been carrying a balance of around $1,200 . <p> If we divide that $1,200 by $2,000 , we- get- 60% . If this is your only credit card , this means that you 're already- utilizing 60% of your total credit . <p> To start building better credit , - you can try- lowering your utilization to under 10% , if possible . For most people , however , keeping it under 30% is- more realistic and manageable . <h> 2 . Increase Your Credit Card Limits <p> Raising your credit limits can have a profound effect on your credit since it will give you more freedom when it comes to its- utilization . Increasing your cards limit can be as easy as calling your credit card provider either through email or phone . <p> I recommend doing this once every six months . You can keep asking for as long as you want to keep increasing your limits or until your issuer wont increase your limits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards and you 're getting pinged with hard inquiries , then it might be a good idea to space out your requests to avoid having to answer to lots of inquiries in a short amount of time . <h> 3 . Become an Authorized User of a Credit Card <p> If you 're struggling to build better credit- on your own , see if a family member or trusted friend can- add you as an authorized user of his or her open credit card . - Although you 'll be able to use the account , you need to remember that the primary account holder will still be liable in case you do n't  get to pay your debt . <p> To avoid conflicts , try to negotiate the payment details with the account owner first . If he has a poor standing in his account or if there are any delinquent credit card activities , these data- can reflect in your credit reports , too . <h> 4 . Open a Credit Builder Loan <p> This last option is for those people who have bad- credit but are looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical credit builder loan can cost around- $500 . <p> If you get approved , your- bank will deposit the money into a savings account .

The proper circle of friends for you can be a lot more than a bunch of people you hang out with or tweet to . Having the right friends can mean : <p> Very fun experiences together , you look forward to every time ; <p> A powerful connection , based on your core common points ; <p> A deep sense of respect and appreciation for each other ; <p> The ability to be comfortable , authentic and open with them ; <p> Knowing you have your back covered by great people . <p> In practice , very few people experience these kinds of things with their friends . I believe this happens a lot because most people build their circle of friends in a reactive way .

This step allows you to filter the people you interact with and the time you dedicate to each one , to maximize the positive outcomes . <p> Pick up a pen and paper , and actually write down these traits , after you think about them really well . But make sure you do n't write too many traits ; otherwise you 'll create such a strong filter you 'll end up with no circle of friends . <p> Get out there Once you decide what kind of people you want to befriend , it 's time to go out and meet them .

Pick the right ones , get out there and be sociable . <p> Say yes and noMeeting new people and discovering some you enjoy interacting with is usually not enough to make new friends . You need to have more interactions with these people to continue getting to know each other and see where it goes . Take the initiative ; ask people out for coffee or lunch , throw a party , talk on the phone if you like it , and so on. - <p> At the same time , it 's important to cut down on the interactions with people who are already in your social circle and you realize they do not really fit the friend profile you 're looking for .

From people who mildly irritate us to someone we genuinely ca n't stand , these situations provide challenges and opportunities . <p> How can you handle these kinds of situations ? Many people will be reactive , immediately responding according to their learned subconscious scripts . For example , many people will get angry and start to attack the aggressor ; others will be upset and hurt and will withdraw from the situation as quickly as possible , perhaps harboring some resentment for a long time into the future . <p> The effective person , however , will be conscious of these scripts and will choose to be proactive , effectively managing the gap which exists between stimulus and response , about which Viktor Frankl writes so movingly and passionately in Man 's Search for Meaning . <p> How you deal with the situation , however , will need to depend on how important the situation is " if it 's someone you need to work with then you 'll have to put in a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see very often . <p> If you see the person a lot , or you need to work with them , you 're going to have to find a way of building a relationship of some sort . The alternative is a poisonous and destructive situation , which will eat away at you over time . <p> We have a tendency to think that our way of seeing the world is accurate or correct . ' However , there are many different types of people , all with a different way of seeing things . According to the American Psychologist David Keirsey , there are sixteen different personality types , and this does not take into account such things as gender difference , differences in age , nationality or culture . It is little wonder then that we do n't get along with everybody .

If you are open minded , it can give you a whole new perspective , and it will probably disarm the objectionable other to the extent that you can begin to communicate . <p> This being said , there are many difficult people who crop up in life who are not going to be around for too long or who are not really important to us . In cases like these , you might find the following simple tips helpful . <p> Keep it in perspective Although you should listen to and see what you can learn from them , the opinions ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived your life except you and nobody is in exactly your shoes " you are unique . Sometimes advice is given with the best of intentions , but it is often not really a best fit ' for your situation . Of course , people have various agendas and axes to grind , and there are as many opinions and criticisms as there are people to give them ( probably more ! ) So my advice would be to take all advice and criticism with a big pinch of salt . <p> Do n't be defensive Like everyone else , you are trying to do the best you can . You are ( probably ) not deliberately trying to be mean or selfish or cruel , or to make someone else 's life difficult . So there is no need to be defensive .

When someone complains about you , remember the words of Benjamin Franklin , who said Any fool can criticize , condemn and complain and most fools do . ' <p> Look for the lesson you can learn , especially about yourself Often , people we find difficult can reveal a great deal about ourselves . Ask yourself some searching questions and try to answer honestly . Why do I react to this person in this way ? Am I being sensitive about something ? Am I trying to hide something ?

No matter who you are , each of us have our times when we feel shy .

Some of us become reclusive . Some of us turn into introverts . And some of us try to evade the situation altogether . While these actions make you feel " safe " , doing them are n't  exactly constructive . For example , you can hide from an awkward situation , but you gain nothing out of it except for self-perceived safety . While you can keep turning down social invitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be the same person . You 'll not be able to grow as a person nor build new social connections . <p> So rather than avoid such situations , why not work on addressing your shyness instead ? There are times when I feel shy , and when that happens I confront the feeling , address it and move boldly inline with my desires . I find that whenever I do that , the experience is so much more fruitful . Instead of being dictated by your shyness , you can now be empowered to make your own decisions , to say what 's on your mind , and to be who you really are . Overcoming your shyness is n't impossible its really all a matter of taking the right steps . Here , I 'll share with you 8 simple steps to overcome your shyness and emerge an empowered self : <p> Know what 's causing the shyness What are the situations that trigger your shyness ? Despite what you may think , you 're not shy all the time . For example , when you 're with your best friend , you 're probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerges when you 're in certain situations . <p> Start off by being aware of what 's causing the shyness . Identify 5 incidences from the past where you felt shy . It can be when you 're alone with a stranger , whenever a certain topic is being discussed , when you 're with a large crowd , and so on . Then , analyze these situations . What is it about these situations that 's causing you to feel shy ? Realize that shyness is the effect of feeling insecure . If you can identify what you 're feeling insecure about , you can then take action on it . <p> Improve on your areas of insecurity After identifying your areas of insecurity , the next step is to take action on them . For example , perhaps you are shy when it comes to presentations at work . If that 's the case , then work on improving your presentation skills ! Practice doing it again and again . Invest your 10,000 hours of hard work its been said that 10,000 hours is the average time experts spend to be the best at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecure about , your shyness will naturally dissipate . <p> Taking myself as an example , I used to be fearful of public speaking when I was young . However when I went into university , I gained more experience in public speaking through class presentations . Later on when I went to corporate work , I was doing it on weekly basis . As I did it more regularly , I became better in presenting , and the fear just disappeared . Today , I conduct training workshops at least once a month for my personal development business , and its already part of my routine . While I definitely have not spent 10,000 hours speaking to date , its clear that the time I spent speaking from before has made me more proficient in speaking , which in turn addressed my shyness in the area . <p> Identify your strengths Many of us tend to focus on what were not good at , rather than recognize what we are good at . As a result , we feel awkward around others , because we feel there 's nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short and start focusing on your strengths . <p> What are you good at ? What are your past achievements ? What are things you 've done that you are really proud of ? Spend some time to recognize them . Youll be surprised to see the huge list of things you are good at . There are so many great things about yourself that you 've become blind to because you 're took them for granted . Knowing your strengths helps you to be more confident of yourself . Remember , all of us are true winners in our own right . <p> Objectify the situation Many people worry too much about what others think about them . Whenever I work with clients on building their self-confidence , its always invariably linked with being afraid of what someone else thinks of them or will think of them . They do n't  want to do X because they 're afraid what person Y will say . They are at a loss of words with Y because they 're afraid what Y will think of their thoughts . <p> But the funny thing is , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy thinking about themselves to pay attention to what you 're doing or not doing . While you 're worrying about your behavior , others are actually too busy worrying about their behaviors and opinions of themselves to think about what you 're doing ! Hence , there 's nothing to feel shy about . Your shyness is merely a result of over scrutinizing yourself of which you 're the only person who does that . When you take an objective viewpoint , it becomes clear your shyness is unfounded . Rather than focus on an disempowering emotion , you can now focus on what you want to achieve . <p> Have a role model Can you think of someone you know ( whether a friend or a famous person ) who is very confident , assured and outgoing ? Use the person as your role model . By identifying a real life person who is not bounded by shyness , it becomes easy for you to break through the confines of shyness , because there is a reference point . Whenever you feel shy , ask yourself what that person will do/say in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes second nature to you to behave in that manner . <p> Ask questions Asking questions is a simple trick I discovered that works very well . Sometimes , you may feel awkward because you do n't  know what to say/do . If so , just ask a question to the other party . For example , it can be a simple question like " What do you think about this ? " or " Why do you say that ? " or " Can you tell me more about yourself ? " In doing so , it immediately shifts the attention from you to the other party . As the other person gathers his/her thoughts and answers your question , you can take the time to regroup and compose yourself . By the time he/she finishes speaking , you 'll be in a good position to continue the interaction . <p> Observe how others interact A great way to overcome shyness is to observe how others around you act . Reduce the time you spend worrying about how others perceive you ( again , remember its all in your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What do they say ? How do they act ? What can you learn from them ? How can you apply these learnings to your future interactions ? <p> Take the first step While it may seem counter-intuitive , taking the 1st step actually helps you overcome your shyness . Firstly , when you consciously take action , its a personal testament that you have personal power over the situation . Secondly , by first taking action , you experience the positive benefits of your actions , which sets in place a forward momentum . For example when I run my workshops , I notice that the participants who are the 1st to introduce themselves end up being the most vocal and active participants for the whole workshop , even though I present everyone with the same opportunity to speak . <p> Your first step neednt be complicated it can just be going up and saying hi . Once you take the small step forward , the rest will follow in its stead . <p> How can you apply the 8 steps above to overcome your shyness ? Feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMMENT <p> I agree , winning the war with shyness takes practice , but is definitely well worth the effort as the result is increasing confidence and self esteem . Wake up feeling good about yourself , able to face the world with confidence and security and the knowing that no feeling of shyness can come in your way of achieving your desires . There are hundreds of books written on the subject of how beat shyness and gain confidence , but there are a few techniques that anyone can practice .

@@2098886 <h> Break the Argument Cycle Once and For All <p> After a big fight with your spouse , co-worker , family member , or house-mate , you swear to yourself that you 're not going to let anger get the best of you again . But then what happens the next time ? You bump into this person somewhere and immediately your physiology and your mindset to change . You can feel your mood begin to sour like lemon juice being poured into milk . Your face transforms to stone , your body tenses , and your mind braces for the expected aggravation . Where does this leave you ? Primed for your next argument ! <p> Why does this happen ? The biggest factor is our expectations : <p> We expect this person to do things that will bother us . <p> We replay the last argument in our mind and expect a repeat . <p> We want and expect that the person should change the behaviors that get under our skin . <p> We know they wo n't , so we envision the next fight without even realizing it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if were completely honest with ourselves , we would actually be a bit disappointed if we were wrong . So we cling onto any little shred that proves our expectations right , and then we launch into fight mode for which we have prepared so well . We set ourselves up for failure . <p> Breaking the CycleSo , how can we break the argument cycle ? Its really quite simple . Change your expectations . Is it easy ? No , but you can do it . How ? Write down what the person does that bothers you . Why does it bother you ? How can you re-frame these experiences so that they do n't  set you off ? Try to understand why the other person does the things that they do and figure out how you can melt your irritation . Let 's look at an example . <p> Let 's say that every evening when you come home from work , your spouse launches into a tirade of complaints , negative comments , and problems she needs solved . After years of this , you now have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens . You feel she should greet you with a smile , some positive energy , and save the problem requests for after dinner . Youve worked hard all day , fought your way home through traffic , and the last thing you want to be greeted with is more problems . You get mad because you 've asked her not to do this many times . She thinks you do n't  care . The scenario keeps repeating . So how can you make the situation better without her changing ? <p> Change your expectations . Expect that your spouse will not be changing . Put yourself in your spouses shoes . Why does she complain and discuss problems as soon as you get home ? Maybe its because she is tired and frustrated and is looking for support . Stop expecting your wife to change this habit . Instead , find a way to understand it and change how you view it . Ask yourself how you could use this opportunity to love and support her . Once you change how you see the situation , you will be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside of you . <p> Obviously , you could also discuss together ways to change this pattern , and that might help too . But there will always be things about people that we do n't  like and that most likely we cant change . <p> Why does Joe always make projects bigger than they need to be ? <p> Why does Karen always buy more things than she needs ? <p> Why cant Louis stop working so hard ? <p> Why is Mary always late ? <p> Instead of being irritated by these things , accept them . Try to focus your thoughts on all the good things about that person . Do n't  try to change them . If they ask for help , go ahead and help , but if they do n't  , just accept who they are . If there is a behavior that is unacceptable to you then you may need to move on from the relationship . But if its something that only irritates you , try to see if you can shift your focus and simply enjoy that person instead , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helpful Tips <p> 1 . Become aware of your triggers . Here are some common ones that may be affecting you : exhaustion , pain , worry , too much caffeine , sugar , alcohol , hormonal changes , and stress . Do you experience any of these before an argument ? What are the precursors that lead up to an argument for you ? <p> 2 . Establish ways to handle those triggers ahead of time . Once you are in touch with what sets you off , you can establish a plan to head off those triggers before they cause you to lose emotional control . So , for instance , if you know that you are more likely to get into an argument when you arrive home from work exhausted , you might want to change something in your routine . Maybe you meditate in your office or your car before you go home . Maybe you ask your spouse for 20 minutes of quiet time alone before greeting each other . Or maybe you get more sleep . The key with whatever plan you design is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they can get the best of you . <p> 3 . Walk away if your emotions are in the red zone . You probably know the difference between being mildly irritated and being flaming mad . If your emotions are really hot , then walk away to release that energy in a way that wo n't cause harm . Maybe you go for a walk . Maybe you call a confidant who is good at listening and helping you to return to a reasonable state of mind . Maybe you write things down so you can clearly understand what caused you to get angry in the first place . That 's when solutions for moving forward in a positive manner will become evident . <p> 4 . Discuss solutions later when your emotions have cooled . Keep in mind that the person may not be able or willing to change . The solution may need to be a change in you and how you perceive the situation . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79 
@@2098887 <h> How I Got Started on a Fitness Plan and Lost 70 Pounds <p> The hardest part about getting in shape is getting started . Yes its a cliche , but it also happens to be absolutely true . Unfortunately , I spent years and years of my life wishing I could somehow lose weight and get fit . Guess what . It never happened . <p> I learned that I never took the time to get serious about my goals and figure out how I was going to get there . Weighing in at 234 lbs , I finally decided to get serious about fitness . I created a simple plan of eating less and exercising more . In the practical application of this , I learned a lot about the " dos " and " donts " of starting out with a fitness plan . <p> I hope these will help you on your quest . <h> Here is the " Do " column : <p> Keep Track of What You Eat I cant stress enough how helpful this has been for me in losing weight . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body on a daily basis , I was pretty much on a free-for-all . Unknowingly , I was most likely consuming upwards of 1,000 calories more than what my body type required . Needless to say , I began packing on the weight pretty fast. - <p> Start Making Easy Substitutions After you have begun keeping track of your daily intake , the next step is to start making some simple dietary substitutions toward healthier and lower calorie options . For example , if you usually have a Coke with your meals , choose water instead . If you normally take your coffee with plenty of cream and sugar , start drinking it black . I could go on and on here . The point is to get your calorie consumption down in simple , easy to manage substitutions . Do n't  worry about eating nothing but salads or some other super restrictive diet . The goal is to keep it simple and sustainable . <p> Add Some Form of Daily Exercise The simple math behind losing weight is to burn more calories than you take in . You burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain its normal functions . Your body also burns calories through exercise . If you begin a simple routine of 30-60 minutes of extra activity everyday ( or every other day if you 'd like to start a little slower ) you will be taking steps toward a sustainable physically active routine and burning off tons of calories. - <p> Tell Someone When I was starting out , I totally neglected this piece of advice to my detriment . I was afraid that I would fail at losing any weight and did n't  want others to know about my plans if I was n't going to succeed . However , looking back , I could have really used the encouragement and support of others along the way . Sure , the fear of public failure is pretty motivating in and of itself , but more importantly , I would have greatly benefited from the encouragement of my friends and family . Do n't  be too prideful to ask for help or support . Getting in shape is important for everyone to do and there is no need for us to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started losing weight , I knew that I had a long way to go . In fact , I 've lost about 70 pounds from where I was this time two years ago . However , my initial goal was n't to drop all that weight at once . I started by setting a target of 15 pounds . I had no idea how long it would take or if I would even make it . But after I lost my first 15 ( using the tips above ) I set my goal for another 15 pounds . I continued setting and achieving weight loss goals until I got to where I am today . If you have a lot to lose , or just a little , breaking it up into manageable chunks is much easier on you and will keep you from getting discouraged . <h> Now let 's look at some of the Donts <p> Do n't  Overdo Exercise A common problem for many getting started in a regular fitness routine is overdoing their exercise too soon . You will burn yourself out and be left with little to no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begin slow by adding 30-60 minutes of moderate activity per day . This way you can build a base of physical activity that you can build on . <p> Do n't  Overly Restrict Your Calories Another common mistake for newcomers is to restrict their diet in extreme ways . If you are just starting out , do n't  force yourself into painful dieting habits . Start by making simple substitutions and resist the urge to eat next to nothing or skipping meals . These practices are dangerous and provide no sustainable results . If you are eating too few calories then your body will think it is starving . When your body enters this " starvation mode " it begins hoarding calories and it becomes much more difficult to lose any weight at all . As a general rule , I would never recommend anyone eat fewer than 1,500 calories a day , regardless of their body type ( unless instructed by a physician ) . <p> Do n't  Criticize Yourself For Slip Ups When you are new at something , you are going to make mistakes . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day " every once in a while this is OK too . The important thing to remember is that you are taking steps to gradually get yourself into a better place physically . If you act like a drill sergeant and beat yourself up over every little slip up , the process is going to be long and painful . Relax . Breathe . Get back on the horse . Everyday is a new beginning for making better choices . <p> Do n't  Expect Huge Results Immediately Getting in shape is a process . You are n't  going to notice any results , whether its weight loss or muscle building , overnight . I suggest weighing yourself only once a week . Do this at the same time every week to get the most accurate results . If after a week or two , you do n't  notice any positive change , increase the intensity of your regimen slightly . It took me over a year to lose my weight . If I had expected it all to come off in a month I would have been sorely disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick battle . <p> Do n't  Buy In To Fads There is no magic bullet for getting healthy . No matter what you see on TV , getting in better shape takes work and discipline . I bought exactly zero supplements , pills , and marketed weight loss strategies . I did n't  buy a single piece of exercise equipment other than a few weights and some running shoes . The only time-tested strategy for losing weight is to consume fewer calories than you burn . For me , this took the form of eating less and exercising more . Its simple and it just works . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

Many of us have tried and failed , and tried and failed , and tried and ended up binging on Big Macs blended with ice cream , etc&lt; What we usually do is say , " After this bucket of KFC Chicken , I 'm not eating this crap anymore ! " Then we purge our house of all things sugary , we eat salads and whole wheat for about 3 days and then cave in the first time we drive past a Taco Bell . Where is the will power , the drive , the ambition you had a couple days ago ? <p> That 's because we try to stop eating junk food without thinking about it without planning our escape . <p> What we should do is worry about changing our habits . As Leo Babautamentioned over at Zen Habits , forging new habits takes time and energy . If we want to kick our junk food habits well have to give both . That 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time <p> give each change at least 2 weeks to become ingrained <p> After all , we 've spent years building up these habits , we cant expect to take them down overnight . Well do it smart , slow and consistent and well kick junk food to the curb . <p> I 'm going to separate the tasks into kicking crap snacks , kicking fast food and kicking pop ( soda to you philistines ) . Pick whichever will be easiest for you and do that first . A taste of success is incredibly motivating . Then do the one that will be hardest second while you 're on an upswing . <p> Kick the Pop Habit <p> This ones probably the simplest . Not the easiest , but the simplest . You just keep downgrading every 2-4 weeks . Essentially switching terrible habits for bad and then switching bad for good . <p> Regular -to- Diet : First switch from regular to diet pop and leave it at that for at least 2 weeks . I know that some people say diet is just as bad as regular but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time were fighting our sugar addiction . Remember we want to change habits in stages to have the highest chance of success . <p> Diet -to- Caffeine Free Diet : If you do have a caffeine addiction this is where you 'll find out . You 're going to have about 3 days of feeling like a hangover mouth tastes while your body breaks the physical addiction . But stay on it for the full 2 weeks , we do n't  want to change too much too fast . <p> Caffeine Free Diet -to- Flavored Water/Water : Now were moving into healthy territory . If you ca n't stand drinking water I 'm not going to lecture you . Just drink the flavored water with 0 calories they have now , its just as good ( if you do n't  mind paying for it ) . If you want you can use that as a jumping off point to regular water but either way you should be loosing weight and feeling better than when you were drinking pop . <p> Kick Fast Food <p> How do we beat crack for the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . How about this : <p> At the end of one week , you can add them all up and get a pretty good idea of how much you 're spending on this crap . Round that up to the nearest $10 and cut it in half . That 's how much you 'll spend a week from now on . <p> Take that money and put it in a ziplock bag that you keep in your car . All your fast food will be paid for out of this fund , and when it dries up , that 's it until next week . This will force you to ration and make choices . <p> Let it sink in for 2 weeks and do n't  forget to plan this out . Something has to replace all that fast food you 're suddenly not eating . I suggest : <p> Keep something in your car to eat on the way home from work , like an apple or some nuts something filling and always ready . <p> Have some frozen meals ready at home so you never wonder what you 're going to eat tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try those frozen skillets something balanced and quick . <p> Then , when this new habit is a part of you , cut that dollar amount again , and again , and again until you 're happy with how much ( how little ) fast food you 're eating . I think under $10 a week is OK for most people . <p> Kick Crap Snacks <p> The first step to kicking crappy snack foods is doing a food inventory . What do you have in your kitchen ? Cookies , chips , candy ? And what are you eating them for ? Which are your comfort food ? Stress foods ? <p> Then were going to make a chart of all these snacks and for each one list a replacement snack . For example instead of potato chips you could eat tortilla chips with salsa . Now you can switch a crappy snack for its healthier replacement . But no more than one every two weeks ( pacing ) . Make yourself eat the new food daily so it becomes a part of your lifestyle and remember to snack before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process but here 's a few tips to make it go smoother : <p> If you have a craving for a crap snack that you absolutely have to give in to , buy an individual portion or eat just enough to satisfy your craving and throw out the rest . Keeping it around is crap-snack sabotage . <p> If you have a sweet tooth , proportion something into bites and eat them after a healthy snack . For example cut a snickers bar into 8ths and keep each individually wrapped in the freezer , then eat one after you 've filled up on popcorn . That gives you that sweet taste without having to fill up that sweet crap . <p> The three keys to kicking junk food are planning , pacing and sticking to it .

In the 30 mile radius around my house , there has to be at least 4 Ferris wheels begging kids to entice their parents to come in and blow $100 trying to win a $2 stuffed animal . Tonight , I decided that enough was enough . I am sharing information given to me by a game operator at a Carnival in Rosemont , IL . Their carnival was up about a month ago . <p> Here is how you can beat a few of those popular Carnival schemes : <p> The Ladder Game : I have easily dropped $100 on this game over the last 2 years . The trick to beating this game is to avoid touching the rungs of the ladder . Your hands and feet should ALWAYS be on the rope . The rungs provide a false sense of security and in reality , they throw off the balance of the ladder . Just be sure to apply an equal amount of weight to each side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed help . I did it 3 times in a row at a carnival and then I was asked to leave the game . <p> The ole machine gun shooting a star : This game is pretty much BS but we all want to be Rambo right ? The ONLY way to ever beat this game is if you shoot a complete circle around the star . Most people try to start at the center and move out because by nature , hitting the center means you have good aim ( darts , etc . ) . In this game , you can forget that . You simply do n't  have enough pellets to hit the middle and move out . <p> Basketball Shot : Come on , we all know that rim is tight and the backboard is made of pure steel . The key here is is to , like Jordan , hit nothing but net . A bank shot off the backboard will generally rebound crazily because of its composition . NOW .. you have to know that the rim on these is anywhere from .5 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you better do a little King James and hit it . If not , you 're cooked . <p> Dart games : If you have your own darts like I do , bring them . Most Carnies will let you use them . If not , just throw the dart towards the middle of the board and use an arc . Do n't  aim because Carnie darts are seriously designed to fade fast , meaning they will plummet . Aim high and let er rip ! . <p> Those are the tips provided straight from a game operator at a carnival .

Before a trip I procrastinated and had to pack at the last minute so I threw everything into my suitcase while the clothes were still in the dry cleaners plastic bags . Guess whatno wrinkles not at all . <p> So that is the first tip : Keep your suits , shirts , and pants in dry cleaning bags to avoid wrinkles . <p> Amazed at the simplicity of this , I was convinced I was missing out on more packing tips . I looked around last night for some other tips and here is what I found : <p> From Fodors : <p> Lighten your load . Jamming your suitcases as full as a subway at rush hour will leave your clothes as exhausted as a crushed commuter . Clothes become wrinkled almost as soon as you shove that last leaden item into your bag . The easiest things to jettison ? Hairdryers and clothes irons . Almost every hotel room ( and hostel ) in the world has these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you remember only one word in your packing efforts , this is the one . And here 's why : friction causes wrinkling , plastic reduces friction . Its that easy . The best way to utilize this basic plastic physics is with dry-cleaner bags . All hanger items should be packed in individual bags ( one outfit per dry-cleaner bag ) . Clothes arrive in a perfectly preserved state . Really ! Another great plastic tip : zip-top baggies . Use these for dirty shoes , shampoo bottles , or anything else you want to isolate from your good clothes . <p> Rolling , rolling , rolling . You have two options for items that you 're not hanging : folding or rolling . Rolling is a great space-saving and wrinkle-reducing choice for jeans and T-shirts . here 's how you do it : take a pair of jeans and fold them lengthwise so that the legs are stacked on top of each other . Now , starting from the cuff , roll your way up . For T-shirts , place face down , fold arms back ( you should now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll up . <p> Fold it . For sweaters and other non-T tops , the square fold is the way to go . here 's a quick primer : button all buttons and lay shirts face down on a bed or flat surface . Smooth away wrinkles . Fold material in at the shoulders and lay arms flat along the body so that you create a roughly two-inch overlap of material on both sides . Now fold up a third of the material from the bottom and overlap a third from the top . You should now have a tidy package worthy of any chain retailer . <p> Delicate situation . What to do with your undies and lingerie ? Buy inexpensive mesh laundry bags ; they 're made of nylon and are lightweight . Stow your delicates in here . An added bonus : if your bag is inspected , no one need touch your underwear since an inspector will be able to see into the bag . Socks , by the way , should be rolled up and placed inside shoes or used to fill gaps in your bag ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take all your tidily arrayed garments and put them outside your bag . Your goal is to use them to create a clothing jigsaw puzzle where no empty spaces remain and items wo n't shift . Lay your bag flat and put folded clothes in piles down the center . Put your toiletries kit at what will be the bottom of your bag when its standing ( this should now be the heaviest item in your bag ; in this position it wont crush other items ) . Rolled clothes fit into the spaces around the stacked clothes . Single shoes should be tucked into remaining openings ( remember , shoes are n't  friends ; they do n't  need to travel right up next to each other ) . Socks fill in remaining holes . Voila ! You are now a wrinkle-free savvy traveler ! <p> The theory behind the interlock , which works best with standard suitcases and travel packs , is that each piece of clothing folds over or is cushioned by another piece . Its really quite simple : <p> Lay a pair of slacks or a skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some surplus to drape over each side . <p> Place a sweater from east to west , allowing arms to drape both east and west and tail to drape to the south . <p> Now flip the northern part of the slacks over the top of the sweater , fold the sweater arms in over this , then fold the bottom of the sweater and the southern part of the slacks or skirt over everything . Youve created a neat stack of clothing that provides cushioning everywhere a wrinkle wants to be . <p> You can add as many garments to this construction as you wish . When you 've finished , fill in the corners and crevices with underwear , socks , scarves , and so on . Place shoes heel down along the hinges of your suitcase . A quick aside about packing your shoes : they should never be empty . They should always be stuffed with underwear , socks , a childs shoe , a purse-size travel umbrella . Otherwise , the hollows of your shoes are just wasted space , and those small items are free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbor fears that a customs official will fling open our suitcase , revealing our Victorias Secret teddy or heart-dappled boxer shorts to the airport community at large . Stuff them in a shoe and hell never notice . Depending on how fancy you want to get , you can buy cloth drawstring shoe bags , or you can simply place each shoe in its own plastic shopping bag .

First I get up damn early were talking 4AM ! <p> From 4:00-6:00 : I write for Dumb Little Man , audit the articles submitted by readers , or audit the freelance work people want me to post . <p> 6:00-6:15 : I shower . <p> 6:15-7:00 : I read and respond to Dumb Little Man emails . <p> 7:00-11:30 : I work my normal job ( from the house ) <p> 11:30-Noon : If time allows , I think of and research topics for tomorrows Dumb Little Man posts <p> Honesty I have told DLM readers from Day 1 that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no reason to lie . I mean sites like Lifehacker have a crew of full time bloggers and although we are in the same niche , this is not a competition . It is up to you to understand your restraints and be forthcoming with your readers . <p> Topics:I get tons of blog post ideas from work . I mean , everything from getting a promotion to dealing with complainers came from episodes at my real job . Use life to give you ideas . Things that bother you most likely both others people . A great example is a blog I recently linked to where an Administrative Assistant solves the problems she faces . As long as your blog is solving problems instead of complaining about them , you 'll do okay . <p> Sharing data : I do n't  care what your boss says , if you share proprietary company data or vent about the CEO , you will eventually get fired . If you want to do that , start an anonymous blogger blog . Even then you are n't  safe . <p> Ok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are some other considerations that you need to consider working or not : <p> Are you even into it ? : Do you know how many times I started a diet and eventually caved in ? No , you do n't  but its a lot . My point here is to start a blog and work at it for a while before you get into the sites design and cosmetics . Get some good posts up on your site and let yourself go . I redesigned Dumb Little Man 12 times before my first post and another 13 times after . I was lucky that I really got into blogging . If not , that first set of 12 reconstructions would have been nothing but a waste of time . <p> Do it right : Choose a topic that you are seriously in love with . I love saving time and money and obviously that is what Dumb Little Man is all about . When I write , the ideas flow without much thought . If you goal is to make money , you should still choose something you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you choose something based on money , your writing will suffer and you will subsequently get no visitors . Guess whatno visitors = no advertisers = no money . <p> When beginning , read Problogger religiously and be sure to check his archives . I had absolutely no idea what a blog even was . I grabbed dumblittleman.com with no idea what I 'd even write . I owe a lot to Darren . <p> Widgets and other garbage:A blog is about your readers , its not about you . Everything you add to your site should be added only if the readers benefit . To this day I cringe when I see blogs with 19 badges indicating what groups they are part of , or where they are ranked on irrelevant rating sites . Who cares ? How does that benefit the people visiting your site ? In fact , take a look at this list of popular blogs and tell me if you see any goofy badges . Sorry , this one annoys me . <p> Marketing:When I first started Dumb Little Man , I tried everything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . I even used Blog Explosion that offers you one visitor for every blog you visit . Guess what , its all a 100% waste of time . Submit your blog to Google , Yahoo , and MSN . That 's it . Its not going to hurt you to crazily submit your URL to everyone else , but I just have n't seen the benefit . All of the smaller search engines feed off those main 3 so spending time and money on some master plan is kind of worthless . Good content and good keywords , as well discuss , will do all you need . <p> Keywords : When you give your posts a title , use really broad words . For example , when I wrote a post on making money blogging , I did n't  title the post " How to make money with your blog " . I used , " Ways to Make Money on the Internet " . Part two was also " Ways to Make Money on the Internet " . You see , each of those posts contained the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so by broadening the title to " online " or " on the internet " I grabbed more visitors . To this day some 6 months later I still get tons of visitors from search engines based on this post . What you have to do is think of phrases that people would enter into search engines , not what you think sounds pretty . <p> Commenting:You know , I have probably made 20 comments on blogs in my life and DLM still did pretty well . While this may be important for real deep niches , I personally never saw a lot of value here . In fact , I found it wasted time since you 're inclined to go back to the original blog and see who responded , engage in conversation , etc . Forget it . Use that time for content creation . <p> Domains : I mentioned earlier that I started DLM at dumblittleman.com . We did well but at some point , I just did n't  like it . I moved the site to dumblittleman.com and we lost about 800 inbound links . Due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , even to this day , is that instead of the meaningless site named Technorati ranking us at 100 , were at 900 . In the big scheme of things this means nothing , but I am a stat junkie . Do yourself a favor and get a real domain as soon as possible . <p> Ads:Keeping with the spirit of , " Your blog is about your readers " , there is nothing I hate more than blogs that use pop-up ads or have ads contained in the content . If you are already doing this , realize there are people like me that will never link to you or subscribe to your feed . I want to read your content and I should n't have to run through an obstacle course to get there . If a sidebar ad appeals to me , I 'll click , but do n't  dilute your content by adding advertisements in the middle of your post or making me scroll down to get past all the ads . <p> I have no readers and I 'll prove it.Just read this post . In short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Making Money:If your goal is to increase your cash flow , be prepared to be patient . In the first month DLM made $0.87 . The next month it was $12 , the next month it was $46 . Today , its significantly higher . The key is to understand that nothing happens overnight and that it it may take at least 6 months of quality writing before you see any meaningful increase . Stay the course no matter what . If you are blogging about you cat , skip this because the monetary future looks bleak . <p> Your archives : On all of your blog pages you have to give readers a simple way to access your archives . If you are not pushing people to your past content , you are losing the inherent value that it holds . Regardless of the platform you are using , do something to get old content on your site in a compelling way . <p> Linking : I do n't  care where you come from , what sports you played , or how good you think you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other blogs within your niche , you are being foolish . Blogging is all about sharing information and starting a larger conversation . The second you take a competitive stance , you are cooked . When you link to other like-minded blogs you are essentially telling them that you exist and that you are part of the conversation . Lifehack.org and Lifehacker could be considered DLM competitors but in the blog world , we all share information and constantly link to one another . <p> Credits:On a daily basis I am irritated by the number of starter blogs that seem to think its OK to copy entire posts from DLM and paste them to their blog . If you have any inkling of being successful , you will not do this . First , its a proven fact that duplicated content hurts the copier in search ratings . Second , there is no way I will ever consider anything you say as legitimate ; you are a fraud . Do not copy posts from other blogs ! <p> Protection from Copiers : If you have time , Copyscape will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that you have in your post ; I use them all the time . Second , make sure your posts contain some link back to your site . Many times these content thieves do n't  change links so you will see their post in Technorati . <p> Stats : Checking stats on Sitemeter is certainly not a good use of time . But you know what , it motivates me and to be honest I still check stats 10 times each day . No , its not going to change anything or make DLM more popular , but I get some personal satisfaction out of seeing where readers come from and what they are interested in . If it motivates you , do it ( although other experts will tell you not to ) . <p> The Business:Regardless of what you may think , if you are not blogging about your kids or your cats , your blog will become your little business . Read this post that I wrote a while back to learn about what you can expect from your venture . It took a large check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real ! <p> Grammar:Its something we love to hate . My grammar is terrible and I admit it . I try to abide by the grammar police but its pretty tough . Although you do n't  have to be perfect , you really need to know the basics . <p> Images:If you grab a picture from Flickr , make sure you give credit to the photographer . If you look at DLM , our images always link to the Flickr page and provide a caption indicating who took the photo . Its simply good business . <p> Do n't  post after dinner:Back to money for a second . If you use any form of pay-per-click ads on your site ( AdSense , Yahoo , etc ) , I have found that posting after dinner time ( 6PM PST ) results in poor paying ads . This is because advertisers reset their clocks at midnight and thus , the daily ad budgets reset . Therefore , posting at night allows your visitors to read your new content while low paying PPC ads are displayed after big spenders ad budgets have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get ads generated by advertisers with full daily budgets . Trust me , I have thoroughly tracked this and posts published in the morning are much more profitable . <p> If you have some other tips that have worked for you , let us all know in the comments .

The few weeks you 're out recovering sends you back to square one . You 've lost all the progress you made . And now you just ca n't be bothered to go through it all again . You 've lost the motivation to continue . Can you relate ? <p> It feels like as soon as you start making some real progress and start seeing results , something always happens . It might be a pull in the neck , a sore lower back or an ache in your knee . It stops you from going to the gym for a week or more and usually is enough to throw you off track . But here 's the thing . This could all have been avoided . A bit of strategic prevention can be all the difference . And if staying pain-free is a top priority to you , you need to take a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Warm Up and Stretch Yourself Silly <p> Another way to prevent gym injuries is to stretch all of your major muscles before your workout . Stretching releases any tightness in muscles and provides beneficial blood flow to the muscles and joints . By doing so , you 'll raise your heart rate and body temperature before you begin your workout , thereby reducing your chance of injury . <h> 2 . Focus on Form First <p> A common mistake people make in the gym is adding on more weight before they learn the correct form . Form should always come first . If you learn the correct lifting technique , only then should you gradually add more weight to your exercises . By lowering the weight and focusing on your technique , you 'll avoid injuries and see maximum results . It 's a good idea to get a gym partner who you can train with . This way , you can both spot one another and make sure you have the right form for each exercise . <h> 3 . Listen to Your Body <p> If you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop .

Yes , it 's true that fatigue is a crucial part of training . Your muscles break down and rebuild , leading to increased strength and muscle development . Feeling delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) a day or two after a gym session is normal . But , when something does n't just feel right , it 's time to stop and recover . Make sure you get enough sleep and drink enough water . It 's a great , but often overlooked . way to prevent gym injuries . <h> 4 . Do n't  Overdo It <p> Just because you read in some magazine that you should train 6 times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Remember , everyone is different . We are not all at the same level or have the same experience . So do you train 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , or 6 days a week ? Pick whatever gives you enough stimulus and enough time for recovery . Training only twice a week is usually enough to maintain progress ( given you maintain a healthy diet ) . However , if you want to see progress , then a minimum of three days per week is required . If you train more than your body can handle , getting an injury is highly likely . But what about if you want to do more ? Of course you can , just remember to progress steadily , allowing enough time for recovery . <h> 5 . When it Comes to Rest Days Rest ! <p> Days off from the gym may seem a little boring . I get it .

Be the one that misses out <p> Having the latest item and keeping up with the latest fashion is a trick that 's been going on since Alfred P. Sloan ensured that each year there was a new Chevy model . An that was nearly a hundred years ago . <p> To fight this you need to deal with the fear of missing out . Youll have to reconcile yourself to being a little bit unfashionable and having last years model or older ! <p> If that 's difficult due to peer pressure then think about your friends . Do they value you for who you are or because you have the right labels and latest stuff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about frictionless spending . This is spending that is oh-so-simple and painless that you hardly notice its happened until you get that awful credit card statement . <p> Whether its one click , contact-less or just tapping in a PIN there 's one well known and well proven method and that 's going to cash . Physically handing over the cash brings the reality of the spending before our eyes and will help put the breaks on . <p> Other simple steps could be deleting any shopping apps on your smart-phone or even deleting you 're on-line shopping accounts . <h> 3 . Use delaying tactics <p> Avoid the trap of buying on impulse . Retailers are clever with their offers which trick us into buying now in the fear that their fantastic offer will be short-lived . Instead give yourself a cooling off period before you buy . <p> You 'll find that more often than not you 'll rethink the purchase the next day so add it to a wish-list instead . I 've such a list that just keeps growing , full of stuff I now cant think why I ever wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some rules such as getting rid of something first before you buy or setting a limited storage space for items like clothes , shoes or books . No space , then no buying until you 've done the clearance . <p> I 'm working hard on the unread book pile by gradually reducing the amount of shelf space and buying only when I going to read immediately . I 'm spending less and reading more . <p> And if you 're still worried about offers the ability to buy just about anything from around the world at a competitive price means you shouldnt be . There 's always an offer on somewhere . <h> 4 . Avoid the mall <p> If going to the mall is a major recreational activity then you 're just putting temptation in front off you . Go somewhere else , ideally somewhere where there is no admission charge and no gift shop . Play Frisbee in your local park or join a reading group at your local library . <p> You 're gran was right " fresh air and exercise is good for you . Exercise " if you do enough will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the momentary buzz you get from buying stuff . <h> 5 . Switch from spending to procurement <p> Notice at work that there 's no-one called Head of Spending but there 's someone called Head of Procurement ? And notice the hoops these procurement types put you through when you only wanted to buy a box of pens ? <p> That 's because businesses hate spending as it reduces profit . So why not use the approach of procurement with you 're own wallet ? You could get your partner to authorize any purchases in advance " this really helps if your personality is n't s strongly conscientious one . <p> Other tricks could be limiting the places you can buy stuff from , keeping to a rigid budget ( back to the weekly allowance you had as a kid ) , having a maximum per item spend and having to track and report every penny spent to the boss ( i.e. your partner ) . <h> 6 . Get an alternative buzz <p> Whatever the spending buzz is work on replacing it with something else . <p> What about foraging for some wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better have some fun selling the mountain of junk you already bought but never use . <h> 7 . Have a compelling goal for your money <p> Are you robbing yourself with your careless spending ? <p> Could you use the money for something more important like training to help a career change or for a deposit on your first home . Put a note or picture in your wallet to remind you of what it is you really want to spend your money on . <p> Every time you see the picture of , say , the great vacation location just remind yourself of the dump you 'll end up at if you spend the cash now . <p> To slow the burn rate of your cash put these simple actions to the test : just miss out ; add friction ; add delay ; do n't  got to the mall ; procure do n't  spend ; get your buzz elsewhere and have a bigger goal for your money . <p> And remember each time you win that the not spending game that 's a step towards a better financial future . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78 @qwx79

While residential plumbing is designed to withstand frequent use , the sewer lines that run from your home into the ground are likely to leak or break from time to time .

You only have to watch a young child after they had sugar and you will know the real effects it has on our bodies . <p> By the time we are adults we can generally cope and adjust to the brief alteration , as long as we are not sedentary . So make sure to do some reasonable exercise at least half an hour everyday to burn it off . Go for a walk , run , take the dog out , have fun with the hottie in the sack . <p> 3 .

Your family needs to know what measures you want taken , and you will experience much greater peace of mind by finalizing these pesky yet highly important details . <p> Make a Will : Aside from determining who will take guardianship of your children , your will determines which assets and money are distributed among your heirs . This is your opportunity to include important people in your life as recipients of your property , it allows you to donate all or part of your estate to a charity , or it allows you to disinherit someone . Having a will ensures your hard-earned money ends up exactly where you want it , and keeps it from being spent in probate .

By taking conscious actions , your habits can easily be a part of your life . Heres 6 simple tips to make that happen : <p> Know why you want this habit Why do you want to cultivate this habit and what does it bring for you ? Some of us may want to cultivate habits like meditating daily and exercising daily , but why exactly do we want to do that ? If you do n't  have a clear reason , its not going to happen . For example , I switched to a vegetarian diet because I wanted to have higher mental clarity and have a cruelty-free lifestyle . I 'm passionate about these reasons having a higher mental clarity helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with my personal vision . Because of that , it was extremely easy making the switch . While I hear of many people who tried to go vegetarian but failed after 2-3 weeks , I switched and never looked back . <p> Identify the biggest reasons why you want to cultivate this habit . Think about what it helps you to achieve once you successfully make it a part of your life . Think about what it can give you that other things cant . Write down these reasons . <p> Try it as a 21 day trial Some of us might get overwhelmed with cultivating a new habit because its something we need to do for life . What if you just need to do this habit for the next 21 days ? Suddenly it does n't  seem so challenging . Most of you will think : " 21 days , hey I can do that " . <p> Why 21 days ? Research has shown 21 days is the time it takes to make or break a new habit . Also , by focusing on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it happen . Once you successfully cultivate the new habit at the end of the 21 days , suddenly its very easy to continue what you are doing . Hence , do n't  think about doing this forever , but rather just think about doing it for 21 days . If you like the habit at the end of the period , you can continue ; otherwise you can ditch it . Its a win-win , no lose situation ! <p> Make time for it in your schedule Slot in your new habit in your schedule . If its not in your schedule , you 'll likely leave it as the last thing to do in the day . Chances are by the end of the day , you 'll be so tired that you 'll leave it to the next day instead . In the end the cycle continues tomorrow and you 're going to end up not doing it at all . On the other hand , if its in your timetable , you 'll be reminded about it every time you see the calendar . You 'll also know not to schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogging sessions every morning , from between 5-6am . A big reason is because I like the coolness of the morning , whereas it can be quite hot to run in the afternoon . Its also great to start the day with a great workout . Since its set at the time , I know I need to wake up at 5am to get it done . In any event where Im unable to do it ( say when it rains , or when I wake up later ) , I 'll reschedule it to the evening . That way , I can still make it happen even if it does n't  happen the first time round . <p> Identify reinforcing habits Our habits do not exist in isolation ; they are interlinked with one another . For example , waking early and sleeping early are related , while exercising and healthy eating are related too . This is why it can be tough to cultivate a new habit , because other behaviors are reinforcing it . What are the habits related to the one you want to cultivate ? Remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits that help you . <p> Preempt things that can go wrong If you 're cultivating the habit for the first time , chances are things will go wrong . Too many things happen every day for everything to happen according to plan . The key is preempting these problems and coming up with solutions beforehand so you can immediately overcome them when these problems crop up . <p> For example , a big obstacle that I experience with my daily exercise goal is that it rains frequently in Singapore . Because of that , I cant go jog , since the running track does not have a shelter . In the past , I would give up my exercise session , and this marks the start of a chain of days where I skip my exercises . My thinking would be " Since I 've already missed it yesterday , does n't  matter much if I skip it today " . Learning from my past experience , what I do instead is I do a combination of resistance exercises and aerobics at home . This keeps up with the momentum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track your habits , you 're more motivated to keep on track , since its a form of accountability to yourself .

They remain on the cloud , so you can re-download them as many times as you want , and keep up to five copies of iTunes registered at a time . <p> 2 .

They look at you with complete boredom or maybe even roll their eyes a bit and answer with , " Mmhmm , that 's great honey .

There will be times when things are tough and they might not understand what the point of all your effort is for . By continuing to remind them why you chose this path , you will reassure them and give yourself the confidence to press on. - <p> Let them be a part of the process ( if they want to ) I know I know , its hard to let others join in to build your business . Sure we all say that were open to others ideas , but are we really ? When your spouse has an idea , do n't  just blow it off because you think you know best . If your kids legitimately want to help you , find something for them to do. - <p> Not only will this help you out in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do think of them first . This may seem like such a little thing , but its the little things that make the difference . <p> Set achievable goals and reward the whole family when you reach them This is just part of good planning . You have to set milestones and goals that you know you can reach . What 's the first thing we want to do when a goal is accomplished ? CELEBRATE ! Of course you need to set aside time to congratulate yourself on the victory , but you also need to have time to include your family in the partying , too . You might have done most of the work , but they 've been the ones manning your support line and dealing with their own concerns about all the energy you 're putting into this endeavor. - <p> Listen to their concerns , embrace them , and talk through them You know what your concerns are . After all , you 're in the trenches everyday . But do you know what your wifes concerns are ? Are your kids old enough to be worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the way you planned ? <p> Talk with them . Ask them . Tell them to be honest with you . Many times they wo n't want to tell you that they 're really scared . They do n't  want to bother you with what they think are silly worries . They know they are your support and they do n't  want you to have to worry about them , too . <p> Its ok if you do n't  have any answers . Just talking and letting them know that you care and you have the same concerns will be incredibly powerful and only bring you closer . <p> Remember , they are not you Its easy for you to stay motivated 18 hours a day because this is your baby . Remember that your family is n't going to share the same endless enthusiasm you have . They need a break .

" - <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one seems so simple , right ? Admit it . If you say you 're only going to work until 4:00 , do you actually shut it all down at 4:00 ? Before you answer that , really think about it . Yea , maybe you close the laptop and leave the desk , but what about that " smart " phone ? For the reasons mentioned in #7 its important for your family to know that you can and you are willing to shut everything else off to focus on them. - <p> Make sure your goals align with your families goals Its easy to think that your goals are the same as the rest of the family . After all , you 're doing this for them . All the hard work , stress , long hours , what else would it be for ?

You might be better off just keeping up with asking what their aspirations and interests are as they grow older. - <p> Remind them that your work is very important , but not as important as they are . This one is particularly important if you work from home and you have younger kids . It may be difficult at first to teach them the boundaries , but if you 're ever going to get anything accomplished they need to know that your work time is very important and requires a lot of concentration . At the same time , they need to know that you 're willing to drop everything ( without being annoyed ) the moment they truly need your help. - <p> The wonderful thing about being your own boss is that you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day to spend with the kids , do n't  back out because you were suddenly inspired to write a new blog post , create a new dish , or add a new vendor to the store .

Theyll end up resenting what you 're doing in the long run . <p> Teach your kids about what you 're doing as you go To grow your business is a daily educational process in almost every area of life . As you learn these lessons teach them to your kids too . Not only is there something very gratifying and reassuring about teaching your children the lessons that you learn , it is also a bonding experience that far too many people miss out on. - <p> Do n't  hide your concerns &amp; roadblocks from them You cant expect to grow your business without running smack into some roadblocks a LOT of them .

You must keep your family in on all of the ups and downs . <p> Remember in #2 how we talked about your family being your support ? They cant give you the support you need if they do n't  know what 's going on .

@@2098959 <h> 3 Unconventional Ways Of Thinking Thatll Help You Change Yourself <p> People become accustomed to ideas when exposed to them often enough . And while this is n't always a bad thing , it can sometimes lead you to believe things that are n't  truly beneficial to you . <p> To lessen the risk of being gullible enough to believe anything you 're told , its important to keep an inquisitive mind and question the way you look at things . There are even various things you believe about yourself that probably are n't  true . By changing the way you think , you might be able to learn more about yourself , which could lead to a better life for you in general . <p> There are two main parts of your brain that control your decision making : the pre-frontal cortex and the limbic system . <p> The Limbic System <p> The limbic system is all about auto-pilot and not so much about active long-term decision making . Its the part of your brain that causes you to sleep when you 're tired , eat when you 're hungry and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , it controls your mindless actions , also known as habits . These habits are n't  necessarily based on anything useful . They just seem rewarding in the short-term . <p> That 's why you might have a hard time getting work done instead of watching television sometimes . The part of your brain based on short-term rewards is telling you that rest feels good and work does n't  . Procrastination lives and thrives in your limbic system because its only focused on short-term rewards . <p> When you try to build good habits without really thinking about it , this part of your brain is almost sure to take over and spoil all your best efforts . <p> The Pre-Frontal Cortex <p> The pre-frontal cortex is more engaging . This part of your brain helps you in thinking critically . In a sense , you 're human because you have a fully engaged pre-frontal cortex that allows you to think about long-term consequences in a way animals do n't  . You analyse situations and predict the possible outcomes based on your actions . This allows you to make choices that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Choices you make by thinking critically are n't  always rewarding in the short-term . They often require you to give up some fun for the sake of getting what you want in the future . <p> But here 's the deal , your pre-frontal cortex can help you change your habits , not by going into auto-pilot and mindlessly trying to change them over time , but by being engaged . Instead of simply trying to build good habits , take some time to question your bad ones . Once you start to think deeper thoughts about how you spend your days , there 's a good chance you 'll change some things . <p> Be mindful about those bad habits and they might just become so undesirable , you force yourself to do better . Its a matter of curiosity . Once you start actively questioning your habits , you might become more aware of how bad the bad ones really are . <p> So in a sense , engaged thinking can help you change your actions rather than cruising along hoping to build a healthier lifestyle without giving it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cerebral dominance " the side of your brain you apparently use the most " has an influence on your personality . The idea is that people who are factual , analytical and more practically orientated use their left brain more and people who are creative , holistic and more mindful of feelings rather than facts are right brain dominant . <p> But here 's the problem : that 's just not true . And if you really think about it , why would it even be true ? <p> You use your whole brain , not just one side . You do n't  even really have a dominant cerebral hemisphere . The link between your personality and your brain is difficult to pinpoint , but it certainly has nothing to do with the two sides of your brain . <p> Choosing Your personality Instead <p> Look at the bright side , though , maybe you have more control over your thinking style and personality than the left brain/right brain theory wouldve had had you believe . <p> I certainly believe that there 's a big element of choice when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you consciously decide to change the way you look at things , you 'll eventually change entirely as a person . It wo n't happen over night , but you can change yourself . <p> Humans are creatures of habit , and you might not realise that you develop these habits even in your thinking patterns . So maybe creative , artistically inclined people are only that way because they had a bad math teacher who led them to believe that they are n't  good at numbers and facts . Their response might have been to focus on more artistic pursuits . Cultivating this way of thinking over a long period of time possibly became so ingrained in the essence of their thinking , they no longer know how to be any other way . <p> Same goes for people who would be classified as left brained . Maybe they just live according to a stereotype because they happened to be good at science and bad at drawing . But maybe they never gave drawing the chance it deserved and dismissed it as something for right brained people . <h> 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we debunked the myth that your dominant cerebral hemisphere has an influence on your personality " because you do n't  truly have a dominant cerebral hemisphere " its time to focus on pushing boundaries and learning new things . <p> Learning new things can actually make you happier . It provides you with something to keep life interesting and escape from the everyday hum-drum of your ordinary job . Chances are , you do most of your job easily without really thinking about it . <p> But when you feed your mind with new ideas , there are new idea for you to explore and consciously think about . By thinking about new things , sometimes even things you never thought you 'd think about , you 're creating an opportunity for creativity to grow . This creativity allow for space in your mind that 's dedicated to actively think about world views , art , culture , science , sports or whatever else you 're learning about . <p> And fostering creativity is one of the best things you can do for yourself because creativity is one of the most important characteristics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the box and come up with new ways of solving old problems . It also focuses your mind on itself , helping you to think more intrinsically and teaches you to seek gratification from within yourself instead of trying to obtain it from the things around you . This allows you to be less inclined to feel bothered by what others think of you and helps you take a proactive approach to dealing with the issues in your life . Instead on focusing solely on the extrinsic problems you 're facing , you internalise them in a way that almost has you playing with the idea of solutions . <p> This all comes back to the difference between doing things on auto-pilot and actually thinking critically . When you decide to become a life-long learner , you 're making an active decision to think about new things all the time . This feeds your pre-frontal cortex which allows you to live life in a proactive way , as opposed to just cruising by on auto-pilot . <p> When you create a life of thinking consciously , you are better able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Follow Us @qwx76 @qwx80 @qwx78
