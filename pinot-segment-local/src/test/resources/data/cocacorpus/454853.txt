@@105689886 @1089886/ <p> An Introduction to The Royal Swedish Army in WWIIIng=lfur Bjrgvinsson <p> Like the Swiss , the Swedish military system , rests on the militia system . And like the Swiss , Swedens neutrality is well over a century old . The last war fought by the Swedish Army was in 1814 although volunteers from its ranks has on number of occasions fought at the side of fellow Scandinavians against much stronger and powerfull neightbours . This happened in Finland 1939-40 and also in Danmark 1848 and 1864 . <p> After the first world war Swedens armed forces were allowed to sink to a very low period of preperdness . In 1924 conscription was reduced to four months and only raised again in 1936 following growing international tension . <p> In April 1940 Swedens entire force of 400,000 men was put on full alert . A newly formed national goverment was formed , conscription was increased to 450 days and the armed forces streinght was incresed to 600,000 men , not including civilians who were formed into home guard , aircraft observer and various auxilary units . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( MILO ) ; Sodra ( South ) Vestra ( Western ) Norra ( Northern ) Ovre Nordland ( Upper Nordland ) Ostra ( Eastern ) . The streinght of each MILO in early 1940 was as follows : <p> Further listed as raised in 1941 are two more motor brigades , three armoured brigades , three bicycle brigades and four jager brigades . <h> The Infantry Division <p> The Swedish Regiments were organized into Divisions that seems mostly to have been an administrativ formation . Howerver the formation excisted and would have fought as an unit if needed . The few offensive operations planned by the Swedes called for Divisions under a Corps HQ . <h> The Infantry Regiment <p> The regiment was the building block of the Swedish Army . They were sometimes organized into Divisions but more often they seem to have served under the control of Defance Areas ( Forsvarsomrade ) several of these controled by Military Areas ( Militaromrade or MILO ) numbered I - VII . <p> At the start of WWII regiments of the Royal Swedish Army was undergoing a number of changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time making things a little complex . The regiments were updated one after another in no special order . Basicly there were three different organizations of regiments named after the year they were suposed to have taken effect ; 1937 , 1940 and 1943 . It seems that 's the 1937 org. was ordered in 1925 to be completed in ' 37 and the 1940 org ordered in 1937 to be competed in 1940 . In reality the 1937 org. seems not to have been completed until 1940 when some regiments had allready started ot convert to the 1940 org . <p> In 1940 a new modified organization was ordered for the army , the 43M org. calling for more modern weapons in an effort to increase units firepower . The idea was that all units would have completed this reorganization in 1943 . This propably did n't start to take effect until 1942 . <p> All officers were mounted ( Company and above ) . Some regiments were issued with bicycles . In winter carts and wagons were supposed to be replaced with sleds and all men issued with skis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was common in other armies of the period . The high numbers of mortars in the regiment was a way to get more firepower to the units . The regimental mortar platoon was of good quality and had well trained forward observers . <h> The Artillery <p> The Artillery Regiments had three Artilleri Div of three batteries each . Number of Artilleri Div. is listed below : <h> Air Defence <p> Most of the AA units were static . In 1939 Swedens Air Defence could field 76 75mm AA guns ( 24 of old design ) 154 40mm Bofors AA guns and 78 searchlights . There were four mobile AA Batteries , each of 4 40mm Bofors guns and four Autocannon troops of 2 40mm guns . <p> In 1942 the Army took over its air defence , raising seven AA regiments from Lv1 to Lv7 , 4 batt. of 7,5mm AA guns and one Company of Autocannons , 40mm Bofors or 20mm guns . <p> At the same time each Division got one Autocannon Company with 40mm and 20mm guns and each Infantry Battalion a platoon of 4 20mm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one such platoon issued to its 14 . Kompanie . They were issued with tripods for AA role . <h> The Cavalry <p> The Cavalry Brigade in 1940 was made up from a Brigade HQ and three motorized Battalions , one from each of the southern cavalry regiments , K1 from Stocholm , K2 from Helsingborg and K3 from Skovde . Each Battalion had 1 Squadron of armoured cars and two Squadrons of truck motorized cavalry . <p> The Armoured Car Squadron had only one troop of three Panserbil m/31 in 1940 . Some were fitted with 37mm guns . This was later replaced with the Panserbil m/40 Lynx . <h> Notes on uniforms : <p> As most Europian armies at the start of the century Sweden adopted drab-coulered service uniforms . The 1906 uniform was of light blue-grey coulor with dark blue collar , sleeve chevrons and trouser stripes . A light and dark blue tricon hat in the style of the 18th century was a distinctive feature of thes uniform . In 1910 it was modified with dark blue shoulder straps with regimental number in arms-of-service colours ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cavalry . This uniform was still being used in 1940 by members of the home guard . <p> A new service uniform was ordered in 1923 . It took a long time for it to replace the 1910 uniform for general use . The cloth in this uniform was a mixture of brown , grey and green , the brown being predominating . In 1937 it was modified with a stand and fall collar , replacing the orginal uppright collar . These two versions were in use uring the first years of the Second World War . Rolled up trouser bottoms was a common feature of these uniforms . <p> In 1938 a modern type uniform ( with anklets ) was introducted . It was of grey-green cloth similar to German uniforms of the time . In 1945 the army had changed to the 1939 uniform . <p> The Swedish steel helmet was from 1918 . There were also m/27 and m/37 helmets of more modern design . It was painted gray brown and often had the blue and yellow national emblem on the side . <p> Brown leather belts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The Inner ring , at the edge of the city , consisted of an earth wall and a moat flanked by nineteenth century brick and mortar forts . The Outer ring formed a 94 km long arc around Antwerp about 15 km out . It was made of a string of forts and redoubts armed with artillery in steel turrets . Most works were built between 1906 and 1914 and were made of unarmed concrete . Three forts in the bends of the river downstream from Antwerp protected the city from a naval attack . <p> In 1914 , the Outer ring was assaulted by the German army and was the scene of heavy fighting which eventually precipitated the fall of the city in October 1914 . <p> In 1917 , the German army undertook to repair some of the defences and created the Antwerpen-Turnhout Stellung to guard against an Allied invasion from The Netherlands . The position ran along the Northern section of Antwerps Outer ring and the Antwerp - Turnhout canal . A total of 524 bunkers were built in the intervals between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Turnhout canal . These bunkers had 0.5 to 1 m thick unarmed concrete walls . The roof was made of steel-reinforced concrete , 0.6 to 0.8 m thick . The bunkers were designed to resist sustained 75 mm fire and/or occasional hits from 150 mm shells . <p> After WWI , the defences were left in disrepair until 1934 , when Belgium decided to fortify Antwerp once again . The new position , called Position fortifiTe dAnvers ( PFA ) had a threefold mission : <p> Protect Antwerp from a German armoured thrust through The Netherlands . <p> Secure the left flank of the Northeastern border screen , the Albert Canal position and the Dyle position . <p> Form a bridgehead on the Scheldt in case the army was forced to withdraw to that line . <p> To accomplish this mission , the Outer ring was rebuilt and strengthened by anti-tank defences and layered bunker positions . <p> The forts were renovated and repaired , but not rearmed with artillery . Each fort was converted into an infantry stronghold to be defended by one machine gun company ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns ) . The garrison deployed most of its heavy machine guns in modern bunkers built on top of the old turret pits where they provided flanking fire on the intervals between two works . The remaining machine guns were installed in open topped concrete positions on the forts glacis and inside the traditore battery and the caponnieres to defend the fort itself . Each fort was also fitted with airtight gas shelters . <p> The smaller redoubts were converted into platoon-sized positions for one reinforced machine gun platoon ( 2 heavy and 6 light machine guns ) . The heavy machine guns and two light machine guns were positioned in two bunkers built on the front face of the redoubt ; the remainder of the guns took position in the traditore battery . <p> Machine gun bunkers defended the intervals between the forts and redoubts . In most places , these formed two successive lines . The Belgians built the bunkers in the thirties , but in the Northern section of the PFA , the line included many converted German WWI bunkers . The Belgian-made bunkers were all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three firing ports , most with a single firing port . <p> The anti-tank defences were made up of an anti-tank ditch and a combination of flooded areas and steel obstacles .

The ditch was 14 m wide and contained 2 m of water ( this could be raised to 2.5 m if needed ) . It ran in a broken line , with machine gun bunkers at the inner angles . The roads crossed the ditch on earthen dams with an underpass for the water . These dams could be barred quickly by anti-tank obstacles ( Cointet gates mostly ) . There were 15 such crossings .

At the same time , two German divisions ( I 'd 208 , I 'd 256 ) attempted to breach the line from the North East .

The Ghent bridgehead or TPG ( TOte de pont de Gand ) was made of six bastions straddling the roads and railroads leading to Ghent . Each bastion was a dense network of bunkers providing a layered defence against attacks from all sides . The bastions were linked together by two or three successive lines of bunkers . There were 228 bunkers in all . Most were medium type machine gun bunkers with one or two firing ports , but there were also a small number of large anti-tank bunkers and artillery casemates for 75 mm field guns . The TPG bunkers were integrated in field works ( trenches , barbed wire networks , dug outs ) carried out by the field army . There were some anti-tank obstacles present , but they did not form a continuous barrier over the whole length of the position . <p> German units made contact with the Ghent position on 20 May , 1940 , after the retreat of the Allied armies on the Scheldt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break through the Eastern sector of the position , but a Belgian counterattack on 21 May recaptured the lost ground . A new German attack was planned for 23 May , but the Belgians evacuated the TPG in the night of 22 May-23 . There was no fighting in the Western section ( between the Leie and the Scheldt ) . <p> Bunker MU11 in the Ghent bridgehead , near Munte . Note the similarity with the standard PFL II bunker . <p> Brussels South <p> This position covering the Southern approaches to Brussels was built explicitly to prove Belgiums neutrality . It was supposed to defend the capital against an invasion from France . As it turned out , it also protected the right flank of the Dyle position . This was not a line but a string of five bastions or Centre de rTsistance ( Ninove , Kester , Hal , Braine-LAlleud and Waterloo ) blocking the roads leading into Brussels from the South . Between them , the Centres de rTsistance totalled 49 works , most of them medium machine gun bunkers with one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

Contrary to Cointet lines , rail barriers were placed in a straight line . <p> Coastal Defenses <p> Along part of their coastline , Nieuwpoort to Knokke , the Belgians built a string of 13 bunkers armed with the French APX-2B tank turret ( one 47 mm gun , one machine gun ) . The turrets were part of a lot of twenty-five French turrets the Belgians had ordered in 1936 to create two platoons of armoured cars for its cavalry divisions . Those plans were shelved when Parliament deemed that Belgium should not have any offensive weapons . Most of the turrets were then used in bunkers . This thin line was supported by position artillery , i.e. two 170 mm batteries in unroofed concrete emplacements ( Knokke and Bredene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zeebrugge ) . <p> German soldiers of IR 234 relaxing on top of one of the coastal bunkers . This particular bunker was located in front of the Ostend Casino . <p> The Meuse from Namur to LiFge <p> From Namur to LiFge ( Herstal ) , the Belgians installed 70 bunkers to defend the river crossings . One medium bunker ( for one or two heavy machine guns , or one 47 mm anti-tank gun ) defended each bridge along that stretch of the river . The bunker was placed on the west bank , as close as possible to the bridge and preferably in front of it to rake it with enfilade fire . <p> This article first appeared in World War II Online - Technical Publications .

@@105689902 @1089902/ <p> CommentsRegarding the sources used for these tanks strengths , Richard Anderson informs me that : <p> The pro forma reports used by 12th Army Group were laid down in NEPTUNE Administrative Orders and were periodically repeated in various subordinate unit Admin Orders and were frequently abused . <p> In theory , the first column reported on hand operational and operational in less than 6 hours . The second column reported on hand and operational with repairs requiring less than 24 hours ( but more than 6 hours of repairs ) . The third column reported lost and damaged requiring repairs greater than 24 hours . The key is that according to the rules any vehicle entered into the last column should only have been reported once and then dropped from the unit on hand , because in theory it was either a potential write off or was to be evacuated to an army Ordnance Heavy Maintenance Company ( Tank ) or a base depot ( when established ) for further report . The problem is this rule was very obviously violated all the time as units reported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It would be an error to think that the third column in Allied tank reports are analogous to the German ' long term repair ' . They are similar , but reflect a different philosophy . In theory , for the Germans so long as the vehicle was held in long term repair it was charged to the unit and would not be issued to other units , whereas the Allied system theoretically discharged the vehicle from unit inventory when it left the unit . Mind you , all of this is theory . <p> As regards the reporting , it is critical to remember that two different things were reported . For example , from the units to the First Army Armor Section and then to the Army G-3 is a different reporting path and criteria than from the army Heavy Maintenance Company ( Tank ) to Armor Section . The first reports ' losses ' to the unit , i.e. all those reported in column three of the reports , which were evacuated to 4th echelon maintenance . It included both vehicles that were ' write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reissued . The later report is only for write offs , although it has some interesting corrections later I recall one notation in February for three tanks reported as write offs because they were damaged , bogged , and irrecoverable but a few days later they managed to recover them and judged them all repairable.

@@105689923 @1089923/ <p> The organisation of Belgiums fixed defences in World War II was partly based on the experiences of World War I , in which the fortified positions of Antwerp , Namur and LiFge played a significant role . It was also the result of a compromise between two conflicting strategic concepts . Proponents of the first concept held that Belgium should not give battle on its borders but on a fortified line in the heart of the country , allowing time both for the army to fully mobilise and dig in and for Belgiums Allies to come to its help . The fortified line would run from Antwerp in the North through Leuven and Wavre along the Dyle River , and then on to Namur and Givet ( France ) along the Meuse . Many politicians , whose constituencies would have to be abandoned in the event of an invasion , opposed this " deep defence " concept . Instead , they wanted to fortify the border itself . Successive peacetime governments tried to please both sides of the argument , resulting in an unfortunate dispersion of resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first appeared in World War II Online - Technical Publications .

@@105689934 @1089934/ <p> Explanation of German Units and Organizational Symbols The symbols in this work are based on the official German handbook of military symbols ( H.Dv. 272 ) of 23 May 1943 , and the symbols of the organizational charts ( Kriegsgliederung des Feldheeres 1.07.1943 ) . <p> The 1943 organizational symbols were simplified . The anti-tank units now also used a representation of the basic anti-tank gun symbol itself . The weapons symbols themselves were no longer modified , but instead had information placed next to them . <p> In German organizational charts ( and , as reflected in this work ) , the headquarters symbol represents two purposes . First , it indicated the size , function , and mobility of the unit . And , second , it also indicated the headquarters of that echelon itself . I.e. , there was no separate symbol for this echelon 's headquarters . For all headquarters units with ( and sometimes important units without ) separate KStN , the corresponding symbols were placed to the right of the echelon 's symbol . The same applied to those units that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different functions and mobility additions were used to enhance the echelon 's symbol to indicate a specific purpose . Company-sized units and sub-units symbols were also modified in a similar fashion . <p> An interesting feature of company and sub-unit symbols is that their size and shape dimensions could be altered to fit the diagram being depicted with them . Several infantry companies , for example , were placed side-by-side , elongated upwards , ( so that all weapons symbols could fit within ) , and only the left-hand company had the thickened edge used to indicate its size ( more of this below ) . The variations in size and shape followed the original configuration , so that the basic symbol was still recognizable as such . <p> The symbols were intended to be mnemonic . The headquarters symbols reflected the units ' pennants used on vehicles or the standards themselves . ( These flags and pennants were of different colors to represent the various combat arms , and usually had a number , letter , and/or heraldic symbol superimposed upon them ) . Hence , any German looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type being depicted . The colors in real life were substituted by the unit function and mobility modifiers above and below the symbols . In addition , a simplified version of the organizational symbols was , for example , painted on unit vehicles . <p> The mobility of the unit was also quickly recognizable . The two small circles ( ' wheels ' ) underneath a symbols identified the unit as being motorized . In case these wheels were over the symbol ( applied only to artillery-type units ) , this indicated that the unit was motorized by half-tracked prime movers . Elongated ovals ( ' tracks ' ) applied underneath the symbol meant that the unit was self-propelled . A wheel and a track symbol indicated a half tracked armored vehicle . <p> The lozenge symbol represented armor . All tank units used this symbol . It was shaped to reflect World War I tanks , and hence provided a good memory assist . <p> Aside from a very few specialized symbols , which were quickly memorized , all company-sized and smaller unit symbols tended to reflect the units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cases , a unit too difficult to depict easily was instead represented by a box with a corresponding abbreviation inside . In case it belonged to a particular arm , the arms symbol could be placed on top of or within this box . Where various modifiers applied , these were all added to the symbol . <p> Company-sized units had , somewhere within their symbol , a thickened part , usually a side . <p> Artillery Inspectorate and Army Anti-Aircraft firing artillery ( tube , rocket-launcher , and anti-aircraft ) batteries used the basic symbol without thickening . ( Firing artillery in units smaller than battery size were depicted on a smaller scale ) . <p> Weapon identification was by means of information placed alongside the symbol : caliber to the left ( if no modifier was indicated , it was a light weapon ) , identification to the right , the number of weapons were placed below . <p> None-firing batteries of the artillery arm followed the normal form of thickening a portion of the symbol to indicate their size . <p> Infantry anti-aircraft companies followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of companies had the upright stems thickened accordingly . <p> Where several columns , platoons , or detachments were gathered under a company headquarters , ( such as a heavy company ) and each of these sub-units had its own KStN these symbols were placed side-by-side within a box , with the left side thickened accordingly . <p> The Germans numbered their units on organizational charts from the right . I.e. , the first company was on the far right , and the last company was on the far left . The same applied to battalions and regiments . <p> Units smaller than companies appeared on organizational charts only if they had their own Table of Organization . Exceptions occurred , particularly if headquarters sub-units had specialized equipment . They were depicted on a smaller scale than company-sized units . <p> Staffel(Detachment) An elastic designation for several components under a headquarters section , these components being from section to platoon size . Often this was merely an administrative grouping , and the components were distributed to other sub-units in combat . It could either have its own small headquarters section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a dual function . <p> Kolonne ( Column ) An independent transportation unit , varying from company to platoon size , transporting equipment or supplies such as a bridge column ( which in fact did not actually build the bridge it was transporting ) , or even as an light ' infantry ' column ( which consisted of a set number of horse-drawn vehicles capable of transporting a fixed tonnage ) . <p> Zug(Platoon) An independent unit or the typical main sub-division of companies and batteries . Usually , the 1st and 2nd platoons in each company-sized unit , and also of independent platoons , were lead by a lieutenant , while the other platoons were headed by a senior NCO . <p> Trupp ( lit . Troop ; Section ) A small unit , equipped with specialized equipment ; it could also be used as the designation for a headquarters echelon unit ( Kompanie-Trupp : Company Headquarters ; Zug-Trupp : Platoon Headquarters , etc . ) . <p> The units indicated below were not depicted as separate symbols . <p> Halb-Zug ( lit. : Half-Platoon ) Some platoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two parts . <p> Gruppe ( Squad , Section ) This was normally the smallest sub-unit that existed in the German Army . In this work , the word " Squad " has only been used for infantry and reconnaissance infantry units . All other units of this size have been designated as " Sections " . <p> Halb-Gruppe ( lit . Half-Squad , i.e. Team ) In the case of infantry and reconnaissance units , squads could be broken down into two parts . Infantry and reconnaissance squads were built up around the squad LMG . Where only one LMG was provided , the LMG team provided cover while the other team was the movement element . Where two LMG were available , the teams covered each other in turns . Reconnaissance teams , on the other hand , were trained to work independently , although they too could function as a squad .

Readers are warned that , as in all armies , they were in actual fact more complicated , with important differentiations being made between designations of rank , billet , function , and skill .. Billet indicates an appointment to ( staffing of ) a position also called a ' slot ' like Squad Leader , Platoon Commander , Divisional Commander , Executive Officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , the billet has the same designation as a rank , such as Hauptfeldwebel . <p> The equivalent Ranks given in English are neither completely World War II British nor American , and is not going to satisfy any specialist . ( However a specialist would probably not be reading this anyway ) . Nearly all German officer ranks correspond to US Army ranks , although their terminology differs , a Generalmajor being the equivalent of a brigadier general . Modern US Army rank equivalents have some differences . There is one more enlisted rank ( Command Sergeant Major ) , and three more Warrant Officer ranks ( Warrant Officers W3W5 ) . US Army Warrant Officers are counted as officers , not enlisted men . In the German WWII Army , all ranks below 2nd Lieutenant were enlisted men . <p> The German Army divided officers billets into eight groups , depending on the function to be carried out . German wartime officer ranks were permanent , which often made it impossible for German officers to be promoted to the higher rank which their wartime billet would actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffed the billet of Company Commander , this was not always a rule . If there were not enough Captains then a senior member of a lower rank was assigned to that billet . Conversely , if there were too many of a higher rank than one or more might be assigned a lower ranking billet . Many Divisions were commanded by a Brigadier General and even an occasional Colonel instead of a Major General . Conversely , if a billet was particularly critical , a higher-ranking person might be assigned to that billet than would normally be the case . Skill was preferred to rank . promotion was achieved by serving time . The function or billet filled as such was not a ground for promotion . <p> Enlisted members of the German Army had an Occupation ( Laufbahn ) , i.e. a career or field of specialty , like Infantry , Supply , Finance , and so on . The occupation might be incorporated into the rank designation , such as **29;55;TOOLONG , a farrier ( horseshoe smith ) corporal ; or even be used instead of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , who was an expert farrier sergeant . <p> The highest combat leader position held by an enlisted man was that of platoon leader . However , this usually applied only to the third and fourth platoons . All other combat command positions were held by officers . Sergeants and Warrant Officers were in charge of logistics and administration , freeing the officers for their primary function of leading men into combat . It was not unusual for senior enlisted men to become involved in combat when the need arose , although the German Army considered it a waste of skilled manpower to use these highly trained and experienced men for this purpose . <p> German Tables of Organization ( KStN **25;86;TOOLONG ) had many notes indicating which billets and specialist slots were to be filled with what ranks and specialists , listing which billets had priority over others , which could alternatively be filled by a person with specialized knowledge or skill , and which billets should by preference be filled with regular army personnel . <p> Although it was expected to have rank and billet corresponding to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specialist personnel was rare and many units were raised in a hurry , not having enough time to acquire all its correct personnel . And once a units entered combat , the chances of acquiring the exact , highly-skilled soldier for the correct position often became merely a matter of luck . <p> Band Officers in the German Army ranked between NCOs and Officers , and formed a seperate rank class . They did not have powers of command , though they were entitled to wear officers ' uniforms and did hold officer-equivalent rank . Musikinspizienten ( Music Directors ) were considered staff officers . <p> The German Wehrmacht also had a unique category of personnel within its ranks , namely the Wehrmachtbeamten , which can be loosely translated as Armed Forces Civil Servants or as Government Service Officials . They were found in administrative , legal , and technical service positions . They were civilians performing functions within the Armed Forces .

I worked with one or two archivists on a weekly basis , who got to know me by name . Most of the War Department 's textual records from 1940 onward are kept in the stacks ( as they 're called ) in the Modern Military Branch of the Archives . In those musty old boxes are the records of the Adjutant General of the Army , who handled all correspondence within the War Department . I started out looking for a station list of the Army on 12/7/41 , but got interested in many other documents along the way , like strength lists , unit activation lists , station plans , authorized strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . From here they suggest I visit the National Archive Record Center . <p> The National Archives Record Center , Suitland , Md. here is where I research individual unit histories of both large and small units , but only Army Ground and Service units . If I wanted to research the Army Air Forces , I had go to either Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama or Bolling Air Force Base in Washington , D.C. For obvious reasons I chose Bolling . Bolling had copies of Air Force unit histories ( from Maxwell ) on microfilm . Note : NARC has since moved to College Park , Maryland . <p> The Air Force History Support Center , Bolling AFB , D.C. here I poured through microfilm of unit histories from the Headquarters of AAF to smallest detachments .

The first ones were listed in the Army Directory published by the Adjutant General from the 1880 's to 1940 . The Army Directory also listed all regular Army officers and their location . In 1941 , they took the Station List out of the Directory and made it a separate book . This may be due the size of the army or the need to keep it secret . The army continue to publish station lists about every 6 months . The station list closest to 7 December 1941 was dated 1 November 1941 , but it only contained units in the continental U.S. It turned out that the overseas station list for 1 November 1941 was on microfilm . The OMH also had Army Registers dating back to 1784 , which listed army officers and their promotion dates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on several occasions where I got information on War Dept General and Special Orders . <p> The Library of Congress , near the Capitol another place I visited for a source of any book ever published since it was built . 
@@105690081 @1090081/ <p> Explanation of German Units and Organizational Symbols The symbols in this work are based on the official German handbook of military symbols ( H.Dv. 272 ) of 24.03.1941 , ( with changes up to November 1941 ) and on the actual symbols used in the organizational charts ( Kriegsgliederungen des Feldheers , ( 15.05.1941 through May 1942 ) ) . Where symbols in the latter are at variance with the former , those symbols of the organizational charts have been used . <p> In German organizational charts ( and , as reflected here ) , the headquarters symbol represents two purposes . First , it indicated the size , function , and mobility of the unit . And , second , it also indicated the headquarters of that echelon itself . I.e. , there was no separate symbol for this echelons headquarters . For all headquarters units with ( and sometimes important units without ) separate KStN , the corresponding symbols were placed to the right of the echelons symbol . The same applied to those units that were directly assigned to the echelons headquarters . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echelons symbol to indicate a specific purpose . Company-sized units and sub-units symbols were also modified in a similar fashion . <p> The Germans numbered their units on organizational charts from the right . I.e. , the first company was on the far right , and the last company was on the far left . The same applied to battalions and regiments . <p> An interesting feature of company and sub-unit symbols is that their size and shape dimensions could be altered to fit the diagram being depicted with them . Several infantry companies , for example , were placed side-by-side , elongated upwards , ( so that all weapons symbols could fit within ) , and only the left-hand company had the thickened edge used to indicate its size ( more of this below ) . The variations in size and shape followed the original configuration , so that the basic symbol was still recognizable as such . <p> The symbols were intended to be mnemonic . The headquarters symbols reflected the units pennants used on vehicles or the standards themselves . ( These flags and pennants were of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually had a number , letter , and/or heraldic symbol superimposed upon them ) . Hence , any German looking at one of these symbols could immediately recognize the unit type being depicted . The colors in real life were substituted by the unit function and mobility modifiers above and below the symbols . In addition , a simplified version of the organizational symbols was , for example , painted on unit vehicles . <p> The mobility of the unit was also quickly recognizable . The two small circles ( wheels ) underneath a symbols identified the unit as being motorized . In case these wheels were over the symbol ( applied only to artillery-type units ) , this indicated that the unit was motorized by half-tracked prime movers . Elongated ovals ( tracks ) applied underneath the symbol meant that the unit was self-propelled . <p> All units assigned to Panzer divisions were at least motorized , so that it was thought that the addition of the motorization wheels to the upright staff symbol could be dispensed with , and that the Panzer-Truppen pennant was indication enough . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the halftrack symbol underneath them instead of the motorized symbol , this practice was not yet followed in most organizational charts at that time . The diagrams in this book reflect this usage . <p> The lozenge symbol represented armor . All tank units used this symbol . It was shaped to reflect World War I tanks , and hence provided a good memory assist . <p> Aside from a very few specialized symbols , which were quickly memorized , all company-sized and smaller unit symbols tended to reflect the units function or at least their main weapon . In most cases , a unit too difficult to depict easily was instead represented by a box with a corresponding abbreviation inside . In case it belonged to a particular arm , the arms symbol could be placed on top of or within this box . Where various modifiers applied , these were all added to the symbol . <p> Company-sized units had , somewhere within their symbol , a thickened part , usually a side . <p> Excluded from this were the firing artillery ( tube , rocket-launcher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol itself in firing batteries ( usually with the number of guns underneath ) indicating a battery . ( Firing artillery in units smaller than battery size were depicted on a smaller scale ) . None-firing batteries of the artillery arm followed the normal form of thickening a portion of the symbol to indicate their size . Infantry-type artillery ( anti-aircraft and infantry gun ) and well as machine gun companies followed the normal practice , and the weapon symbols representing these types of companies had the upright stems thickened accordingly . <p> Where several columns , platoons , or detachments were gathered into a headquarters company or heavy company , ( and each of these sub-units had its own KStN ) , these symbols were enclosed in a box without a thick side . <p> Units smaller than companies appeared on organizational charts only if they had their own Table of Organization . Exceptions occurred , particularly if headquarters sub-units had specialized equipment . They were depicted on a smaller scale than company-sized units . <p> Staffel(Detachment) An elastic designation for several components under a headquarters section , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was merely an administrative grouping , and the components were distributed to other sub-units in combat . It could either have its own small headquarters section , or one of the components ' leaders could carry out a dual function . <p> Kolonne ( Column ) An independent transportation unit , varying from company to platoon size , transporting equipment or supplies such as a bridge column ( which in fact did not actually build the bridge it was transporting ) , or even as an light ' infantry ' column ( which consisted of a set number of horse-drawn vehicles capable of transporting a fixed tonnage ) . <p> Zug(Platoon) An independent unit or the typical main sub-division of companies and batteries . Usually , the 1st and 2nd platoons in each company-sized unit , and also of independent platoons , were lead by a lieutenant , while the other platoons were headed by a senior NCO . <p> Trupp ( lit .

In this work , the word " Squad " has only been used for infantry and reconnaissance infantry units . All other units of this size have been designated as " Sections " . <p> Halb-Gruppe ( lit . Half-Squad , i.e. Team ) In the case of infantry and reconnaissance units , squads could be broken down into two parts . Infantry and reconnaissance squads were built up around the squad LMG . Where only one LMG was provided , the LMG team provided cover while the other team was the movement element . Where two LMG were available , the teams covered each other in turns .

@@105690248 @1090248/ <p> The Japanese did not have a separate Marine Corps . Instead , landing parties would be formed from ship 's crews - to the obvious detriment of their ship . Therefor , in the late 1920 's , the Imperial Japanese Navy began to form permanent Naval Landing Forces at its four main naval bases , Sasebo , Maizuru , Kure , and Yokosuka , designating them as Special Naval Landing Forces ( SNLF ) , known in Japanese as Rikusentai . <p> The original meaning of the word Rikusentai was a group of sailors detached from a warship for a special , temporary mission . For example , the cruiser Kashima detached a group of men for occupying small bases in New Guinea for a short period . This group was known as the Kashima Rikusentai . The meaning progressed further to include a group of sailors sent from one base force to another . E.g. , a group from the 3rd Base Force detached to the 4th Base Force would be known as the 3rd Base Force Rikunsentai . <p> Although the echelon symbol generally used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to regiment-sized units , the strengths of the SNLF were not uniform and varied from 700 to 1800.
