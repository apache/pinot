Charlotte wrote of her dad , " He loved life , especially singing , dancing , classical music and cycling . He was funny , witty and exceptionally smart . He worked extremely hard as a doctor , and he cared so much for his patients . " <p> Image : Facebook <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Please look out for your friends , family and those you care about , and share this message if you need to .

Some of you may not yet know that Andrew took his own life , in his office , on Thursday morning . <p> Andrew had never before suffered from depression . He had n't been sleeping well since late February ; but he was never a great sleeper . He was very busy with work ; but had always been busy . <p> Just before Easter he became anxious - about his private practice , about being behind in his office administration , about his practice finances , about some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-communicative .

It was on the worst on call week he had ever had - he was called every night and some nights more than 3 or 4 times and during the day he had to see his own patients and do his endoscopy lists . He missed our son Nick 's birthday dinner and every other dinner at home that week . <p> By the end of the week ( last Friday ) he was exhausted , still could n't sleep properly and just ' flat ' . I was very concerned about him , tried to talk to him about my concerns but he was very unresponsive . I urged him to go and see someone about his sleeping but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lists , go to work , get home late . <p> On Tuesday evening he was upset and teary because a patient had died . Andrew was always upset when any of his patients died , but his level of distress in this case was unusual . <p> In retrospect , the signs were all there . But I did n't see it coming . He was a doctor ; he was surrounded by health professionals every day ; both his parents were psychiatrists ; two of his brothers are doctors ; his sister is a psychiatric nurse - and none of them saw it coming either . <p> I do n't want it to be a secret that Andrew committed suicide . If more people talked about what leads to suicide , if people did n't talk about as if it was shameful , if people understood how easily and quickly depression can take over , then there might be fewer deaths . His four children and I are not ashamed of how he died . <p> So please , forward this email on to anyone in the Wilston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that might want to know , or anyone you think it may help . <p> If you or- someone you know needs support , help can be found- at- Lifeline on 13 11 14 or Beyond Blue on 1300 224 636.

He referenced the late Tupac Shakur - saying Uniqlo has to " evolve or disappear " and be " focused on making simple better all the time " .

" <p> " I had to learn confidence , " admits Alana , 29 . " I knew I had the skills to rise to the challenges of a promotion , but until I spoke up in front of the right people I was always going to get overlooked .

" Not heavily bragging , but showing a positive , purposeful tone , " he says . <p> This behaviour can be implemented at any stage of your vocational climb .

These little news items cited a new employment study from the very official Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) implying Stay At Home Mums should get off their butts and get a job . <p> Breakfast TV and Twitter responded accordingly : OUTRAGE . <p> There was OUTRAGE over the fact the report referred to SAHMs as inactive ' , there was OUTRAGE over the fact the report failed to measure their economic productivity , there was OUTRAGE over the fact that mums are prevented from going back to work due to lack of access to decent child-care and there was OUTRAGE over the fact there were plenty of other people on welfare draining the economy , but they were n't singled out . <p> Of course no-one actually read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a horrifically dry , data filled academic tome that had me reaching for an early morning martini . <p> But it 's aim , in short , was to identify untapped labour markets in Australia , and how to give these people better opportunites to get a job in order to boost productivity .

And it also clearly stated that reliable and flexible child-care was a major barrier to their re-entry . <p> In fact , the report actually said what woke business folk and feminists have been saying for , like , ever : that women 's talents are untapped and underutilised everywhere and that if we had more women participating at all levels of the workforce , the more productive our country will be .

If we praise one type of mum , we are not condemning the other . There is n't only two ways to raise kids , like there is n't only one way to be a productive member of society . And while this report focussed on economic productivity , women know first-hand there are lots of other ways to measure your worth in society other than through your pay slip .
