Why ? Read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) of Pitcairn <p> Ill start at the very beginning , because Pitcairn does have a- fascinating history . When- the island was first discovered by Europeans , it was entirely- uninhabited . Polynesians- had previously- settled- the volcanic land , but the population had been extinct for at least a century before a fifteen year-old crew member of the HMS Swallow , Robert Pitcairn , spotted the land in 1767 . The ships Captain named the island after the young eagle-eyed seaman and- charted its position- at 25-2S133-21W , erroneously mapping Pitcairn- about 330km west of its actual location . The ship- went on its way and when Britains famous Captain Cook was sent out to explore- Pitcairn- six years later , - he of course could n't find it . <p> Who should be the first to finally rediscover the isolated island 17 years later ? Only- nine of- the most wanted men in the British Empire , the infamous Bounty mutineers .

In the time that- mutiny leader , Fletcher Christan , and his fellow fugitives- had been island-hopping around the Pacific Ocean in search of a safe-haven , they had also picked up a few Tahitian " passengers " ( hostages ? ) along the way , including six men , eleven women and a baby girl. - Christians group remained undiscovered on Pitcairn until 1808 , by which time only one mutineer , John Adams , remained alive . <p> Marlon Brando in MGMs Mutiny on the Bounty <p> Despite the island proving to be a haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fertile land , it had been plagued by alcoholism , lawlessness and other ills from the start .

By 1794 , all six Tahitian men were dead , some even murdered- by the- Tahitian women who had been taken as wives by the English . Two surviving mutineers continued on drunken rampages , having figured out they- could- distill alcohol from a local plant . At the mercy of drunken English pirates , a group of women attempted to escape- the chaos of Pitcairn island on a makeshift boat , but failed . <p> By 1800 , Adams was the only mutineer left alive and took responsibility for the well-being of nine remaining women and 19 children .

Today , there are only about 50 permanent inhabitants , making it the smallest population of any democracy in the world . <p> Over the years , many recovered Bounty artefacts have been sold by islanders as souvenirs , but even such dealings- could not- rid the island of its sinister reputation . <p> When I began reading about Pitcairn , I knew- I was in for some tempestuous and bloody history about a band of pirates and castaways , but I was not in any way- prepared to learn of the- shocking modern-day tale that now plagues this paradise island . <p> In 2004 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands mayor at the time , for the- rape or molestation of young girls , with most of the girls alleged to have been victims with the crimes spanning several generations .

The spring has been flowing continuously here in Monroe , Utah for millions of years , coming out of the ground at 168 degrees Fahrenheit ( 75 degrees- -C ) at 200 gallons a minute . <p> In the very same spot where travellers today still come to soak in the healing waters while enjoying- an acoustic concert as the sun goes down , nomadic tribes- of native people before them came to- make their camps on the warm earth- near the hot springs . <p> When settlers arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot springs became popular as a resting place , but always represented " a place of peace and neutrality , where even warring tribes would lie down their arms to enjoy natures gift " . <p> In the 1880s , Thomas Cooper and his wife , a couple of Mormon pioneers arrived at the east foothills of Monroe , 150 miles out from what is Salt Lake City today . They settled near the large mineral deposit with streams of hot water flowing from it and eventually built the first swimming pool at the site , calling it Monroe Hot Springs . <p> People from nearby towns enjoyed the Coopers hospitality until the resort was- sold to Charles Wilkes in 1916 , who built a dance hall where orchestras would stop and play their music . People- came from miles around in their horse-drawn buggies to dance and soak the night away . <p> A century later- and Monroe Hot Springs is now Mystic Hot Springs , run by a guy who likes to go by " Mystic Mike " .

Instead of building new cabins , he went looking around the desert valley for old abandoned- pioneer cabins that nobody wanted . One of the first buildings he purchased was a pioneer cabin deserted- in the valley from 1865 . Five children were born in it during the Pioneer days . <p> As he continued to acquire more , Mike has today put together something of an authentic Pioneer Village with fifteen cabins so far at different stages of restoration . <p> The antique bath tubs I gather are Mikes artistic touch .

Some of the baths as if they 're being engulfed by the layers of rock formed as the minerals cool , a buildup over time which has created a mound 200 yards wide . <p> The scenery is quite something , soaking in a bath surrounded by the open desert , ideal for stargazing and moon watching over the mountains . <p> Mystic Mike has of course also revived the old hot springs- musical tradition by hosting bands and maintaining the historic love of music and dance that the Mystic hot springs- is famous for .

@@71654785 @354785/ <h> The Rooftop Pigeon Men : A New York Subculture <p> When I was about twelve or thirteen , I remember watching an episode of my favourite Nickelodeon cartoon , Hey Arnold , entitled " Pigeon Man " , about a mysterious hermit who lived on a New York rooftop with pigeons . <p> Very few people had seen him and only rumours circulated amongst the neighbourhood kids about the Legend of the Pigeon Man . The episode begins with Arnolds friend relaying the tale <p> " In the pet shop district there stands an old tenement , abandoned since the great fire of 69 . After the fire the pigeons started gathering by the thousands on its charred roof . No one knew why , until one day someone saw a dark figure moving among the avian multitude . For lo , alone on the roof of that 88th street building , there lurked a creature , half-man , half-bird ; known only asPigeon Man . <p> Some say , he was hatched from an egg and left by aliens .

" <p> It turned out Pigeon Man was just a lonely guy who preferred the company of pigeons to human society . But over the years , long after I stopped watching Nickelodeon after school , I would discover that the tale of the good-natured cartoon character was n't just a story for kids <p> These photographs come from Brooklyn-based Aaron Wojack , one of the few photographers out there who has tapped into the citys semi-secret avian subculture . <p> " On a calm day multitudes of pigeons can be seen flying together over the rooftops of New York City 's boroughs tornados of birds . These are not the reviled creatures of the street ; they are domestic pigeons that live their entire lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cared for daily by their owners . " <p> The birds are bred in sometimes highly elaborate rooftop coops to become champion flyers and racers . The pigeon men will release their flocks , use sounding chirps and whistles to send them higher , choreographing their movement with flags and then incredibly summon them back to the coop . <p> Better known as rooftop fliers or pigeon fliers , for these New Yorkers , raising pigeons is a salvation from the stresses of daily life and the distractions of the street. <p> The New York Times looked into the subculture recently as a means of crossing racial lines . <p> " The men are as likely to be working-class blacks or Hispanics . Many were introduced to the hobby by Irish , Italian and other fliers of European descent , an unlikely camaraderie that evolved in neighbourhoods like Bushwick , Canarsie and Ozone Park that were undergoing gradual racial shifts . " <p> A 2010 documentary , Above Brooklyn , directed by Heather Spilkin also explores the little-known world of New York pigeon breeders and racers . One man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the birds have kept him from a darker fate . " If it was n't for this , who knows where I 'd be .. in jail or killed . But they keep me off the street . " <p> If you were a fan of the HBO cult crime series , The Wire , you may recall we saw the softer , nurturing side of a ruthless drug-dealer Marlo , who bonds with his rooftop pet pigeons . And even former heavy-weight champion Mike Tyson was a keen domestic pigeon breeder before his sporting fame , and kept pigeon coops at lofts in New Jersey and Brooklyn long after . Reflecting on his childhood , Tyson once told a reporter : <p> " One morning I woke up and found my favorite pigeon , Julius , had died . I was devastated and was gon na use his crate as my stickball bat to honor him . I left the crate on my stoop and went in to get something and I returned to see the sanitation man put the crate into the crusher . I rushed him and caught him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was out cold , convulsing on the floor like an infantile retard . " <p> The caring of pigeons has certainly found an unlikely volunteer in guys from harder neighbourhoods and backgrounds , but up on those rooftops , its these guys who are keeping alive a tradition that dates back thousands of years . Many of us see the mostly feral breed as nothing more than " flying rats " , yet in World War II , carrier pigeons saved lives delivering vital messages through what was then known as Pigeon Post . Heck , they even gave pigeons medals to honour their bravery in war . <p> In the 1950s , almost every other low-rise roof in certain neighbourhoods of New York had a coop , but pigeon flying is a vanishing sport and community . While in recent decades you could see 20 t0 30 stocks flying above the rooftops of Queens , the Bronx , Brooklyn etc , our photographer Aaron Wojack says you may see only as little as five today . <p> Landlords are cracking down on the 300 or so pigeon fliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with the gentrifying neighbourhoods . <p> " This series is an exploration of an isolated and shrinking community in which men are free to be nurturers and caretakers .

The unexpected relationship between the men and their birds suggests the inherent tenderness of humanity itself .

@@71654829 @354829/ <h> The Forgotten 1950s Girl Gang <p> You might have heard of the Teddy Boys , a 1950s rebel youth subculture in Britain characterized by an unlikely style of dress inspired by Edwardian dandies fused with American rockn roll . They formed gangs from East London to North Kensington and became high profile rebels in the media . But an important sub-subculture of the Teddy Boys , an unlikely female element , has remained all but invisible from historical records . Meet The Teddy Girls . <p> These are one of just a few known collections of documented photographs of the first British female youth culture ever to exist . In 1955 , freelance photographer Ken Russell was introduced Josie Buchan , a Teddy Girl who introduced him to some of her friends . Russell photographed them and one other group in Notting Hill . <p> After his photographs were published in a small magazine in 1955 , Russells photographs remained unseen for over half a century .

They just wore what they wore . " <p> To understand the Teddy Girls style , we first have to go back to the boys culture . They emerged in England as post-war austerity was coming to an end and working class teenagers were able to afford good clothes and began to adopt the upper class Saville Row revival of dandy Edwardian fashion . By the mid 1950s , second-hand Edwardian suits were readily available on sale in markets as they had become unwearable by the upper-class once the Teddy Boys had started sporting them . <p> Teddy Boys style <p> The Teds , as they called themselves , wore long drape jackets , velvet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thick rubber-soled creeper shoes and the greaser hairstyles of their American rocknroll idols . <p> Despite their overall gentlemanly style of dress ( certainly compared to today ) , the Teddys were a teenage youth culture out to shock their parents generation , and quickly became associated with trouble by the media . <p> Teddy girls were mostly working class teens as well , but considered less interesting by the media who were more concerned with sensationalizing a violent working class youth culture . While Teddy boys were known for hanging around on street corners , looking for trouble , a young working class womans role at the time was still focused around the home . <p> But even with lower wages than the boys , Teddy girls would still dress up in their own drape jackets , rolled-up jeans , flat shoes , tailored jackets with velvet collars and put their feminine spin on the Teddy style with straw boater hats , brooches , espadrilles and elegant clutch bags .

The racist tendencies of the Teddy boy gangs in the end lost to the unstoppable rocknroll movement centered around African-American acts . The British pop boom of the 1960s brought new music and new youth cultures . <p> here 's a clip of 1950s Teddy Boy being interviewed by a news reporter about their thoughts on an attack on a Vicar .

They were small-town girls from New Jersey who had been hired by a local factory to paint the clock faces of luminous watches , the latest new army gadget used by American soldiers . The women were told that the glow-in-the-dark radioactive paint was harmless , and so they painted 250 dials a day , licking their brushes every few strokes with their lips and tongue to give them a fine point . <p> They were paid the modern equivalent of $0.27 per watch dial , so the harder they worked , unknowingly swallowing deadly amounts of poison each time to make a few extra pennies , the faster death would approach .

At the dawn of the 1920s , an estimated total of 4,000 workers were hired by corporations in the U.S. and Canada alone to paint watch faces after the initial success in developing a glow-in-the-dark radioactive paint . The inventor of the paint , Dr. von Sochocky , died himself in 1928 from his exposure to the radioactive material . Its still unknown how many died from exposure to radiation but its clear how many could have been saved . <p> It was a time in history when the dangers of radiation were not well understood by the general public .

Thorium is predicted to be able to replace uranium in nuclear reactors and can be used as a source of nuclear power . It is about three times as abundant as uranium . <p> But the most baffling part about this story is not the fact that the general public had no idea that radium was so dangerous , but the fact that some people most certainly did ! And yet , they sat back and watched as everyone around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Radium Corporation were probably the worst .

While their young female factory workers fresh out of high school were literally encouraged to swallow radium on a daily basis , the owners and chemists were using lead screens , masks and tongs to handle the radium . <p> But negligence to share the knowledge of the dangers of radium did n't  stop there . The US Radium Corporation had actually distributed literature to the medical community describing its " injurious effects " . But of course , doctors at the time had been prescribing it to treat everything from colds to cancer . Radium had also quickly become a veritable marketing force the world over and US Radium was a defence contractor with influential contacts and deep pockets to protect its interests .

A local dentist began to investigate the mysterious phenomenon of deteriorating jawbones among women in his town and soon enough discovered the link that they had all worked for the US Radium plant , licking radio-active paintbrushes at one time or another . <p> When the women began exploring the possibility that their factory jobs had contributed to their illnesses , university " specialists " requested to examine them .

They tried to pin the girls deaths on syphilis to smear the reputations of the young unmarried women who had come to work for them . Inexplicably , the medical community went along with all of it , fully cooperating with the powerful companies . <p> It took two years for Grace Fryer to find a lawyer who would go up against U.S. Radium and the trial was dragged on for months .

The last of the girls only lived two years after the settlement was agreed . <p> In a pre Erin Brockovich style victory however , the girls were able to make a significant historical impact on industrial safety standards . The right of individual workers to sue for damages from corporations due to labor abuse was also established as a direct result of the Radium Girls case . <p> US Radium continued making luminous watches and other materials using radium paint for the army but after the new worker safety laws were introduced , not a single factory worker ever suffered from radium sickness at their plant again .

Today I got to chat with Loux the Vintage Guru based in Namibia , Africa , whose Tumblr site I recently discovered and fell instantly under its spell . The budding fashion designer and all-round exquisitely-dressed dude is making waves with a collective of twenty-something like-minded style innovators to promote the fashion industry in Africa and inspire the art of elegant dressing . The result is a visual delight of unparalleled style that Loux documents on his Tumblr . But rather than simply showing you his photographs , I wanted to talk with him , get a feel for who this talented and ambitious young African designer is . <p> If you were to take me vintage shopping in Namibia , where would we go , what would we see ? <p> I would take you to a place called Omuthiya-Gwipundi in the northern part of Namibia , its an open market where they sell vintage and second-hand clothing . You can find all sorts of wonderful clothing for both men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and it all comes from Africa ; the stuff our parents generation was wearing . <p> Vintage shopping can be really expensive over here in Paris <p> Really ? Come here ! A lot of the vendors do n't  really realise the value of what they 're selling because many people are n't  interested in wearing vintage , they just see it as " used clothing " . The main fashion district of Namibia is actually in the capital city of Windhoek where you can also find some really beautiful vintage clothing , but I prefer to go to the open markets of Omuthiya-Gwipundi , as well as Johannesburg and Pretoria in South Africa . It makes me different from most people here ; I manage to dress myself cheaply and end up looking like a million bucks . <p> What are the challenges you face being a designer in Namibia trying to launch a fashion brand ? <p> Honestly , money . To launch a brand you need to market yourself ; designers need to pay for events to showcase their clothes in the right light . Speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much the main challenge I face . <p> Tell me the story of how you first became interested in fashion <p> From a young age , I was inspired by my late grandfather , the old man always dressed in suits and shiny shoes and would tell me , " my son , fashion is what you adopt when you do n't  yet know who you are , make sure you are always well-dressed " . So I grew up loving fashion from childhood . <p> Where and how did you learn to design clothes ? <p> I learned from local tailors in Namibia as well as some friends I made from Japan .

I fell in love with vintage pieces , especially from the 1960s , and normally alter them to fit me and modernise them in my own way . Most of the suits I wear are actually my late Dads suits .

The fashion industry in Africa is growing and I advise the international industry to attend fashion shows like the AFF ( Africa Fashion Festival ) and you 'll see first-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're collaborating with a group called Khumbula , described as " young visionaries who advocate for a well cut Africa , the sartorial Africa " .

When we collaborate we call ourself LIA ( Love is African ) and were currently playing a big part by simply inspiring fashionistas around the African continent . Were also all passionate vintage fashion lovers that pay tribute to the legendary vintage clothing era . Khumbula is a Zulu word meaning " Remember " . <p> Has the Congolese subculture of the sapeurs influenced you at all ? <p> We are not part of the sapeurs but we would love to be .

You 'll also see them killing it on all the street style blogs during fashion week in Europe . <p> What 's next for Loux the Vintage Guru ? <p> Next month I 'll be showcasing my designs at RVK ( Retro VIntage Kollection ) Fashion Week in Pretoria South Africa , and then in April I 'll have my fashion show in Namibia , before I fly to showcase at the AFF ( Africa Fashion Festival ) in Ghana in May . These are all big events for me .
