These applications have widely varying requirements for resistance to exposures such as heat , chemicals and solvents , water , mechanical strain and outdoor conditions including UV light . The substrate to be labelled places exacting demands particularly on the adhesive , and from this perspective there are two main types : polar surfaces like glass , metals , ABS plastic , polycarbonate and polyester , and non polar surfaces like PE , HDPE and PP plastics . &lt;br&gt;- &lt;br&gt;&lt;img class= " ms-rtePosition-1 " LONG ... alt= " " style= " margin:5px ; " /&gt;Non polar ( low surface energy ) surfaces are particularly challenging due to the basic principle that good adhesive wet-out and bonding requires the surface energy of the adhesive to be equal to or lower than the surface energy of the labelled substrate . For bonding on low surface energy materials , additives are incorporated into adhesives to reduce their surface energy . However , these additives plus tackifiers reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience required for durable labeling. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;UPM Raflatac 's durable labelling products incorporate UV-acrylic adhesives cured by ultraviolet light . The cure initiates a cross-linking ' reaction , which locks together the molecules in these adhesives , increasing their cohesion and therefore their resistance to durable labelling exposures . Adhesives such as &lt;a LONG ... target= " blank " &gt;RC 15&lt;/a&gt; , &lt;a LONG ... target= " blank " &gt;RC 18&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a LONG ... target= " blank " &gt;RC 20&lt;/a&gt; provide options optimized for polar , non polar smooth and rough surfaces .
