" <p> Pearson in Practice has around 560 staff and all will be part of the consultation . <p> A company spokesperson said : " The consultation will begin soon , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include discussion of the staff 's and staff representatives ' ideas regarding the business , as well as individual consultations . <p> " The value of the business being written off the balance sheet will be ? and includes the estimated cost of closing the business until the end of the orderly wind-down period . " <p> He added : " There are no redundancy notices during this consultation , though the consultation will clearly outline the situation to staff regarding any redundancies that may follow this period . <p> " During this period and beyond , we will be talking to the Skills Funding Agency , and to FE colleges , other training providers and employers as part of our commitment to all learners to complete their programmes , either through Pearson in Practice during an orderly wind-down period or by transferring to other providers .

 ' accepts principle ' of Lord Heseltine 's single funding pot <p> The government has already " accepted the principle " of Lord Heseltine 's single funding pot idea for Local Enterprise Partnerships ( LEPs ) , the Tory grandee told MPs today ( Tuesday , February 12 ) . <p> Members of the House of Commons Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) Select Committee grilled Lord Heseltine on his proposals to hand over the entire skills budget to LEPs and he said Chancellor George Osbourne was " committed to the single pot " . <p> He said : " The government has accepted the principle , but as for the scale and the breadth we will have to wait for a statement around the time of the budget . <p> " There is the political will to deliver this within the government . <p> " The chancellor is committed to the single pot and I ca n't think of another chancellor who took so active a role in that sort of political and economic activity . <p> He added : " The understanding that we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is thirst for the opportunity . The length of this recession has shaken many people who had views as to what should be done . We are the only economy that has our centralism . " <p> Lord Heseltine 's comments came just a day after publication of an FE Week report that revealed the government had launched informal talks on the single funding pot idea with the Association of Colleges ( AoC ) and the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) . However , both bodies have expressed opposition to Lord Heseltine 's proposals . <p> Martin Doel , chief executive of the AoC , said : " We want to work with LEPs but I do n't think breaking up college funding and giving it to LEPs is a helpful way to do that because it makes it uncoordinated , lacking coherence and wo n't be responsive when money is tight . " <p> A BIS spokesperson declined to comment on government plans for LEPs , but said a statement on the issue would be made in next month 's Budget . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a revolution it is a big switch in emphasis to involve local people in the decision-making process and to encourage them to add extra resources from largely the private sector to that which the government can afford . " <p> He added : " Local areas ca n't get the skills . Humberside has very exciting prospects of inward investment but they know there is n't the skills supply so it will come from somewhere else . <p> " It will come from Europe , it will come from Asia , it will come from wherever but it is n't there on the ground at the moment so they have to do something about it . <p> " There 's a very serious shortage of engineering skills for example , but how long does it take to train an engineer ? That 's where the real anxiety is in the economies when I go out to visit they want more control of the agenda for producing skilled people , trained people . <p> " The thing that impresses me is that there is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally whether publically or privately about what training should take place , by whom and at in which institution . <p> " There is a ? budget at BIS that is constrained by central views and I think it would be much more likely to reflect local opportunities if the people who create local jobs played a definitive role in determining the allocation of funds .

 clashes with AoC over ' consequence of failure ' <p> Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw has clashed with the Association of Colleges ( AoC ) over the issue of failing colleges after claiming there was no " consequence for failure in the FE sector " . <p> Flanked by his learning and skills director , Mathew Coffey , Sir Michael told members of the education select committee that the system for failing schools was different to that faced by colleges . <p> " I think one of the reasons why schools are improving their performance but colleges are n't , is that there are very clear consequences to failure and underperformance in the schools sector , " he said , having revealed plans for a new ' excellent ' grade in leadership . <p> " If a school becomes inadequate and remains so , the head usually goes , something usually happens to the governing board ... etc . <p> " We do n't sense there 's that same sense of clear consequence for failure in the FE sector and that 's where both the Department for Education and Business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We would challenge those statements which appear to be unsupported by evidence , " she said . <p> " The consequences for failure in a college , for instance , are comparable to schools governing bodies regularly hold senior management teams to account for performance . " <p> The Ofsted duo were giving evidence on a number of issues from Ofsted 's annual report last year that was highly critical of colleges . <p> " With this report I tried to make it clear that schools are getting better but not as quickly as they should do and there 's a real problem in learning and skills , " said Sir Michael . <p> Ofsted has itself come in for criticism for targeting poor colleges with a ' risk-based approach , ' but took the opportunity to defend itself at yesterday 's ( Wednesday , February 13 ) hearing . <p> " In learning and skills we adopt the proportionate inspection approach , and this year about a third of all our learning and skill inspections were brought forward on the basis of the risk we felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " For colleges as part of that cohort it was more like 55 per cent . It 's right to target our resources where they 're most needed , particularly when the cohort of people studying are only studying for a relatively short period of time , one or two years , so we ca n't wait for crisis point . " <p> But the AoC 's Ms Mercer hit back again . <p> " We need to remember 64 per cent of colleges are graded outstanding or good from their last inspection , but neither AoC nor its members are complacent , " she said . <p> " The annual report no longer represents a state-of-the-nation view , nor does it provide a reliable year-on-year comparison . For example , last year 44 per cent of college inspections were conducted on a risk assessed basis as opposed to 34 per cent in schools meaning that a skewed sample of colleges was inspected . " <p> Sir Michael Wilshaw , HM chief inspector , Ofsted <p> Nevertheless , Sir Michael won Ms Mercer 's approval with plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but reiterated fears that college principals had lost focus on the quality of teaching . <p> " It 's really important that impartial advice is given to students on progression routes and I 'm not sure that 's the case , " he said . <p> " In our adjustment to our inspection framework from September we will give the inspection of careers advice a priority . " <p> He added : " Getting principals of colleges to focus on what 's important is absolutely critical . They lost their way a bit and focussed on capital investment , extending their reach , building programmes , going abroad to attract students and so on . <p> " All those things are important , but equally , if not more important is what 's happening in the workshop or the classroom as an eminent said to me ' they need to start worrying more about what 's happening in Deptford rather than Delhi ' . " <p> Meanwhile , just days after an FE Week special investigation into tumbling inspection grades at London colleges , Mr Coffey revealed fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an urban college issue , particularly a London college issue and we have seen some decline in inspection grades in London , " he said . <p> Matthew Coffey , Ofsted director of learning and skills <p> And with a government announcement on the funding of Local Enterprise Partnerships ( LEPs ) next month expected to include a single pot of cash taking in the adult skills budget , Mr Coffey said he wanted to see FE representation on LEP boards . <p> He also expressed fears the FE sector was not ready for the raising of the participation age ( RPA ) , and that funding problems had been " at the heart " of many college problems . <p> Mr Coffey said : " Given what we 've said in the annual report about key challenges , essentially about insufficient good quality teaching , some concerns about teaching of English and maths at level two , we are concerned about the preparedness of the sector to be able to take on board what essentially will equate to another 250,000 students by 2015 . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many problems we 've identified and the report does pose the question ' is the system fit for purpose ? ' Its main reference point is the financial incentives have all been wrong ; they 've led to very low level qualifications being delivered across the board to a wide number of students . <p> " For example alcohol awareness and personal effectiveness because they 're funded and because it delivers the money , but what chasing this money has done , is taken the leadership 's eye off the ball of what really matters , which is teaching and learning . " <p> The AoC 's Ms Mercer said : " We welcome Ofsted 's recognition that a lack of stability in the system caused by colleges having to chase funding year to year has been at the root of many of the problems the report identified and that perverse funding incentives need to be addressed . " <p> Sir Michael is inaccurate . Whilst there may not be a system for replacing Principals of colleges judged inadequate , in my experience , very often resignation and replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ' nasty , brutish and short ' . Whilst there can be no room for complacency , since it 's my belief that there is always room for improvement , and college leadership teams need to have a primary focus on teaching and learning , providing that the management capacity and capability is there , then College 's should seek out opportunities both commercial and otherwise . This is particularly the case now as the public purse shrinks and is likely to continue to do so . Sir Michael has a great track record of improvement , and one of which I would be proud , but in my opinion his comments are narrow , ill informed , albeit motivated by a sincere determination to improve provision for students across the learning network . <p> As ever , there will be some good and some bad in this situation not all colleges can be tarred with the same brush . It 's ironic that an organisation that inspects providers for how well they differentiate and meet individual needs appears to be falling into a trap of over-generalising limited @ @ @ @ @ <h> The Most Painful 
 told ' no chance ' of growth request <p> Chris Henwood <p> 9:21 , Mar 1 , 2013 <p> 1 <p> A training provider in the Midlands slashed its growth request by 75 per cent after local staff at the Skills Funding Agency said there was " no chance of putting forward any form of growth case for classroom-based provision for the unemployed " . <p> Bosses at Leicester-based , which has around 450 learners in sectors including construction and logistics , now hope that the agency will increase their contract from ? to ? . <p> The firm had planned to ask for ? , but decided to pass on the provision that the increase would have funded to other prime contractors after local agency staff said the request would fall on deaf ears . <p> managing director Nic O'Donovan said : " We received correspondence from our agency relationship team that , despite being a priority for growth , there was ' no chance of putting forward any form of growth case for classroom-based provision for the unemployed ' . <p> " They said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sufficient funds in the system . <p> " So we knocked back about 75 per cent of our original growth request and brokered it out to other primes . " <p> " Where funding allows , we will continue to expand the offer to the unemployed and provide growth for apprenticeships where there is clear employer demand , " it said . <p> The situation has led to confusion in the sector about growth requests and Mr O'Donovan said new guidance " might be helpful " . <p> However , the agency declined to produce up-to-date information on the growth requests situation in light of the experience of providers such as . It reissued the guidance dated January . <p> Meanwhile , a spokesperson for the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) , which has been in talks with the agency on growth requests , said : " We understand some providers have still recently been told by agency relationship teams that some growth requests should not be put forward and would not be funded . <p> " We would like to reiterate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requests will be considered , subject to affordability . " <p> An agency spokesperson said : " We will increase the funds needed to support the rate increases introduced for English and maths . <p> " The agency will also increase access for high quality apprenticeships where there is clear employer demand , and to support unemployed people back to work . " <p> However , the AELP spokesperson said : " The current growth request issue has shown that demand for apprenticeships is not being fully met that is why we are talking to the skills minister and the agency about it . <p> " But if the funding is more efficiently allocated to providers who can evidence demand , then there is no reason why growth in standalone NVQs and apprenticeships should be mutually exclusive . " <p> The agency spokesperson added : " We continue to review performance of providers against their minimum contract value , through our published quarterly performance management arrangements .

 all workplaces are sites of learning <p> " Have you been sent here as a reward . . . or as a punishment ? " Lorna Unwin asked more than 100 delegates at a LSIS leadership and management conference in London late last month . <p> Throughout the day , delegates heard how leadership could support excellent learning , and how to lead outstanding learning . <p> Professor Unwin , of the Institute of Education , examined leadership and learning from a slightly different perspective . <p> She pointed out that most delegates had actually come to the conference as an experience that was simultaneously working and learning . <p> " All workplaces are sites of learning it does n't matter how big they are , how small they are , what they produce , what services they provide , " she said . <p> " Most people still tend to think learning only takes place in classrooms or in settings designed for learning . " <p> Professor Unwin urged delegates to think about what their workplace was like as a learning environment . <p> " Maybe you have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , trainees and clients , " she said . <p> " Our institutions are workplaces . But because their focus is on the learning of those they wish to serve , they tend not to be thought of as workplaces , and I think they 're the poorer for it . <p> " If colleges and providers thought of themselves as workplaces they could model what good workplaces would look like , and use those new ideas with the workplaces they send learners and apprentices to . " <p> In the most expansive workplaces , the process of management is regarded as a form of pedagogy <p> " In the most expansive workplaces I have researched , the process of management is regarded as a form of pedagogy , " she said . <p> In one workplace , she had been told : " To create a learning environment we need our managers to understand how learning takes place , how to foster it and nurture it and almost for managers to see themselves as teachers or tutors . " <p> She added : " Key to that idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to employees in a way that would be similar to what you 're doing with your learners . " <p> Anthony Bravo , principal of Basingstoke College , said the key was to have high expectations of student , staff and yourself . <p> " You have to know that your college is great or , if it 's not great , that you want to make it great . If you do n't have that belief , the college is sunk , " he said . <p> " Our vision is simple : every learner will succeed . " <p> This might be ambitious , he admitted , but having visited colleges awarded grade one by Ofsted , this ethos had stayed with him . <p> " Every teacher must fight for every learner . I have ridiculously high expectations , I ca n't help it . <p> " I dream of having 100 per cent success rates , and that 's what I largely get , " he said . <p> " If you have low expectations the vast majority will live down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast majority will live up to them . " <p> Like Professor Unwin , he argued that the best support a leader could provide might be to allow people to use their own judgment . <p> From left : Professor Lorna Unwin , Institute of Education and Anthony Bravo , principal of Basingstoke College <p> " You must trust people , " he said . " You must allow them to fail . Not twice on the same thing , but definitely once . <p> " What 's important is that your people know what support is available for them to meet those expectations . " <p> He gave delegates a taster of some of the strategies for improvement he and his curriculum manager had designed , and provided copies of a teaching and learning assessment strategy for them to take away . <p> " There is no best way of doing anything . Whatever you do has got to be a conscious decision on your part to try and be as good as you can be , " he said . <p> Caption for featured image : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference in London Pictures by Nick Linford <h> London Burger Bash 
 radical change took place as colleges were freed from local authority control . <p> The revolution had started five years earlier when the 1988 Education Reform Act introduced market forces into state schools . <p> After the Further and Higher Education Act of 1992 and the resultant Incorporation the following year ( page 3 ) , however , colleges rapidly overtook schools and could now teach them a lesson or two no wonder government officials were imploring college leaders to sponsor a new generation of academies at the Association of Colleges ' annual conference in Birmingham last November . <p> But what has happened to colleges over the last two decades ? What are the prospects now as the Coalition offers new " freedoms " through strategies spelled out in New Challenges , New Chances in what many would describe as a period of " re-Incorporation " ? <p> It is clear that the revolution , started 20 years ago , is still in need of nurturing " <p> This supplement can only provide a snapshot and , in so doing , concentrates solely on the colleges and local adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the politicians of both the Coalition and Labour Party say ( page 4 ) , Incorporation is " unfinished business " as colleges must get even closer to employers and the community through Local Enterprise Partnerships . <p> Were anyone to doubt the unfinished nature of the task , Association of Colleges chief executive Martin Doel ( page 5 ) points out that the whole process of self improvement and true autonomy envisaged all those years ago will take at least another three to five years to complete . <p> But as coverage on pages 6 and 7 shows , protracted debates over who really owns or controls the sector have not stopped a remarkable upsurge of enterprise and entrepreneurialism in FE . <p> While it must be acknowledged that a few rogue college leaders overstepped the mark with dodgy deals and franchises bringing unwelcome curtailment of freedom for the majority the creative zeal of most , characterised lately by the Gazelle Colleges Group , has been remarkable . <p> The 20-year case study of City and Islington College shows just how far such zeal reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , the FE sector continues to suffer a relatively poor image . To a large extent , as shown on page 10 , this arises from the complexity of the sector and failure to identify a college " brand " . <p> But page 11 poses the question that perhaps a unified " brand " is impractical in light of the changing and burgeoning scope and size of colleges post-Incorporation . <p> It 's just the latest in a highly equivocal , nevertheless constructive , relationship between FE and its inspectorate , as inspectors present ( Matthew Coffey ) and past ( David Sherlock , who was a member of the Lingfield inquiry into professionalism in colleges ) testify on page 12 . <p> But as new , more affordable learning opportunities emerge daily through the power of ICT ( page 13 ) and as the quality of the FE estate improves despite the pressures of austerity ( page 14 ) , it is clear that the revolution , started 20 years ago , is still in need of nurturing . <p> As a last word , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept sight of the true needs of FE ? <p> Alan Tuckett , of the International Council for Adult Education , and David Igoe , from the Sixth Form Colleges Association , remind us on page 15 that the world of FE is bigger than the skills agenda that currently dominates . <h> Where others failed 
 rise of the entrepreneurial college <p> Former hairdressing apprentice Jodie Whitemore ( pictured right ) is running her own salon at the age of 20 while completing a foundation degree at West Nottinghamshire College . <p> Just four years ago , she started her NVQ with no school-leaver qualifications and looked destined to add to the growing bank of NEET statistics . But Asha Khemka , her college principal , had other ideas with the creation of the Ashfield Centre aimed at capturing the likes of Jodie . <p> Nineteen-year-old Joseph Johnson ( also pictured ) is a similar entrepreneurial success story . While studying professional cookery at the college , he helped create the Forest Ferret company , producing and selling jams and preserves . <p> When Khemka launched the Ashfield Centre , she discovered that public funding would never meet the centre 's needs and so founded the Inspire and Achieve Foundation a charity separate from the college to fund it . <p> Based in former South Yorkshire coal-mining communities with severe cycles of inter-generational deprivation , the college had to act , she says . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to support the job-creators of tomorrow where enterprising students from the college and local sixth-forms will learn what it takes to succeed in business while hearing from inspirational guest speakers . <p> Similar initiatives can be seen springing up elsewhere , and not just for NEETs . <p> Among them is the Gazelle Group of 20 colleges , launched in April 2011 , which its chief executive , Fintan Donohue , describes as " subversive " in intent . <p> " The group promotes the idea of entrepreneurial colleges as a disruptive influence for positive change in the purpose of colleges and the nature of their offer , " he says . <p> Technological change is rapidly replacing colleges and classrooms as the route to knowledge and skill " <p> Colleges have been striving for a more enterprising approach ever since incorporation reaching out to the community , creating arms-length college companies which reinvest profits in learning , and franchising courses to reach people in the workplace , but they too often came to grief for overstepping the mark or being accused of using public funds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seen as quite respectable for colleges have come to the rescue of collapsed or failed enterprises , such as the Newcastle College Group takeover of Carter &amp; Carter and Khemka 's own college appropriation of training company Pearson in Practice . <p> Several factors are forcing a change of attitude and approach , says Donohue . <p> " Traditional colleges and qualifications no longer provide the career opportunities they once did , " he explains . <p> " Young people are more open to the sort of entrepreneurship already established in countries like India and Africa . Technological change is rapidly replacing colleges and classrooms as the route to knowledge and skill . And the recent European Commission report makes entrepreneurial education its number one priority . " <p> This constitutes a far more generalised rather than utilitarian view of students being enterprising and entrepreneurial , he says . <p> " We need people who are ' enterprising ' in all the dimensions of their life , not just about their career paths and financial investments , " explains Donohue . <p> For Sally Dicketts , principal of Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to bring the best of the past and present together is through the creation of a learning company , where students are employed in real commercial operations as a significant part of their college experience .

Following a three-course meal , delegates were treated to a ' This is Your Life ' tribute to Mr Hoyle .

 the merger mystery <p> Chris Henwood <p> 10:56 , Jun 21 , 2013 <p> 0 <p> A proposed college merger in the Midlands made the FE Week news pages earlier this year after the intervention of Skills Minister Matthew Hancock . Chris Henwood looks at the national picture of mergers over the past few years <p> When Skills Minister Matthew Hancock sent a letter to every college chair and principal in England reminding them of the rules about merging , there will have been few , if any , who failed to sit up and take notice . <p> Accountability , consultation and competition were key to his advice , four months ago , that came not long after his officials at the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) looked at plans for two colleges in the Midlands to become one . <p> The proposals for Stourbridge College and Birmingham Metropolitan College came under the spotlight to " establish if appropriate processes have been followed " . <p> The principal of a local college claimed he had found out about the proposals on Twitter , while another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has since gone through with Mr Hancock 's blessing . <p> David Nolan , chair of Stourbridge College Corporation , said : " The board of governors at Stourbridge College unanimously voted in favour of merger after considering the wide range of benefits this would create for our learners , including greater choice of courses , improved facilities and enhanced connections to employers and the jobs market . " <p> A BIS spokesperson said : " Stourbridge Corporation has responded constructively to our concerns by demonstrating why it considers the merger to be the best option for learners , local employers and the community . <p> " The corporation has now gone through the proper process and undertaken a college structure and prospects appraisal as set out in New Challenges , New Chances . " <p> But just how common are mergers ? <p> Six took place last academic year , according to information to supplied to FE Week by BIS , and eight the year before that , but in the year starting September 2009 there was n't one although Bicton and Exeter Colleges thought about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of just two in the current academic year to the end of April . <p> The second is between Ludlow Sixth Form College and Herefordshire College of Technology , and both involve one of the colleges dissolving before its assets shift to the other ( Stourbridge dissolved on May 31 and Ludlow is due to do the same at the end of next month ) . <p> Such dissolution is the norm , but Norfolk 's Easton College and Suffolk 's Otley College were both dissolved in August last year followed by the incorporation of Easton and Otley College , despite a trip between the two . Filton College and Stroud College took the same path earlier in the year , resulting in the South Gloucestershire and Stroud College . <p> However , mergers are n't always a done deal . Newcastle College and Northumberland College , and City of Westminster College and College of North West London ( CNWL ) also looked at merging , but all decided against it in the end . <p> If that sounds like there may be growing caution over mergers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should n't . Some are under consideration now , including North East Worcestershire ( New ) College with Worcester College of Technology . <p> A joint statement by the New and Worcester colleges said : " A Joint Options Group will lead an accountable and open process . . . Any proposals resulting from these discussions must bring clear benefits to students , the local communities and employers . " <p> Meanwhile , " collaboration " is up for discussion between Middlesbrough College and Gateshead College . <p> In a joint statement , the chairs of Middlesbrough and Gateshead , Bob Brady and Robin Mackie , said : " We would be delighted if we can bring the collective strengths of our colleges together . <p> " This would give us the opportunity to take a more regional perspective working with our funding bodies , local authorities , local enterprise partnerships and others for the benefit of students , staff , employers and both local communities .

We felt this would be best for both our colleges , and constructed a relationship with a shared services company and a leadership team spanning both colleges . <p> " In setting this up , we saved around ? against our combined turnover of ? from our management costs . <p> " It was challenging , though , as we had to ask our excellent staff to take a leap of faith with us and enter into new ways of working , while the different cultures and practices of the two colleges do n't always sit comfortably alongside each other .

 of subcontracting for first time <p> More than 1,600 subcontracting agreements , totaling ? of funding , were in place between providers who already held their own direct contracts with the SFA . <p> It is the first time that the extent of inter-lead subcontracting has been disclosed by the SFA ( click here to download ) . <p> Meanwhile lead providers gave out ? of business , via 2,235 contracts , to organisations that did n't hold direct contracts ( click here to download ) . <p> However , more subcontracting could be taking place because the figures are based on self-declarations and only agreements worth ? 100,000 or more are included the SFA spreadsheets . <p> County Durham-based Learning Curve had a direct SFA contract worth ? last year and was also by far the biggest subcontractor . <p> The firm , which has a direct SFA contract for ? for the coming year , had ? in subcontracting arrangements with 32 lead providers last year . <p> Tony Outhart , Learning Curve director and co-owner , said subcontracting played such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Learning Curve chief executive in 2004 because " in the early years it was difficult to get a direct funding contract with the Learning and Skills Council , so the natural way forward was to work in partnership with colleges . " <p> He said : " Then when Train2Gain was launched we were offered direct contracts in four regions , and we have continued to grow our SFA contract year-on-year ever since . <p> " This year we also became a direct Education Funding Agency EFA provider to extend our provision to 16 to 18-year-old learners in addition to our core Adult Skills Budget-funded workplace and classroom provision . <p> " Although we are a directly-funded SFA/EFA provider we want to continue to build on the strategic delivery partnerships we have developed with our college partners over the past nine years . " <p> He added : " We are hoping to increase both our direct contracts with SFA and EFA , and at the same time continue to develop high quality , sustainable partnerships with FE colleges . " <p> The firm pays anywhere between 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes on from lead contractors . <p> " I think this is a fair arrangement given the QA , funding , MIS and audit support our partners provide , " added Mr Outhart . <p> An SFA spokesperson said Learning Curve had " quarterly opportunities to make a case for growth in relation to its direct contract " . <p> He said : " If and when such a case is received , we will consider it ... in accordance with our published process and subject to affordability at that point in time . " <p> Learning Curve , which was rated as good by Ofsted in early 2009 , also dishes out provision to subcontractors and is listed on the SFA website as doing so with five providers . <p> The next biggest subcontractor was the Skills Network , which does not have a direct SFA or EFA contract and so is not subject to full Ofsted inspection . It took ? of business from 14 colleges and one independent provider last year . <p> Nobody from the North Yorkshire-based Skills Network was available for comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of subcontracting from colleges was issued by its chief executive , Mick Cox , two months ago . <p> He said : " Good training providers can add value to a college 's curriculum offer , through the provision of niche services . <p> " We have our own contacts within relevant business communities , and our own experienced staff who understand the needs of these sectors . Colleges are able to use a training provider 's longstanding relationship with employers to build on their own employer engagement . " <p> The SFA spokesperson said it had conducted apprenticeships pilots over the last 12 months to see if subcontractors wanted to become lead providers . <p> " The organisations were invited to participate through our e-tendering portal and 62 training organisations were successful in their application for a direct contract with us as a result , " he said . <p> " The Skills Network did successfully apply to deliver apprenticeships through one of the pilots , but elected not to enter into a contract . " <p> Based on management fees of 20 per cent , and total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to ? could have been taken from front line delivery of education . <p> However , that figure could be even higher with a number of primes charging around 30 per cent and FE Week has even learned of one prime charging fees of up to 35 per cent . <p> " We do not determine how much subcontracting a provider can undertake , " said the SFA spokesperson . <p> " There are clear funding rules and contract clauses that support subcontracting arrangements , however we are clear it is the responsibility of the provider to ensure that its subcontracting arrangements represent good value for money and that there is sufficient funding being allocated for the delivery of high quality education and training . <p> " Providers who contract directly with us are responsible for the entirety of the value of their contract and all of the provision that it funds .

Then we had the more recent Coalition Government 's short-course and bogus Apprenticeships masquerading as quality training , with ministers erroneously claiming record levels of expansion . Who is monitoring subcontracting now and how closely in this new age of deregulation ? <p> Well said Gill , having seen some very greedy lead providers contracting with some equally greedy supply chains and making far too much money through ' roll em in stack em high ' approaches makes this type of arrangement beyond any understanding ! ! <p> Such is the 
 chief executive , said : " We are deeply concerned about the possible impact of removing the need for teachers in our sector to have teaching qualifications , given their responsibility to serve a vast and diverse group of young and adult learners , including some of the most vulnerable people in society . <p> " We believe that tomorrow 's engineers , accountants , technicians , mechanics , plumbers , chefs and healthcare workers should be taught by teachers who know their specialist subject well and have been through initial teacher training to ensure that they have the right teaching skills too . " <p> Barry Lovejoy , UCU 's head of further education , said the union would continue to push the government to ensure that newly-appointed lecturers had to have teaching qualifications . <p> " We are disappointed that the government appears to believe it is acceptable for lecturers to teach students without having a recognised qualification , " he said . <p> " We shall be pressing the case for all lecturers in our colleges to remain fully-qualified professionals . " <p> The IfL publication includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from contributors including Norman Crowther , national official for post 16 education at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers ; Jayne Stigger , head of maths and science at North East Surrey College of Technology ; Sue Rimmer , principal at South Thames College ; and , Mike Hopkins , principal at Middlesbrough College . <p> Joe Vinson , vice-president ( further education ) of the NUS and also a contributor to the publication , said : " Further education supports so many different types of students , with different backgrounds , different levels of ability and different needs . <p> " To have someone at the front of a workshop or classroom with no quantifiable or standardised way of supporting a diverse group of students is a disservice to the students themselves , the college and the community they serve . " <p> A spokesperson for the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills said the Education and Training Foundation was " in place and developing a firm foundation for the self-regulation of the profession " . <p> " The foundation 's aim is to develop a well-qualified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , management and governance , " he said . <p> " It will define and promote professionalism in the sector and ensure the availability , scope and quality of initial teacher training . It is for individual institutions to decide what teaching qualifications are appropriate for their particular situation . " <p> He added : " The highest quality of teaching is paramount to the success of each college and we trust FE institutions to employ those they believe to be best qualified for the job . " <p> Hi Ian , Please clarify who you mean by ' we ' as in ' the value of professionalism WE crave ' and ' WE should welcome the freedom to self-regulate ' ? It clearly does n't include my fellow teachers or I , who are referred to as ' they ' . Pronouns can be very revealing . Evidently , the freedoms you seek are freedoms for people like ' you ' . Forgive my skepticism. 20 years of ' independence ' has seen an erosion of ' our ' conditions . ( Do you recall ELS ? And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overtime , and so on ? ) More is needed than far-sighted college ' leaders ' to protect ' our ' professionalism . Given recent history in FE , might not ' we ' need a little protection from ' you ' ? This is quite apart from the legitimate expectation that governments set frameworks for professional standards in relation to largely publicly funded education . As a tax-payer funding your probably generous salary , I expect nothing less . <p> The idea that FE has the maturity to make its own decisions about quality and the qualifications required by teaching staff is fine if one is prepared to accept that FE can be compared to an errant teenager who has now grown up . This is not a meaningful comparison . <p> If teachers are to develop and maintain their professionalism , we need the support and protection of a legislative framework . Sadly , college management structures with a keenly focused eye on the bottom line are not entirely respectful of pedagogic expertise . <p> It is hard to imagine what evidential base would be accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit from outcomes that do more than hit the bottom line . There is ample , credible and well documented evidence that a regulated sector is an improving sector . Our challenge is working out how to defend the progress we have made . <p> After working so hard over the past 20 years to achieve recognised , legislated professionalism within the Post 16 sector , it is disappointing ( and worrying ) to see Government moving away from this . I fully support the freedoms afforded our sector through Self-Regulation but the imperative for effective , professional teaching and learning must be derived from a clear , mandatory framework followed by all in the sector , anything less will negatively impact on future learning and our collective credibility . <p> The Lingfield Review emphasised freedom from regulation as a positive thing for employers but paid no attention to a teacher 's freedom to undertake teaching qualifications . Now it is no longer a requirement to be qualified how long before corners are cut . How long before employers are no longer happy to pay towards professionalising their staff ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone mad . Are we saying goodbye to Ofsted too and all the quality measures , for ensuring that education at whatever age is offering the learner the best opportunity ? Standardisation in education is facilitated by trained teachers singing from the same hymn sheet , understanding theory and pedagogy and putting it into practice . <p> I am not particularly fearful for delivery at colleges but what of the other training organisations falling under the FE banner ? I do not believe that each and every one of them will put their staff through if there is no need to . I work as a subcontractor and the management fee we have to pay nearly cripples us . I wo n't ever stop keeping my staff " professional " because it benefits the company and the learner , but others will no doubt be tempted . <p> However , LG 
 plan after wrath of Wilshaw <p> The government has announced an action plan to tackle poor careers advice after Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw attacked schools saying " too few are doing enough " on the service . <p> He hit out with the education watchdog 's much-awaited report Going in the right direction ? Careers guidance in schools from September 2012 offering a damning commentary on careers guidance in schools . <p> The report showed that 75 per cent of the 60 schools visited were not implementing their duty to provide impartial careers advice . <p> Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said schools , which have been responsible for providing their 14 to with careers guidance since 2012 , would in future be issued with clearer advice on their responsibilities . <p> He said he also wanted more employers involved in response to the Ofsted report and also a report this year by the National Careers Council which called for a " culture change " in careers guidance . <p> " I want all schools to do as the best do inspiring young people , providing work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr Hancock . The National Careers Service is also set to " be improved to give young people a greater understanding of the full range of options available to them " . <p> The Ofsted report came out on September 10 the day after Sir Michael praised schools for " radical advances " in inspections . <p> He said : " Our findings show that too few schools are doing enough to ensure all their students receive comprehensive advice about the breadth of career opportunities available . " The criticism comes nine months after the Education Select Committee warned of a " deterioration " in schools ' careers guidance . <p> Committee chair said Graham Stuart said : " This Ofsted report makes an irresistible case for change and I very much hope ministers are listening . " <p> " This is a matter of social justice and economic competitiveness young people need the support to make the right choices and the youth unemployment rates are a sad testament to that . " <p> Association of Colleges president Michele Sutton said : " We are letting young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarity on the full range of providers , including sixth form colleges and colleges , and to the widest range of options open to them , which includes further and higher education , traineeships and apprenticeships . " <p> Stewart Segal , chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , said : " The Ofsted report should lead to schools and colleges being more transparent in terms of the careers advice offered and more welcoming to input from training providers and employers . " <p> David Igoe , chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges ' Association , said his members " rely on local schools providing information and guidance on all the opportunities available and ... too often we felt that this statutory duty was neglected or just blatantly ignored . " <p> Brian Lightman , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , wanted " high-quality , face-to-face guidance provided by qualified professionals is available in all parts of the country " . <p> David Hughes , chief executive of the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education , said employers should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Including employers ... will go some way to inspiring those wanting to take a more vocational route , " he said . <p> Lynne Sedgmore , executive director of the 157 Group , suggested colleges step in to help schools , because they " offer excellent advice and guidance services " . <p> Meanwhile , Karen O'Donoghue , president of the Career Development Institute , called for guidance to be delivered by Qualifications and Credit Framework level professionals . <p> Her family back

 's bonfire of the quals <p> Around 95 per cent of the adult vocational market 's 19,000-plus qualifications could be axed under radical proposals to " de-clutter the system , " FE Week can reveal . <p> The move , put forward by BAE Systems group managing director Nigel Whitehead in a review requested by Skills Minister Matthew Hancock , would leave just " hundreds " of qualifications . <p> Mr Whitehead 's report , published by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in which he is a commissioner , said there were a number of problems with the current " complex , over-prescribed " system . <p> It was failing to " generate vocational qualifications that are valued widely or seen as a signal of marketable skills , " according to his report . <p> Mr Whitehead recommended that Ofqual , the Skills Funding Agency and the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills should use " design principles " as eligibility criteria for public funding of qualifications . <p> The design principles are aimed , among other things , at promoting greater collaboration between employers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the workplace . <p> In conjunction with counting identical qualifications from different awarding organisations as one , the report includes examples of how the design principles , which would be used over Qualifications and Credit Framework ( QCF ) rules , might hit the market for certain regulated qualifications . <p> It suggests a 50 per cent fall in engineering qualifications ( to 166 ) , an 81 per cent fall in adult social care ( to 58 ) and a 72 per cent fall in retail ( to 66 ) . <p> Speaking to FE Week ahead of today 's launch of his report , Mr Whitehead said his proposals would therefore mean the overall number of publicly-funded adult vocational qualifications should fall drastically from the current figure of more than 19,000 . <p> " It 'll come down to hundreds of recognisable qualifications across the entire landscape as opposed to thousands , " said Mr Whitehead . <p> He added : " I think awarding organisations should actually look at we are proffering here and recognise that what we are saying is that where there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their thought into it , then that should be recognised . " <p> The report also called for more information about the impact of qualifications , and said : " Our vision is of a de-cluttered skills landscape , making it easier for industrial partnerships to use the regulated qualifications system to align skills with vocational qualifications in their sectors . " <p> The potential cull of 95 per cent of qualifications would be the second such move in recent months . <p> Nearly 1,900 adult qualifications , that had little or no uptake , have already seen their public funding cease , as Mr Hancock pointed out . <p> He said : " We are already using elements of his approach to streamline and simplify the publicly-funded adult vocational qualifications offer , and will use it to inform our work as we drive to make our skills system more rigorous and responsive to the needs of employers and learners . " <p> Glenys Stacey , Ofqual chief regulator , said : " We recognise and accept the challenge the report ... sets for us as regulator , working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations as we review the QCF , and more generally as we develop strengthened arrangements for regulating vocational qualifications . We will be saying more in the coming months about our plans . " <p> Chris Jones , director-general at leading vocational awarding organisation City &amp; Guilds , said : " Cutting the number of adult vocational qualifications from almost 20,000 to a few hundred seems drastic at first glance , but we are in this position because of QCF accreditation rules and the role of the Sector Skills Councils . <p> " We fully support de-cluttering of qualifications . The ability to localise each qualification to meet the needs of both employers and individuals , without having it reaccredited , will certainly achieve this . <p> " What it really comes down to is ensuring employers own the requirements for their industry . The number of qualifications should be an outcome of their needs , rather than a centralised quota . Our recent research showed that over half of employers want to be involved in qualification design . That 's why it 's so important that the Whitehead Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be guided by the whims of the SSCs . " <p> A Pearson UK spokesperson said the awarding organisation would welcome a sensible streamlining of qualifications , " and Rod Bristow , its president , said : " We look forward to working closely with UKCES , employers and other partners to consider the implementation of each recommendation in detail and ensure the proposals impact positively on the employer and the learner . " <p> Charlotte Bosworth , director of skills and employment at awarding organisation OCR , said : " The qualification mountain and the inhibiting infrastructure of the current system has to go . Under the QCF , we 've seen a vast inflation in the number of qualifications , driven by funding incentives not by genuine demand . " <p> Jill Lanning , chief executive of the Federation of Awarding Bodies , declined to comment . <p> Adult vocational qualifications Q&amp;A <p> The London HQ of BAE Systems played host to a Q&amp;A session with Nigel Whitehead on Tuesday evening . The UKCES commissioner was interviewed on his review of adult vocational qualifications by FE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets for skills in the UK that which is funded and progressed by employers and the regulated government-funded market , and the two do n't mesh . <p> There 's a lot of government money spent on the creation of skills and capability in the UK and largely speaking employers , and particularly small employers , look at it and think , ' what 's that all about ? ' and potentially therefore that is an inappropriate use of public funds . <p> What do you mean by " inappropriate use of public funds " ? <p> We see evidence that training providers are being paid to provide qualifications for individuals , but those individuals have sets of qualifications which are n't necessarily matched to the needs of the market . <p> There is a sense in the existing system that courses are being selected on the basis of ease of passing them , as opposed to whether they actually qualify you to work in a particular industry and sector and then become a passport for mobility within that sector . <p> Successive governments have attempted to reform the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review ? <p> I thought that what I was going to be talking about was something that was really quite radical and unpopular and throughout the process of consultation I 've gone out of way to try and get all the potentially angry people in one room and get it thrashed out . <p> What reactions were you expecting ? <p> Currently there are 176 awarding bodies that we 've found and I 'm making some recommendations about how they interact with employers ; the implication being that they 're not doing that or they 're not doing it well enough . <p> I thought they would see that a gross criticism and that in some way I was taking away from the very nature of what they do . <p> What I actually found is that those organisations or the people in them come to work wanting to do a good job and if you can say to them this is what better looks like they actually respond very well . <p> When you said that learners are taking the wrong qualifications , is there a criticism there of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some organisations have pandered to the government rules on what it takes to actually get funding as opposed to focusing on what the employers need first and foremost , and to some extent that let 's down the learner because they go through the process in good faith believing that there 's something at the end of it . <p> You refer to decluttering the system does that include reducing the 19,000-plus regulated vocational qualifications ? <p> I think it does . Having been through the arithmetic of it , there are some simplifications you can make where you acknowledge a qualification once rather than having 140 versions of it , which actually takes the numbers down significantly . <p> But one of the fundamental problems is that the system is impenetrable for either the learner or the employer . <p> As an engineering employer I know my way around the principal engineering vocational qualifications . <p> I can count on one hand the qualifications I could name and my counterparts across industry will talk in those terms , but if you actually expose them to the many qualifications that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I do n't really know where to start with this ' . So there does need to be a decluttering of it . <p> Part of it is the titling and naming , but also the system has allowed I think , a plethora of potential solutions which has led to confusion , so I think with what we are recommending , in particular the issue about recognisable qualifications , we should get a coalescence around some major recognisable qualifications . <p> What feels like the right amount of qualifications ? <p> My personal view is that it 'll come down to hundreds of recognisable qualifications across the entire landscape as opposed to thousands . <p> So from more than 19,000 to potentially under 1,000 ? <p> Yes . One of the examples drawn to my attention was retail and the difference between Scotland and England were 140 recognisable qualifications in a particular branch of retail in England , but in Scotland the same area was covered by just five qualifications . <p> Who decides on the qualifications to stop publicly funding ? <p> I 've made no attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the process of putting principles in place and we test the qualifications against the new design principles in the report , and Ofqual looks at whether the awarding bodies have lived up to those new design principles , that will naturally end up with a selection and deselection of particular qualifications . <p> So there 'll be a natural filtering of it as opposed to something that happens on day one and so from that perspective I would see it as a natural washing out of the old and an arrival of the new as people embrace the new design principles . <p> If there 's government money going into this then the throttle on that money would be whether qualifications and training providers are actually meeting the new expectations set out in this report . <p> So in terms of the flow of government money there 'll be a point which you say it either does or it does n't satisfy , so in that sense there will be an ability to switch on and off the money and at the moment that falls through the Skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles I would expect to see happen through the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills and the SFA . <p> The adoption of the principles and the regulation of the awarding bodies and ultimately a training provider is through Ofqual . <p> And if we 're getting two ' no 's at that stage than I be very surprised if government money was sanctioned and I would be surprised , in particular , if Skills Minister Matthew Hancock would allow that situation . <p> Why introduce grading for competency-based qualifications ? <p> It 's a personal hang-up that simply passing a course is not enough . <p> I 've yet to meet an employer who does n't want to employ anybody other than the best people that come through , so in the greater scheme of things , a simple pass/fail works for some qualifications , but for the majority it will be grading will result in learners wanting to do better because they can . <p> Was your conclusion that there needs to be fewer qualifications , one that you were instructed by the Skills Minister to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions . He asked for my view of the vocational skills landscape . The government gave me free rein to say my opinion and it cuts both ways because they can say ' that 's just his opinion ' . <p> But equally they can say ' we value his opinion ' . So it stands alone in that regard , and no , I have not responded to any instruction from government . <p> If this can be done it would be a welcome simplification of the assessment system and stop awarding bodies inventing products which are simply there to get them a share of the huge market for fundable qualifications . <p> AELP chief executive Stewart Segal said : " AELP welcomes the report 's recommendations for working in partnership with employers , awarding organisations and providers . We feel that the proposed move away from unitisation requires more consideration and a partnership approach is required on the development of success measures and the use of technology . "

" <p> Skills Minister Matthew Hancock also announced a new programme to improve broadband infrastructure and provision in colleges . <p> Colleges will receive new funding which was not specified to install second broadband connections with help to make the most effective use of existing provision , including upgrades to bandwidth . <p> Mr Hancock said : " Colleges that embrace the latest technologies can revolutionise the services they offer to students and business . This new funding to improve broadband infrastructure will provide colleges with greater resilience and improved broadband speed . <p> " As many as eight out of 10 colleges are relying on a single connection , for both their operational and teaching needs including cloud-based applications and online business . <p> " It 's easy to imagine what happens if that connection goes down , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ install a second broadband connection giving them greater ability to operate and support their students with the latest technology 24/7 . " <p> It is thought that as many as eight in 10 colleges are relying on a single broadband connection and maybe unaware of the impact this could have if the connection fails . <p> Lynne Sedgmore , executive director of the 157 Group , said : " The additional investment to support college broadband accessibility is most welcome , as is the reassurance that skills capital funding flowing through local authority partnerships is indeed ring-fenced and guaranteed for an additional year . We will of course be working with partners to establish how this can be used for colleges . " <p> Peter Roberts , chair of the 157 Group and chief executive of Leeds City College , said : " Last month , the 157 Group published its manifesto for FE and skills .

 Wilson his story <p> Janet Murray <p> 9:16 , Jan 20 , 2012 <p> 0 <p> The unionlearn director talks to FE Week . <p> Raised in rural Shropshire , in a family that was " very middle of the road " politically , Tom Wilson was an unlikely teenage leftie . In fact , his parents both teachers regarded his political awakenings with some amusement , he says . <p> Educated at Wellington Grammar School , which " had pretentions to being a posh school but was in fact a very ordinary grammar school , " he was inspired by the example of former pupil Len Murray , who went on to become the general secretary of the TUC . " This was back in the early 70s and me and my mate Desmond , whose dad was convenor at GKN Sankey a local engineering company were sort of radical lefties , " he recalls . " We were fixated on the fact that if Len Murray came from our ordinary school and he was general secretary of the TUC , well then we could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something he jokes was down to growing up in a small village and having " nothing else to do " Wilson went on to St. Andrew 's University , where he studied philosophy , got heavily involved in student politics and spent a lot of time arguing with " rising young Thatcherites . " It was an exciting time to be a student ; St. Andrews was the first university to opt out of the National Union of Students a move Wilson fought against and the protest movement had begun to gain momentum . <p> But it was working during the university holidays that really started to shape his political interests , he says . During his time at St. Andrew 's he worked in construction , on factory production lines , as a hospital porter and , in perhaps his most unusual job , cooked breakfasts for workers on an oil-rig in Scapa Flow , off the Orkney Islands . <p> " I always think actually I learned more from those experiences than I ever did from university , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how bloody awful and boring lots of peoples ' jobs were . <p> That was where I got into learning for the first time , because it really kind of impressed upon me , that in those days particularly , if you did n't do well at school and you had n't got yourself into college or university you were stuck . You were stuck in some dead end boring job for the rest of your life . " <p> His experiences pressed upon him the significance of his upbringing , of being brought up around books , with parents who encouraged him to study . While many of his colleagues were equally , if not more intelligent and well-informed as him , the hand they had been dealt in life meant that while he would be going back to university and a choice of jobs or careers , many of his colleagues " were stuck there forever . " I 'm not saying unions are perfect , but I 've always felt more comfortable in a union than any political world . " <p> But he admits his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , working for the Pepsi Cola bottling factory in Acton , west London , where " basically , the job was to wade up to your knees in broken glass and sticky kind of Pepsi that was all over the floor " taking bottles off the production line and putting them in plastic crates . <p> Having seen a notice pinned to the wall that made him realise that the recruitment agency he and his colleagues many of whom were African immigrants were employed by , were giving the workers half what they were being paid by the company , he was incensed . <p> I 'm not saying unions are perfect , but I 've always felt more comfortable in a union than any political world . " <p> But he soon found colleagues did n't necessarily share his views . " I said to the bloke next to me ' Look at this , we 're getting paid half why is the agency getting all this money ? ' And he was horrified that I was kind of rocking the boat a little bit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought I was mad to get upset about it or protest about it ... he could see it was completely unfair that the agency was ripping us off to that extent , but he thought it was inconceivable that anyone could do anything about it . " <p> After university , Wilson did a diploma in Social Administration at York University , followed by a Masters in Industrial Relations at Warwick . After a brief spell working as a journalist , on a magazine for trade union officials , he moved to the GMB , where he spent six years doing research , speech writing , drafting wage claims and teaching shop stewards . He then moved to the Labour Party , where he spent three happy years as their national trade union liaison officer and got to know some of those , like Peter Mandelson , who went on to be part of the government . <p> " I know he is n't terribly fashionable in some quarters , but he was a very personable , bright bloke , " he says of Mandelson . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never agree with everyone 's politics . He was a very interesting guy and unlike some others , he was genuinely interested in the relationship between the trade unions and the Labour Party . " <p> There were many ups and down in the job , but the biggest low was the 1987 election , says Wilson . Having " ate , slept and breathed " the campaign for weeks , losing the election Labour 's fourth successive defeat was a crushing blow . <p> After three years working for the party , by which time he had two small children , he realised the job was n't compatible with normal family life . He moved to the Association of University Teachers ( now known as UCU , since its merger with the National Association of Teachers of Further and Higher Education in 2006 ) , where he stayed for the next 15 years in a variety of roles , including head of research . <p> Wilson joined the TUC in 1993 as head of organisation and services and was appointed director of their learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immensely proud of the introduction union of learning reps , a new kind of union activist role that is concerned with helping employees access learning and training which he says are " massively important and the foundation of everything we do . " The biggest challenge for unionlearn at the moment , is moving employers on from awareness to action , from wanting unions " just to be kind of cheerleaders for what they do , to a genuine kind of equal and open discussion where they sit down and are prepared to actually negotiate properly and openly about the way they organise their training . " <p> More broadly , the challenge for the union movement is being clear that while it does not support many of the government 's policies ( particularly its stance on pensions ) , it does acknowledge the support the government is providing for skills and training . <p> Wilson speaks warmly of the skills minister John Hayes , who he says is " engaged , supportive and interested " and " plainly cares about unionlearn . " <p> But he is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , who he says " are supposed to represent British employers and they do n't really do enough in my opinion to argue the case for better and fairer investment in training ... " <p> In his vision for a fairer education system for all , there would be a National Learning Service , instead of the " fragmentary patchwork " of further and higher education currently in existence . In this kind of system , he says , people could move more easily from further to higher education and between institutions which , above all , would make funding far less complicated . <p> While at 59 , he has no plans to retire , he would love to write a book about history of trade union learning which , he concedes , might make " most people roll their eyes in horror and think ' how boring can you possible get ? ' " Clearly , after more than 30 years ' involvement with unions that is where he feels most at home . <p> " When I was at the Labour party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prone I think to looking at things in terms of individuals you know , who 's in and who 's out . But unions are a different sort of world where culturally you look much more at people generally in terms of the organisations or the groups of people they belong to ... I 'm not saying unions are perfect , but I 've always felt more comfortable in a union than any political world . " <h> Juventus ' Corner

 , are you ready for the raising of the participation age ? <p> Increasing the minimum age at which young people in England can leave education or training is an unsettling prospect . <p> No-one can predict with absolute certainty how the further education ( FE ) sector will adapt to the implementation of mandatory participation up to the age of 17 next year . <p> The Association of Colleges ( AoC ) held an event in Paddington last week to give advice on how FE colleges could attract more students during the recruitment period and prepare for increased competition from schools . <p> Julian Gravatt , assistant chief executive ( research and development ) at the AoC , said colleges should be preparing an offer which will differentiate themselves from rival learning providers . <p> " You need to devise an appropriate response , taking into account not only capacity , but also local need , who else is around and doing things and also what the available funds are what is actually possible , " Mr Gravatt said . <p> Raising the participation age will mean that teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to undertake either 534 hours of full-time education , an apprenticeship , full-time work or volunteering supplemented with 280 hours of part-time education . <p> Under the reforms , colleges and schools will have a duty to monitor attendance and employers will need to ensure training is being delivered appropriately to the learner . <p> Mr Gravatt warned that the implementation of the policy could have a negative impact on the funding allocated for each student . <p> " After having several years of the 16-18 education budget going up and us as a sector using that very well , the way in which we will get increased numbers in the next few years is partly at the expense of making some quite significant cuts in terms of funding for students , " he said . <p> " It 's a policy with desirable ends but is coming in a financial environment which is difficult . " <p> Mr Gravatt said the reform was being used by government as a solution to youth unemployment and the number of people not in education , employment and training ( NEET ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy used to say , whatever you do think or used to think , the number one issue is tackling youth unemployment , " he said . <p> " A college can either engage with that and do it well , or it may feel actually others will do it better . It 's a choice , but given the priority it 's an issue and you should see the full participation for 16-17 year-olds within that context at the moment . " <p> David Russell , director for participation and vocational education at the Department for Education ( DfE ) , appeared to agree with Mr Gravatt and emphasised the government 's interest not only in tackling NEETs , but also those currently in jobs without training . <p> " We also know that a very small number of 16 and 17 year-olds in jobs without training , although there are a very small number of them , they only have marginally better outcomes in the long run than those who are NEET , " Mr Russell said . <p> " So we are almost as concerned about those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal and chief executive of Lancaster &amp; Morecambe College , said raising the participation age was creating a great deal of fuss over a very small proportion of learners . <p> " Some of this seems to be much ado about nothing , " Mr Wood said . <p> " It 's a very small group of people which we are chasing and at one level EMA is being removed , the fees for higher education have gone up incredibly high , local authorities are losing their authority , academies are increasing competition . All those things seem to be challenging the ability to tackle this group head on . " <p> Mr Wood agreed however that competition from schools would continue to be a huge issue for FE colleges . <p> " I 've got eight schools around me , for 11-18 's , who wo n't let me in . The root of the NEET problem is in poor information and guidance I think , " he said . <p> " So even though we 've got lots of people participating , a lot of them are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lives . " <p> He added : " What I do n't want to be doing , is fighting other providers for those young people . <p> " What I see at the moment is a fair degree of anarchy and chaos about to emerge for a very small group of people . " <p> Jon Thorn , head of business development at the National Apprenticeship Service ( NAS ) , added that apprenticeships should n't be seen as a ' one size fits all ' solution to the problem . <p> He said : " There 's always a risk around a programme which is doing well that it does become a solution for every problem or challenge that there might be . " <p> It 's a policy with desirable ends but is coming in a financial environment which is difficult . " <p> Peasgood , deputy principal of City College Norwich , said simply creating more places for students wo n't be enough to raise the level of participation either . <p> She said : " Between us , I really do believe that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then later at 17 , but is that enough ? I do n't think we 're in the field of dreams territory , that we can be sure that if we build it , they can come . " <p> Raising the participation age is likely to cause some problems for the FE sector , but Fiona McMillan OBE , president of the AoC and principal of Bridgwater College , said it would help young people in the long run . <p> " We all know that not being in education or training beyond 16 means you are considerably more likely to experience being out of work , more likely to have a criminal record , more likely to suffer from low self-esteem and from bouts of depression , " she said . <p> " There are really strong social , personal and economic reasons for looking at extending the time that young people are in employment , and in training , and are gaining qualifications and valuable experience .

 celebrates 90 years at annual conference <p> Over 1,500 students from across educational institutions in the UK descended upon Sheffield 's City Hall to attend the National Union of Students ( NUS ) flagship National Conference . <p> National conference is the sovereign body of the NUS and sees delegates electing their representatives and policy for the forthcoming academic year . A raft of policy was debated and approved by delegates regarding the Union 's political stance on various aspects of further education ( FE ) . <p> Celebrating 90 years since its formation , the NUS , has often been criticised for its prioritisation of more higher education related campaigns . However in recent years efforts have been made by many to raise the profile of FE within the NUS and to more ferociously campaign on the issues that the FE membership mandate the Union with . <p> On day two of the conference Toni Pearce was re-elected in a landslide victory to the office of vice president further education for the NUS . <p> Pearce , formally President of Cornwall College Students ' Union , was elected in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her opponent Jamil Keating received 69 votes and " re-open nominations " three . <p> Speaking during the election 's hustings on the second day of conference , Pearce said : " NUS must move forward with our narrative of a fair , high quality tertiary education system for all , based on parity of esteem between academic and vocational , supported by genuinely independent information advice and guidance and properly funded by the state . " <p> Following on from the ballot of FE delegates and her re-election in Sheffield , Pearce explained to FE Week the mandate that she has been given by her membership for the forthcoming year . <p> We are witnessing an entire generation of young people not just being forgotten by their government , but being completely abandoned " <p> " I am overwhelmed that the FE membership has given me the opportunity to once again represent FE students . My first term has thrown at me many challenges and our movement begun the fight to protect our sector and students . From the harsh withdrawal of EMA to the proposed removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what two years of this Coalition Government has done to the sector , we have another three . " <p> Pearce went on to declare that her second term will be one where she leads the Union 's refocus to those who are the most vulnerable . <p> " We are witnessing an entire generation of young people not just being forgotten by their government , but being completely abandoned . Successive governments have attempted to pull the rug from under young people , and maybe they 've almost been successful . But I absolutely refuse to sit back and accept it . Last year we were successful in our campaign to prevent the withdrawal of Care to Learn and I am determined that we are mobilise our Unions once more to protect those that are most vulnerable . " <p> During the conference the 1,500 delegates mandated the Union with plethora of new policies that it must act upon during the forthcoming academic year . The further education zone committee proposed several polices which sanctioned stances on Ofsted , Student Governors , Offender Learning and called for the implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures ; similar to the OIA in Higher Education . <p> Delegates also debated the Union 's approach to the government 's White Paper on higher education reforms leading to a vote calling for the resignation of David Willets , the universities and science minister . The conference delegates also voted to hold a national demonstration against the government 's reforms in the first term of the 2012-13 academic year ; a demonstration that is expected to involve thousands of FE students ; in opposition to government cuts in education . <p> The NUS Annual Conference was held at Sheffield City Hall Liam Burns was reelected as President of the NUS <h> Keep FE Free campaign launched by NUS <p> On the first day of its National Conference on Tuesday , NUS launched its latest FE campaign Keep FE Free ; its campaign against the introduction of fees and student loans for adults in further education in England . <p> The campaign launch featured as part of a fringe event during the conference discussing the government 's proposal of introducing a system of student loans ; similar to tuition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offset the governments planned withdrawal of the current 50 per cent subsidy for level 3 qualifications for those over 24 years old . <p> The vice president of NUS , Toni Pearce opened the fringe by providing the room , of around 100 FE and HE students , with an introduction to the government 's proposals and why NUS believes the government should " halt progress on the introduction of fees for college students . " <p> Pearce went on to add that , " under the new regime , adults will face barriers to participation and progression , leaving them with limited education , training and employment opportunities . " <p> Following on from her opening of the fringe and launch of the campaign ; Pearce was joined on the platform by Fiona Aldridge , head of work place learning at the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education ( NIACE ) . Alridge informed the delegates of NIACE 's undertaking of research into the impact the Government 's proposals would have and declared that they " were a high risk strategy . " <p> Aldridge explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost of their education ; however warned that the impact of the current proposal is under-researched . <p> " We would support in principle that if you can contribute to the cost of your learning then adding private money to public money does increase the provision that can be offered . However , we do think that the demand for loans and the impact of loans is under-researched , that the policy is being implemented too quickly and there is a severe underestimate of the complexity . " <p> Following on from the remarks of both speakers , delegates were then invited to debate their views on the proposals and were encouraged to lobby their local MP 's . Delegates discussed and shared their own experiences from their Unions . The FE Zone Committee of the NUS has produced post cards with a clear message emblazoned requesting their MP to not support these proposals . <p> Pearce added : " This cut in funding will be hugely damaging to further education , normally a place where adults can get a second chance if they 've been failed the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current economic climate ? How will they access higher level apprenticeships ? And how will they afford Access to HE courses ? I and my membership will campaign tirelessly against the implementation of these loans .

 future of adult learning <p> Ever-rising levels of unemployment , lack of skills among sections of the population , equality , changing policy and funding rates are just some of the issues that those in further education need to battle on a daily basis . <p> But how do they move forward ? The potential answers were discussed at The Future of Adult Learning , organised by the Westminster Employment Forum , last Tuesday . <p> Deborah Roseveare , head of the skills beyond school division in the directorate for education at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , said there are three reasons why adult learning matters . <p> She said : " First , it contributes to human capital development , both economic and social . Secondly , the changing skills demand , especially over the 40 years of working life . <p> " Thirdly , demographics mean if you want to boost the human capital and you want to meet changing skills demands , then you have to look at adult learning , because the university cohort adds such a little fraction to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told delegates the OECD is currently carrying out a survey to assess skills held by adults , which will be available in October . <p> She said : " One of the challenges that we have is that we do n't know what skills adults actually have and the good news is we are currently carrying out a major international survey of adult foundation skills . <p> " This is looking at literacy , numeracy and problem solving and a lot of information about background and how they are using their skills if they are in the workplace . " <p> Mrs Roseveare said adult learning should not be looked at " in isolation " , adding : " Adult learning needs to be linked to other economic and social policies . <p> " We are , in a few weeks , going to be releasing the OECD skills strategy , which looks at the evidence and sets out a framework for developing better policies for skills development and utilisation . " <p> David Hughes , the chief executive of the National Institute for Adult Continuing Education ( NIACE ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 'm not wholly optimistic about the way things are going at the moment . <p> " Therefore , opportunities are difficult to focus on and actually I think challenges are what we should be focusing on , " he said . <p> He began with six " areas of context " , such as the economic crisis , which Mr Hughes believes is also a social crisis . <p> The second point , he added , is government uncertainty , " about understanding what they are about and what they stand for " . <p> His third point revolved around " fewer adults " learning , while the threat to widening participation , caused by declining numbers , funding cuts and reductions in the unit of funding for learning , was his fourth point . <p> He added : " The fifth is a shift , particularly around level 3 , from state funding to state financing , so we are moving into a world where we are asking people to take loans at level 3 which has never happened before . <p> " We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His final point related to the government 's localism agenda . <p> Moving on , Mr Hughes then spoke of key challenges , including the " need to promote adult learning in terms of its wider benefits " and inequality . <p> He also added : " I think there is going to be a social wave of concern around social inequalities in our society . We 've got to get in there and show just how unequal so much of the adult learning sector is in terms of the sorts of people who participate . " <p> Mr Hughes also stressed " all forms of adult learning are equally important " and the best employers " really do understand that learning is an important skill " . <p> However , he also suggested that the sector needs to " rehabilitate the word ' learning ' " . <p> He said : " We 've focused too much on skills , too much on training and too much on teaching , rather than learning . <p> I 'm not wholly optimistic about the way things are going at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room but if you go to many people out there , they do n't think learning is a positive . If you think about people taking their driving tests , they are proud if they do it in as fewer lessons as possible , as the learning is not what they want , it 's the passing . <p> Meanwhile , Tom Wilson , director of unionlearn , the learning and skills organisation of the TUC , said : " From a trade union perspective , we are quite optimistic .

" <p> Mr Wilson spoke of a recent trip to Germany with skills minister John Hayes . <p> " There is n't that same distinction between personal , informal and what counts as company learning . There is encouragement for all sorts of learning and a recognition that the two blend into each other , " said Mr Wilson . <p> The director also said it is the union 's view that , in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , you need " at least " a level 2 . <p> He said : " Most of the young unemployed are people who ca n't get a job , because they ca n't get a level 2 .

" <p> Mr Wilson later said : " It 's not the squeezed middle , it 's the excluded bottom . <p> " The two or three million out there , of any age , who ca n't get in the workplace or easily engaged and we have to reach out to them and the way to do that is informal learning .

 is ' very different kettle of fish ' <p> The fast-approaching FE loans policy has been labelled as " very complex to implement " , " difficult to market " and cause for " real worry " from key figures in the sector . <p> A roundtable debate , held at the FE Week office and attended by a representative from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , the University and College Union ( UCU ) and the National Union of Students ( NUS ) , as well as the shadow minister for FE , among others , was used to discuss the sector 's growing concerns with the scheme . <p> Peter Pledger , chief executive of South London Business and chairman of the Confederation of Apprenticeship Training Agencies ( ) , criticised the government 's timetable for introducing the policy , emphasising that learners would need more time to think about applying for a loan . <p> " With all due respect , you need to get your act together , " he said . <p> The Department has revealed to FE Week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Advanced Learning Loans " . <p> A BIS spokesperson told FE Week : " After carrying out testing with a sample of learners , we have chosen the name ' 24+ Advanced Learning Loans " ' . <p> Gordon Marsden , shadow minister for FE , skills and regional growth , emphasised at the roundtable debate that learners in FE are very different to those in HE , and should be treated accordingly by the Student Loans Company ( SLC ) . <p> Mr Marsden said : " ( The ) government can say until its blue in the face that it will be done in the same way as HE loans . <p> " They may want to use the same instrument , the SLC , but it 's a very different kettle of fish , delivering loans across variable courses for variable lengths and at variable times of the year , to doing a sort of one size fits all with HE loans . " <p> Andrew King , the lead on FE loans at BIS , responded : " We have had to look at how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are systems in place so that it can be dealt with . " <p> Toni Pearce , vice president ( FE ) at the NUS , said the absence of UCAS in the further education sector would be another issue for the SLC . <p> She said : " For the SLC to only have to interface with UCAS is one thing , but to have to interface with a variety of different providers in the country ? <p> " We could well be in a situation where students receive a loan and do n't get onto their course , or get onto their course and then do n't receive a loan because those two things have to interface separately . " <p> The FE loans scheme was first announced as part of the spending review in 2010 . <p> The priority is to shift money towards young people in an age where we have millions of young people unemployed " <p> A budget was then set to introduce FE loans in 2013/14 ( ? 129 million ) and 2014/15 ( ? 398 million ) , based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is understood that learners will make repayments on an income contingent basis , equivalent to nine per cent above the ? 21,000 threshold . <p> The Department held a consultation with the sector last summer , and has also published reports detailing the initial impact assessment and equalities screening impact assessment . <p> The final versions of these reports alongside new market research which examines the potential impact of FE loans on learners are expected to be published later this month . <p> Mr Marsden said he was waiting with " baited breath " to see how the research had been carried out . <p> " I think the whole picture that we 're building up is of concern , concern that people will be nudged away from FE and real , severe difficulties about the implementation period , and relative breakneck speed at which this is now proceeding , " Mr Marsden said . <p> " Yes , it was flagged up in 2010 , but what has actually happened between 2010 and up to the last six months ? The answer is very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Community College and member of UCU , said she knew teaching staff who were still unaware of the policy , and that it would be very difficult to sell the concept of a loan to learners in their local area . <p> " Teachers who are involved in enrolment and marketing , who have to promote the college , are going to find it very difficult to market , " she said . <p> " We 've spent a lot of time trying to engage adult learners , over 24s , and particularly women in our community , and it 's going to be very difficult to sell that whole notion to them . " <p> Mr Pledger said he did , however , support the introduction of the FE loans system . <p> " It 's absolutely the right policy , " Mr Pledger said . <p> Kate Lomas , lecturer at Greenwich Community College and UCU member and Peter Pledger , chief executive of South London Business and chairman of <p> " Will it hurt FE colleges ? Yes . Will it hurt adult community colleges ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority is to shift money towards young people in an age where we have millions of young people unemployed and that 's where you want to shift money , and we support it . " <p> Mr Pledger added that the introduction of FE loans would also help create a " truer market " for learners aged 25 and above . <p> " They will choose the courses that truly will help them make more money , " he said . <p> The shadow minister for FE responded by saying the government should be worried about the effect the policy will have on the record number of new adult apprentices . <p> " I think the government should be concerned that their much flaunted expansion in post -24 apprenticeships could well fall off a cliff if this goes wrong , because you will get droves and droves of people not prepared to take a post 24 apprenticeship loan up on an individual basis , " he said . <p> Mr Pledger said that while he agreed the number of adult apprentices would drop following the implementation of the loans system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help eradicate ' deadweight ' . <p> " What I would like is if we 've got a limited amount of resource is that resource is focused at those under 24 without a level two or level three qualification , and if we want people to up skill at a higher level , the employer either pays for it or the individuals get loans on qualifications that truly meet their needs , " Mr Pledger said . <p> Mr King said the Department had looked " very seriously " at apprenticeships , and argued that many apprentices would be happy to take out a loan once they understood the value of the qualification associated with their programme . <p> " Once they understand the offer of the loan that 's available to them , that 's when they 're willing and willing to cost taking that out , " Mr King said . <p> " ( They ) see the value of the loan offer that 's available , rather than just the increasing debt that it might otherwise be seen as . " <p> The Department will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manage the loan applications from April next year . <p> However , Maxine Room said the FE loans system should be deferred a year unless an online system was available instead . <p> " I 'm driving an e-strategy in my college , and it seems incredible that you 're even thinking about it , " the principal of Lewisham College said . <p> " What will happen in colleges and the psyche of college is something I know well is you start with a paper based system , you then go to an online system , but staff keep their paper based system because they 're worried about the online system . " <p> Mr King was clear the Department was developing an online system simultaneously , which they hoped to implement at the earliest opportunity . <p> " It 's not that we 've made the decision not to have an online system , but obviously ( we 're doing ) as much as we can to accelerate that process and potentially bring it forward , " he said . <p> However , Ms Room said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We need to have our information this year , now , and the system up and running so we can trial it , " she said . <p> " We 've had issues in our own organisation about trialling some of the system changes , and staff have been very negative when we 've put systems in without actually piloting them . <p> " Now for you to come in and say the system is a paper based one , but you might have an online one , well for me is a no-no . " <p> The new name for FE loans , " 24+ Advanced Learning Loans " , was also criticised during the roundtable debate . <p> " Well it could be simpler , " Ms Room said . <p> " It 's not a name ; it 's a descriptor is n't it ? " <p> Mr Marsden added : " I think the name is potentially going to have the unintended consequence of turning quite a lot of people off . <p> " I 'm sure that 's not what ( BIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't been thought about . " <p> Mr King said the new name was a result of a survey conducted with the sector . <p> " It was n't a name we put forward as part of the survey , but it was actually something that was suggested as part of the responses . <p> " So we gave three responses and people came back with ideas about Advanced Learning Loans , and 24 + Advanced Learning Loans .

Click here to download . <p> Chief executive of Natspec , Alison Boulton , and executive director of 157 Group , Lynne Sedgmore , write in the forward that the voices of learners are key to understanding how colleges can offer the best support . <p> " The traditional wisdom says that policymakers make policy and practitioners implement it . We believe that it does not have to be that way , and seek , through publications like this , to allow the real experiences of learners to influence those who make policy decisions , " they said . <p> One of the students featured in the report was former Ruskin Mill College student Charlie Avent , 24 , who 's autistic . <p> Mr Avent is pictured above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , with Lynne Sedgmore , where he said in a speech about his experience being a learner : <p> I do n't have learning difficulties , I had teaching difficulties " . <p> With permission from the 157 Group we have included Charlie 's story below , as written by Jan Murray in the publication . <p> Charlie : Harmony through horsemanship <p> I did n't get on well in mainstream education . Reading and writing was a struggle for me , but my teachers did n't seem to understand my difficulties . Their constant criticism made me angry and confrontational , so it was difficult to make friends . <p> The kids at school did n't seem to like me : they 'd just beat me up and call me names . I felt completely isolated , as if I were in a foreign country where no one understood my language . By the age of 15 , I was losing the will to live . <p> I did try riding as a child , but autism makes you very sensitive to the world around you and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realise I was freaked out by the violence of it all , particularly seeing horses being whipped , but I just was n't able to articulate those feelings at the time . I 'd just freak out or have panic attacks . <p> I was moved to a special school at 15 , and then on to Ruskin Mill College at 19 . But despite having greater freedom , I still struggled to fit in at college . Then my art teacher Patricia introduced me to her horse , Oscar , and everything changed . <p> When I first saw Oscar , it was like meeting a long-lost member of the family . I knew instinctively that I wanted to understand more about how horses communicate . Having noticed my enthusiasm , staff at Ruskin Mill College arranged for me to do work experience at Heartshore Horses , a centre for natural horsemanship near Minchinhampton in the Cotswolds . <p> Dawn , who owns the stables , introduced me to the concept of natural horsemanship , explaining how horses communicate through their movement and gestures . If you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse is happy , sad , in love or even if they like you . <p> In all , I had 18 months of weekly work experience and learning natural horsemanship at Heartshore . When I left Ruskin Mill College , I asked Dawn if I could stay on doing regular volunteer work at the stables , which I have been doing ever since . <p> I knew early on that I wanted my own horse , but had no idea how I would afford the livery . After talking it through with Dawn , she said I could keep a horse at Heartshore in exchange for helping out at the stables a few days a week . <p> Thanks to the help of staff at Ruskin Mill College and Dawn and my colleagues at Heartshore , I now have a much better understanding of myself . " <p> In natural horsemanship , your horse chooses you , not the other way round . As soon as I saw Spirit , she lowered her head and pawed the ground , which was a very clear sign that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , it is a very powerful moment and I decided then that I wanted to use my interest to help raise awareness of autism . <p> Since then , I 've continued to work part time at Heartshore and have started giving demonstrations in natural horsemanship to children and young people with autism . Last year , I gave a talk at the Natspec conference about autism something I 'd never have done before I started working with horses . <p> When you 're on the autistic spectrum , it 's like your brain is on a different operating system from other people 's ; if you compare the brain to a computer , it 's like the difference between Apple and Windows 7 . <p> Thanks to the help of staff at Ruskin Mill College and Dawn and my colleagues at Heartshore , I now have a much better understanding of myself , which means I am far more able to control my behaviour . I 've learned that no one listens when you 're ranting and raving , which means I am far less likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 now , and when I look back on my teenage years , I can see why I was angry . I felt I had no voice and no choice . I 'm sure a lot of young people and not just those on the autistic spectrum feel like that . <p> Young people 's interests are their strength , and if we could develop a system that helped young people pursue their passions , instead of trying to educate everyone in the same way , I 'm sure we could reduce anti-social behaviour and underachievement . <p> I used to think of autism as a disorder , but my experiences have taught me that being on the autism spectrum is a disability only if you perceive it that way . Imagine an axe : in the wrong hands it can be destructive , but if used in the right way , it can create beautiful things . That 's how I see autism now . And for the first time in my life , I feel I can have my say . <p> It has since

 minister sets out his vision for the future of FE <p> FE Week reporter <p> 9:55 , Dec 2 , 2013 <p> 0 <p> The Shadow Education Secretary , Tristram Hunt , chose the Association of Colleges conference as the venue for his first speech since taking on the role in early October . He used to opportunity to outline policies laid down by his party 's Skills Taskforce in its second report , entitled Transforming further education : A new mission to deliver excellence in technical education . Here are extracts from his pre-prepared speech along with some of the key recommendations from the Skills Taskforce report , published on November 21 . <p> In government , it will be an early and vital priority to rebuild our careers service for young people . <p> They are being failed at the moment and we can see the social and economic consequences all around us . <p> And these failings particularly hurt vocational education where the routes to qualifications and accreditation are often harder to decipher . <p> I want to make it very clear that raising the status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a signal task of Labour 's time in office . <p> It is why I chose to come to this conference to give my first speech as Shadow Education Secretary . <p> For there can be no transformation of vocational education in this country ; no change in the fortunes of the forgotten fifty per cent ; no improvement on social mobility , without the hard work and dedication of the people in this room . <p> If that were not already clear , then the shocking findings of two recent reports from Alan Milburn on social mobility and from the OECD Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development on our numeracy and literacy skills have made it so with devastating emphasis . <p> When social mobility has ground to a halt ; when older age groups have better numeracy and literacy skills than our young people ; and when the long tail of underperformance wags hardest in the 14 to 19 age range ; then none of us can afford to be complacent . <p> But this is not just about social justice . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1997 we saw that higher education expansion was vital for our future competitiveness we now realise how vital vocational excellence is for the same reason . <p> Byzantine funding regimes ; perverse incentives ; shambolic co-ordination ; central government and its agencies have a lot to answer for when we consider the proliferation of qualifications and the breadth of provision . <p> Where academic rigour is strong it is absolutely right that colleges continue to deliver A Levels and send students to higher education . <p> But the most important thing we can do to deliver vocational excellence is to bring about a transformation in apprenticeship provision , both in terms of quality and quantity . <p> But this is not just about social justice . It is also a matter of absolute economic urgency <p> We will say to business : ' If you want a major government contract you must provide apprenticeships for the next generation ' . <p> But we will give employers more control over skills standards and funding . <p> And we would guarantee quality by ensuring that apprenticeships are all level three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course mandating that apprenticeships should be of level three standard does not remove the need or demand for level two qualifications . <p> But that is what I would call a real traineeship . <p> Indeed , the truth is that too many apprenticeships in this country are delivered at a level that would not be recognised as an apprenticeship in places like Germany . <p> And in far too many cases they are a cover for the repackaged re-training of existing employees . <p> But changes to apprenticeships are only one half of the equation . <p> Alongside delivering the off-the job training component of apprenticeships , this must be where FE applies its focus . <p> Alongside compulsory English and maths , our Tech Bacc would be accredited by business and contain a work experience requirement . <p> However , a gold-standard must be seen that way by all by parents , businesses , colleges and , most of all , by young people themselves . <p> So the Tech Bacc must only be delivered by highly qualified lecturers , who understand how to tailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> So I can announce today that as part of Labour 's new mission for FE , colleges who demonstrate strong performance in specialist vocational teaching ; strong links with local employers ; and high quality English and maths provision would be recognised as specialist Institutes of Technical Education . <p> And only Institutes of Technical Education would be licensed to deliver our gold-standard Tech Bacc and the off-the-job component of apprenticeships . <p> What is more , to make absolutely sure that business buys-in to our gold standard , we will take advice from the UK Commission on Employment and Skills responsible for determining the exact criteria for awarding the licenses . <p> With this comes a renewed focus on English and maths . <p> Numeracy and literacy are the most basic 21st century skills . Contrary to the government , we think it is right to follow the lead of our international competitors by making English and maths compulsory to 18 for all students . <p> So , unlike the Government , we would require that all FE lecturers hold a teaching qualification and because English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would ensure that all FE teachers hold a teaching qualification at level two or above in English and maths . <p> We would allow the Education and Training Foundation to set tough minimum standards on qualification and CPD requirements for teachers in FE colleges . <p> And we would improve vocational excellence by ensuring that teachers spend a period of time in their industry each year , developing their specialist area . <p> The 48-year-old from 
 employers will take ownership of apprenticeships in a new HMRC funding system <p> Paul Offord <p> 21:15 , Dec 5 , 2013 <p> 6 <p> Apprenticeship funding will be redirected from providers to employers but they will have to make a " significant " cash contribution towards training costs for the first time . <p> Chancellor George Osborne announced in his Autumn Statement a new funding model would use Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ) systems to route funding directly to employers . <p> The Treasury subsequently announced it would launch a consultation on the technical details of the system early next year . <p> A compulsory employer cash contribution for a significant proportion of apprentices ' external training costs , excluding English and maths , will also be introduced . <p> Mr Osborne told the House of Commons : " The government will put business at the centre of the apprenticeship system by enabling employers to receive funding for the training costs of apprentices directly through an system and ensuring that employers contribute . " <p> A Department for Business , Innovation and Skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered to route apprenticeship funding directly to employers . <p> The government will also be looking at the option of an " alternative funding route for the smallest businesses " . <p> The Autumn Statement also talked of an " additional contribution " to the costs of training for 16 to and consider the approach for , but did not commit to fully-funding them as now . <p> The Treasury further announced it would make ? of new funding available to help deliver an additional 20,000 higher apprenticeships starts in the 2013/14 and 2014/15 academic years . <p> Phil Orford , chief executive of The Forum of Private Business , welcomed the changes which he said would make providers " deliver the skills employers require " . <p> However , the announcements drew a strong warning from the chief executive of City &amp; Guilds , Chris Jones , told FE Week : " Although it is n't the intention , the Autumn Statement puts the apprenticeship system at risk . <p> " All employers , regardless of size , will feel the effects . The reforms will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to jump through to establish an apprenticeship . Where is the incentive there ? " <p> Stewart Segal , chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , said : " Mandatory contributions will be a barrier to the growth of the programme for those aged over 19 , especially young people who are unemployed . " <p> So does this mean that if employers are being asked to make a ' significant contribution ' to 16/17 year olds on an apprenticeship , then in essence employers will be subsidising the state education as these young people would otherwise be at school ? This of course would be on top of the additional resources that the business would have to wrap around the apprentice all of which is costly . <p> Chris makes a good point Graham Hoyle , when leading the AELP used to argue that the funding directed at functional skills should be clawed back from the school that had " failed " to get the young person up to the required standard ... Why are we paying twice for the same piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses that the Governemnt has listened to . How will small employers navigate and fund Apprenticeships ? Small employers already find it tough enough to train young people . <p> Again , policies that only support the larger employers . All the small SMEs will not have the cash to make " significant contributions " or the infrastructure to manage the admin that surrounds their obligations . This is about as good an idea as was using the advanced learning loan to fund apprenticeships for 24+ learners !

Rebecca Cooney looks back at an event five months since its " official launch " and even further back to the early discussions about a new sector organisation . <p> The concept of the Education and Training Foundation , the sector self-improvement body , was first given life in August 2012 . <p> The group has been through consultations , a name change , a shock resignation and is now up and running , so FE Week took a look back over the foundation 's eventful first 18 months . <p> In October 2012 , Skills Minister Matthew Hancock announced the Association of Colleges ( AoC ) and Association for Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) , along with HOLEX , would be steering the proposed group , then known as the FE Guild . <p> The guild , said Mr Hancock , would " support and enhance the professional standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group was renamed the Education and Training Foundation after a consultation deemed the name guild " old-fashioned " . <p> In April , an implementation plan was released detailing ? funding to be provided by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) for the first two years of the foundation , which would then move towards being self-funded . <p> It also revealed the foundation would operate by commissioning other bodies to carry out its research and development work . <p> Many questioned the need for a new sector body , suggesting the Learning and Skills Improvement Service , which was no longer funded after the foundation began , could have been modified to suit the same purpose . <p> But AELP chief executive Stewart Segal told delegates at the AELP conference in June " the Education and Training Foundation has not replaced LSIS it is a new and different organisation " . <p> Peter Davies , then leading the guild steering group , said : " The fundamental premise is that we are about having a professional , relevant , highly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education and Training Foundation was officially launched on August 1 . <p> But just two weeks in , the foundation attracted criticism for failing to properly advertise senior roles and just a fortnight after that , the interim chief executive Sir Geoff Hall resigned . <p> September saw the appointments of the permanent chief executive , David Russell ( pictured centre left ) , who is yet to take up post , and permanent chair Peter Mullins ( pictured centre right ) , as well as a commitment from BIS to provide an extra ? funding in 2015-16 . <p> The government has tasked the foundation with research and development around fulfilling the recommendations of Frank McLoughlin 's Commission on Adult Vocational Teaching and Learning ( CAVTL ) which published its report It 's About Work in March . <p> The foundation 's panel at the conference on the report , held at the Skills Show in November , raised as many questions around how CAVTL 's aims could be achieved as it answered . <p> Confederation of British Industry director for employment and skills Neil Carberry said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their parents and the education system that vocational education choices have validity .

Make sure you tell us what we need to do to support you , " he said . <p> And questions were a big theme for new chair Mr Mullins at the AoC conference the following week . <p> " We 're up , we 're now running , we 're underway , " he said . <p> " But the big question everyone wants to get a much clearer view on from us is , what does that really look like in practice ? <p> " We 've got a big programme of tenders out , of work underway , but more importantly we 're starting to engage with the sector much more about what they think comes next for us .

Whatever is proposed , we are sure that the government , employers , learning providers and learners and their representatives will need to work together to understand the full implications of this policy and how best to take it forward . " <p> A spokesperson for the AELP said : " This is very welcome news for the apprenticeship programme . Ministers have long said that they want to see more progression within apprenticeships from level two to higher levels and the problem is that loans are acting as a barrier to adults who want to move on to an advanced or high apprenticeship . <p> " By removing the cost differentials between studying individual elements of an apprenticeship inside or outside a framework which loans had caused , an outright abolition or fundamental reform could also rid us of a major anomaly in the market that was benefiting no one .

" <p> The National Union of Students ( NUS ) has also been a long-standing critic of the system . It said apprenticeships were effectively taking out loans to pay to work . <p> Toni Pearce , NUS president , said : " We have been committed to campaigning against the introduction of loans for students in FE aged 24 and over studying at level three and above ever since this entirely wrong-headed proposal was first put forward .

" <p> Sally Hunt , University and College Union general secretary , said : " Forcing older people to take out huge loans to retrain was always going to be a barrier and the time has come for the government to scrap the scheme and provide proper financial support for people who wish to study for an apprenticeship . " <p> Dr Cable 's comments came at the London offices of PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , where the LPA was launched . <p> The programme is set to provide 250 apprenticeships to attract young Londoners into professional services roles . The LPA , developed by PwC , will receive ? from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing ? 900,000 . <p> Sara Caplan , PwC partner , said : " The LPA is a new way of learning for London to create the next generation of business people and the networks to support them in training and beyond . It 's specifically designed to open up career opportunities based on people 's potential to learn and employer 's drive to grow , and challenges traditional perceptions of who can access what opportunities . " <p> A recruitment drive aimed at apprentices will begin in the New Year , and more businesses will be encouraged to employ apprentices through the LPA . Small and medium-sized enterprises will be targeted . <p> **Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said : " While the newly available loans for FE have seen higher than expected demand , loans for apprenticeships have not seen high demand . <p> " With the confirmation of a new funding system for apprenticeships in the Autumn Statement , now is the right time to reinstate co-funding for all apprenticeships ahead of more fundamental reforms , details of which will be publicised in the new year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the first sign that Apprenticeships need to have funding support and will scrap the proposed funding contributions from employers especially micro businesses who will walk away from Apprenticeships and will offer posts without the qualification route . Mr Hancock the writings on the wall ! ! ! <p> I would slightly disagree with the last comment ( sorry Lee ) , employers are willing to pay for apprenticeships however their expectations would be a ) the training provider is delivering quality provision b ) they are getting candidates who are ' work ready ' . <p> This last point is probably the biggest issue for employers . Rather than focussing on generating more apprenticeship vacancies the government should spend more time making school leavers ready for the work place . The gap between leaving education and being ready to the enter employment is growing to the detriment of everyone . <p> There is a gap in the apprenticeships system for adults over 24 with higher level skills and who wish to continue their professional development &amp; training as part of their job rather than studying as a separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up loans for apprenticeships . It is very commendable that much attention is being given to providing young school leavers with post GCSE/A level apprenticeships . However , there seems to be a forgotten pool of higher skilled adult talent who could be generating much needed GPD if the apprenticeships system were developed to include them without requiring them to pay to be an apprentice . I am guessing that we are far behind other European countries such as Germany and Holland in this ? ? <p> The government tells me to get of the doll so i do i get my grandparents to look after my 4 yr old child so i can study i did n't go to college at a younger age due to mental illness i am totally dedicated to my course in automotive and strive to acheive because i want to be able to provide a better life for my child i will not receive any financial help . With living expenses for continuing with college &amp; i cant get a apprenticeship although I 'm working towards imi a lot of students go so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as a social experience maybe if the government made 24+ more aware that further education is achievable more would apply at the moment I 'm just up against one brick wall.after the other makes me laugh job centre funds all the courses for the shit jobs no one wants and is lacking in employment <p> the biggest joke is the per month FE payment given to colleges to teach these apprentices ! ! ? 150 per month per person for 4 to 5 days at college in any given month ... are they joking ? who works for that in teaching ? ? devide that by 4 ( days ) and then devide by 8 ( hours ) = teacher hourly rate no materails or equipment <p> Still , in 
 Osborne buries hopes of college VAT refund <p> Hopes of a VAT refund for colleges look to have finally ended with Education Secretary Michael Gove admitting his hands were tied by the Treasury . <p> All 93 sixth form colleges in England , along with general further education colleges , pay VAT on goods and services , while schools and academies are reimbursed . <p> The Sixth Form Colleges Association ( SFCA ) has long campaigned for the " anomaly " to end , but Treasury Minister David said the policy would continue . <p> And Education Secretary Michael Gove said he was unable to secure funding from Chancellor George Osborne to address the issue . <p> James Kewin , SFCA deputy chief executive , said : " We are very disappointed that the government has decided not to address this longstanding anomaly , particularly when year on year funding cuts are pushing some sixth form colleges to breaking point . <p> " In that context , and when the government is meeting the VAT costs of new and untested 16 to 19 providers such as free schools and academies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> A cross-party group of 74 MPs had written to Mr Gove in October in a bid to change the situation , following a pledge from David Cameron , during Prime Minister 's questions on October 9 , to " look carefully at the issue " . <p> The VAT issue is believed to cost sixth form colleges an estimated ? per year and , according to research from the SFCA , has resulted in colleges being forced to drop courses such as modern foreign languages and further maths , as their funding reduces . <p> But Mr said in a Westminster Hall debate in parliament on December 17 that the Department for Education ( DfE ) had " considered whether adjustments could be made to funding for 16 to 19 education to recognise the differential VAT treatment of different types of providers " . <p> He said : " In particular , the DfE has considered whether it could additionally fund sixth form colleges by an amount equivalent to their typical VAT costs . The DfE has concluded that that is not affordable in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would cost ? to reimburse sixth form colleges , this would lead to the inclusion of general further education colleges as well , pushing the costs up significantly . <p> " Extending extra funding to FE colleges , which have a similar case to sixth form colleges , would cost some ? , " said Mr . <p> However , Mr Gove acknowledged the case for change when he was questioned by the Education Select Committee the following day . <p> " There are some historical anomalies , not least the fact that sixth form colleges are treated differently in respect to VAT . I 'd love to be able to change that , but money is tight , " he said . <p> " We looked at it before the autumn statement and the case is clear and strong . <p> " If I got more money from the Chancellor then I would like to and if we can be certain that it will be spent effectively , and there 's no doubt that sixth form colleges do , then I 'd love to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could put a timescale on potential change in the future , he said : " I 'd like to but the Chancellor would n't let me . " <p> Julian Gravatt , assistant chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said : " We are disappointed that government is n't planning to act on the absurd anomaly which means that 16 to 19 free schools get VAT , but 16 to 19 colleges do n't . <p> " VAT law is fiendishly complicated with UK-wide and EU implications , so we 'll be pushing DfE to ensure that students are fairly funded wherever they study .

 strips second principal of powers <p> Rebecca Cooney <p> 20:35 , Jan 2 , 2014 <p> 0 <p> The FE Commissioner has slapped a second grade four college with administered status as an Ofsted monitoring report blasted its action plan for lack of results . <p> The senior management team at Stockport College , which fell from grade one at the end of September , has been stripped of control over staffing and finance following a review by commissioner David Collins . <p> Stockport joins K College , which was given administered status last month . Mr Collins has made two further college visits , to Bristol and Liverpool , and both have seen him issue recommendations . <p> Further , Ofsted called for principal Stephen Carlisle ( pictured ) to ensure there was " less time spent in meetings discussing the plans " and more " taking action " . <p> And , following Mr Collins ' visit , Skills Minister Matthew Hancock wrote to Stockport MP Ann Coffey about placing the college into administered status . The letter said : " I do not believe the existing leadership has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial recovery needed to protect learners and make efficient use of public funding . " <p> He warned that changes to the governing body and executive leadership team were " urgently needed " . <p> Stockport College deputy principal Karen Moss said : " Although we are implementing major changes which in turn will raise standards at the college , not enough time had passed to demonstrate any impact . <p> " Our main focus at present is to achieve the key targets we have set out in our post inspection action plan quickly and effectively . " <p> Currently , the commissioner 's findings are not made public , and a Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) spokesperson told FE Week they were unable to say whether the situation would be changing . <p> However , the BIS spokesperson added that the commissioner had " identified weaknesses in the governance " of Liverpool college . <p> She said : " The report makes a number of recommendations that will , once implemented , address these weaknesses and help steer the college in the right direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporting back on progress regularly . " <p> Further , she said the commissioner 's review of City of Bristol College carried out in September had concluded that the college was " making good progress in delivering improvement " . <p> Vice principal Cliff Shaw said the outcome of the visit had been " positive " and " useful " and the commissioner had validated the college 's action plans . He confirmed the college would continue to be subject to further monitoring visits from the commissioner . <p> K College principal Phil Frier said the college would keep operating as normal , and staff would be paid as usual . <p> No one from Stockport College or City of Liverpool College was available to comment on the commissioner 's review . <p> <p> Editorial <p> Sharing the benefits of a busy FE Commissioner <p> The FE Commissioner certainly seems to have hit the ground running . <p> Four visits ( that we 're aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Administered status at Stockport and K College , plus recommendations for Bristol and Liverpool . <p> Skills Minister Matthew Hancock is getting nothing if not his money 's worth from David Collins . <p> But while we wait to find out whether the commissioner 's knowledgeable recommendations and calls for action work , how does the rest of the sector benefit ? <p> Should n't improvement for all learners at all colleges be a goal ? <p> Ofsted reports are public documents and providers scour them to see if they can improve their own offer and practices . <p> On that basis , we should also see publication of the commissioner 's findings and recommendations . <p> It is understandable that the commissioner should focus his efforts on those most in need , but that 's no reason to deny successful colleges the benefit of his expertise . <p> To square that circle would be , for one , to make the commissioner 's findings accessible .@@2204746 <h> Rebecca Ferguson reveals 
 college gets ' direct ' role in sale of provision <p> Troubled K College is back on the market this time with its own corporation playing a greater role in the sale after the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) tendering process proved unsuccessful last year . <p> Three bidders had approached the SFA to take on the college after a competitive tendering process , but talks ended without agreement . <p> But now interim principal Phil Frier has told FE Week that he expected to find new providers and have handed over the college 's SFA and Education Funding Agency provision by August . <p> " We 're working closely with both funding agencies , but we are now going to be able to engage with new providers directly , " he said . <p> " We 'll be having discussions with them over the next two months so that we are able to transfer the assets of the college over by August this year . <p> " I think those discussions will lead us to being clear about who the preferred providers are by February . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . <p> The Kent college is currently in administered status , having been visited by FE Commissioner David Collins after an ' inadequate ' Ofsted inspection result last month . <p> The move stripped college management of the ability to make many key decisions independently , instead having to seek approval of the commissioner and the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills . <p> " The intervention of the FE Commissioner and the Skills Minister has been very helpful because it has put back in the hands of the corporation some key decisions , " said Mr Frier . <p> He added : " I think with hindsight everyone agrees that the competition process slowed things down and the procurement process forced a straightjacket which created difficulties . <p> " It is easy looking back to see that we could have done it differently and the college could have been more directly involved from the start . " <p> The SFA would still have a " significant " role to play , he said , both financially and in terms of " decision making " . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now a channel from the corporation through the commissioner , to the department directly to the Minister , " said Mr Frier . <p> " And the discussion I had with the commissioner was that that 's the route now that will finalise the decision making .

 a quarter of vacancies in the UK have gone unfilled because of a shortage of much-needed skills , the chief executive of UK Commission for Employment and Skills ( UKCES ) has revealed . <p> Michael Davis ( pictured ) gave the Skills Summit in Central London a preview of the Employer Skills Survey 2013 findings in which 22 per cent of the 655,000 vacancies in the UK remained untaken because employers could not find workers with the right skills . <p> He told delegates that the survey , officially published today , presented " a mixed picture with positive trends , but also significant challenges " . <p> " On the one hand , the number of job vacancies are up and in England have returned to pre-recession levels , " he said . <p> " On the other , skills-shortage vacancies are growing faster than vacancies . " <p> Jobs in skilled trades , management , professional roles , caring , leisure and machine operating were most affected . <p> The report said : " There appears to have been an increased difficulty finding appropriate oral and written communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last survey , in 2011 . " <p> The UKCES Employer Skills Survey interviewed over 90,000 employers between March and July 2013 . They reported a total of 559,600 job vacancies in England up 45 per cent per cent from 2009 . <p> Skills Minister Matthew Hancock said : " Employers in some sectors report persistent skills shortages which is why I have been working hard to design a skills system that is rigorous in the training it provides and responsive to the needs of employers . <p> " With a record number of people in jobs as our economy continues to grow we must have a skilled workforce equipped to work in a modern economy and compete effectively in the global race . " <p> The survey found that the number of job vacancies in England had returned to pre-recession levels . However , so-called " skills shortage vacancies " where businesses can not find recruits with the skills required were growing twice as fast . <p> The survey interviewed more 90,000 employers between March and July last year . They reported a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent from 2009 . However , skills shortage vacancies nearly doubled over the same period , increasing from 63,100 to 124,800 . <p> Overall , skills shortage vacancies now account for more than one in five of all vacancies ( 22 per cent ) up from one in six ( 16 per cent ) in 2009 . <p> A further finding of the survey was that the number of establishments providing training for staff was back to pre-recession levels , although the amount spent on training had decreased from ? 1,680 per employee in 2011 to ? 1,590 in 2013 . <p> Douglas McCormick , a UKCES Commissioner and managing director of the UK rail business at Atkins , a design , engineering and project management consultancy , said : " While the rise in the number of vacancies is a good sign that the economy is recovering , there 's a real possibility that businesses might not be able to make the most of the upturn because they do n't have the right people . <p> " This shows that businesses need to start thinking about planning their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fulfil contracts because of a lack of skilled staff . <p> " Worryingly , these figures show that the percentage of staff in the UK receiving training from their employer has n't changed significantly for a decade . <p> " There are also signs that some employers might be trying to solve their skills problems by choosing to recruit highly-skilled and qualified staff to do very basic jobs . <p> " people 's skills like this risks a bored and demotivated workforce .

 at inspections from the ' other side of the fence ' <p> Rebecca Cooney <p> 10:49 , Feb 7 , 2014 <p> 2 <p> It 's one thing being inspected by Ofsted and feeling aggrieved by the process or outcome but it 's another thing to be carrying out the inspection and potentially exposing managing directors and principals to the ugly truth about their organisations . <p> Here , just weeks after ex-Newcastle College Group chief executive Dame Jackie Fisher revealed why she had thrown Ofsted out mid-inspection back in 2012 ( pictured inset ) , former inspector Phil Hatton speaks to FE Week about his experience from the other side of the fence . <p> The debate about complaints against Ofsted has prompted discussions about the current process in the sector . <p> Over the past year , since I gave up being a full-time inspector , I have worked with a wide selection of providers and colleges and have spoken with many more at conferences . <p> There is a very definite feeling among them that the appeals procedure is heavily loaded one way and that complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time ' . <p> This is a sad reflection of how the inspection process is currently viewed by those subject to it . <p> ' Iron Fist ' <p> Of the four inspectorates I worked for in 20 years as an inspector , the one that was probably viewed best by the sector was the Adult Learning Inspectorate ( ALI ) . <p> Before being merged into Ofsted , an independent review of inspectorates described the ALI as being viewed by the sector as ' an iron fist in a velvet glove ' . <p> Communication with the sector was particularly strong , with the monthly newsletter , Talisman , being eagerly read . <p> Full-time inspectors met to share findings frequently and part-time inspectors worked for the inspectorate rather than a third party , with their performance and development being closely monitored . <p> Part of the quality assurance of complaints in the ALI was for myself and another inspector to review and analyse the reasons for all the complaints that arose in a particular year . <p> Over the two years I did this it was extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review . <p> The ALI , just like any really good provider , learned from what had gone wrong to prevent reoccurrence . <p> That should be the raison d ' ? tre for any complaints system if the culture of an organisation is really about improvement , rather than paying it lip service . <p> Communication breakdown <p> One of the forgotten quality assurance methods when I was a part-time inspector for the Further Education Funding Council was for college nominees to be able to sit in on observations with inspectors . <p> This meant that nominees developed confidence in judgements made about teaching and learning , with real transparency of the process as viewed by colleges at the time . <p> In my experience complaints arise when there are breakdowns in communication . <p> As a lead inspector , both you and the provider nominee want to ensure that an inspection runs smoothly , so that your team of inspectors get to see every positive attribute of the provider . <p> This was always my very clear message when first talking to a provider , ' show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grading meeting . <p> My experienced colleagues that I have worked with over the years have that same attitude , so that if there is a close call between two grades we would be questioning to see if there were any positives that had been missed or which had not been given sufficient weighting . <p> Conflict <p> The role of the nominee is absolutely crucial in preventing potential conflict . <p> Any provider , whether one with 20 or 40,000 learners , needs to ensure that communication during inspection throws up that potential conflict quickly . <p> Over the years I have had to deal with inspectors whose personality was such that they came across as too cold and unfriendly , or whose grasp of the area they were inspecting was just not good enough . <p> Along with this , there were occasionally those who were of the glass being half-empty rather than half-full variety . <p> In such cases the lead inspector or their assist would usually observe the inspector where such concerns were raised , and look at their evidence base to check the validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken about . <p> This usually worked very well , with feedback to the inspector ironing out the difficulties . In such cases , with honest two-way communication with the nominee , the outcome of inspection was not impacted on . <p> Where there are unresolved problems it is usually down to clashes of personality . That can be a two-way street , with elements of blame on both sides . <p> Intimidation <p> Speaking with total frankness and honesty , there are some providers ( or usually a particular individual ) whose point-blank refusal to understand why they are less than perfect can not be shaken , despite the evidence being irrefutable as to why they are not . <p> Truly outstanding providers will say ' but is there anything else that we could improve ? ' <p> I have personally been subjected to intimidation on a number of occasions . In one particular case an external observer on the inspection wondered why there was no punitive action for a provider who tried to make the inspection very difficult to carry out . <p> The complaints process was crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was needed was rapidly taken . <p> An inspection manager , unconnected with the problematic inspection and knowledgeable about the area being inspected , would quickly visit a complaining provider to hear their side of the story , alongside reviewing the complete evidence base for the inspection . This worked well in the vast majority of cases , with a two-way dialogue . Providers felt listened to and that the complaints process was transparent and fair . <p> The timings of the current Ofsted complaints system need to be aligned with the report publication schedule ( five weeks to publish , six to deal with complaints ? ) . <p> The fact it exceeds the publication schedule sends the wrong message and does not demonstrate joined up thinking if you are really wanting to engage positively with the sector , rather than to give the impression of a hard-nosed ' publish or be damned ' organisation . <p> Mistakes <p> It is an obvious fact that anyone can make a mistake . An acknowledgement of this when one is made would prevent some complaints reaching the latter stages . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that they are inspecting well and they can demonstrate a record of high achievement in them to those that they are inspecting . This cuts out the ' who are you to be telling me what to do ' element of potential conflict . <p> By the end of August a record year for the number of Learning and Skills inspections carried out will have ended , many led by recently-recruited inspectors . <p> The Freedom of Informaton request by FE Week does point to failings in the process of inspection in the last academic year , with nine step two complaints by providers being upheld ( over one-third of those reached ) . <p> What is even more worrying is the 100 per cent rate quoted so far for this academic year , with all four complaints having been upheld . <p> Hopefully , the need to ramp up quality assurance of inspections in the field will be recognised and will impact quickly to prevent mistrust . I know that inspection can be a truly valuable improvement process for the sector . <p> Phil Hatton is a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college and work-based learning inspections . He now works at the Learning Improvement Service **36;118;TOOLONG as an adviser . <p> I know that the inspectors are between a rock and a hard place when it comes to complaints , but Matthew Coffey really should have thought again before saying : " I know of a good number where grades have been amended because we 've had a second look and a much more detailed examination ... " This is tantamount to admitting that Ofsted fails to carry out detailed enough examination in the first place . A very unwise admission . Also , to admit the number of complaints made is " relatively consistent year-on-year " suggests they have n't learned from their mistakes . Were a school , college or provider to admit the same , they would soon find themselves in special measures .@@2285992 <p> As the Winter 
 puts up to 20 members of staff on ' gardening leave ' <p> Troubled provider Bright Assessing has allegedly put several members of its staff on " gardening leave " . <p> FE Week has seen a letter which it is understood the Warwickshire-based provider 's chief executive Krissy Charles-Jones ( pictured ) handed to up to 20 members of staff on March 26 . <p> It said the short term outlook for the firm " looks challenging " and invited them to go on " gardening leave " which usually refers to employees staying away from their workplace throughout their notice period on full pay . <p> In the letter , she added : " Please note that you are not being dismissed , being made redundant or being sacked and the company are not in administration or liquidation . <p> " The company will be unable to pay staff on the due pay day and we are currently in the process of raising funds to pay staff . We will notify you of pay in due course . <p> " In the event of the company going into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notice and all holiday entitlements from the National Insurance fund ; obviously we hope that this wo n't be necessary .

I am owed one month 's salary and two month 's expenses , the letter we were given basically asked us to waiver some of our employment rights away if signed , it was an attempt to change our employment contractual terms , needless to say I did not sign mine . Adrian Oldfield mentions " Pre Pack Administration " in his post , I say , look out for a Phoenix Company arising from the ashes of what was Bright out to start up delivering the " quality training " they were previously providing <p> If Bright do go into liquidation , and the course was paid for by a credit card you should contact the back and claim the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights in claiming it back the same way as Bright lost NCFE 's accreditation which means breach of contract . <p> I like to thank bright assessing for sending my certificate for the CPD work which i compleated in March 2014. so thak you for your quick responce after i had sent an email to Vickie Mullins . again thank you .

 Save adult education ' petition signed by over 10,000 delivered to home of Prime Minister <p> Rebecca Jones <p> 13:15 , Oct 30 , 2015 <p> 2 <p> A petition signed by more than 10,000 people that called on the government to " stop further funding cuts to adult education " has been delivered to 10 Downing Street . <p> Shadow Minister for Culture and the Digital Economy Chi Onwurah was joined yesterday ( October 29 ) by five members of the Workers ' Educational Association ( WEA ) when presenting the petition at the home of Prime Minister David Cameron . <p> It was part of the Save Adult Education campaign launched by the WEA on September 28 . <p> Mr Onwurah said that she was backing the campaign because " adult education is important it helps individuals and their families break cycles of deprivation and forge better lives themselves " . <p> " For many people living in low-income communities , adult education is a lifeline which helps them get the skills they need to get on in life , " he added . <p> Chief executive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed over the petition , said it was important to pile pressure on the government to limit FE spending cuts , ahead of next month 's spending review announcement , because " everyone deserves a second chance back into learning " . <p> " It is essential for our economy and society that we continue to provide high quality education for adults , " she added . <p> It comes after hundreds of staff and students from FE colleges descended on Parliament in June as part of another campaign against funding cuts to adult education . <p> The lobby event , organised by the University and College Union ( UCU ) , gave FE staff the chance to explain directly to their MPs the impact the reduction in the adult skills budget ( ASB ) was having on their classrooms . <p> It has been estimated , as reported in FE Week , that the ASB has been reduced by 35 per cent since 2009 , and funding for adults over the age of 19 on non-apprenticeship courses is set to be slashed by up to a further 24 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Lack of compliance 
 The prospect , not to mention the potential cost , of end assessments in Trailblazer apprenticeships has proven a cause for concern for employers and providers . Richard Guy attempts to address these concerns . <p> One of the biggest changes in the apprenticeship reforms is the introduction of independent end assessment for all apprenticeships . It 's clear from recent news that there is confusion surrounding how this will work , with warnings coming from both the Confederation of British Industry and the Association of Employment and Learning Providers around the additional costs of independent assessment . <p> What these warnings do n't make clear is that far from being an additional financial burden to employers , end assessment is in fact a new way of assuring quality in the system that replaces the existing models of continuous assessment that are no longer fit for purpose . <p> Existing models of continuous assessment are no longer fit for purpose <p> In Making Apprenticeships Work , published jointly by City &amp; Guilds and our Industry Skills Board ( ISB ) we look at the importance of end assessment in apprenticeships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mastery and autonomy in an apprenticeship . This allows for a holistic view of the apprentices ' skill level in a particular area as well as general workplace skills they have developed during the apprenticeship . <p> The apprenticeship reforms have given each Trailblazer group responsibility for developing an occupation-specific assessment plan which will set out the skills , knowledge and behaviours required together with the assessment methods to be used . These will range from workplace observation through to projects both in and out of the workplace . <p> It 's important to recognise the role that continuous assessment will still play in an apprenticeship . Before the end assessment takes place the apprentice has to be signed off as ready by his or her employer it is only through continuous assessment that the employer will be able to gain a realistic view of the apprentice 's readiness . This type of ongoing progress tracking is likely to be carried out by the employer with the support of their provider , rather than by the provider as currently . <p> A point of confusion has been around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor helpful to look at end assessment as a percentage of the overall apprenticeship cost . Each assessment plan will be individually costed based on the specific assessment tools and methods needed and these will be fixed regardless of the cost of the overall apprenticeship . The cost estimates by Trailblazer groups which we have knowledge of range from ? 500 to ? 1,500 depending on the methods determined by the group . This may well reduce once actual occupations are priced and we have not priced any yet . <p> The cost of end assessment will represent a small proportion of the total costs of most apprenticeships and whatever the cost , it will always be included in the allocation to a funding band . <p> An important and common element of all costings is the time taken by the independent assessor in assessment activity . In Making Apprenticeships Work we highlighted the importance of the independent assessor role . The person should have a status similar to that of an Ofsted inspector albeit with a different set of skills including very strong industry knowledge . <p> Independent end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are understandably nervous about starting apprentices until they have seen what the end assessment looks like . Each apprenticeship standard is published on the gov.uk website as " ready for delivery " once the assessment plan is approved and a funding band is allocated . However this does not mean that the development work on assessment instruments has been completed and this can take some time for Registered Assessment Organisations ( RAOs ) to carry out . City &amp; Guilds will advise employers on progress , to help them take on apprentices as quickly as possible . <p> As the reforms continue , it 's vital we learn lessons from the past to create an end assessment for every apprenticeship that measures the quality of the programme and assesses the individual apprentices in a valid and reliable way . This is how the value of the reforms will be realised and will require collaboration between employers , providers and RAOs to ensure we have high quality and cost effective solutions in place . <p> But exactly how accurate is that end cost calculation ? Does it go to the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We wo n't know how much an end point assessment will actually cost until each trailblazer has reported back after the fact . We have to take into account every fluctuation in each activity that can impact on time and performance . Weather conditions , flaws in metals , animals that do n't co-operate all of these and more will impact on cost . We must , must be confident that all associated costs are real and not estimated or we 'll soon find out to our cost that sustainability of end point assessment will be impossible to maintain .@@3730852 <p> The report added

 Ofsted short inspection of FE provider published amid ' cramming in ' concerns <p> Rebecca Jones <p> 12:01 , Nov 6 , 2015 <p> 0 <p> The results of the first Ofsted short inspection of a good provider were positive for the Cheshire college visited but fears have emerged that it was " more of a case of how much you can cram in within two days " . <p> The Riverside College , in Widnes , was the first FE provider to experience the two-day visit under Ofsted 's new common inspection framework ( Cif ) , which was introduced from September . <p> The college was inspected from September 23 having previously been visited by Ofsted nearly six years ago when it secured a good rating putting it on Ofsted 's radar for a short inspection . <p> The new report said the college " continues to be good , " but assistant principal and Ofsted nominee Alan Brown ( pictured right ) said : " The key difference is how the new inspections operate and it is now more of a case of how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The latest report paints a similar picture to the previous one , but this time it is only five pages long , as opposed to 27 last time , and comes in the form of a letter to the principal , with contents comparable to monitoring reports . <p> The new Ofsted Cif has specified that all providers with a good Ofsted rating will have shorter inspections more frequently rather than the traditional five-day full scale inspections . <p> And Mr Brown said his college inspection was " very firmly focused on the lines of inquiry to see how the previous issues have improved " . <p> " So the main issue was that the inspectors did n't move away from the lines of enquiry and could n't veer away because of the time frame restraints , " he said . <p> He also said that for other colleges undergoing a short inspection it was " important to know the inspection framework as Ofsted is currently using the handbook as a clutch " . <p> Principal Mary Murphy ( pictured left ) said : " You have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are carried out in such a short space of time and you are informed just 48 hours before they take place . <p> " However , I do prefer them and so do the staff here as Ofsted coming in with such short notice gives us less time to anticipate the inspections and not build the college up with as much worry .

 As a marketing expert , Ruth Sparkes found the job of helping her offspring find the right FE institution an eye-opening experience . <p> It 's that time of year when colleges are flinging open their doors and inviting prospective students in , to ' taste ' their wares . <p> The summer and ' mop-up ' campaigns are but a distant and expensive memory , and the new student recruitment cycle has started , all over again . <p> Schools have distributed their Year 11s predicted GCSE grades . <p> Recruiting students needs a joined-up approach , now more than ever <p> Most colleges will already have published their glossy new prospectuses for the 2016/17 in-take . <p> Some colleges will already have a few open events under their belts , applications will hopefully be rolling or dribbling in , and some colleges will have started interviewing potential students , and have made conditional offers . <p> This is what happens every year and it ought to be a well-oiled machine but , in my experience as a parent this year , for the first time on other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents choose school sixth forms over standalone sixth forms or FE colleges . <p> Team Sparkes does n't have the ' luxury ' of a school sixth form to fall back on , so we 've had to persevere , even though we 've hit quite a few obstacles . <p> Team objective find a good college within an hour 's travelling that can offer A-levels in maths , further maths , economics , French and law . <p> We live in a county with 18 standalone mainstream colleges ( either FE or sixth form ) so it should n't be too difficult you would think . <p> College A we enjoyed a fabulous welcome at the open event , staff on hand to answer questions , the principal was lively , engaging and accessible , but ca n't offer economics and would love to offer French but needs more applicants . <p> Unfortunately , French was not an option on the college 's online application form .

( Team Sparkes could n't attend open evening week due to the key member being on a assessment in Shropshire ) . <p> College B has booked us on a ' tour ' , but says : " This is just a tour , without any opportunity to speak to teaching staff or explore course choices .

 Baker hits back at ' get out of jail ' criticism <p> Jude Burke <p> 9:00 , Nov 9 , 2015 <p> 0 <p> Former Education Secretary Ken Baker ( pictured above ) has hit back at criticism that his university technical college ( UTC ) project had been given a " get out of jail clause " in government plans for the English Baccalaureate ( EBacc ) performance measure . <p> Lord Baker , co-founder of Baker Dearing Educational Trust ( BDT ) , which has been working to develop UTCs , also defended the institutions over claims they simply replicated the work of general FE colleges . <p> The Conservative peer used his speech and appearance at the ninth annual Sir John Cass 's Foundation Lecture to defend UTCs , which offer 14-19 vocational training in science , technology , engineering and maths-based ( STEM ) subjects , alongside the teaching of core academic subjects . <p> He said he was " not in favour personally " of the 14-16 Ebacc , for which a government consultation launched this week with UTCs , studio schools and FE colleges potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the policy should apply " . <p> The exemption from the Ebacc measure which shows the proportion of pupils in a school entering and achieving a good GCSE in English , maths , science , a foreign language and history or geography drew criticism on Twitter from the likes of , who described it as a " get out of jail clause for UTCs " . <p> The government is consulting on making 90 per cent of pupils do from autumn 2017 , but Lord Baker called for more " technical , practical , vocational , hands-on training and learning " . <p> " Ebacc was the exam I took in 1951 , called the school certificate . Item for item , it was the same thing , " said Lord Baker . " And it was abolished in 1951 because it was too narrow . " <p> The government consultation , which closes on January 29 , says that " like pupils attending UTCs and studio schools , 14 to 16 pupils at FE colleges have chosen to specialise in a technical or professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to make them study " a smaller academic curriculum " unsuitable for EBacc . <p> Charles Parker , chief executive of the Baker Dearing Education Trust said : " It seems to us that the compulsory EBacc is not compatible with the UTC program . We are glad to see that the consultation recognises this . " <p> Catherine Sezen , 14-19 and curriculum policy manager at the Association of Colleges , said the consultation meant FE colleges with learners aged 14 and over would have " a chance to respond to the government 's proposals " . <p> Nevertheless , in his speech , entitled The Intelligent Hand how we can solve the problem of people without jobs and jobs without people , Lord Baker went on to say : " The greatest problem facing our educational system is that it is not being geared up to providing what industry , business and commerce require " . <p> He laid part of the blame for this at the door of FE colleges , and said : " If FE colleges were as successful as people believed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He also hit back at comments by Northampton College principal Pat Brennan-Barrett at a House of Lords Social Mobility Committee meeting where , as reported by FE Week , she said UTCs did " the sort of work that FE colleges have done for many years " . <p> Lord Baker , speaking at the November 4 event at the Cass Business School in London , said : " The trouble is that so many FE colleges have never related their output to what the needs of the economy are , and what the needs of industry are .

 changes could have a serious impact on college funding , during an update he gave in a breakout session at the Association of Colleges annual conference , in Birmingham on Wednesday ( November 18 ) . <p> " Colleges are spending at the moment just under 20 pence in the pound on apprenticeships , " he said . <p> " However , in the adult world ... over 40 per cent of that you are subcontracting out . " So if you convert that into how much money is going directly to you , in worse cases it is an average of less than 10 pence in the pound . <p> " You might be benefiting at the moment from subcontracting bringing money in , but from April 2017 those subcontractors will take that capacity and they will get funded directly through the apprenticeship voucher system . " Mr Smith advised colleges leader to think carefully about how to address these issues , adding : " This is a huge challenge for you . " <p> The government 's large employers ' apprenticeship levy reform changes set to come into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a funding allocation for apprenticeships . Instead , employers will be able to approach subcontractors to work directly with them , potentially leaving colleges in the cold . <p> Mr Smith said he proposed a " two-fold " challenge to colleges firstly to do more apprenticeships and secondly to rethink their delivery models and structures for securing business . <p> In response to a question from FE Week , asking how serious the problem is and what colleges could doing , Mr Smith said : " In a model where the provider is the central element of the funding system I think the subcontractor and the college can plan that sort of strategy . I do n't think that strategy works at all in the system we SFA are talking about designing . So I think it is a huge problem . " <p> He said many of the subcontractors colleges used were also prime contractors in their own right and added : " I would have to seriously question the motives for some of that and of course those organisations will need no encouragement at all to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said colleges should not waste time in addressing the challenges the apprenticeship levy would bring . <p> He advised conference audience members that it was " hugely important you do n't think about this in a year 's time when the detail of the new system is finalised . You must be thinking about this now . " <p> How will this new scheme be audited ? How can you have tiny providers getting what amounts to direct funding ? This could make the Individual Learning Accounts farrago look like a picnic . Any scheme like this needs incredibly close monitoring or there *will* be massive fraud . <p> I 'm sorry , but this just does n't make sense . There needs to be an audit regime as this is public money , so who will deal with the millions of small private training providers that do n't have the capacity to produce ILRs or deal with Ofsted . <p> I do n't believe this is the end for sub contracting per se , but clearly it will be for the larger private training providers . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colleges do an excellent job of keeping these companies in line . Without this type of control , we will have many more major headlines about unscrupulous private training providers . <p> Like previous commentators I wonder how the government will ensure there is no misappropriation of public funds ( AKA fraud ) and also how they will ensure at least good quality . We can all envisage embarrassing and fraudulent fiascos and a return to primes and subcontractors a few years down the line . <p> This is a simple system of subsidising wages so that employers can make even more profits for their shareholders . There is no interest in the education element of apprenticeships or in supporting lifelong education for adults whether that be ' second chance ' or career changes ..... Wake up everyone this is a Conservative government that is working for the benefit of the few at the expense of the many . Why wont they cap rents or support social housing because they support landlords ( have a look at how many Tory MPs are landlords ) Shameful <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent audit to show that they have the correct subcontracting management controls in place ? I seems ridiculous to be forcing more spending on already cash strapped colleges . This new ' simplified ' system seems to be incredibly complicated and raising more questions than it is answering . <p> I 'd still like to understand the controls on this , how will the government ensure learners are getting the right offer and service . How will subcontractors be selected and how will government sense check the levels and scope of service , Lots of questions .... <p> The goal in this is a system that engages large employers in funding their own and a growth in Apprenticeships and as the article suggests for that to happen the employer must be in control . In chasing the goal of large employer engagement in the scenario is it a case of hitting that target but loosing a lot of other aspect aspects available from a more robust and universal approach . Clearly the casualty in these arrangements might well be much of the education and training infrastructure . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage those at the margin , where as SMEs tend to be more approachable to the less well fitted Apprenticeship candidates . <p> This is only a concern from an administration perspective if the organisations in question do n't have the tools to manage the situation they may be presented with . Traditional solutions to SFA fund management are time consuming , expensive and often require a major investment of time and money hence why this could be deemed a problem . What is needed is a robust scalable software platform to enable SME 's and educational institutions to deal with this problem . There are software products out there that try to resolve this issue but I 'm afraid most of them are not up to the the challenge . Eligibility and other surrounding factors cause major problems for FE colleges and they have good experience with SFA and they still struggle . There is hope though . Over 30 colleges use the new online platform to resolve this simply and effectively and with a very low overhead . Fund management can be simple but it must be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @@@3807205 <h> Send a story 
 Meredith White outlines how the Network for Black and Asian Professionals ( NBAP ) helped her , and just what the FE sector is losing with its closure . <p> I was introduced to the Network for Black Professionals ( NBP ) some time ago by my manager who at the time , through NBP , was mentoring staff aspiring to be senior managers . <p> I was very much impressed with its work . Seeing the efforts of the NBP , I thought , this work should be replicated across all public sector organisations . <p> Over the years , I have seen many BME black and minority ethnic staff benefit greatly from the culture of support and initiative that the NBP alongside the support of FE colleges have provided . For this reason I have continued to keenly encourage colleagues to engage with the NBP . <p> I was disappointed to learn of the closure of the NBP this year renamed Network for Black and Asian Professionals it has been a voice for BME working in the FE sector for the past 18 years . <p> The strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in striving to facilitate the development and progression of BME staff . <p> Its work supports the benefits and cultural diversity and support succession planning for BME staff has now come to an end . <p> So what does this mean for the FE sector ? Outside of the working environment , it is often difficult to find sources and avenues go gain access to mentoring and guidance from managers and senior managers ; or training that comes with little or no financial spend without organisations such as the NBP . <p> In the current climate of austerity , resources continue to be reduced and priorities shifted , it is unlikely FE organisations will have the time and resources to replicate or sustain the work done by the NBP <p> Without the NBP being available to turn to , I wonder whether we can expect to see a shift of dependency onto the organisations to further develop and continue initiatives in line with the aspirations of the NBP . <p> However in the current climate of austerity , resources continue to be reduced and priorities shifted , it is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sustain the work done by the NBP . <p> Positively , FE colleges have actively supported the addressing of issues that surround BME progression within FE , an area that still has much work to be done . <p> While colleges try to recruit and manage the best talent , it is great to see that colleges such as Westminster Kingsway College continue to maintain dialogue with the recruitment and development of BME staff . <p> FE serves a diverse set of learners , and as such it is important that this diversity is reflected in its workforce . <p> Diversity can bring a sense of cohesion to FE colleges , not only is this positive for the sector , but great for our learners whom have and will continue to choose FE to support them through their chosen career paths . <p> The NBP set itself the task to address the under-representation of BAME managers , senior staffs and principals in the FE sector . Much has come to fruition . <p> Many FE colleges supported the initiative and we can now talk at length about the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Further , the value of the long term partnerships formed and self-confidence individuals gained , is invaluable . <p> It is important that this work is continued within the sector without placing the full burden on organisations . Developing these initiatives requires time , money and expertise . We therefore need to start the conversation , probably even a campaign to continue the focused energies of the NBP . <p> That the NBP will no longer be part of the FE sector due to being another collateral damage of funding cuts , is highly disappointing and should not be accepted . <h> Ross County 3 
 Small but key changes to Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) subcontracting rules could lead to big problems for lead providers if not considered and followed , says Denise Bishop . <p> In times of great change it is very easy to allow less urgent things to fall down the to-do list with an ' ' attitude . <p> And for FE providers currently dealing with transformation on a massive scale it is understandable that a myriad of decisions would fall into this category on a daily basis . <p> However , two seemingly incongruous changes made by the SFA in August this year have the potential to trip up leadership teams across the country if they do not take action . <p> We are talking about changes made to contract service agreements between colleges or independent learning providers ( ILPs ) and their subcontractors for education and training . <p> In particular , the relevant issues involve those providers entering into subcontracts that deliver services with an aggregate value of ? 100,000 or more in any one contract year . <p> There is now the legal responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not misappropriating government funding <p> In layman 's terms the main additions are colleges and ILPs that subcontract must ensure that the subcontractor is financially viable and obtain various pieces of evidence to prove due diligence has been undertaken . <p> The other main addition is that the original contractor is independently audited to ensure they have adequate subcontractor management in place in accordance with the SFA rules . <p> While both of these elements have always been alluded to , there is now the legal responsibility on leadership teams to ensure those businesses that are carrying out training are not misappropriating government funding . <p> Primarily , the lead contractor must carry out its own due diligence checks when appointing , or continuing to subcontact with , subcontractors and not use the Register of Training Organisations as a substitute for carrying out due diligence checks . <p> This must include obtaining an annual report from external auditors , which provides assurances on the arrangements that the contractor has in place to manage its subcontractors . <p> The report must comply with the guidance issued from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certificate signed by its external auditors and an authorised signatory confirming it has received a report providing satisfactory assurance . <p> The SFA sates that it " reserves the right to require the contractor to provide a copy of the full report and can , at any time , assess arrangements for subcontracting " . It can also require a contracting body to commission an independent report on these arrangements from a third party , such as external auditors . <p> Other issues range from ensuring the subcontractor does not have an above average risk warning from a credit agency and looking at whether its statutory accounts are overdue . <p> It is also critical to make sure learners and employers supported through subcontracting arrangements are clear about every party 's roles and responsibilities in providing the learning . <p> In terms of monitoring from the SFA , there will always be an element of trust involved ie that the providers will implicitly follow the letter of the law . <p> But the most feared scenarios are that the SFA descends on a provider to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that the subcontractor fails to deliver , as the college or ILP will be responsible for making alternative arrangements for the delivery of education and training and/or repaying SFA or loan funding . <p> And , of course , there is always the fact that under the new common inspection framework these arrangement may also be looked at and leadership teams could find themselves being ' marked down ' for poor subcontracting management , potentially putting contracts at risk and ultimately could create an argument for special measures . <p> Central to not falling foul of these issues , FE leaders in charge of contracting should review their priorities and ask : ' Am I spending too much time on what is urgent , instead of what is important ? ' <p> This will help assess the future impact of decisions made today and ensure it 's not the little things that cause big problems down the line . <h> Undermining <p> That 
 Mark Dawe was , like many in FE and skills , hanging on Chancellor George Osborne 's every word as he delivered today 's Budget . This is what he made of the announcements . <p> There will be an FE sector sigh of relief as 16 to 19 funding is protected , but only in cash terms , adult funding protected , again in cash terms , and apprenticeship funding set to double but we are still awaiting the real detail . <p> The sector could n't ask for any more and demonstrates the power of the sector both in terms of lobbying and the service it provides to the economy and society . <p> I would argue that this gives the breathing space allowing significant reform rather than an opportunity to continue doing what FE has been doing for the last decade . <p> Adult funding has been under attack for the last decade ever since the ill-fated and poorly thought through Train to Gain programme and obsession with the full level two , adult funding has been eroded . <p> If we are planning for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there will be a continued erosion of real terms government adult funding with a greater and greater focus on apprenticeships and English and maths . <p> The levy , the most un-Tory policy we have ever seen , is the hook that all providers will have to open the doors to the thousands of large employers <p> It does n't mean there should n't be any education and training for the over 19s , but it has to be based more and more on employers and individuals contributions , in some cases supported by loans as we have seen with the 19-plus level three and four loans . <p> This finally allows for the delivery of the policy aim of higher education in FE an exciting opportunity for the sector . There may be local grants for local needs but these ca n't be relied upon for the long term sustainability of colleges . <p> Ahead of Prime Minister 's Questions before the Spending Review announcement , David Cameron said all should have the choice to take on an apprenticeship or go to university apprenticeships have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Skills Minister Nick Boles talked about colleges stopping independent learning providers ( ILPs ) " nicking their lunch " . This is n't about colleges verses ILPs it is about shifting the focus of vocational training to apprenticeships or pathways into apprenticeships , if university is not the pathway a student is choosing . <p> The debate about one-year programmes is that learners at 16 should have a programme of study that leads to higher education or work with an apprenticeship and students should move into the latter as soon as they are ready . This requires a much deeper engagement of employers in the training of our young people and there is now a clear responsibility for the sector and employers . <p> The levy , the most un-Tory policy we have ever seen , is the hook that all providers will have to open the doors to the thousands of large employers who do n't engage in the apprenticeship and traineeship programme and have a payroll over ? , raising an additional ? per annum of apprenticeship funding for the FE system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has been much talk about mergers . While there are some savings to be made through scale around administration and systems I do n't think this is the real benefit . <p> Large institutions allow the spreading of outstanding leaders and their teams across a larger area and more students expertise is a scarce resource and we have to use it effectively . <p> We are also seeing a digital revolution . We have been talking about this for the past 15 years but I think it has finally arrived . And the timing could n't be better with loss of real terms student funding per learner and number of learners funded . <p> To continue to enhance the learning experience and increase the number of learners FE reaches , colleges must fully engage with the digital agenda . <p> There are some excellent examples around the country but this needs to be the norm not the exception . Fundamentally , delivery needs to change and staff in colleges will have to change how they deliver learning and support students . <p> The investment needed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe will be achieved in small institutions . The leadership demands and investment in digital delivery can only be achieved through substantially larger colleges . This will preserve delivery across the country not erode it . <p> The devolution , regional and local agenda requires high level engagement in the locality this is not achieved by large numbers of FE college sitting around the table , they wont be invited look at the size of the Strategic Area Review groups . It requires a single voice from the colleges , not some intermediary , and therefore college need to merge or create hard federations to have a seat of power at the table otherwise colleges will be forgotten . <p> On a final note sixth form colleges are being allowed to become academies escaping VAT and in reality , post-16 area reviews . I am sure this will be the final goodbye to sixth form colleges from the FE sector . It may be great for the colleges , but it 's sad for FE. <h> New trailer for

 report hails ' substantial impact ' of FE on unemployed <p> A government report has hailed the " substantial impact " of FE in getting unemployed people back into work and called for greater investment into provision for people looking for a job . <p> The report published by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , was based on the experiences of unemployed people and used individualised learner record data on , for example , enrolments on government initiatives such as such the Work Programme as well as " self-refer " learners out of work . <p> A government spokesperson said : " Analysis of over 2 million unemployed found that FE can make a substantial impact on the chances of unemployed people finding work . " <p> " Those who engage in FE experience a greater improvement in the likelihood of being in employment than those who do n't engage in FE . <p> " The evidence presented here implies that an expansion of FE learning for the unemployed ( including at level two and below ) would be beneficial , which should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this provision . " <p> The 71-page report follows last month 's spending review which appeared positive for FE with news of protection of the " core adult skills participation budgets in cash terms , at ? 1.5bn " but left lingering questions with no definition as to where " ? of efficiencies and savings from the adult skills budget by 2019-20 " would come from . <p> A spokesperson for the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) told FE Week : " These findings come as no surprise because our members have long delivered effective skills provision for the unemployed . <p> " It 's a major reason why we argued against significant cuts to the adult skills budget which funds this provision and why we have pushed for contract growth in this area . " <p> A spokesperson for the Association of Colleges said : " Colleges have always been successful in helping unemployed people gain the skills and qualifications to find a job . It is therefore pleasing that this is confirmed by the BIS research . " <p> The report analyses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 and April 2009 , and between August 2010 and July 2012 , with around 2.3 million people in each group . <p> Among its findings were that " individuals facing the highest barriers to employment are more likely to be observed in FE learning " and that " this group also see the biggest difference in outcomes relative to those who do n't engage in FE " . <p> Of those aged 18 to 24 who had " no prior employment experience according to HMRC records " , those who had some form of FE learning were between 4 and 7 per cent more likely to have found work one , two and three years after starting their benefit claim than those with no FE learning . <p> The report further highlighted the value of learning at level two and below for unemployed learners , which it says had previously been underestimated . <p> " The central role of FE in helping the most disadvantaged is also central to the methodological problems that led to previous underestimates of the value of learning at level two and below , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commenting on the report . <p> Editor 's comment <p> Seeing substantial sense <p> First came the ' better-than-expected ' settlement in Chancellor George Osborne 's Budget last month and now this a BIS report that is clearly , and rightly , complimentary of the FE sector . <p> They are two seemingly concrete indications that someone in the corridors of power is finally seeing sense . <p> However , the extent to which Mr Osborne 's Spending Review announcements were as positive as they seemed ( ok so , positive in that they were bad , but not as bad as expected ) will only emerge with the unpacking of the finer details . <p> And the extent to which BIS officials , or indeed Mr Osborne himself , will take heed of this report with its praise for the " substantial impact " FE has on unemployed people 's job hopes also remains to be seen . <p> Of course there 's always the get-out clause in the report , when budgets are being decided upon , that " the views expressed " within are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there can surely not be many more clear-cut arguments for the good that FE can do and more clear-cut reasons for the government to finally give the sector the backing it deserves . <p> Because , as the report points out , it 's support that ultimately would help the government achieve its own aims of reducing levels of unemployment .@@3857900 <p> Erewash MP Mrs 
 adviser Nigel Whitehead warned that the Trailblazer apprenticeship process was " out of control " as he revealed fears national occupational standards ( NOS ) were in " danger " of being bypassed . <p> He added : " There is a danger there is a moment in time when we will accidentally bypass the NOS unless we take the care to recognise their importance . " <p> The UK Commission for Employment and Skills ( UKCES ) , which counts Mr Whitehead as one of its commissioners , is responsible for NOS across the UK . <p> However , the UKCES was " struggling to get that voice properly heard " when the new apprenticeship standards were being drawn up by Trailblazer employer groups , said Mr Whitehead , and with its funding set to cease , " that danger moment is amplified " . <p> It 's an issue he said he had even raised with Skills Minister Nick Boles " and he acknowledges that we have some work to do to work out how that function is going to be performed , " said Mr Whitehead . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision course with the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , which said research carried out by the UKCES itself showed only 5 per cent of employers had a good knowledge of NOS , while 44 per cent of the economy was not even covered by NOS . <p> " Employers are free to refer to national occupational standards to support the development of their Trailblazer apprenticeships most have chosen to do something different , " said a BIS spokesperson . <p> Nick Boles MP <p> But a UKCES spokesperson said : " We believe NOS are vitally important and , as Mr Whitehead said , they are the raw material on which high quality apprenticeships and many vocational qualifications are based . " <p> Mr Whitehead 's employers at BAE , which is on a number of Trailblazer groups , also backed him , saying they " recognise the value of NOS and their role in ensuring apprenticeships in our sector meet their requirements " . <p> " We believe they are an essential starting point on which high quality apprenticeships and many vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to the UKCES , NOS are developed " for employers by employers through the relevant Sector Skills Council or Standards Setting Organisation " and are " statements of the standards of performance individuals must achieve when carrying out functions in the workplace , together with specifications of the underpinning knowledge and understanding " . <p> However , with UKCES funding set to end , question marks also hang over the devolved nations ' use of NOS . <p> " They are waiting with baited breath to see if they have to build their own foundation or whether they can rely on the English system to actually then continue to provide a foundation , " said Mr Whitehead . <p> A Scottish government spokesperson said it had " a commitment from Mr Boles to work with the devolved nations on this " . <p> But , she said : " We are disappointed with the UK government decision to stop funding the UKCES , as this will have implications in a number of areas such as the NOS which are used widely across all four nations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Unfortunately this is another example of where another UK government decision is having unintended consequences for skills activities across the UK . " <p> A Northern Ireland government spokesperson said it was working " to ensure NOS remain the national standards . " <p> The government saw fit to listen to Mr Whitehead on qualifications nearly three years ago . <p> His recommendations resulted in the public funding of , it has been estimated , around 6,900 adult vocational qualifications severed . <p> He is clearly someone that is listened to among ministers and at Whitehall . <p> So his warning that the Trailblazer process was ' out of control ' will hopefully also be listened to . <p> He , along with the UKCES , makes a case for national occupational standards ( NOS ) that Trailblazer employers , no less than BIS , should take great care to heed . <p> But it 's a warning that also came with worries for devolved governments who rely upon the UKCES for their own NOS in developing apprenticeships . <p> And perhaps one of the most damning criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reforms , comes from North of Border about the ' unintended consequence ' of policy shift after policy shift . <p> It just adds to that out of control feel that the FE and skills sector has sadly become accustomed to nowadays . <p> The UKCES funding around NOS has shrunk year on year since 2009 meaning that , in reality , it is already employers in many sectors who continue to fund the bulk work necessary to develop , review and maintain standards . UK Govt continues to look at NOS solely through the lens of adult qualifications , but for many employers they actually play a fundamental role as the consistent common language of ' what good looks like ' throughout their HR and learning systems and processes . The changes to NOS being pushed for by BIS through UKCES risk making them more complex , more opaque and less user friendly ; the complete opposite of the intended ' simplification ' exercise . They are the one , single consistent component of the UK skills landscape and where they are used well , play a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the politicains and cvil servants who uncritically embraced his report , never really understood what National Occupational Standards are , the process by which they are written , the uses to which they can be put and the value they add to the whole " skills agenda " . We now face the prospect of their being replaced by a hotch potch of cobbled together Trailblazer standards for which the phrase " unfit for purpose " might have been coined . Doubtless in thirty years time , some bright spark will have the idea of getting people together to develop robust and dispassionate standards which define what people need to be able to do and need to know and understand in order to achieve a particular vocational outcome . They could be called Occupational Standards or OS for short ... <p> Dissatisfaction with NOS arose from the antipathy to competences and N/SVQs in certain quarters . Representations were made but just batted aside . They will now wither and die , before anything else can be devised , leaving a vacuum , which will probably be filled more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the Russian economy post Glasnost . Other standards exist , particularly higher level professional ones such as those of the Engineering Council , but these standards are much more general , and the details of specific occupations still remains to be fleshed out . As Hillaire Belloc with great prescience wrote of poor Jim and his reckless disregard for the health and safety standards of the day , " always keep a-hold of NOS ; For fear of finding something worse . " <p> My concern is the way the term ' employers ' is used as if they were an homogenous group . What employers want means different things to different employers and BIS should listen less to the handful who can employ effective lobbyists . I share concerns that trailblazers are splintering the currency of Apprenticeships . At present an Apprenticeship is like the US Dollar ... everyone knows what it is and what it 's worth . The new trailblazers will have some US Dollar standard programmes , but also so Euro , Swiss Franc , Mexican Peso etc etc . I am deeply concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry qualifications with little value and zero portability . <p> It is disappointing that the Government in England seems to place so little value on NOS and Sector Skills Councils when internationally they are held in the highest regard and extensively copied along with the rest of our competence based approach to technical and vocational education . I am sure they are right that these approaches do need to be continually adapted and refreshed , but perhaps with a little more humility and listening first ? Trailblazer work has added new energy to the standards debate and has been effective at engaging employers . Managed sensibly , the Trailblazer standards can provide a valuable " front end " to NOS , testing their relevance and enhancing their value . But someone has to do the leg work to join all this up and to turn TB standards into apprenticeships that can be assessed . Who is going to pay for that ? Might it also have been better if we had started with a road map of the occupations that needed to be covered rather than the " making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been driving employers round the bend . Perhaps an opportunity for the new apprenticeship agency , if BIS gives them the space to untangle this pretty important issue .@@3885001 <h> More on this 
 Two visits from FE Commissioner Dr David Collins triggered first by financial problems and secondly by an Ofsted inadequate rating was the scene into which Tim Eyton-Jones stepped in February . Dr Collins has since drawn a line under his involvement and inspectors have also seen improvements . Mr Eyton-Jones spells out what 's been happening at Barnfield . <p> Barnfield College has history . A few years ago it was a highly respected college with an excellent reputation and an outstanding Ofsted report . It was a college that inspired other colleges a college with fantastic industry links and a college whose students had won national awards year-after-year . I could go on . <p> So what went wrong ? The senior managers and governors lost sight of the college 's primary business . Instead of concentrating on putting the student first and ensuring their success , they concentrated on building an empire the Barnfield Federation which included a whole host of other providers . They took their eye off the ball and the quality of teaching and learning at the college plummeted . <p> If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start from scratch and take tough decisions <p> In November 2014 , Barnfield College received the worst Ofsted report in the whole country . Every key area observed was deemed ' inadequate ' and inspectors struggled to find a single positive thing to say about the college . To top it all , the college was accused of financial mismanagement a scandal that hit the national media . <p> I remember my first day as principal of Barnfield College very clearly it was February 1 , 2015 . I stood and watched the students as they arrived at the front entrance . Their behaviour was appalling and the atmosphere was intimidating . I asked the ( then ) curriculum managers for information about the quality of teaching and learning in their respective areas , but their replies were vague and about everything and anything else . <p> If the college was going to make any progress , we had to start from scratch and take tough decisions . Links with Barnfield Federation were severed so we could focus on our core business . A new board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on the college . Together with the new chair and board , I wrote a new three-year Development Plan entitled Reclaiming Excellence , which set out our values and vision for the future . <p> Our students are now at the heart of everything we do . We want them to be successful on their course so they progress on to a relevant destination , but we also want them to develop as individuals so they become respected and valued members of the community . To enable them to achieve this , our priority is for them to experience excellent teaching and learning and an active enrichment programme in an outstanding learning environment . We have set ourselves high targets for their performance . Giving students a voice has also been key they now have their say in everything we do , from staff recruitment to the governance of the college . It 's their college after all . <p> We 've achieved a lot in 10 months . We now have a fantastic staff team , as over one third of the staff have changed , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Following the financial problems of last year , we are proud to have received an ' outstanding ' for our financial plans from the Skills Funding Agency something not many colleges can boast about today . We are still under close scrutiny , which is to be expected , but we are pleased to announce that the college is now showing improvements in all areas , with exceptional improvements in apprenticeships for both quality and numbers . It is now fast developing into one of the biggest and most successful areas of the college . <p> When I was welcoming the students at 9am this morning , my thoughts went back to February 1 and it 's quite remarkable how much has changed in such a short space of time . If you asked any of our students , they 'd tell you that they are proud of their college now . I know I certainly am . In three years ' time I really believe that Barnfield College will be the talk of the sector once again , but for all the right reasons .@@3896148 <h> Councillors to see 
 The strain of getting vocational learners over the GCSE English and maths finish line is behind much strain in the FE and skills sector , as recognised not least in Ofsted 's annual report . But behind the policy is a view of GCSEs and the workplace that needs rethinking says Mark Flinn . <p> Last month , FE Week stated that 130,979 17+ learners were entered for GCSE maths in summer 2015 , an increase of 57 per cent over the previous year see English and maths supplement available on feweek.co.uk . Many will herald this as good news . But is GCSE maths fit for purpose as a qualification for vocational learners in the 21st Century ? <p> What we used to refer to as " numeracy " has been replaced in ministerial terminology by " maths " . But when we look closely at the GCSE maths subject content and assessment objectives for 2015 and beyond , as published by the Department for Education in 2013 , we find much content unrelated to the needs of vocational learners in the modern world . <p> Where , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ever required to use or apply the factorisation of quadratic expressions , quadratic equations , simultaneous equations , linear inequalities , sequences , Pythagoras ' Theorem , the surface area of a sphere or pyramid , simple proofs in Euclidian geometry , the sine rule or the cosine rule ? <p> Why has the attainment of a grade C pass at GCSE become the ' gold standard ' to which all , irrespective of future career plans , must aspire ? Not on the basis of any research evidence , and not on the basis of a proven link between subject content and vocational needs <p> In the days of computer-based design systems , what is the relevance of using " the standard ruler and compass constructions to .... bisect a given angle " ? In what vocational context is a knowledge of " Fibonacci type sequences and quadratic sequences " useful ? Where might we " Derive the properties of regular polygons " or " identify and interpret gradients and intercepts of linear functions graphically and algebraically " ? When is the " multiplication of vectors by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This is not to deny that elements of the GCSE subject content are important for all learners : working with number , fractions , percentages and decimals , measures , graphs , ratio and proportion , mensuration , calculation , graphs , probability and statistics all have a fundamental place . But the totality of the GCSE subject content has not been designed to provide a foundation in numeracy the understanding and application of numbers . <p> Rather , its purpose is to provide an important and ( largely ) necessary foundation for the further study of maths and its applications in the sciences and technology at advanced level and beyond . Pythagoras , trigonometry and quadratic equations are of great importance in the further study and application of mathematics but are largely irrelevant to the needs of most vocational learners . <p> Many learners will wish , of course , to strive towards a grade C ( or better ) pass at GCSE in order to qualify for a future professional study . But most of the learners who are struggling to move from a grade D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to advanced level and beyond . For many of them , a grade D pass represents a hard-won and creditable achievement which may not , even with the best of efforts , be improved upon . Yet the new requirement imposed on these learners , and the FE sector , is forcing those learners through irrelevant learning hoops , when that time and teacher resources could usefully be employed in reinforcing their core numeracy skills . No-one denies the importance of developing core numeracy skills , but can anyone demonstrate that GCSE maths , as currently specified , is fit for this purpose ? <p> So why has the attainment of a grade C pass at GCSE become the ' gold standard ' to which all , irrespective of future career plans , must aspire ? Not on the basis of any research evidence , and not on the basis of a proven link between subject content and vocational needs . As with other examples of ministerially-driven curriculum change , it seems to have been driven by personal experience and prejudice .

 David Hughes raises six key questions that he feels need to be answered to help the Government realise its goal of transforming learning and skills by 2020 , as set out in the Skills Funding Letter . <p> The Skills Funding Letter to the Skills Funding Agency sets out a radical and potentially positive path over the next five years for learning and skills . <p> With the new apprenticeship levy , an extension of loans and cash protection for the newly-named adult education budget , the Government has set out rising investment in learning and skills over the term of this Parliament . <p> Nobody was predicting that and it is a welcome respite after five years of cuts which have reduced learning opportunities and brought many colleges close to financial melt-down . <p> In a very clever settlement , the Skills Minister showed that he has listened and set out a stable policy environment as well as the unexpected rising investment . <p> But there is always a but , and for me there are six questions which need answering before we can truly view this as a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's easy to blame the remote Whitehall mandarins for ' bad ' decisions , not so easy when the decisions are being taken in the town hall . <p> Firstly , will apprenticeships be piled high &amp; sold cheap ? The target and the levy on pay-rolls over ? could easily lead to more of the apprenticeships which do n't launch people on a productive career . <p> The risk of this is compounded by the fear that employers will cease to invest in other much-needed workplace training . <p> Secondly , will adults invest in themselves ? The introduction of loans for those over 24 and for part-time higher education has seen a collapse in participation . What will change now to ensure that more adults do make the investment through the loans ? <p> Thirdly , is this the time for community learning to fly or die ? Folding the community learning budget into a new locally-commissioned adult education budget is clever , but will every area understand , value and retain the learning which , for instance , encourages adults to take those first steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later life ? <p> Next up , will Town Hall leadership be better than Whitehall ? It 's easy to blame the remote Whitehall mandarins for ' bad ' decisions , not so easy when the decisions are being taken in the town hall . <p> In any devolved system , it is inevitable that some areas will be ' better ' than others . Where is the balancing accountability for local decisions and who centrally will police it ? <p> Also , are colleges up for the changes needed ? The rising investment set out in the letter is very different in nature it will come very clearly from three sources the Government via local commissioning , employers via the apprenticeship levy and learners via loans . <p> Colleges will need to think carefully about how to market , package and deliver the mix , the quality , the flexibility needed to appeal to these new markets . <p> Some will need to invest in change at a time when reserves have been severely depleted in many places . <p> Finally , is this the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his view at the Association of Colleges conference by challenging colleges to take more of the growing apprenticeship market and the letter suggests that big national contracts will cease as funding is routed via local commissioning and via employers . <p> It sets an enormous challenge to independent providers at the same time as the Department for Work and Pensions has set out that the ? Work Programme will cease , to be replaced by in-house services and a much smaller Work and Health Programme of ? . <p> I am optimistic about the next few years because the sector has a policy and funding settlement it can work with and some time to make it work . <p> That 's great news for us all , and in 2020 I hope to be able to look back at the positive changes which resulted in better access , better quality and better outcomes for learners and employers . <h> Exclusive : Luton 
 single skills market is needed to make employers invest more in apprenticeships and training , according to a report published today by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills ( UKCES ) . <p> The document , titled ' Employer Ownership of Skills ' , says " more can be done to leverage additional employer investment " , and that government schemes have led to " significant dead-weight " when trying to engage businesses in training . <p> The report calls for a revised funding system which would give employers more responsibility and greater incentives to invest in employer-facing programmes such as apprenticeships . <p> Charlie Mayfield , Chairman of UKCES , said : " We need a single market for skills development into which employers and employees are prepared to make a greater contribution for higher quality training . <p> " For young people , this means moving from provider grants to employer incentives for apprenticeships and work experience ; and for adults , shifting from provider grants to employer investments and loans .

 Week investigates : The National Extension College is ' reborn ' <p> Little more than a month ago , thousands of students faced uncertainty after the owners of a distance-learning institution plunged into administration . <p> Saddled with a pension liability and rapidly reducing income , the Learning and Skills Network ( LSN ) announced its demise in early November . <p> It left the administrators , PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) , with the task of finding buyers for LSN 's five businesses , including the National Extension College ( NEC ) , which supports 20,000 students nationwide on home study courses . <p> Fast-forward six weeks and the NEC has a new owner in the Open School Trust ( OST ) a consortium which includes former employees and trustees who were involved with the NEC prior to its merger with the LSN in 2010 . <p> But the familiarities do not end there , as both share the same founder Lord Young of Dartington , who set up OST 1989 and the NEC in 1963 . <p> As such , the OST , which has been dormant since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by former NEC director Dr Ros Morpeth , has promised to retain the name and " values and missions of the reborn college " . <p> Speaking to FE Week , Dr Morpeth said that " for confidentiality reasons " she could not reveal how much the OST paid for the NEC . <p> However , she said : " Money exchanged hands and there were other organisations bidding .

 Commissioner criticises minority of providers for failing to address problems flagged last year <p> Alix Robertson <p> 15:35 , Dec 22 , 2015 <p> 0 <p> A minority of colleges are still failing to address areas of concern identified last year , FE Commissioner David Collins has warned . <p> In his 2014/15 annual report , Dr Collins said challenges already dealt-with by most providers were still proving problematic for others . <p> He said the interventions undertaken in 2014/15 suggested that there were " still a number of problems in colleges that could be considered to be ' basic ' and highlighted in last year 's report , which the majority of the sector has long since addressed " . <p> In the report , Dr Collins identified a number of key areas of weakness , including the role of the clerk , governance , leadership and management , quality improvement and financial health . <p> Dr Collins said : " After a period of intense competition between institutions , the new approach is to encourage collaboration and the creation of fewer and larger institutions that will be better placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringent environment , while creating stronger specialisation . " <p> He added that this would be especially significant for weaker colleges , such as those struggling financially or those with " quality issues " . <p> He also commented on the limited skillsets of some governing bodies , slow responses by college leaders to changing financial situations and problematic differences in the role of clerks between colleges . <p> This year 's annual report summarises the work of the FE Commissioner and his team through interventions from August 1 , 2014 to July 31 , 2015 , with updates on the colleges assessed to the end of October 2015 . <p> Over this period 21 cases were referred to the commissioner , with seven of these ( 33 per cent ) triggered by an inadequate Ofsted inspection and 14 ( 67 per cent ) because of " financial concerns " . <p> Each of the organisations visited underwent a two week intervention or review .

 call for action with one-third of transgender adult learners bullied or harassed <p> Jude Burke <p> 0:01 , Jan 14 , 2016 <p> 2 <p> A parliamentary committee today called for government action after being told how one-third of transgender adult learners experienced " unacceptable " bullying or harassment . <p> The House of Commons Women and Equalities Committee ( WEC ) , chaired by Basingstoke 's Conservative MP Maria Miller ( pictured above ) , looked into the issue between September and November and published its report , entitled Transgender Equality , this morning . <p> Key findings in the area of post-school education , which covered both FE and higher education , included one third of trans-students having been bullied or harassed on campus , and trans students being more likely to leave their courses as a result of this harassment . <p> " The levels of bullying and harassment experienced by trans-students in further and higher education are unacceptable , " the report said . <p> The inquiry had " heard evidence that in FE the learning environment for LGBT lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it said . <p> Evidence to the inquiry had been submitted by the National Union of Students ( NUS ) , the Government Equalities Office and Skills Minister Nick Boles , among others . <p> The report 's authors said they " welcomed " Mr Boles ' offer , given during the inquiry 's evidence session on October 28 , to raise the issue with universities . <p> " We recommend that the government hold similar conversations with FE providers . " <p> The report also called on the government " take steps " to ensure that all FE staff received training in gender identity awareness . <p> Speaking exclusively to FE Week , WEC chair Maria Miller , said she was " shocked " by the " level of transphobia that we 've seen " . <p> " The reason why it is so important to get the change that the minister agreed needed to happen is because too many students are choosing to leave their courses because they feel there 's a lack of policies or facilities in place to support them as transpeople , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is studying for a BTec in applied science at Lambeth College , was assigned female at birth , but identifies as neither male nor female . <p> " I know who I am , but I still hear comments , homophobic , biphobic language , get thrown around , " they said . <p> " I 'm in a position to challenge that when I hear it from other students but I think I 'm very lucky . I 'm also the LGBT officer at the college , so I know I 've got staff members who 'll back me up if I do challenge it whereas I think a lot of students would n't have the assurance that they know the staff are there to back them up if they do challenge . <p> " There are two trans people at Lambeth me and one other and neither of us are out to our classmates . We 've both mature students , but neither of us feel comfortable being out to our classmates which I think tells you a lot . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that if they want to come out to staff or students they 'll be respected and their identities will be respected , and that staff will challenge derogatory language when it 's heard . You have to create an environment in which the student is comfortable being out .

 figures from the Policy Consortium have challenged Sir Michael Wilshaw over his claim that the FE sector is " inadequate at best " , in a letter to Ofsted 's chief inspector seen by FE Week . <p> Sir Michael made the comments during a speech on Monday ( January 19 ) for thinktank CentreForum , which also criticised the sector for offering " uniformly weak " careers advice , as reported in FE Week . <p> But 12 members of the Policy Forum , which is described on its website as a group of " experienced people with strong and varied track records in FE and skills " , hit back in a letter sent to Sir Michael yesterday ( January 22 ) . <p> He will have received it on the same day that FE Week reported on how leaders of the Association of Colleges ( AoC ) , , the Association of School and College Leaders ( ASCL ) , and the University and College Union ( UCU ) had issued strongly worded statements defending the sector against Mr Wilshaw 's scathing claims . <p> The Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's speech , where he said : " Educational provision , for the many children who do not succeed at 16 or who would prefer an alternative to higher education , is inadequate at best and non-existent at worst .

But it is also very puzzling " . <p> " We have looked back at the most recent chief inspector 's report , published on December 1 , " their letter added . <p> " There , we find that only 3 per cent of general FE colleges and 3 per cent of independent training providers were graded as ' inadequate ' for overall effectiveness at their most recent inspection . <p> " On the other hand , more than three-quarters of both those categories were rated by Ofsted inspectors as either ' good ' or ' outstanding ' . <p> " We would be grateful if you could let us know how to reconcile your recent assertion with the evidence produced by your own organisation , and detailed so clearly in your own annual report . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we accept the evidence of that data , or your quite contradictory claim above ?

" <p> Mr Pretty , who took over from executive director Dr Lynne Sedgmore in September , added : " I am delighted that we are getting a dynamic , entrepreneurial college as a new member and I look forward to working with them . " <p> CVC , which is also a member of Gazelle , was established in August 2011 as a result of the merger of Barry College and Coleg Glan Hafren . <p> The latest Estyn report said that it was in the top quarter of the largest colleges in Wales , with 10 sites located from Trowbridge in East Cardiff across to Rhoose in the Vale of Glamorgan . <p> Mike James , CVC principal , said today : " I am delighted that we are to become the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to being employer-facing and ensuring our learners are appropriately skilled and ready for work has been recognised by such a hugely influential UK body . <p> " I have no doubt that working with the 157 Group and other member colleges will support us in shaping future skills needs to ensure the long-term economic capacity of the Welsh and UK economy . <p> " CVC is excited about the prospect of contributing to the vital work of the 157 Group working with a wide range of stakeholders in the development of sustainable professional and technical skills , not just in Wales but across the sector ; and of bringing examples of good practice back to our colleagues at other colleges in Wales and at Colegau Cymru to help influence and shape policy here in Wales .

 conference what the FE delegates had to say <p> Alix Robertson <p> 19:38 , Feb 6 , 2016 <p> 0 <h> At today 's University and College Union conference on ' Education from Cradle to Grave ' , FE Week spoke to some of the FE delegates to find out how they felt about the event and which hot topics they were discussing . <p> Danyl Bartlett South Essex College <p> There has been such a variety of opinions here . It 's nice to see people who have just come from all over the country with very different perspectives on the same issues and being able to share that in a to share that in an open space has been great . <p> I do n't think there needs to be a single message to today , I think it just needs to be about getting everyone together to hear how different branches of UCU are coping with some of the big changes that are happening in FE . <p> The FE model is changing . It 's becoming more client-led , as opposed to and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I also think it is damaging the morale of academics . <p> Anya Cook Newcastle College <p> I really enjoyed what Jeremy Corbyn had to say on the purpose and function of FE . What I felt was missed was that he did n't talk enough about the social impact that education can have . <p> He talked about access to FE for developing skills for developing higher level thinking skills and imagination , he did n't address how FE is important to enable people to come out of their social situation . There was n't enough , for me , about the barriers . <p> Graham English Canterbury College <p> I think there 's a very positive feeling about the importance of the FE sector here . It 's easy on the job , in the colleges , to be caught dealing with day-to-day problems rather than stepping back and taking a wide look at how important the sector is and what it can offer society . <p> I think there 's a lot of feelings and thoughts apparent here that makes me realise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps undervalued and misunderstood and not thought about often enough . <p> Hand hand-in-hand with that is a belief in the people and a belief in the communities that the college and FE provision serves , and that you can have a far better , fairer , more equal society that benefits all if you keep working with these professionals . <p> Trust the professionals to do their job and stop trying to do quick fixes that are aimed at offloading government responsibility , head kept in the sand , thinking that apprenticeships will solve all the problems , or new management will solve the problems . Listen to the research , listen to the front line and then invest accordingly , so that the sector really functions . <p> Ikram Bradford College <p> I came here just because of Mr Corbyn really . I really enjoyed his speech . He seems to have a proper vision for the education sector , as opposed to just saying things . I think he understands the real purpose of FE . It 's more than just apprenticeships , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him acknowledge that . <p> This is my first conference I am a lecturer we do n't get to hear much about what the management do but we hear the issues in the classroom and we see that the students and their issues really do need to be taken more seriously , and the only people who really know are the teachers who are with them . <p> Even the immediate managers do n't always know . I think teachers and lecturers should have more say in how to deal with the situation . I have students at the moment that are having financial problems just getting to college . Just the travelling . I think the real issues nobody is talking about and at least in the union they do have some idea . <p> Keith Gould City and Islington College <p> The atmosphere here today started off really well . Obviously Jeremy Corbyn was here right at the beginning and everyone was happy to have him here . Then in our breakout session there was some interesting debate about getting older people back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did n't cover the internet revolution and how that is affecting things , because that is obviously an overriding topic . <p> But Jeremy Corbyn is totally with the vein of the sector for most people . At City and Islington we are one of the colleges that is merging with another large successful college Westminster Kingsway College so we are going to be a super college . I do n't know how it will affect me yet , but they have focused on how the identities of the two colleges will remain unique , there may not be a rebranding but we are merging so who knows what will happen . <p> Lorraine Yuill Kendal College <p> I really like that Jeremy Corbyn raised the issue of lifelong learners . He was saying that he really believed in lifelong learning and if we were all going to be working to pension age and later pensions that we might be retraining and need the opportunity to go in and out of education . <p> I think people here have been talking a lot and are asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and colleges . It 's my first conference and I 've very much enjoyed it . <p> The 2016 Calcutta 
 colleges ' crucial ' and need to be protected from ' cuts and attacks ' , says Corbyn <p> Alix Robertson <p> 19:28 , Feb 6 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn called for a greater focus on lifelong learning , such as the provision offered by many FE colleges , to address the skills gap in Britain . <p> In addressing a large audience at the University and College Union ( UCU ) ' Cradle to Grave ' conference today in Senate House , University of London , Mr Corbyn said the skills gap is " the biggest challenge facing the economy in Britain " , and the services provided by the FE sector are " crucial " in tackling the problem . <p> " Education needs to be a lifelong process . ... I believe that we have a fundamental responsibility to provide opportunities for adults to learn and train to pursue their ambitions , " he said . <p> " Funding cuts have led to a drop in the adult skills budget over the past five years . The Association of Colleges has warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2015 and 2016 alone . <p> " We must enable lifelong learning in order to succeed as individuals and as a society . " <p> He said that business is now " in crisis " because the number of workers with the skills needed is " drying up " . <p> " Education is absolutely vital in addressing the biggest challenge facing the economy in Britain , which is the skills gap at the present time , " Mr Corbyn said . <p> " All these cuts and attacks are doing permanent damage to the whole of our society and the ability to develop a much stronger , manufacturing-based , innovative economy in the future . " <p> He stressed the importance of ensuring that people have the ability to go back in and out of education during their working lives , to develop new skills and change direction particularly older jobs-seekers who are also facing a rising pension age . <p> " I have met many in their 40s and 50s in colleges , often going through great personal hardship in order to try and gain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a lifeline for the future , " he said . <p> In discussing the situation for universities and colleges , Mr Corbyn praised the contribution of many providers , particularity in the FE sector , in opening doors for people of all ages . <p> " The government has scrapped maintenance grants which means that thousands of students every year will be worse off . Further education , and those who study and work in colleges will be significantly affected by this because more than one in ten of every student doing a higher education local degree course does it in an FE college . <p> " That 's why FE colleges are so crucial , because many of those from disadvantaged backgrounds are able to access further education and go on to higher education through the college system . It 's absolutely essential that we understand that and protect it , " he said . <p> He concluded by saying : " If we want to thrive as dynamic economy in the 21st century , we must focus on equipping people with the skills and training needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Sally Hunt , UCU general secretary , also spoke at the event , discussing ' what is to be done ' in the future . <p> She drew out four points , beginning with the UCU 's plans to " continue to argue for an alternative to the current policies " . <p> She also highlighted the importance of the working conditions of university and college staff , saying : " There are very many great teachers today who are existing from hand to mouth with little or no job security . The results they do achieve for their students are sadly despite rather than because of the system which governments and employers have allowed to grow . <p> " We need to be telling students that because our working conditions are their learning conditions , it is long past time that we make common cause with each other .

 on restructuring facilities published by BIS <p> The government will be providing cash to help colleges to implement area review recommendations but has made it clear that no more money will be made available once these are completed . <p> Information about the restructuring facility exclusively revealed by FE Week two weeks ago ( see right ) was included in updated guidance on area reviews , published on Tuesday by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills . <p> The updated guidance is almost twice as long as the previous version and includes a number of lessons learned from the first area reviews . <p> Colleges will be expected to seek alternative sources of funds for implementing any changes but " in cases where the required funding can not otherwise be secured there is a restructuring facility available , " the guidance says . <p> Cash from the fund " is being made available to reflect the one off nature of the restructuring of the sector , through area reviews , to achieve long-term sustainability " . <p> " A key objective of the reviews is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore no further Exceptional Financial Support will be available for colleges following the implementation of review recommendations in the relevant area , " the guidance continues . <p> As previously reported in FE Week , the " default position " of the facility , which is being held by the Treasury , is that " it will be provided as a loan on commercial terms " and it will " cover only a proportion of the total costs " . <p> In exceptional cases , the guidance states , cash may be available as a non-repayable grant . <p> Skills Minister Nick Boles is understood to have said during an event for the Association of Colleges ( AoC ) on Wednesday that grants of between ? 50,000 and ? 100,000 would be available from the facility . <p> A spokesperson for BIS has confirmed that the grants will be either ? 50,000 or ? 100,000 " depending on circumstances " . More detail will be published shortly , the spokesperson added . <p> The updated guidance was welcomed by Martin Doel , AoC chief executive , who said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the guidance at the start of wave one , but now it has been published it can be used by colleges going forward , " he added . <p> The guidance also features an expanded section on the area review process , as well as a number of lessons learned from the first wave of reviews . <p> These include the importance of " early engagement between colleges on options " and " early communication between the colleges and the LEPs local enterprise partnerships and LAs local authorities " . The role of LEPs and LAs in the area reviews in setting out the " economic vision " and " skills base " needed is now stated in the updated guidance . <p> The " critical role " of banks , as colleges ' creditors , is acknowledged , with the guidance stating that the government has " initiated national level discussions " with the banks . <p> The guidance also reveals that the government is " proposing to introduce an insolvency regime for FE and sixth form colleges , " which would come into effect once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on implementation " highlights some key issues for colleges in the implementation phase " , which it describes as challenging . These include the ' in principle ' decision , appointing the right people to lead the colleges and the stages of implementation ahead of merging . <p> " Fuller implementation guidance " should be published in the spring . <p> Other changes in the new guidance include an extension in the area review timescales , from three to four months in the initial guidance to four to six months , and the removal of the option for " proactive proposals " for area reviews . <p> The guidance also covers the option for sixth form colleges to convert to academies , full guidance for which was published by the Department for Education in February . <p> The Sixth Form Colleges Association declined to comment on the updated guidance . <h> 13 <p> Shares 
 row has broken out between the University and College Union ( UCU ) and providers that dispute the findings of its new report identifying where women were said to be paid " significantly less than men " . <p> The union publicly unveiled the document today , but FE Week was shown a copy in advance and asked for responses from five colleges that were " named and shamed " as having " the widest combined gender pay gap " . <p> Of those , Northampton College , Great Yarmouth College ( GYC ) , and Kirklees College disputed the validity of the findings which prompted the union 's general secretary Sally Hunt to complain they were " playing shoot the messenger " . <p> Sally Hunt <p> The UCU claimed the report had exposed " shameful levels of pay inequality " , as at " nearly two-thirds ( 132 out of 203 ) of the English FE colleges that provided data , male lecturers are paid on average ? 1,000 more than women " . <p> However , a Northampton College spokesperson told FE Week the data " only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college ( lecturers only ) " . <p> " The college employs a high proportion of teaching staff on an hourly paid basis and these contracts tend to be more attractive to women , enabling them to work more flexibly , " she added . <p> " There has also been a failure to consider data associated with the remaining academic staff . <p> " For example , female staff form approximately 67 per cent of the cohort of academic staff with additional or management duties . " <p> A Great Yarmouth College ( GYC ) spokesperson said : " We do not recognise this report as a fair reflection of our college , nor endorse the methodology ; which appears flawed . " <p> She raised concern about " the potential misuse of actual headcount and salaries vs their full time equivalents " . <p> " The report uses different pay scales to our own and fails to recognise we use a single scale with automatic , incremental progression , " she added . <p> " Also the data excludes the programme area leads our highest paid academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Melanie Brooke , vice principal of Kirklees College , said : " We 've got a range of concerns about the way the whole data is presented . <p> " We would need to understand more on who the comparatives are and how part-time staff , for example , doing different jobs , have been reported in our data . " <p> A spokesperson for Milton Keynes College , which also appeared in the top five , also said it would " be investigating the report findings thoroughly " . <p> However , she said : " The college operates a single pay scale for all staff in teaching roles , irrespective of gender , age , sexuality or ethnicity and it is disappointing to read the UCU analysis which is not a picture the college recognises . " <p> Meanwhile , City College Norwich said it should not have featured second on the list , but " an unfortunate administrative error meant we submitted the actual salaries of teachers , as opposed to the full time equivalent salaries , in response to the UCU 's original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response from Ms Hunt , who said : " UCU is disappointed that colleges are playing ' shoot the messenger ' when it comes to the gender pay gap . <p> " Our survey has been conducted to the highest standards and shows that a significant gap exists between the pay of men and women . <p> " The response to the survey by some of the worst offenders sadly shows the level of complacency within parts of the sector about this serious issue . " <p> UCU also responded directly to the Great Yarmouth College claims , stating : " The FOI asked specifically for a headcount of all lecturers , and for male and female lecturers at each point of the nationally recognised eight-point scale , and clearly asked that colleges responding use the FTE salary for part time staff . <p> " Under the FOI Act the responder must ensure that the data they provide is correct . <p> " Any issue or confusion between part-time and full-time salaries is the responsibility of the college " . <p> " The sooner

We 're there to promote that offer and support providers in doing it .

 of apprenticeships <p> Jude Burke <p> 18:00 , Mar 11 , 2016 <p> 2 <p> The Government 's Enterprise Bill currently making its way through parliament contains a number of measures designed to set minimum standards for apprenticeships , including legally protecting the term ' apprenticeship ' and setting public sector targets . <p> However , reporter Jude Burke found that these pale in comparison to the first time government legislated on minimum standards for apprenticeships , back in the sixteenth century . <p> Apprenticeships the early years : <p> The Statute of Artificers , introduced by the parliament of Elizabeth 1 in 1563 , made it illegal for anyone to " exercise any art , mystery or occupation now used or occupied within the realm of England and Wales except he shall have been brought up therein seven years at the least as an apprentice " . <p> Before the introduction of this legislation , apprenticeships were regulated by the guilds of trades and craftsmen . <p> An apprentice , often starting as young as 10 or 12 , would learn his trade over a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shorter than this with his master being responsible for his board , lodging and clothing as well as teaching . <p> The 1563 Act was abolished in 1814 , as the popularity of apprenticeships waned " due to conditions in factories and exploitation of young apprentices " , according to a House of Commons research paper from 2009 . <p> Apprentices working in the brass foundry department , Wallsend Slipway and Engineering Company , 1914 <p> A medieval baker with his apprentice .

 90 per cent of providers fear for apprenticeships quality <p> Nine out of ten apprenticeship sector leaders who took part in an exclusive FE Week survey fear quality will suffer as the government drives towards apprenticeship starts by 2020 . <p> It was carried out ahead of the FE Apprenticeship Conference ( AAC ) which will be attended by nearly 1,000 staff from colleges , independent training providers and awarding organisations over tomorrow , Thursday , and Friday at the Birmingham ICC . <p> There was a fairly even split , among 209 respondents to the survey sent to delegates , between those that thought the target would be achieved and those who did n't but 88 per cent were concerned about quality suffering . <p> FE Week survey results : <p> Are you concerned quality will suffer in effort to increase quantity ? <p> Yes very concerned <p> 85 <p> <p> 183 <p> <p> Yes a little concerned <p> 98 <p> <p> No not very concerned <p> 21 <p> <p> 23 <p> <p> No not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 <p> <p> 1 <p> <p> Total <p> 209 <p> Keith Smith <p> Delegates at AAC , which is organised by FE Week parent company in partnership with the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) , will hear tomorrow from Skills Funding Agency director Keith Smith who is now leading levy implementation . <p> Ofsted chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw will also deliver a keynote conference speech on Thursday morning , when he is expected to repeat his concern raised in October about poor quality apprenticeships , for example in cleaning and coffee making . <p> A damning Ofsted report published at the same time , following a thematic review , also warned of low-skilled jobs being rebadged as apprenticeships . <p> Sir Michael Wilshaw <p> Sir Michael will be joined for a question and answer session after his AAC speech by Ofsted deputy director for FE and skills Paul Joyce , who told the BBC at the start of National Apprenticeship Week that the inspectorate had come across " apprentices that received very little to no training " . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long history of apprenticeships , like construction and engineering , but with some sectors like retail and customer services , the experience was less positive , " he added . <p> Delegates also expressed concern , through the survey , about lack of detail over the way the reforms , such as the levy , would be implemented . <p> Neil Coates , director of vocational and growth at Newham College , asked : " When will we know all the facts ? The lack of clear information at a time of area reviews is a massive disadvantage to FE colleges . " <p> Matt Garvey , managing director at independent training provider WBTC , said : " The vision is sound but the lack of detail on how the reforms will work has created an environment of rumour , supposition and fear .

 The old adage when you 're in a hole first stop digging before you find a way out could n't be more true so far as apprenticeship reform is concerned at least that 's the view of Graham . <p> Following the publication of the Enterprise Bill at the end of February , I believe the Institute for Apprenticeships ( IfA ) might just be the way to rekindle enthusiasm for Trailblazers solving the issues and anxieties surrounding apprenticeships . Let me explain ... <p> The government started reforming apprenticeships more than three years ago but the blunt truth is , thus far , insufficient progress has been made . <p> Its aim is to improve the quality of apprenticeships with fundamental reforms so that skills and productivity within the economy will increase . <p> But while some excellent work has been carried out by the Employer Groups working together to design world-class apprenticeship standards and assessment approaches we need to consider the actual rate of progress . <p> Currently there are 1,700 job roles in the existing apprenticeship frameworks excluding degree apprenticeships and sectors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate of the total number of reformed apprenticeship standards which are going to be needed across the economy , based upon the government 's current approach , is likely to be 2,000 to 2,500 . <p> But although Trailblazers have been around since October 2013 , ( when they were formally announced ) the present rate to complete to the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) ' ready for delivery ' status is just 38 per year that means it could take several decades to complete all the reformed apprenticeship standards and assessment plans . <p> Little wonder then people engaged in the Trailblazer process say not enough progress is being made <p> Little wonder then people engaged in the Trailblazer process say not enough progress is being made . <p> To increase the number of standards and assessment plans ready for delivery the present Trailblazer process will need to be reformed with a robust operational system put in place , led by employers . <p> It seems SASE ( Specification of Apprenticeship Standards for England ) apprenticeships are going to be around for some time , bridging the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apprenticeship reform programme in achieving ' high quality ' apprenticeships ? Well , personally I think they include : <p> A lack of a detailed and coherent design for the ' new world ' of reformed apprenticeships , underpinned by a detailed implementation programme ; <p> Also insufficient progress . Some Trailblazers have been two years in development and are still not complete ; <p> The scale of the increased and complex administrative burden also appears to be designed into the new arrangements by government . <p> It could see employers , particularly SMEs , deciding not to engage with Trailblazer apprenticeships or apprenticeships at all . On some Trailblazer groups employers are already drifting away saying ' it 's in the too hard box ' . <p> Also of concern is the potential reduction in the numbers of adults undertaking apprenticeships 40 per cent of apprenticeships over the last five years have been over 25 . <p> Then there are inconsistencies in approach between various standards and their assessment plans as well as apparent duplications and overlaps in the standards being developed by different industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a ' Skills and Training Plan ' which sets out clearly how skills will be developed in the work-place , the role of work-place learning , mentoring and the type of formal training <p> The governance structures , in the form of the IfA and the Digital Apprenticeship Service ( DAS ) , have only recently been tabled . It will be a considerable challenge to get these fully operational . <p> Inefficient clarity or transparency on the full extent of the roles for these new governance organisations and inadequate communication to the organisations key to a successful implementation of the reforms , i.e. the several hundred thousand employers , including SMEs , training providers and is another issue . <p> So what needs to be done ? The 10 point plan below might be the answer . I think we should : <p> Complete the detailed design of the new apprenticeship reforms and system including creating a firm understanding of how many apprenticeship standards are both required and desirable across the economy ; <p> Finalise and publish the details of a streamlined business process which can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details of the new DAS portal ; <p> Establish a realistic and robust implementation plan , with all the support risks , issues and governance structures ; <p> Complete the detailed design of the functions and structure for the IfA and make these public this should ensure there is proper provision for the potential additional functions of the IfA ; <p> Resource the IfA . This would not only increase the production of apprenticeship standards and assessment plans but also ensure it can discharge all of its functions ; <p> Unfreeze the existing SASE apprenticeships allowing a staged transition to the new arrangement ; <p> Use industry sub-committees in IfA to establish a definite list of apprenticeship standards needed in each sector and undertake an analysis of cross-sector roles to cut duplications . In doing this the sub-committees should consider the core skills for broad apprenticeships as an entry to sectors as well as a pathways approach to developing specialism . By doing this we believe the number of apprenticeship standards eventually required could be reduced to a more manageable number ; <p> Compare the definite list with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a ' fast-track ' upgrade of existing apprenticeships ; <p> Prioritise development of reformed apprenticeship standards based upon potential apprenticeship numbers and relative ease of ' fast-tracking ' ; <p> PHOENIX ( AP

In most colleges that we see , a very small proportion of youngsters are on apprenticeship programmes you ca n't tell me that 's good . No it is n't good .

" <p> " When he talks there does still seem to be an FE bias , " Mr Dawe told FE Week . <p> " When you look at the evidence there is some really good provision and he should base his comments on the evidence and I do n't think he is fulfilling the chief inspector 's role by his personal views being aired , " he said . <p> The Ofsted boss , who will be retiring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new apprenticeship reforms , which could see the education watchdog having to inspect 4,000 training providers , " will present a challenge to Ofsted " . <p> During his speech Sir Michael criticised " colleges and other providers " for " not delivering high enough numbers of apprenticeships overall , and certainly not in the right areas " . <p> " Taking some local examples , two of the biggest colleges in this region have less than 10 per cent of their student population on apprenticeship courses . And these in colleges of nearly 30,000 students , " he said . <p> He also contrasted the quality of different types of apprenticeship provision . <p> " Most high-quality apprenticeships are found in industries that have long-established traditions of using them : the motor industry , construction and engineering . <p> " They are few in number and are largely delivered by long-standing industries and providers . <p> " On the other hand , the ever-increasing numbers of apprenticeships in the care and retail sectors are not consistently reaching the same high standards , " he said . <p> When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much the people delivering them were paid , Sir Michael said : " Those are internal problems for every provider " . <p> " It 's up to the leaders of those institutions to ensure that salary levels and professional development programmes are equitable across the different areas of curriculum , " he continued . <p> Sir Michael also criticised the quality of apprenticeships in small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) , calling most of them " poor quality " . <p> " That 's what 's got to improve , and the only way to get apprenticeships to improve is if employers take ownership of quality , working with high quality training providers , " Sir Michael said . <p> " Most of our employers are SMEs you know that . And yet they 're badly supported , and I have to say , badly led , by local employers , " he added . <p> The singers ' 
 Week 's second Annual Apprenticeship Conference ( AAC ) saw more than 900 delegates fill Birmingham 's International Convention Centre for three days from March 16 to 18 to hear the latest on the government 's apprenticeship reforms . <p> With speakers including sector leaders , key civil servants , government advisers , awarding bodies and apprentices themselves , the conference covered just about every aspect of the apprenticeship programme except , perhaps , concrete answers from the government on some of the big questions . <p> David Hill , the first of two Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) representatives , opened the event with an overview of the government 's reforms . <p> His colleague , Keith Smith ( pictured left ) , the newly appointed head of levy implementation at BIS , revealed a few more tantalising glimpses of how the levy system the cornerstone of the apprenticeship reforms would operate . <p> The levy system will " change how you do business " , Mr Smith said , with providers contracting directly with employers and no longer able to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them certainty over their budgets . <p> More detail would be available in April , Mr Smith said , including " a bit about how the system is going to work for those small businesses , and how we see the service for small business developing over time " . <p> However , some of that detail came a little earlier than April at the end of the second day , to be precise . <p> During a Q&amp;A session Nadhim Zahawi ( picture below ) , co-chair of the apprenticeship delivery board , dropped the bombshell that only levy-paying companies will have access to the new funding system when it is launched in April 2017 . <p> " The core offering that we will be launching in April 2017 will effectively be delivering the levy for the two per cent levy payers , while maintaining stability in the rest of the system , " Mr Zahawi , who is also apprenticeship adviser to Prime Minister David Cameron , said . <p> Sue Husband , the SFA 's director of apprenticeships and delivery service , then confirmed that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " once the levy has been launched . <p> This lack of detailed information from government about the reforms led a number of speakers to express their concern and frustration . <p> During a panel discussion at the end of the first day , Graham Taylor , principal of New College Swindon , called the new system " far too complex , unnecessary waste , increased bureaucracy " . <p> Stewart Segal , chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , criticised the complexity of the system , adding that " the fact is that we 're here only a year way from a complete change and we 're low on details " . <p> Iain Wright ( pictured left ) , MP and chair of the BIS select committee , was strongest in his criticism . He hit out on Thursday morning , accusing the government of " making this up as they go along " . <p> " They have announced the policy and now are frantically thinking : ' How on earth are we going to do this ?

I 'm not sure that 's true ! " he said . <p> " It 's not a bias , it 's a criticism of what we see and have seen for a number of years , " he said . <p> Alongside these arguments about the pace of reforms and standards , the conference also provided the opportunity to hear from the apprentices themselves . <p> Shakira Martin ( pictured right ) , vice president for further education at the National Union of Students , exhorted the government to include apprentices in its reforms , calling for the apprentice voice to be " integrated " into the new Institute for Apprenticeships . <p> This was followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , who gave a compelling reason for including the apprentice voice in reforms . <p> " How the hell can pale , male and stale know what it 's like to be 16 ?

The second phase will allow employers to post their own vacancies . " <p> The fall in employers posting vacancies comes after the 2020 Vision document wrote : " We know that in other countries , the proportion of employers engaged with apprenticeships is much higher . <p> " For instance , around 25 per cent of employers in Austria employ apprentices , 24 per cent in Germany , and 30 per cent in Australia . This is compared to only 15 per cent of establishments who have or offer apprenticeships in England .

 misses target to recruit volunteer careers advisers <p> Alix Robertson <p> 0:01 , Apr 16 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> The Government has admitted to missing its target to recruit 300 ' volunteer enterprise advisers ' by the end of March this year , with 127 places yet to be filled . <p> In a response to a parliamentary written question about the government 's careers initiatives , it was revealed that the Department for Education ( DfE ) currently has just 173 ( or ) of the advisers in place . <p> The role of the volunteer enterprise advisers is to support young people between 12-18 in schools and colleges with careers advice . <p> Commenting on the response to his written question , Labour 's Shadow Skills Minister Gordon Marsden said : " Over a year and a half since Ministers first announced their Careers and Enterprise Company , there is very little clarity on what focus or priorities it will have . <p> " How on earth does the Government expect to try to resurrect a careers programme with such flimsy foundations ? <p> " Young people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences as well as from advice by adults . Yet , the DfE continues to fail young people by not including an obligation for work experience at Key Stage 4 in the curriculum . " <p> Mr Marsden estimates that with only 173 advisers in place , each currently has responsibility for supporting 18,408 students at secondary school level and 4,600 students in FE and sixth form colleges , making 23,000 young people in total . <p> When the Government reaches its 300 target , each adviser will support around 13,000 students . <p> He added that young people " are in danger of being short-changed " over their future career options , with information , advice and guidance or vocational routes in particular remaining " very restricted " . <p> The Careers and Enterprise Company , first announced by education secretary Nick Morgan in December 2014 , was launched in the summer of 2015 . Led by chief executive Claudia Harris , the company now has 18 full time equivalent staff members . <p> Ms Harris commented on the finding , saying : " In what can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it easier for schools , colleges , employers and careers and enterprise providers to work effectively together to support young people . By working in partnership with other organisations , we are able to significantly amplify our reach . <p> " We are working with the Local Enterprise Partnerships ( LEPs ) to build local networks of senior business volunteers to connect to schools and colleges , and we are funding existing providers to scale-up proven careers and enterprise programmes in areas of need . " <p> She added that in its first year , the company has launched three key interventions which it is " delivering ahead of schedule " . <p> These include an analysis of areas in England where young people face the greatest need for careers and enterprise provision ; the launch of a ? Careers &amp; Enterprise Fund to invest in organisations in these areas of need ; and the launch of the Enterprise Adviser network , which is active in 35 LEPs with over 400 schools . <p> " The core of our approach is to work in partnership with others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go , to help better inspire and prepare young people across England for work , " she said . <p> When asked about missing the recruitment target , a Department for Education spokesperson : " Latest figures show the number of young people not in education or training is at the lowest on record and we have the highest ever number of young people going into higher education . <p> " We have introduced a more rigorous curriculum so every child learns the basic skills they need such as English and maths so they can go on to fulfill their potential whether they are going into the world of work or continuing their studies . <p> " We are investing ? 70 million in our careers strategy over the course of this parliament to transform the quality of careers education . We have also set up the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company to bring young people into contact with employers and develop closer links with employers so they can play a greater role in preparing young people for the world of work .

 over finances for three colleges and council 's adult education provision <p> Jude Burke <p> 10:00 , May 1 , 2016 <p> 1 <p> Three more colleges have had concerns raised over their finances , alongside Wakefield council 's adult education provision , according to the latest reports from the FE Commissioner . <p> The reports for Telford College of Arts and Technology ( TCAT ) , Richmond upon Thames College ( ) , Warrington Collegiate , and Wakefield District Council were published on April 21 , following visits by the Commissioner , Dr David Collins ' ( pictured ) , team to each of them between December and February . <p> His report into TCAT recommended placing the college in administered status . <p> Dr Collins ' advisers visited the college from December 7 to 11 after it was issued with a financial notice of concern by the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) in November . <p> He said in his report that " the college has experienced a rapid decline in its financial health in recent years " . <p> In his letter to TCAT chair Rick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The financial recovery plan is incomplete and there are still serious concerns over financial planning and forecasting . " <p> Jo Lomax , TCAT 's interim principal , whose appointment was one of a number " significant changes " to its senior management following Dr Collins ' visit , said the college had been " disproportionately affected " by funding cuts to adult education provision . <p> " We welcome the support from the FE Commissioner in helping us to overcome difficulties , " she added . <p> The FE Commissioner 's intervention at came after the college was assessed as inadequate for financial health for 2015/16 by the SFA . <p> In his report , dated January 2016 and based on a visit by his team from December 7 to 11 , Dr Collins said the college 's ratio was too high , and reducing it could save the college ? . <p> As a result , he recommended that " the college should revisit its decision not to take forward further staff restructuring during 2015/16 " . <p> An spokesperson said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The college 's strategy " is supported by a robust financial plan which will deliver outstanding financial health through continual review of revenue opportunities and management of costs , " she added . <p> Dr Collins ' involvement at Warrington Collegiate was also prompted by a judgement of inadequate financial health by the SFA in November . <p> In his report , based on a visit by his team from December 15 to 17 , the FE Commissioner praised the " prompt action " taken by new principal Nichola Newton . <p> Ms Newton said the report was " not reflective of the college 's current position " and that feedback they had received from his team , who revisited the college on April 26 and 27 , " indicates good progress against all the recommendations " . <p> The Commissioner 's report on Wakefield District Council 's Adult and Community Education Service ( ACES ) , based on a visit by his team from February 23 to 25 , said that subsequent action taken by the council after the service had been branded inadequate by Ofsted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said " there is no proof so far these changes have benefited learners " . <p> John Wilson , the council 's corporate director for children and young people , said a governing improvement board established " to focus on increasing the speed of improvement in the quality of teaching and performance of learners " was bearing fruit . <p> Main pic : David Collins <p> College and council responses in full : <p> Telford College of Arts and Technology ( TCAT ) TCAT said it had already made significant changes to its senior management team since the Minister of State 's letter , including the departure of principal Chris Scott . Interim principal Jo Lomax said : " These are challenging times in the Further Education sector , particularly for colleges with a large adult education provision , where funding has fallen significantly . <p> " Here at TCAT , we have one of the largest adult education provisions in the region , so we have been disproportionately affected . So we welcome the support from the Further Education Commissioner , in helping us to overcome difficulties that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our quest to ensure that we continue to be a vibrant college playing a positive role in helping great futures to begin for our learners . " <p> The college has this month begun talks with its near neighbour , New College Telford , with a view to a possible merger in line with recommendations from an area review of further education provision . <p> Richmond upon Thames College The college acknowledges the findings of the FE Commissioner endorsing a college led recovery process which started with the arrival of a new leadership team in 2014/15 . <p> We continue to deliver improvements in our financial position reflected in the improved outturn for 2014/15 and are committed to delivery of our strategic plan Richmond 2020 . The strategy is supported by a robust financial plan which will deliver outstanding financial health through continual review of revenue opportunities and management of costs . The FE Commissioner 's report fully recognises the significant upside of the college redevelopment which in turn has the full backing from the Greater London Authority . <p> The college welcomes the area review process and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resources but also demonstrably delivers a significant return to the public purse through estate rationalisation , creation of new schools and housing . The corporation board is regularly refreshed and continues to appoint members with considerable industrial and financial expertise , notwithstanding the reports acknowledgement that the chair has considerable capital and estate management expertise . <p> Warrington Collegiate Nichola Newton , Principal and CEO of Warrington Collegiate , said : " The FE Commissioner 's report published only recently was the outcome of a visit from the FE Commissioner 's team in December 2015 and , having made good progress against the recommendations contained within it , is not reflective of the college 's current position . <p> " The FE Commissioner 's team has just completed a follow up visit ( 26th and 27th April ) and , whilst we await the final report , we are very pleased with the positive verbal feedback we have received which indicates good progress against all the recommendations in the original report . We expect to receive the FE Commissioner 's report formally outlining the findings from the follow up visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council John Wilson , corporate director children and young people at Wakefield Council said : " The report confirmed the areas of concern which we had already identified and were already seeking to improve . <p> " Further to the Ofsted report we have established a Governing Improvement Board , with an independent chair to focus on increasing the speed of improvement in the quality of teaching and performance of learners . The board meets fortnightly and we are already seeing improvements in both these areas . " <h> Helen named 
 to propose academic and vocational divide <p> The first skills white paper in a decade will bring an end to mixed provision and make choose between academic courses leading to university or a new technical professional education ( TPE ) route into work , FE Week can exclusively reveal . <p> The document , which it emerged last week had been delayed , is likely to be controversial for fear the plans will create a two-tier system between academic schools and vocational colleges . <p> It will reflect the recommendations of an independent panel , led by Lord Sainsbury and set up by the government to look into TPE reforms , which FE Week understands should be published later this month . <p> Jonathan Simons , head of education for the Policy Exchange group of FE and skills experts , said this could be " hugely significant " for post-16 education particularly for school sixth forms that rival colleges in many areas . <p> " It will mean a dramatic change to the majority of schools ' post-16 provision , where they offer a mixture of A-Levels and vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools pulling out of post 16 provision all together -- particularly if the minimum size of 200 pupils is enforced or promoted for existing schools as well as for new ones , " he told FE Week . <p> FE Week understands there will be 15 TPE routes , delivered either full-time over two years or through an apprenticeship . <p> A three-year course could also be an option , with the first year preparing students to start on TPEs . <p> There will be a substantial work experience element within each college-based TPE " pathway " , within its relevant industry . <p> Bridging courses at the higher levels between academic and vocational pathways is also being considered . <p> FE Week further understands that each of the 15 TPEs will be overseen by a panel of industry experts , potentially by the new Institute for Apprenticeships . <p> Professor Lady Alison Wolf , who is part of Lord Sainsbury 's panel , has been a firm advocate of reforming post-16 education and training . <p> She was highly critical of schools diverting low-attaining pupils onto courses and qualifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression purposes , in her landmark 2011 Review of Vocational Education . <p> The former Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove agreed with her findings , stating that " courses which offer no route to higher levels of education or the prospect of meaningful employment " were " not just unacceptable but morally wrong " . <p> The department for education said last November : " New professional and technical routes will be created , leading up to employment or degree-level study , which will be as easy to understand as academic routes . " <p> Skills Minister Nick Boles also announced on April 29 that schools could soon be fined if they sign students up to inappropriate A-level courses that they later abandon . <p> He evaded a question about the delay to the skills white paper five days later , from Labour 's Gordon Marsden during Commons business , innovation and skills questions , after this was exclusively revealed by FE Week . <p> The shadow skills minister subsequently requested explanation from the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) of the hold-up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of going to press . <p> The Department for Education and BIS also declined to answer FE Week enquiries over the leaked details of the white paper . <p> We understand that the government hopes to publish the white paper ahead of EU referendum purdah restrictions -- -- - <p> Editorial : Simpler at what cost ? <p> The recent schools white paper was essentially geared at simplifying the system by making them all academies . <p> It seems that simplification is planned for post-16 academic and vocational learning . <p> The FE sector 's very own skills white paper will strip away many post-16 qualifications to make way for the introduction of 15 technical and professional education ( TPE ) routes . <p> But in an effort to funnel young people into a university or recognised work-related route the government should avoid creating a two-tier system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about provision below level two as well as bridging courses between the pathways at level two and beyond . <p> And in the creation of 15 routes , Ministers could go as far to seek simplification in accreditation , by tendering for a single awarding organisation for each . <p> It was considered by the previous Secretary of State for the new GCSES and A Levels , but quickly dropped in 2013 . <p> So this might be a once in a generation opportunity to reorganise who accredits TPE routes , but surely the single point of failure problem is unsurmountable ? <p> I HAD tea 
 puts charities in ' conflict of legislation ' <p> Alix Robertson <p> 18:00 , May 6 , 2016 <p> 1 <p> Charities are caught in a " conflict of legislation " over the government 's apprenticeship levy , a senior sector figure has warned . <p> The requirement for charities to ensure their funds are spent directly on their missions will put them in conflict with the levy , according to Beth Brook ( pictured above ) , the chief executive of Fair Train , the group training association for the voluntary and community sector . <p> Speaking at FE Week 's parliamentary debate on the levy in the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday ( May 3 ) , she said : " There seems to be a conflict of legislation charities and charity trustees need to make sure charity funding is spent on beneficiaries , and now we have a tax that is coming in that means that charities then need to be spending their money on something else . " <p> It included contributions from Martin Doel , chief executive of the Association of Colleges ; Mike Cox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providers ; and Gemma Gathercole , head of policy at OCR . <p> The concerns raised by Ms Brook at the debate echoed points raised by the Charity Finance Group ( CFG ) , a third sector body with over one thousand members , in a letter sent to Skills Minister Nick Boles on December 1 , 2015 . <p> Caron Bradshaw , the group 's chair wrote : " Redistribution outside of the charity sector of apprenticeship levy funding could call into question whether money given for public benefit should be allowed to leave the sector in order to subsidise private sector employers and support private benefit . " <p> Mr Boles subsequently " accepted that there were difficulties around volunteering " in a meeting with the CFG in March this year , but " could not immediately offer a solution to this challenge " , according to CFG minutes . <p> The meeting covered a number of issues , including the risk of the levy incentivising charities to employ apprentices in place of volunteers a point that Ms Brook also raised in Westminster on Tuesday ( May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed specifically for the voluntary and community sector , covering fundraising , campaigning , and volunteer management , had also fallen off the agenda , she told legislators . <p> She said : " At the moment there 's no apprenticeship specifically or the voluntary and community sector . " We 've got an issue there with supply and demand we are expecting these organisations to pay the levy but there 's nothing for them to buy . " <p> Furthermore , she said , " neither civil servants nor ministers are referring to the voluntary and community sector in guidance " , while messages have been " conflicting " . <p> She claimed that while the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills ( BIS ) was pushing charities to pay the levy , Rob Wilson , minister for civil society , had been " castigating " them for being inefficient , and urging them to spend less . <p> " Despite raising these issues with both politicians and civil servants , no one within government has even acknowledged them , let alone done anything to engage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the event . <p> " I am not at all confident that the issues will be addressed in advance of the introduction of the levy next year . " <p> Following the debate , shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden wrote to Mr Boles , asking " what discussions he has had with the Cabinet Office on the liability of charities and voluntary organisations to pay the apprenticeship levy " . <p> BIS declined to comment . <p> Palace of Westminster <p> Committee Room 10 , House of Commons <p> Gordon Marsden <p> Shadow skills minister <p> Martin Doel <p> Chief executive of the Association of Colleges <p> Gemma Gathercole <p> Head of policy at OCR <p> Mike Cox <p> Operations director of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers <p> Let 's get 
 London college at risk of administered status <p> A struggling college is in danger of becoming the third in London to be placed into administered status by the FE Commissioner , according to the latest intervention report . <p> Dr David Collins ' team visited Ealing , Hammersmith and West London College ( EHWLC ) in December , after the college had been rated inadequate by Ofsted following an inspection in October . <p> His report , which has now been published , recognised that progress was being made with turning around financial problems , but it warned there was " still much to do " . In addition to an inspection notice of concern , EHWLC has been subject to a Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) financial notice of concern since March 2014 . <p> The commissioner is now due to return to the college for a stocktake visit , at which point he reserves the option " to reconsider administered college status at this stage , if progress is insufficient " , his report warns . <p> If this were to happen , it would become the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Lewisham and Southwark College and Greenwich College . <p> " Clearly there has been significant and much-needed focus on the finances of the college over the last 15 months , " Dr Collins wrote in his report . <p> " The strategy has quite rightly been to remove costs ( mainly staffing ) and rationalise the sites to both reduce costs and provide much needed injections of cash , " he continued . <p> " As a result , the operating out-turns are beginning to turn around , but there is still much to do as income levels continue to fall steeply . " <p> Dr Collins recommended that the college should revisit its year-end forecast out-turn for 2015/16 " as a matter of urgency " . <p> He added : " From this exercise the impact on 2016/17 needs to be modelled along with the impact of the fall in EFA funding , to ensure that sufficient action is taken in 2015/16 to reduce cost levels down to ensure a surplus and cash-generative position in 2016/17 . " <p> However , the commissioner also warned that financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : " The actions and improvements made have resulted in the college now being a financially strong and resilient organisation , which has the learners at the heart of everything we do .

 warns college is failing too many of its students <p> A college hit with two inadequate Ofsted ratings in three years has been told by Skills Minster Nick Boles that it is " failing too many of its students " , following an FE Commissioner report . <p> Dr David Collins ' team visited City College Coventry in February , following its most recent Ofsted inspection in November . <p> The report , dated April 2016 , was published today . <p> In the accompanying letter to college chair , Maggie Galliers , Mr Boles said : " The key finding is that the college is clearly failing too many of its students through a combination of poor teaching and weak curriculum management " . <p> Dr David Collins <p> But he added : " It does , however , have a number of strengths which , deployed vigorously and over time , could turn the institution around . " <p> Today 's report comes after Dr Elaine McMahon took over as interim principal in January , following the departure of previous principal Steve Logan after just 18 months in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same month that the college received a grade three rating from Ofsted . <p> Mr Logan replaced previous interim principal John Hogg , who was appointed following the departure of long-standing principal Paul Taylor in May 2013 after an **27;365;TOOLONG rating from Ofsted in April 2013 . <p> Dr Collins ' report found that Dr McMahon had " made an immediate impact on the health of the college and the coherence of its leadership . " <p> There was " clear evidence " of an " emerging quality culture among senior managers " and " a belief that leaders are now taking more responsibility for improvements " , he said . <p> But he recommended that the college " aim to achieve stability in its key managerial and curriculum posts " and " clarify its strategic direction and its intended stronger vocational character " . <p> The report noted : " The board is clear the FE offer in Coventry is not organised such as to give maximum benefit to students and the local economy . " <p> Dr Elaine McMahon <p> It added : " The college itself is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> There " appear to be no insuperable barriers " to a proposed three-way merger with Henley College and Hereward College , Dr Collins said . <p> He recommended that it worked with the two colleges " to consider methodically a full range of options for creating a robust FE curriculum for Coventry , including relationships with higher education " . <p> Dr Collins praised the college for its " good " financial control , and for acting " appropriately and promptly to address its financial deficit " which resulted in it returning to a satisfactory financial health rating " a year earlier than projected " . <p> While he recommended the college should " rebalance " its board to include " businesses relevant to the college 's vocational curriculum " , Dr Collins noted that " even as it stands it is a strong governing body " . <p> A spokesperson for the college told FE Week that it had been " involved in a fundamental review " of its priorities since November , and had taken advice from a " wide range of stakeholders " including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely useful and constructive and our improvement plan addresses all of the recommendations made in the report , " the spokesperson said . <p> Referring to the line in Mr Boles ' letter about the colleges ' strengths , quoted above , the spokesperson added : " We share that optimism and are working every day to ensure that happens as soon and as effectively as possible .

 devolution , exclusive FE Week analysis of Skills Funding Agency figures published this week has found close to ? ( 20 per cent ) of adult funding , excluding apprenticeships , is being delivered to learners living outside the region in which their provider is based . <p> The average out of area funding for colleges in 2014/15 was 16 per cent , with ten colleges using more than half of their budget for learners not living in their region . <p> This revelation comes after Nick Boles also said in his grant letter to the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) that Adult Education Budget " devolution deals will provide specific localities with the power to make their own funding decisions and it may become less appropriate to let large national contracts spanning multiple geographic areas " . <p> The warning was passed onto providers by SFA boss Peter Lauener when he shared the out-of-area figures and said in his 2016/17 allocation letter to providers that : " As we move to local commissioning and devolution , commissioners will expect local resources to be deployed to support their local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time by provider type , also show more than half ( 58 per cent ) of all private provider learners came from beyond their head office areas which amounts to ? funding . <p> The figures produced a passionate reaction from providers highlighted by FE Week as most vulnerable to the reforms , and bolstered the Association of Colleges ' call for delay to the reforms . <p> Janet Meenaghan , principal and chief executive of New College Stamford , which had 72 per cent of funding for out of region learners , said : " As a college which is sited in the south of Lincolnshire , but located close to the borders of four other counties , devolution poses particular issues for us . <p> " Employers , students and parents do n't recognise boundary lines on maps . They want to access high quality education and training which best suits their needs . " John Taylor , joint managing director at Birmingham-based Access to Music Ltd , which had an even higher proportion of learner funding out of region ( 87 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postcode lottery ' for students studying with us . <p> " We would strongly urge a pause on implementation to allow further consultation . " <p> James Bishop , managing director of West Berkshire-based The Skills Partnership Limited , with 100 per cent out of home region learners , said its administrative hub office location was " generally of secondary importance " . <p> This compared to " establishing if we could demonstrate we were able to respond effectively to a particular region 's priority training requirements " . <p> The highest proportion ( 76 per cent ) for a college was for Eastleigh College , and principal Jan Edrich said : " It 's in the interests of employers and economic growth that this delivery is not compromised by the implementation of overly restrictive commissioning arrangements . " <p> But Dan O'Keefe , managing director at TQ Training , which had 99 per cent out of area learners , said : " We have been based in Northamptonshire for 21 years , and the location was chosen as it 's in the middle of the country , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proposed devolution approach is not dissimilar to regional contracts which existed until 2010 , where providers would have up to nine contracts for each of the nine different regions . " <p> Mark Dawe , chief executive of the Association for Employment and Learning Providers , said : " FE Week 's valuable analysis clearly shows the complexity of local and national provision , which includes specialism and the need to meet the demands of regional and national employers . <p> " It 's very important devolution and the area reviews take account of this . " <p> The Association of Colleges would not be drawn on the matter this week , other than to say : " It is up to each college to decide how they deliver their non-apprenticeship adult courses to ensure the most suitable provision for their students and employers . " <p> But its assistant chief executive Julian Gravatt admitted in Edition 173 he was concerned the government had not finalised how devolution would work for provider groups based in multiple regions . <p> He said : " It would be better to delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> It is unclear the extent that the out of region figures result from subcontracting , but Mr Lauener also told providers : " In understanding the pattern of delivery , you should give specific consideration to the provision you sub-contract and how much of it is outside your immediate commissioning area(s) . <p> " We will share information on where your sub-contracted provision is delivered with areas that have a skills devolution agreement -- -- -- <p> Editorial : Out-of-area but not out-of-time <p> Those of us in FE with even short memories will remember that the Learning and Skills Council ( LSC ) was scrapped , along with 47 local LSC councils , to remove their planning role . <p> It is therefore something of a return to the past with devolution of the Adult Education Budget ( AEB ) , with providers facing even greater learner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us this week expose the challenge new local commissioners will face . <p> When they get their hands on the budget , why would they want to pass it on to providers spending it on learners living in another area ? <p> They wo n't , so in the absence of a national provider funding system we can expect major upheaval , particularly for colleges and training providers based near to area boundaries . <p> The end result may be a better one , with less subcontracting and more focus on colleges , in particular , supporting their local community . <p> But the SFA figures understate the issue , as they are based on the nine regions in England rather than the near 40 commissioning areas . <p> Any provider expecting a degree of stability over the coming years from the ? 1.5bn AEB budget will be sorely disappointed . <p> Devolved commissioning will be complex and the potential for unintended consequences are great . <p> So before opaque chaos reigns , if not delay then let 's at least be sure there is sufficient time for well-run consultations @ @ @ <h> Teaching our children 
 of Squad UK announced for Gothenburg 2016 <p> Billy camden <p> 18:00 , May 13 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> A team of the country 's most skilled young people have been selected to represent the UK at EuroSkills 2016 , but what is its purpose and what benefits can it have on our competitors ? Billy Camden investigates <p> Twenty of the country 's top apprentices and learners will be going for gold at Gothenburg 2016 , after being selected for Team UK . <p> They will compete against the most talented young people , under the age of 25 , from more than 30 European countries in more than 35 different skill areas ranging from gardening and stonemasonry to bricklaying and web design . <p> This year 's competition , taking place from December 1 to 3 in Sweden , will be celebrated as more of a " highpoint " event for the competitors than ever before . <p> Ben Blackledge , director of education at WorldSkills UK , the organisation that oversees the selection process for the British WorldSkills team , told FE Week : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be celebrated accordingly . <p> " So , while EuroSkills will still be used as a preparation event for WorldSkills , it will also be used as a motivational event for the team and highlighted as a highpoint in the training process they go through . <p> " We are only sending our young people who we think will do the best .

 warned as scams on the rise again <p> Colleges have been warned to be on their guard against " sophisticated " fraudsters , after a scam involving fake faxes was detected by staff at one provider in London . <p> The Mary Ward Adult Education Centre nearly fell victim to the con last week , before the college 's bank contacted them to question a suspicious payment . <p> A fraudster had sent a fax requesting a ? 4,437 clearing house automated payment system ( CHAPS ) payment after researching the college 's personal bank details , which are in the public domain . <p> But Allister Duncan , head of finance and resources at the college ( pictured ) , explained : " Thankfully the bank picked up on the questionable nature of the instruction and queried it with us . " <p> However , he warned : " It may well be that whoever is behind this may try this on with other colleges .

If the sum was in the tens of thousands of pounds it is likely to raise questions , so this is quite a clever and sophisticated pitch . " <p> The Education Funding Agency ( EFA ) also sent out an alert on May 26 , warning that customers of an attempted scam involving Portakabin Ltd , which makes portable buildings often used by schools and colleges . <p> It said : " We have been advised by Portakabin Ltd that some of their customers may have received a fraudulent letter about a change to their bank account details . <p> " The letter is attempting fraud and , if you have received one , you should ignore any instructions . " <p> Portakabin told FE Week it had been able to flag up the attempt internally and report it to the bank being used by the fraudster . <p> Company director James Robinson said : " As a precaution , we immediately alerted all our customers , even though the bank account no longer existed .

 is ' even now ' unsure of traineeships direction <p> FE Week held a lively debate on the future and purpose of traineeships at the Palace of Westminster last week featuring high profile panellists from across the sector . <p> The event took place on Tuesday ( June 7 ) and speakers included shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden , Association of Employment and Learning Providers chief executive Mark Dawe , OCR 's head of policy for FE and funding Gemma Gathercole , and Jean Duprez , the director at Duprez Consulting . <p> Traineeships were launched three years ago , as part of the government 's drive to help low-skilled young adults onto apprenticeships . Their main aim is to steer people away from long-term unemployment , through guiding them onto other training or even straight into a job . <p> The debate , which came hot on the heels of an FE Week front-page story exposing low progression rates from traineeships to apprenticeships , showed there are still many questions to be resolved around this provision . <p> Mr Marsden , who also hosted the event , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having introduced this good traineeships concept ... they have effectively frittered three years away by failing to promote , failing to explain and failing to target traineeships . <p> " Even now , they are still , it appears , unsure of the direction that they want to take .

" <p> John Hyde <p> There were 19,400 traineeship starts in 2014/15 , an increase of 86.3 per cent on the previous academic year , when concern was raised about the disappointingly low level of interest in the courses . <p> But a Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) response to our Freedom of Information request showed that just 450 ( nine per cent ) of 5,200 traineeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year . <p> Overall progression to apprenticeships for all ages stood at just 22 per cent , with the rest moving on to jobs , further full-time education or other training . <p> It raised questions over the confused purpose of traineeships and provoked Richard Atkins , the former Association of Colleges ( AoC ) president , who called last year for traineeships to be converted into specific pre-apprenticeship programmes , to demand a review . <p> Gordon Marsden <p> But , Mr Dawe said during the debate : " It is n't a pre-apprenticeship programme . <p> " Traineeships are part of it , but it 's about getting these individuals active again and through to further learning , or it 's just getting them into employment and engaging them . " <p> Ms Gathercole highlighted the results of a traineeship pilot three years ago from OCR , which sponsored the debate . <p> It showed that the majority of trainees moved back into FE after their courses were completed . <p> She said : " We have an education and training system that is in flux at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vocational qualifications , or apprenticeships . <p> " I think potentially this traineeship programme is a victim of those other things .

 calling for every major multi-academy trust to include a UTC <p> Ofsted 's chief inspector is set to call on the government to insist that every major multi-academy trust ( MAT ) includes a university technical college ( UTC ) . <p> Sir Michael Wilshaw will speak out on the issue during his speech , starting at 1:30pm today , at the Festival of Education . <p> He will say : " The government should insist that every major multi-academy trust should have a UTC . <p> " Every multi-academy trust should be inspected to ensure that the UTC does not become a dumping ground for the difficult or disaffected and that it delivers high quality pre-apprenticeship programmes to the age of 19 . " <p> Sir Michael Wilshaw previously told MPs on the education select committee in March that school and UTC clusters provided a " really great opportunity " to ensure high quality vocational education . <p> He said at the time : " If I was running one of those I 'd have primary schools , I 'd have secondary schools and I 'd have a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this latest call for the 14-to-19 vocational institutions to be part of the furniture in all MATs will be seen as further indication of his support for UTCs becoming integral to the delivery nationwide of skills training . <p> The chief inspector 's speech at the festival in Wellington College , Berkshire , will also reflect on school leavers ' general lack of vocational skills . <p> Sir Michael will ask : " What about those youngsters who would benefit from a technical education ? <p> " What about those employers who , year after year , say that school leavers are not equipped with the technical skills that they are crying out for ? " <p> He will refer to the latest figures as " shocking " , saying : " In the UK as a whole there are now 210,000 vacancies as a consequence of skills shortages across the economy an increase of 43 per cent from 2013 . <p> " I have taught in disadvantaged communities for most of my professional life . And I can tell you that there will always be some children who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Sir Michael 's support for UTCs comes after FE Week reported in May that UTC Lancashire would be the fourth of its kind to close , since they launched in 2010 . <p> Central Bedfordshire UTC announced in March that it would close in August after admitting it had not been able to attract " sufficient pupils " . <h> Republic of Ireland 
 boss accuses government of distorting market against ITPs <p> The government has been accused of " distorting the market " against independent training providers with its post-area review support package for colleges by a sector leader . <p> Mark Dawe , the new boss of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , has now demanded a " level playing field " for public and private providers alike , on the eve of his first conference . <p> He told FE Week : " All we are looking for in AELP is a level playing field and all providers having the same opportunities , whether college or independent training provider , private or charitable . <p> " We are concerned that the government is providing financial assistance to colleges to help set up apprenticeship organisations in direct competition with independent training providers . <p> " In some cases this feels like it is the government distorting the market and potentially providing state aid in an inappropriate manner . " <p> He pointed out that providers of all stripes were facing unprecedented change , and that it would be " appropriate " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With 76 per cent of the apprenticeships delivery , you would have thought the government would be keen to support ITPs as much as colleges through this transformation . " <p> The government 's post-area review support package includes transition or consultancy grants of up to ? 100k to help colleges " access the best change management skills " , according to guidance published by the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills in April . <p> The cash is available for " each significant change resulting from an area review " , such as a significant curriculum rationalisation , establishment of " a shared services arrangement " , or " the establishment of a joint venture " such as a merger . <p> Two of the three area reviews to have completed so far -- Sheffield City , and Birmingham and Solihull have included proposals for the colleges involved to develop a joint apprenticeship company . <p> Loan funding from the government 's restructuring facility is also on offer for colleges to help them implement recommendations from the area reviews . <p> The fund is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a substantive area review recommendation " and " unable to fund the change themselves " , according to guidance published last month . <p> Commenting on this restructuring facility , Mr Dawe said : " If colleges are considered unsustainable in their current form , they should be offered not just to other colleges but to ITPs and others with the same financial incentives that are being offered through this fund for example , loan support and loan write offs . " <p> He added : " There should be a prospectus for sale for every college in this situation . " <p> A BIS spokesperson said : " The restructuring facility is there to support the implementation of recommendations from the area reviews . <p> " It 's focused on FE and sixth form colleges because this reflects the focus of the area reviews themselves .

 of apprenticeship levy says new provider register will be a level playing field to ' let the employer choose ' <p> Jude Burke <p> 22:30 , Jun 27 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> The government 's director of levy implementation has sought to reassure AELP delegates over the new register of apprenticeship providers , telling them it will be open to providers that are " best placed " to deliver . <p> But Keith Smith , who heads up the levy implementation team at the Department for Business , Innovation and Skills , was unable to give any detail about what the criteria for the new register will be , despite being pressed for it by FE Week 's editor Nick Linford . <p> It comes after Mr Smith told delegates at FE Week 's Annual Apprenticeship Conference ( AAC ) in March that the government would be consulting on a new set of criteria for providers who want to deliver apprenticeships . <p> He told delegates at today 's conference that providers who currently subcontract would " absolutely " be able to access the new register , in response to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central to what we need , " he said . <p> " For me it 's about who 's best placed to do the right programme . <p> " If that 's employers who want to take control , great . If it 's new providers coming onto the market , great . If it 's the current stock of providers that want to offer their good quality offer , great . All of those things are great . <p> " Everyone can come forward equally , level playing field , and let the employer choose , " he continued . <p> But when asked by FE Week 's editor Nick Linford about the consultation promised in March , Mr Smith was unable to provide any detail . <p> Alongside the existing " old stuff " around due diligence , capacity and capability , Mr Smith said the register would include " some new stuff around quality " . <p> He added : " That 's particularly the bit we want to make sure we 've got absolutely right " . <p> The consultation which Mr Smith said was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build this around the best that you do " . <p> He continued : " What we want to do is find is find a simple , fair way to test everybody about the sorts of things you know is what should happen in a good performing or high performing college or training provider . <p> " We wo n't make any decisions on the detail or the substance of it until we 've engaged on that conversation with you . " <p> In March , Mr Smith told AAC delegates that he would " no longer be the middle man " and employers would be able to contract directly with training providers once the levy is introduced in April 2017 . <p> He said the new register of training providers was needed because " what employers are telling us really clearly is , we need to know bits of information about the providers ... we actually want to get some confidence that these providers are going to deliver a certain set of services to us " . <p> At the time , Mr Smith promised the consultation on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , early summer time " . <h> Quick links <h> 
 Conference : Shadow minister hits back at lack of progress <p> Paul Offord <p> 17:28 , Jun 28 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> Shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden has accused the government of wasting three years that should have been better spent promoting and targeting traineeships . <p> He told AELP conference delegates on Monday ( June 27 ) that the original concept for traineeships when they were launched three years ago that of improving job prospects for young people who have slipped through the education and training net was a good one . <p> But he felt they should have been targeted more carefully at preparing learners for good quality apprenticeships . <p> Mr Marsden said : " I was a very strong supporter of traineeships when they were originally introduced by the government . <p> " It was the right concept , but ministers have frittered away three years failing to promote it , failing to explain it , and failing to target . Even now they are unsure of the direction they want to go with them . <p> " Are they entry points to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down by Job Centre Plus or are they stepping stones for achieving apprenticeships ? " <p> The criticism follows calls for a review over the purpose of traineeships after FE Week revealed shockingly low progression levels to apprenticeships . <p> The government repeatedly refused to answer questions about how many young people had progressed from traineeships to apprenticeships so FE Week obtained the figure through a Freedom of Information request to the Skills Funding Agency . <p> The figures showed that just 450 ( nine per cent ) of 5,200 completions for 19- to 24-year-olds in 2014/15 started an apprenticeship . <p> The figure was slightly higher for under 19s with 2,280 ( 31 per cent ) of 7,400 completions progressing -- but it still meant that overall progression to apprenticeships stood at just 22 per cent . Publicly available statistics provide only overall " positive " progression numbers to a job , apprenticeship , further full-time education or other training . <p> " You want to be able to use the funding to do something useful for those young people , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a key point of entry to get far more young people competitive as a starting point for high quality apprenticeships . <p> " The lack of promotion or a clear strategy is in my view hindering that progress . <p> " They must be progressive . If they are not , we are in danger of having some of the issues seen in the 1980s , where a generation of young people felt like hamsters never quite getting to the top of the wheel . " <p> He called for a " joined up situation , which takes me onto careers advice in schools " . <p> " I regard the complete inadequacy of careers advice over the last three to six years in schools to be one of the government 's biggest failings , " he added . <p> When asked last month to respond to concerns about low progression to apprenticeships , a Department for Business , Innovation and Skills spokesperson said : " We will continue to expand traineeships to create opportunities up and down the country so we can help as many young people as @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> New Citroen C3 
 Conference : Hottest topic was impact of vote to leave the EU <p> Key sector figures have urged the government to continue with its apprenticeship reforms following Thursday 's Brexit vote and warned of the consequences if it does n't . <p> The vote by the British public to leave the European Union came after a speech by skills minister Nick Boles on June 13 raised concerns that such a verdict could kill off the apprenticeship levy . <p> It has already led to the resignation of prime minister David Cameron , on Friday , and a mass exodus from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn 's shadow cabinet on Sunday . <p> Mark Dawe , chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , was among those who argued it was now more important than ever to press ahead with its apprenticeship plans . <p> He said : " If anything , the referendum result means that a skilled British workforce will be needed more than ever , so the target of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 takes on a new significance . " <p> Mr Dawe also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its levy plans . <p> He said : " I can understand they 'll pause for a moment and think , but if we do n't know what 's going to happen it 's going to by default not happen in April . " <p> While she said it could be a " long time before you see the impact " of the referendum vote , she warned that " any delay regarding the detail is only going to frustrate providers even more and employers as well " . <p> Their views were echoed by Professor Alison Wolf , who made the case for an employer levy to fund apprenticeship training in a report published days before the government first unveiled the charge last July . <p> She told FE Week that " skills policy has become more important than ever " in the light of the referendum result . <p> She said : " One argument for the apprenticeship levy was that firms had cut back their training expenditures over the years , in part because they found it cheaper and easier to use skilled migrant/immigrant labour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to opt out of the free movement of labour within Europe " the need to increase our skilled , level three apprenticeship numbers will be more pressing than ever " . <p> But Gordon Marsden , shadow skills minister , warned that if companies ' " collaboration and cooperation with European companies in building things and winning contracts was being diminished , then obviously either their ability to or their need to recruit more highly skilled apprenticeships could become quite volatile . " <p> Martin Doel , chief executive of the Association of Colleges , pressed the government to " make it clear as soon as possible how it will continue to fund education and training for the good of everyone . " <p> And Shakira Martin , National Union of Students vice president for FE , cautioned that if the levy were scrapped " we 're going to see the aspirations of so many young people wanting to get into training and work squashed " . <p> She urged : " The government should be assuring young people that they have a future in the UK 's skilled workforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadhim Zahawi , the prime minister 's apprenticeship adviser , said the " apprenticeship levy and the enhancement of our nation 's skills is a central government policy , and this will continue to be the case . " <p> Others have raised concerns over the impact of the Brexit vote on the ESF cash the UK receives from the EU for skills training . <p> Sue Pember , director of policy and external relationships at HOLEX , urged the government to " stabilise their policy " around ESF-funded activities . <p> She said : " These funds have provided vital support for our adult education students and they will need to be replaced . " <p> A spokesperson for the University and Colleges Union ( UCU ) said that colleges received " significant funding " from the ESF , and called on the government to " act quickly to quell uncertainty and set out its plans for sustainable further education funding now and in the future " . <p> Janet Clark , education policy adviser at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , said that it would be against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will depend on what happens to the economy " . <p> The interview starts 
 private sector will ' asset strip ' colleges <p> Jude Burke <p> 22:54 , Jun 30 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> The FE sector could be facing a " fire sale " of FE colleges , according to shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden , after a leaked government report indicated that they could be sold off to the private sector . <p> A draft document seen by FE Week , called ' Framework for due diligence in the FE sector following area reviews ' , looks ahead to a post-area review world for colleges . <p> The most worrying section was titled ' Acquisition of an FE college by a private sector organisation ' . <p> It reads : " Private sector organisations such as private training providers may be interested in the acquisition of FE colleges . <p> " They may have different benchmarks and parameters as to what is acceptable in terms of both curriculum and financial performance of the college involved . " <p> After learning of the report , Mr Marsden said : " It 's alarming that people are already turning their minds to how they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates to whoever . It would be wrong if BIS was just able to run a fire sale . " <p> The document , dated June 2016 , also raised questions about the impact of private sector involvement on colleges ' VAT exemptions . <p> It said : " There is a significant and increasing number of private sector organisations operating in FE . <p> " Not all providers are exempt from VAT and collaborative arrangements with providers could have a significant impact financial models . <p> " Mergers , joint ventures and other collaborative arrangements could alter the status of the provider . This needs to be investigated . " <p> The news comes in the same week as a report by London Work Based Learning Alliance called for a level playing field among providers in London , and warned against a state owned monopoly . <p> BIS guidance , published in March , revealed for the first time that the government is planning to introduce an insolvency regime for colleges . <p> It said that , following the area reviews , the government planned no longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow them to go bust . <p> When FE Week asked the Association of Colleges ' chief executive Martin Doel about the principle of private sector firms buying up colleges , he reacted with alarm . <p> " Private organisations should not be able to asset strip colleges ' buildings and facilities or pick and choose students or courses according to how much profit they might generate , " he said . <p> " Any private sector organisation that wanted to buy a college must be required to adhere to the same rules as a college already does and meet the same duties and responsibilities to students , staff and community . " <p> But Mark Dawe , the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ' chief executive , who has previously called for a level playing field for all providers , said : " If the government is genuinely looking for the right solution to give a long term sustainable future to a failing college , it should be open to consider all propositions . " <p> FE Week contacted a number of private equity firms to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous education investment portfolios , but they all declined to comment ( see table ) . <p> The University and Colleges Union , which published a report in 2012 calling for greater regulation of private equity firms in the education sector , warned against such firms getting their hands on FE colleges . <p> A spokesperson warned that private equity firms in America had been " shown to offer derisory rates of graduation , crushing levels of debt and of course dubious value " . <p> She added : " We see little merit in allowing them greater access to the UK education sector . " -- -- -- <p> Editorial Keep profit out of colleges <p> What should the government do when a college goes bust ? <p> This is n't a hypothetical scenario , as it happened to K College in 2013 . <p> After tens of millions in bail-outs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and open days to the five campus assets and contracts . <p> No deal was done , but subsequently two neighbouring colleges have successfully taken over the sites and provision . <p> What this showed was that with government support , the college sector was capable of rescuing and restructuring itself . <p> And there should be more college takeovers like this where needed forced if necessary . <p> Every community deserves a not-for-profit college and the tax paying public should expect it to be financially efficient . <p> Both should be possible . <p> So when colleges go bust the first in the queue with a rescue plan should n't be those with profit motives . <p> It should be successful colleges , with short-term financial support where needed . <h> Juno 's first 
 back widening role of new Careers &amp; Enterprise Company <p> A long-awaited MPs ' report has called for the government to consult on handing over control of the National Careers Service ( NCS ) to the new Careers &amp; Enterprise Company . <p> The document by the House of Commons Sub-Committee on Education , Skills and the Economy , which follows an enquiry launched in December , was published today . <p> It reported concern about overlaps between the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) -run NCS , which supports young people through a network of careers advisers and its website , and the company launched last summer to get private firms more involved with guiding school and college students . <p> The MPs called for a more joined-up approach that would see all " government-funded careers initiatives ... brought under the umbrella of the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company " . <p> " We recommend that the government consult on transferring responsibility for the NCS from the SFA to the company , " the report said . <p> The SFA , Department for Education , and the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they agreed with the proposal . <p> But Claudia Harris ( pictured ) , chief executive of the new organisation , said : " It is critical for young people that careers and enterprise support is easy to navigate . <p> " We agree with the sub-committee 's findings that strong coordination is essential and schools and colleges must be supported in accessing the different services available to them . " <p> Education and Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah said : " The government strategy for improved careers education , due to be published later this year , will provide a roadmap for this parliament and set out what we want to achieve by 2020 . " <p> He also conceded that " careers education varies hugely " across the country . <p> " That is why we have made it mandatory for all schools and colleges to secure independent careers guidance for all 12 to 18 year olds , and are investing ? 90m over this parliament to transform careers education and guidance including funding the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company , " he said . <p> The sub-committee report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Careers England , told members that the NCS 's " inspiration agenda was ' exactly the same ' as the work the Careers &amp; Enterprise Company was doing " . <p> The Science , Engineering , Manufacturing and Technologies Alliance , it added , saw " no real reason for the continued existence of the NCS as a separate entity " . <p> The 40-page document did , however , point out that those running the two organisations had insisted they fulfilled different roles . <p> The point was made by Skills Minister Boles , who the report recalled , told the committee : " The NCS is basically a series of contracts . <p> " It has a single unified website ... but in terms of the provision of direct advice , it is a series of contracts . <p> " One of the whole points about the Careers and Enterprise Company was to have a business-led organisation that was in charge of the process of bringing businesses much more into the heart of school life .

 ever Ofqual fine to an awarding organisation over thousands of late results <p> Alix Robertson and Paul Offord <p> 13:16 , Jul 6 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> Ofqual has announced that its ' first ever fine to an awarding organisation will be for City &amp; Guilds , over the late issuing of more than 22,000 results . <p> The qualifications and exams regulator published a notice of intention to impose the ? 38,000 financial penalty yesterday . <p> An Ofqual spokesperson confirmed to FE Week this " would be the first occasion we have fined an awarding organisation if it goes ahead " , under powers granted back in 2012 . <p> The notice stated that 22,229 late results were issued between the middle of March and the end of May last year . <p> It said : " On February 1 , 2015 , City &amp; Guilds identified an incident that resulted in it becoming aware , on or around February 16 that it could fail to issue results for certain qualifications ( including paper-based Functional Skills ) in accordance with its published timescales . <p> " On approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results in accordance with its published timescales for these qualifications , " it added . <p> The awarding organisation notified Ofqual on April 17 and " thereafter maintained frequent and effective communications about its management of the incident " , before it was resolved from June 5 and " results thereafter were issued in accordance with published timescales " . <p> An Ofqual investigation followed , which resulted in it criticising City &amp; Guilds for taking more than two months to report the incident . <p> The notice said this prevented the regulator from " exercising regulatory supervision of the response to an emerging incident to ensure that action is taken to mitigate potential prejudice to learners and to minimise the detrimental impact on public confidence in regulated qualifications " . <p> But it did say in mitigation that City &amp; Guilds has " to date had a good history of compliance " with Ofqual 's conditions ; has " co-operated fully with Ofqual 's investigation of the incident " ; and has " not benefited financially from the incident " . <p> A City &amp; Guilds spokesperson said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pleased to have cooperated fully with Ofqual to bring the situation to a close . We have also taken a number of steps to minimise the risk of such a situation happening again " . <p> The awarding organisation , which offers over 600 qualifications in a range of subjects in the UK , including over 100 apprenticeships , still has the opportunity to make representations in respect of the proposed fine , provided it is submitted by August 5 . <p> Ofqual 's own guidance on its fines regime for awarding organisations states : " We can impose a monetary penalty ( a fine ) on an awarding organisation if it appears , on the evidence available to us , that it has breached a condition of its recognition . <p> " A fine may be for an amount up to 10 per cent of an awarding organisation 's annual turnover . This limit applies to each fine we decide to impose and is not a cumulative limit for a financial year . <p> " We will decide what the appropriate amount of the fine should be taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No further details about the circumstances surrounding the late results was provided in the notice , and Ofqual and City &amp; Guilds both declined to provide more information . <h> Battle of Stamford 
 committee rejects Spielman as next chief inspector <p> An influential committee of MPs has rejected the government 's proposal of Amanda Spielman to become the next chief inspector of Ofsted . <p> Ms Spielman , who is chair of Ofqual , was put forward for the role last month by Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , who named her as the government 's preferred candidate to succeed Sir Michael Wilshaw . <p> But following a pre-appointment hearing on June 29 , a House of Commons Education Committee report raised " significant concerns " , criticising Ms Spielman 's lack of " passion for the role " and the fact she has not worked as a teacher before , spending much of her career in corporate finance . <p> It provoked a firm defence of her suitability by Ms Morgan , but she declined to say for certain whether or not she would now press ahead with the appointment . <p> Chair of the Education Committee Neil Carmichael said : " The government 's preferred candidate has a broad range of experience , but failed to demonstrate to us the vision and passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say although Ms Spielman had good experience of secondary schools , her understanding of early years , primary education , FE , and children 's services seemed lacking . <p> He added : " Ms Spielman 's responses on child protection were particularly troubling and did not inspire confidence that she grasped the importance of Ofsted 's inspections in preventing children being held at risk through service failure . " <p> Education Secretary Nicky Morgan refuted all of this . <p> She said : " Ms Spielman has a proven track record as a leader and huge experience in education . <p> " I chose her because I believe she will be a highly effective leader and where necessary challenge schools , local authorities and government where education and social care services are not meeting standards our children deserve . " <p> But she added : " I will now consider their report and respond in due course . " <p> A DfE spokesperson added : " Her understanding of the role , vision , leadership abilities and commitment to raising standards have been tested at each stage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panel and overseen by the Cabinet Office and Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments " . <p> Martin Doel , chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said : " While there may have been concerns that she has never been a teacher , we have had a series of chief inspectors at Ofsted who had little or no experience of FE . <p> " In this context , Ms Spielman 's lack of detailed knowledge did not seem problematic . " <p> Mark Dawe , chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ( AELP ) , added : " While we respect the committee 's concerns , our view is that the government should go ahead with Ms Spielman 's appointment because we believe that she has done a very good job at Ofqual . <p> " As for the committee 's desire for passion , some of the previous chief inspectors have had this in abundance and if misdirected , it 's not always a good thing . " <p> He was critical of current chief inspector Sir Michael for allowing " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he told MPs in March that he believed 16- to 19-year-olds should be taught in schools rather than colleges , and the FE sector was " in a mess " . <p> Ms Spielman 's case is not the first example of a select committee choosing not to support the government 's preferred candidate for a particular post . <p> In 2009 , Maggie Atkinson , the then director of children 's services at Gateshead Council , was put forward as the preferred candidate for Children 's Commissioner and appointed by Ed Balls , despite a negative report from the Children , Families and Schools Committee . <p> In 2011 , the Justice Select Committee declined to endorse the appointment of Diana Fulbrook as HM Chief Inspector of Probation . This led to Liz Calderbank being appointed on a temporary basis instead . <p> And in 2012 the Business , Innovation and Skills Committee declined to endorse the appointment of Les Ebdon , the preferred candidate , as director of the Office for Fair Access .

Providers will have to meet strict criteria to be included on the register , which will then be used by employers looking for training for their apprentices . <p> The guidance issued by the government emphasises the desire of ministers to put employers in the driving seat , and has some big ramifications for subcontractors and other " middle men " in the contracting process , along with colleges or independent providers which have had less-than-favourable run-ins with Ofsted or the Skills Funding Agency ( SFA ) . <p> Here are some of the key points from the government guidance ... <h> Inadequate providers will escape a ban from the register if their apprenticeship provision is rated above a grade four <h> There are a lot of reasons why a provider could be removed from the register <p> The government says it will remove providers from the register is they or any of their directors , governors , senior employeers or shareholders meets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suspicion of fraud or irregularity , or possible failure to comply with conditions of funding under an existing funding agreement or subcontract . <p> Withdrawal of funding following the failure to comply with a Notice of Withdrawal of Funding , or failure to remedy a serious breach of contract within the last three years . <p> Information from awarding bodies identifying significant irregularities in the award of qualifications within the last three years . <p> Previous activities have resulted in significant repayment of SFA or government funding within the last two years ( ? 100,000 or 5 per cent of contract value , whichever is the higher ) . This also includes funding paid to a subcontractor to deliver education and training services funded by the SFA . <p> Failure to repay funding due to the SFA or other government body , in excess of ? 50,000 . <p> Failure to repay funding due under a subcontract to deliver education and training services funded by the SFA in excess of ? 50,000 . <p> Two or more instances where the SFA or its agents has audited the provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is non-compliance with conditions of funding within the last two years . <p> Early termination of a funding agreement or a subcontract to deliver education and training services funded by the SFA within the last three years . <p> This also applies to providers which have key personnel who were previously a director , governor , senior employee or shareholder in " another organisation where one or more of the above criteria apply " . <h> New standards for quality of apprenticeship delivery could be introduced <p> The government is working with the Institute for Apprenticeships in looking to introduce " standards associated with the quality of a provider 's actual delivery " , which will enable the DfE to remove from the register any providers which fall below those standards . <p> Ministers also want to " explore the role that employer feedback can play in informing a provider 's status on the register " . <h> Smaller subcontractors will have to be on the register <p> Any organisation wanting a role in delivering apprenticeship training from next May will have to apply to be on the register . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 100,000 of SFA-funded provision each year do not need to apply . <p> Howerver , managing agents , intermediary bodies , consortium leads , brokerage organisations or " any other similar entity that does not itself deliver education and training to apprentices " will not be eligible to join . <p> The government claims this is being done to foster direct relationships between employers and training providers . <h> In fact , the whole subcontracting system is changing <p> The government claims that the current model of providers funding other providers to deliver a number of apprenticeships , often to employers that the original provider has no relationship with , is " redundant " . <p> The DfE is proposing that providers be able to supplement their own delivery by bringing in expertise from supporting providers to deliver parts of apprentices , but the expectation will be that the main provider delivers " significantly more than half of each apprentice 's training " and maintains the relationship with the employer " at all times " . <h> Employers who want to provide their own apprenticeship training to staff wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The government has said the route for would-be employer-providers would require them to meet " the same quality criteria " , but that other criteria would be " proportionate and appropriate " . <p> For example , the DfE would not ask employer-providers to " confirm details of legislation they will be complying with through their employment of the apprentices " . <p> The government has n't specified which specific pieces of legislation the document is referring to . <h> Some larger businesses wanting to become providers could be subject to a financial health test <p> At the moment , employers with an annual turnover of more than ? 100 million and whose funding from the SFA is less than 5 per cent of that turnover are exempt from the test . <p> But the government is considering a reduction to these thresholds because " they will exceed the turnover of many levied employers " . <h> The proposals have prompted a mixed reaction ... <p> Stephen Evans <p> A spokesperson for the Association of Employment and Learning Providers said : " We understand that the government is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sector but the full implications of today 's proposals need very careful consideration before they are given the green light . In particular , the idea that a provider should be responsible for at least half of the training of every apprentice on its books looks like a misguided approach to addressing the overall issue . <p> " We also want to see consistent criteria applied to different types of provider , such as good financial health . Good finances are a strong indicator of the quality of leadership and management which is likely to have a heavy bearing on the learner experience . " <p> Stephen Evans , deputy chief executive at Learning and Work Institute , said : " The clear emphasis on quality in today 's announcements is welcome . Learning and Work shares the views of many employers who believe apprenticeship quality is just as , if not more , important than quantity . However , I challenge the view that an Ofsted grade alone is the most effective measure to use for the purposes of the new Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers -- measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've called for an Apprentice Charter , designed by employers and Apprentices .

 apprenticeship report warns of history repeating itself over fraud <p> Jude Burke <p> 0:01 , Sep 6 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> The apprenticeship reform programme risks repeating the fraud that plagued Individual Learning Accounts without more robust risk planning , the National Audit Office ( NAO ) has warned . <p> The stark message came in a damning report from the NAO , published today , on delivering value through apprenticeships which revealed the Department for Education ( DfE ) has still has no contingency plan for if levy and funding reforms do not work out as planned . <p> The failure of the Individual Learning Accounts scheme which was scrapped in 2001 after abuse by unscrupulous providers led to a reported ? 67m fraud was blamed on poor planning and risk management by the government . <p> But today 's NAO report raised concern that lessons had not been learned -- as it warned the DfE had not done enough to identify how providers , employers and assessment bodies might react to the apprenticeship reforms , raising the risk of " market abuse " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on behavioural risks , and also ensure it learns lessons from previous initiatives which have not turned out as planned , such as Individual Learning Accounts . " <p> Phil Hyde , one of the team behind the report , told FE Week : " We 've flagged this behavioural risk up as a separate section , because we do think from past experience that this is something that 's very important for them to be on top of . " <p> The report found that although a delivery team had been set up to " consider the risks of fraud and gaming " it was " too early to say what impact this group will have " . <p> It urged the DfE to " do more to understand how employers , training providers and assessment bodies may respond to ongoing reforms , and develop robust ways of reacting quickly should instances of market abuse emerge " . <p> The report urged the government to develop contingency plans for key parts of the reforms particularly the introduction of the levy . <p> But according to the NAO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiatives are progressing sufficiently well that no contingency plans will need to be drawn up before October 2016 " . <p> It said that in July a team had been commissioned " to prepare contingency plans if elements of the programme should not progress as expected " . <p> It continued : " However , the contingency planning for funding reform , including the introduction of the levy , needs to continue to be developed . " <p> Mark Dawe , chief executive of Association of Employment and Learning Providers , said : " The NAO is right to highlight that further progress is needed to manage the risks involved in the reform programme because if we do n't get the transition process right , there 's a real danger that quality of apprenticeships will be adversely affected . " <p> Sally Hunt , University and College Union general secretary , said : " We have to avoid the unfortunate scandals of private for-profit firms ripping off the taxpayer that we have seen in higher education . " <p> Apprenticeships and Skills Minister Robert Halfon said : " Our apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers with high quality apprentices and deliver real benefits to the economy . <p> " The new Institute for Apprenticeships will ensure that apprenticeships are even more closely tailored to the needs of employers .

 investigated head of curriculum 's racist tweets yet he kept his job until FE Week started asking questions <p> Jess <p> 2:15 , Sep 9 , 2016 <p> 0 <p> A curriculum head at one of London 's largest colleges sent a string of racist , homophobic and abusive tweets but was allowed to keep his job despite an internal investigation . <p> Glen Maybury , who was head of leisure , health and public services at the City of Westminster College , used his personal Twitter account to make a number of unpleasant public posts , as well as retweeting a number of Islamophobic and anti-Semitic comments made by others , for several years . <p> According to the college 's senior leadership , a disciplinary investigation was launched in May this year after other members of staff made complaints about Mr Maybury 's conduct . <p> However , while the former curriculum lead is no longer an employee at the college , evidence seen by FE Week appears to prove that he had been allowed to return to his full-time role until at least September 7 this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in touch . <p> Senior staff were told suddenly on September 8 that Mr Maybury would be leaving at " lunchtime " , just a couple of hours after FE Week rang the college , anonymous whistleblowers have said . <p> These same sources confirmed that Mr Maybury had been seen in college this month , though its principal Keith Cowell insisted that this would just have been while he packed up his desk . <p> " I can confirm to you that he is not an employee at the college . He may have been in college to hand over and pick up personal effects . I do n't know what his movements are , but he is not employed by us , " said Mr Cowell . <p> When pressed as to whether Mr Maybury was no longer an employee of the college on the morning of September 8 , Mr Cowell replied : " Yes . Yes . That 's what I said . " <p> Graphic tweets sent by Mr Maybury , seen by FE Week , include him insulting other Twitter users with comments like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , as well as slurs against London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Jewish people , and offensive images of black people and genitalia , which were posted in 2013 . <p> The City of Westminster College , which has 7,000 students at two sites in Paddington and Queen 's Park in north London , is ethnically diverse , with 17 per cent of students coming from an Asian background , seven per cent from an Arab background , and 26 per cent from an African , black or Caribbean background . <p> " When these types of action take place in an institution that is meant to prevent discrimination , radicalisation and promote British values , how can these students have faith in the system ? " asked the whistleblowers , speaking to FE Week . <p> Mr Cowell admitted that a disciplinary process had been launched earlier this year to investigate the incidents , and confirmed that this was " concluded in July " .

 fighting to avoid dropping to a damaging Ofsted grade 3 <p> An Ofsted report into the nation 's largest college has still not been published more than four months after it was inspected due to a row over the result , FE Week has discovered . <p> According to several sources who wish to remain anonymous , NCG ( formerly Newcastle College Group ) is actively disputing the overall grade-three , or ' needs improvement ' , rating it is understood to have received . <p> In public , neither Ofsted nor NCG is commenting on the dispute , which has meant a delay of 118 days and counting to the release of the final report . <p> FE Week understands that the week-long process involving 15 inspectors went smoothly , and that the college had been told to expect a second consecutive overall result of grade two , or ' good ' . <p> Inspections all go through Ofsted moderation , and concerns raised during this process meant the overall grade was lowered to a grade three at best . <p> The delay 118 days when FE Week went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous longest wait for an Ofsted report since the new common inspection framework ( CIF ) was launched last September <p> A delay of this length is especially unusual as Ofsted typically publishes its reports before the complaints procedure has been concluded . <p> In a statement , the spokesperson for NCG simply said : " We are in the quality assurance process . " <p> For its part , Ofsted stated that it " does not comment on an inspection while it is going through quality assurance processes " . <p> The inspectorate 's handbook says , however , that " providers will receive an electronic version of the final report within 17 working days of the end of the inspection " , while " in most circumstances , the final report will be published on Ofsted 's website within 19 working days " . <p> In cases where Ofsted decides that a report " requires further quality assurance , or finds the provider is provisionally inadequate , the provider will usually receive an electronic version of the final report within 26 working days " . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " usually be published within 28 working days " , although Ofsted does not normally delay publication of an inspection report " while complaints are investigated " . <p> This previous longest wait after inspection under the new CIF was 59 days , for a report on Ealing , Hammersmith and West London College . The average wait is just 35 days . <p> This is not the first time NCG has clashed with Ofsted . <p> NCG national achievement rates . Source : Skills Funding Agency <p> FE Week revealed in July 2012 that Ofsted inspectors had been asked to leave Newcastle College , after staff complained of " troubling incidents " during an inspection . <p> Ofsted 's visit had to be cut short , although they returned several weeks later , eventually downgrading the college 's overall rating from grade one to two . <p> The body 's former principal Dame Jackie Fisher is understood to have lodged a formal complaint running to over 600 pages . <p> An inspector subsequently told FE Week that " it was never going to be easy inspecting a college that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , Ofsted has introduced new scrutiny panels for complaints about inspections , but this mechanism is unlikely to have been the cause of the current delay ; a spokesperson for the inspectorate said that such panels " would normally take place following publication of the inspection report " . <p> The delay is more likely down to disappointing recent retention and overall achievement rates . <p> For example , NCG 's overall retention rate for level two 16- to 18 year-olds in 2014/15 stood at 15.6 per cent below the national average for a general further education college , while the overall achievement rate at level three ( formerly known as the success rate ) for that age group was negative 7.5 per cent . <p> NCG insisted that this data was " misleading " because it was " for all NCG provision including national charity Rathbone , which works exclusively with young people not in education , employment or training , and national private training provider Intraining , both of which have national performance benchmarks lower than those of FE colleges . <p> " The disaggregated data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level for FE colleges . <p> " Rathbone and were not in scope for the inspection . was inspected separately in May and provision was found to be grade two .

 Asks : David Hughes becomes fifth chief executive of the AoC <p> Last week saw David Hughes become the fifth chief executive of the Association of Colleges in its 20 year history . <p> Many readers will know that he 's been close to the action ever since joining the Further Education Funding Council in 2000 and more recently as chief executive at the Institute for Learning and Work . <p> I 've known David for over ten years , first clashing over his approach to the distribution of ESOL funding to colleges in London , when I was a Director at Lewisham College and he was the LSC Regional Director . <p> Since then our paths have regularly crossed , such as when he speaks at events and in the pages of FE Week , where he has regularly featured as both a commentator and in the cartoons . <p> David is a well-respected FE leader with plenty of experience and his policy views are well documented . <p> But now he is at the helm of the AoC , this was the first opportunity to quiz him about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed for apprenticeships and skills likely to be wanting to stamp their mark , I started by asking which policies are working and which should be left alone . <p> It 's a tough question because as a sector we tend to focus on the negative impact policies have on further education . <p> " Colleges in particular are dealing with all of that at a time they have been crushed financially over the last eight years . <p> The issue is scale and breadth of change , lack of systemic approach to change process <p> He continues : " I think one of the things the minister needs to do is step back from it and say ' what are the most important changes to be done and over what period ' , and put in a proper change management process " . <p> We move on to talk about the role of the AoC and I ask him about Martin Doel 's reflections article , in which he said he regretted not focussing more on creating a sense of identity for colleges . This , said the outgoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges around . <p> David was quick to defend Martin , saying : " It has always been an issue ever since I 've been in the sector . I 've always thought that part of the reason why FE is overlooked is the simple one , that most of the people in Whitehall did n't participate in FE , in a college . <p> " Therefore they do n't have a good understanding . There have been multiple attempts -- groups and organisations that tried to make the change . <p> " I 'm mildly optimistic that the Sainsbury review could provide a new platform for colleges to have a unique place in the education system ... we need a college in every community that can deliver most , if not all 15 areas : high quality , good relationships with employers , so on . That will become the signature of what the FE sector is about . " <p> Another challenge for any AoC chief executive is clearly representing members when they might disagree with each other . <p> I put this to David and ask if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of large multi-site , multi-age vocational colleges with ? 100million turnover , whilst also representing small sixth form colleges ? <p> " Yes . " he shoots straight back . So I press him further and he admits : " It is challenging . <p> The dynamic of it is not that I sit here and work out what to say in Whitehall , disconnected . Membership organisations are difficult because you have lots of people with different opinions . The focus Martin has achieved over the years is about the key issues common to all or most colleges . <p> " That 's what you do ; go to the 80 per cent and support different interest groups around rural , urban , big , small , and agricultural . It 's a constant job , communicating , working with and supporting people who have made their own submissions . That 's why it 's exciting . Diversity is fun . " <p> But what about the annual cost of AoC membership , which for some colleges is nearly ? 50,000 ? What is his elevator pitch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for not wearing a tie , so a welcome gift seemed appropriate <p> He tells me colleges need to stick together as members because " collectively they 've got a lot of clout , collectively they colleges deliver to millions of people in this country , and collectively they 've got a lot in common . The impact of all of that has shown over the years to be really powerful in Whitehall , with the Treasury , with the Department . <p> " Despite devolution there 's still going to be a strong need to represent the interest of colleges , in Whitehall , regionally and locally , and the AoC does that with colleges , for colleges , by colleges . If we do n't hold onto that collective it 's much easier for colleges to be ignored . " <p> I acknowledge that it was only David 's second day at the helm but go ahead anyway and ask him if there is anything he wanted to say about how he thinks the membership body might now change . <p> To my surprise , although doing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the AoC board calling for an immediate review that might change the AoC services and regional structure . <p> Despite devolution there 's still going to be a strong need to represent the interest of colleges <p> " Part of my first two months before our annual conference in November is to go around every region and see as many members as I can and ask what they want . " he tells me . <p> " The last proper review of the AoC was eight or nine years ago , just before Martin started and a lot has changed since then . It 's a really good time for me starting , the board have said ' let 's do a review ' . <p> " The first part is informally asking the members to say what they think . Then to use the annual conference in November to formalise it a bit more to come up with some proposals . <p> " What do you want and what are you willing to pay for ? We 've got a regional structure which was based on old government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we change it ? <p> " What are the services that need to be local , need to be central , what do people most preciously want to keep , want to do differently ? It 's a great opportunity for me . If you look at what has changed since then , institutions , politics , governments have changed , new prime minister . <p> " The policy landscape looks completely different than it did eight or nine years ago .

 After Ofsted 's thematic review into Prevent found " a worrying number of providers struggling to implement the duty " , Zubeda Limbada and Lynn Davies explain how to spot signs of radicalisation . <p> The actual wording of the Prevent duty on educational institutions is that they need to have ' due regard to the need to prevent people from being drawn into terrorism ' . For the FE sector this has a number of strands being careful about visiting speakers , having a risk assessment policy in place , thinking about internet safety . But one of the most difficult areas is the implied need for surveillance of students , to be able to spot the signs that someone is being radicalised . <p> Mistakes and overreactions over this have been among the reasons the Prevent strategy has been criticised . Is it the job of teachers and lecturers to be policing students ? When is it appropriate for colleges to escalate concerns around extremism by referring students to the government 's Channel scheme ? Is this what ' due regard ' means ? <p> In fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . Just as there is no one path into violent extremism , there is no one set of signals to indicate risk . From our research with former extremists , we 've found that it 's always a combination of behaviours , different for each individual . <p> It 's always a combination of behaviours , different for each individual <p> In our training courses on Prevent , we draw on a useful Behaviour Barometer devised by the Canadian Centre for the Prevention of Radicalisation leading to Violence . This distinguishes between ' insignificant ' , ' troublesome ' , ' worrisome ' and ' alarming ' behaviours . <p> Many behaviours that teachers may wonder about such as increased arguing , dressing in a particular way , being active on social media or becoming more religious or political might be typical of any teenager searching for their identity . When it becomes particularly worrisome is if when there is a combination of some of the following : <p> When a person cuts off ties with friends and family to keep company with a new circle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support violence for a cause ; <p> When they suddenly become uninterested in study or college activities ; <p> When they express hateful views or use derogatory terms towards other individuals or groups , or avoid being with them ; <p> If they are spending time on their computer looking at extremist groups ; or <p> If they are posting pictures of fighters on their Twitter or other accounts . <p> The problem for educators who may additionally worry about potential Ofsted consequences as part of the Prevent duty is that the really alarming signs may not be visible at all . It is at the , ' worrisome ' , stage that a teacher can be particularly insightful , especially if they know a student fairly well , and can start to see changes as they occur . Other students may express concerns too and can be consulted . <p> It is at the , ' worrisome ' , stage that a teacher can be particularly insightful <p> This observational duty has to be set within college procedures , i.e. that there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other people , and for deciding when contacts with parents or authorities should be made . This procedural framework is not just to keep Ofsted happy , but to provide a safety net . <p> Once a concern is noted and fully discussed , institutions should know about the external mechanisms for referral . Through police or FE Regional Prevent Coordinators ( RPCs ) , a student ( or colleague ) may be referred to Channel , the government multi-agency scheme . <p> A local Channel panel will look for three things : engagement , intent , and capability . So if a student simply sounds off or makes extremist or racist remarks , or even sports something as innocuous as a Free Palestine wristband , this is not on its own a reason to think about referral . But some combination of changed behaviours might well be , and it is up to the panel to investigate further . It is important to note that anyone can refer , and parents or relatives do not have to be informed , but that the final participation in the scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whether we can spot radicalisation the answer is not easily . But FE institutions can take the initiative by ensuring their staff have received good Prevent training .

 Skills and apprenticeships were centre stage at one of the party conferences , says Gemma Gathercole , while being relegated to the wings at the other . <p> By any stretch of the imagination it 's been a busy summer , from the referendum to leadership elections to the machinery of government changes . So conference season , at the start of the autumn when almost every part of the further education system is undergoing some form of revision or review should have been the perfect time to discuss these issues . The reality , however , was a tale of two halves . <p> For me the key take-away from the Labour Party conference was an internal message : a lack of focus on the issues of the day , particularly in relation to FE . Arguably , due to the need to restore party unity following a divisive summer , attention was elsewhere . In the exhibition hall , there were fewer corporate exhibitors than even last year ; there appeared to be fewer fringe meetings in general and certainly the MPs were less visible . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gordon Marsden , who appeared to be the hardest working MP across all the fringe events . Gordon attended events covering all parts of his expansive skills , business and higher education brief . No mean feat . <p> However , this extraordinary effort to cover so many events masks an underlying message . The lack of visibility of other MPs indicated a lack of engagement from Labour MPs in general , over key issues that affect education , skills and productivity . <p> The lack of visibility of other MPs indicated a lack of engagement from Labour MPs in general <p> In three years of attending party conferences , we have always struggled to timetable events and to be able to cover the plethora of fringe events ( seminars , debates , workshops and receptions that typically take place across the conference site and host city ) . This year , the number of events that were relevant for us to attend was relatively fewer and where there were a number of events on relevant topics , they tended to clash in the conference plan . <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention from Angela Rayner and none from Jeremy Corbyn . While the broader education system was of course mentioned in their speeches , the lack of reference to approaches to current policy initiatives is a concern . <p> In contrast , at the Conservative conference this week education , skills and especially apprenticeships could n't have been higher on the agenda . As delegates ascended the staircase to the exhibition hall at the ICC , they could not miss the large space dedicated to the apprenticeship zone with FE colleges , apprentices and employers all represented . Within the exhibition hall itself , Pimlico Plumbers put their support for apprenticeships clear on their stand . <p> Within the fringe programme , there was an abundance of events discussing the impact of reform of the further education system . Brexit , social mobility , skills and apprenticeships were the buzzwords of conference . Robert Halfon , the new skills minister , devoted time to meeting apprentices and attended a number of fringe events to discuss his priorities for the role . <p> In her first conference speech as Education Secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apprentice zone , Jessica Shaw from Fujitsu . Justine Greening 's speech stated her intention to make the skills plan a big priority . <p> And there was one reference to apprenticeships in the Prime Minister 's speech ; it may have only been about the target but words are critical real estate in conference speeches and it was important for it to be included . <p> There is clearly much detail still needed from the government about the massive ongoing reform programme for apprenticeships final details on levy implementation being first and foremost in this list , and critically , much more detail on the implementation of the skills plan . <p> But the evidence from Liverpool suggests that challenge on these issues may have to come from the sector rather than the opposition .@@14754598 <h> Older workers must 
 unstoppable rise of management apprenticeships <p> Management is now the third most popular apprenticeship subject , and analysis by FE Week suggests it will rocket to the top spot once the apprenticeship levy kicks in next year . <p> A huge 83 per cent of all 25+ higher apprenticeship frameworks are currently in management , according to the latest Department for Education data . <p> And the number of starts for 25+ higher management apprenticeships in the nine months between August 2015 and April 2016 has already exceeded the total for the previous 12 months , with 4,670 compared to 4,660 . <p> This trend is not a new one . The percentage of all apprenticeships in management frameworks has increased rapidly since 2002/03 , soaring from around one per cent to over 10 per cent for 2015/16 . <p> The rise has accelerated since 24+ apprenticeships were permitted in 2007/08 . <p> When the apprenticeship levy comes into play next April , close to 20,000 employers will have a levy pot and for many , the easiest way to make use of this funding will be to place existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Apprenticeships and skills minister Robert Halfon has recently singled out the importance of higher and degree apprenticeships as a " ladder " to help employers bring in new talent and to improve social mobility . <p> But the popularity of management apprenticeships raises a new question : should large sums of government funding , much of it expected to be generated by the forthcoming levy , go on what is effectively upskilling firms ' existing managers . <p> Mark Dawe , the chief executive of AELP , raised concerns about the trend when FE Week showed him its analysis . <p> " AELP has been hearing from levy-paying employers for some months that their strategic planning in preparation for the levy includes many more apprenticeships at higher levels , in particular management training , " he said . <p> " AELP 's concern is the knock-on consequence of not enough levy money being available for non-levy-payers , and those exceeding their levy pot . <p> AELP 's concern is the knock-on consequence of not enough levy money being available for non-levy-payers , and those exceeding their levy pot <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence to ministers , as we believe any restriction on apprenticeships will have an impact on social justice and productivity . " <p> In July last year , a new apprenticeship standard for a chartered manager degree was launched , following its development by employers such as Barclays Bank , Sainsbury 's and Virgin Media . <p> The Open University is just one of the higher education institutions making the most of this new standard . <p> Its chartered manager degree apprenticeship will cost ? 22,500 per apprentice , highlighting the opportunity that now for universities either public or private to corner this market . <p> With an upper of ? 9,000 for higher apprenticeships and ? 27,000 for degree apprenticeships in all sectors , the management standard is set to be a best seller . <p> According to the CFA Institute , there are 400,000 new managers a year which would amount to around ? 3.6bn . <p> And once the Skills Funding Agency system of allocating funding is removed , there will be no ring-fence for 16-to-18 apprenticeships , meaning that companies could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 or more . <p> Mr Halfon told delegates at this week 's Conservative Party Conference that once the apprenticeship levy is in operation , employers might try to " game the system " , by rebranding existing training in order to claw back as much of their levy contribution as possible . <p> He said : " I 'm not going to deny to you , inevitably there may be some gaming of the system . <p> " But I do n't actually believe it will be widespread . If gaming is widespread ... then of course we would look at it later on and make sure we stop it as much as possible .

 warned off overseas ventures following collapse of AoC India after just four years <p> Colleges should be wary of betting the farm on big overseas ventures and learn the lesson from AoC India , which is to close after just four years , industry experts have warned . <p> AoC India was established in 2012 as a partnership of 33 FE colleges to provide UK-standard vocational education and training programmes to India . <p> Each of the colleges invested ? 20,000 for a two-year membership , but only eight members chose to continue with the project after this initial period . <p> However , as FE Week reported last week , AoC India and its remaining partners agreed to " wind down the partnership from July 2016 " . <p> A spokesperson for the group blamed the lack of enthusiasm on member colleges ' desire to focus on the area review process back in Britain . <p> Tom Bewick , the managing director at New Work Training Ltd and a former chief executive of the International Skills Standards Organisation , told FE Week that colleges entering markets like India is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India had " done its job " . <p> " I do think the AoC was pretty upfront about what it was trying to achieve , in that it was a two-year sort of incubator-style approach to working internationally , " he said . " I think they have come under some unfair criticism . " <p> Despite the colleges ' significant total investment in the project of ? 660,000 , Mr Bewick insisted that the AoC 's involvement was likely to have offered some protection . <p> " I would argue that the colleges chipping in some money and doing it via the AoC actually lowered the risk for all of them , " he said . <p> Mr Bewick also said that government policy was largely responsible for sparking the interest in promoting UK FE overseas . <p> " In 2012/13 there was a lot of ministerial frenzy around the notion of our colleges getting on planes , getting out to Saudi , getting out to India as well . Governing bodies and college leaders were put under quite a lot of political pressure , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious warning to FE to ' stick to the knitting ' <p> Mr Bewick added that in his own consultancy work abroad he has pulled back from areas such as India or Saudi Arabia to focus solely on North America , because he believes " it 's far better to do proper business and commercial relationships with very like-minded cultures and economies " . <p> Mr Bewick 's comments were echoed by Mick Fletcher , a founding member of the Policy Consortium , a director of RCU Ltd , and a senior research associate at the Institute of Education . <p> " From what I see , it AoC India was a well organised attempt to develop a substantial overseas business for English FE , " he said . " There have been numerous scandals in the past involving overseas work , but this is not one of them .

 Rather than creating a regime that makes it easier for colleges to become insolvent , government should be investing more in further education , says Angela Rayner . <p> More than four million people in Britain are learning in the further education sector every year . <p> The sector plays a crucial role in supporting our young people . Those who are seeking qualifications to move on to university . Those learners who , later in life , are retraining and gaining new skills to get better jobs . <p> Also , as I know from my own personal experience , it 's helping those people who did n't get what they needed from the education system the first time around to go further in life . <p> Going into further education after leaving school at 16 was life-changing for me . It enabled me to gain new skills and qualifications so that I could get work and start to fend for myself and my baby son . <p> Going into further education after leaving school at 16 was life-changing for me <p> Most of all , perhaps , further education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a vocational approach than an academic one . <p> The vocational skills I gained are invaluable to me even more today when I try to help my constituents as a member of parliament . <p> That 's why I am passionate about further education and the route it can offer for people from every walk of life to go further and reach their full potential . <p> So I was hugely disappointed when the government missed a great opportunity to get behind the sector when it recently announced , to as little fanfare as seems possible , a new Technical and Further Education Bill . <p> Because it is clear to anyone who has read the bill that this Conservative government has no plans to develop a system of technical and further education fit for the 21st century . <p> Over 20 clauses in the government 's bill are committed to developing an insolvency regime for further education providers . Only under a government that has continually starved the further education sector of the investment it needs would this be necessary . <p> Last year , a report by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in deficit for the first time in 2013/14 ; 110 colleges had an operating deficit , more than double the number from 2010/11 . <p> In the same period , the number of colleges assessed by the Skills Funding Agency to have ' inadequate ' financial health rose from five per cent to 12 per cent . All of this from the party of so-called fiscal responsibility ! <p> Education is the best investment we can make in Britain <p> Everyone who works in the further education sector will have witnessed the dangerous levels of deficit denial coming from the Tories . <p> Anyone truly committed to an education system that works for everyone could see the dire warnings in that report and take immediate action to invest in our colleges . <p> Education is the best investment we can make in Britain , to support young people at every stage of their lives to get the skills which they need to live well and to contribute to Britain 's economic prosperity . <p> So when I see a government that , looking at the millions of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , decides that the priority is not investment but to create a regime that makes it easier for colleges to become insolvent , I see a government that is failing in its duty . <p> As shadow secretary of state for education , I have been urging the government to invest in our young people , to help them get the skills they need to go further . It 's an investment that we know will pay off down the line . <p> That 's why Labour has pledged to bring back the Education Maintenance Allowance , which would support hundreds of thousands of young people from low- and middle-income backgrounds . <p> I want to make it clear that Labour will never accept second best for our young people . Everyone deserves the opportunity to succeed .

 new clerk of a recently merged college and I am increasingly worried about the makeup of the governing body . It seems to be largely made up of colleagues and acquaintances of the chair . How can I ensure a better mix ? <p> governance requires a balanced mix of skills , knowledge and experience that is directed effectively to ensure the work of the governing body is shared equally by all governors . <p> To ensure that individual governors are empowered to actively participate in the work of the college , they must have up-to-date knowledge , the right skills and remain motivated to gain the experience that can only come from good attendance at meetings . They must also be impartial and prepared to challenge the executive and/or the chair . Appointing friends or acquaintances of other board members who may not be prepared to challenge in this way is not a healthy situation . <p> Use this opportunity to bring about change by starting with an audit of the existing blend of skills , knowledge and experience amongst the current governors . There are several tools available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clerks ' Network will be able to point you in the right direction . <p> The next stage is to get the board to agree to recruit new members who fill the identified gaps . You will need to set up a process where the search committee ( or equivalent ) prioritises applications which demonstrate the particular skills , knowledge and/or experience that meet the needs of the work of the governing body . <p> Question 2 : Having impact <p> I have been a governor for 12 months and I do n't know whether I am wasting my time . I try to be supportive and get the right balance of challenge but sometimes I feel my contribution is n't valued by the executive . How can I judge the impact I am having ? <p> Answer : <p> You are not alone in this and it is one of the most frequently asked questions . One way to judge this is to get the clerk to organise a board effectiveness exercise . This should include questions about the quality of discussion and minutes , the impact of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alternatively , why not meet up with the principal for a coffee and just ask the question . <p> Often principals value a challenging governor knowing that a governor is going to ask the difficult questions encourages them get their act together and prepare much better for meetings . But they are sometimes not very good at saying thank you to those governors . <p> I still remember those governors who asked the awkward questions <p> From my time as a principal I still remember those governors who ? asked the awkward questions . I might not have enjoyed it at the time but , looking back , I now see they fully understood their role . Having those challenging questions minuted and addressed made it much easier to demonstrate to auditors , regulators and the inspectorate that governors were holding the executive to account . Or as one previous skills minister said , " holding their feet to the fire " . <p> Question 3 : New A-level entry grades <p> I am worried we have set our entry grades too low and are undermining our local schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only four or five 4s at GCSE when the local feeder schools are trying to encourage their pupils to aim at five 5s , including English and maths . What do you think we should be doing ? <p> Answer : <p> You raise a serious and complex issue . The Ofqual chart has tried to made it clear that both grade 5 and 4 are equivalent to an old grade C , but I am with you . The college should try and support schools to encourage pupils to raise their sights and should consider setting their minimum entry requirement for a 3 A-level programme at four or five grade 5 's . We need to help schools by setting the same aspiration and achievement levels . However , we need to be aware as the recent research highlighted that young people from poorer backgrounds do n't do well at GCSEs , so there needs to be some flexibility and support for them . <p> This is one of those issues where the college should talk to their feeder schools and try to agree an approach . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet your student number targets but , if you felt the right level was at least 5 C 's including English and maths before the change , then you should stick with that expectation and ask for five grade 5 's , even though they are at the top end of a C. <p> Help schools by setting the same achievement levels <p> There are those who have said that getting four C 's was not enough in the past and we know that if students do n't have the right grades they struggle with the content and rigour of an A-level programme . <p> That does n't mean you should not offer them a programme at your college , it just might not be A-levels. <p> Sunday was the

 <p> However , the recommendations for the Black Country , Coventry and Warwickshire , Cumbria , Liverpool City Region , and North and reviews revealed just five planned mergers involving 12 colleges . <p> But this figure is outweighed by the 18 colleges to emerge from the process with no firm recommendations for change . <p> What 's more , one of the proposed mergers a link-up between Lakes College and Carlisle College has already been scrapped . <p> Janet Clark , the post-16 policy specialist at the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , hit out at the lack of change . <p> It 's disappointing that all that money has been spent , and all the stress that it 's caused staff , and nothing 's come of it <p> " It 's disappointing that all that money has been spent , and all the stress that it 's caused staff , and nothing 's come of it , " she said . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> One of the many dilemmas that principals must struggle with is when to appeal against an Ofsted decision . You have to balance the emotional response to the feelings of being unfairly treated with the knowledge that Ofsted seldom admits to being wrong . <p> My college was inspected in October 2016 and we had been prepared for over a year . The wait is always worse than the actual inspection , but within a couple of hours of receiving the phone call , the lead inspector had been sent position papers , 2015/16 SAR and data , timetables and our strategic plan . We were ready . <p> The week went well . We 'd hoped for some grade ones but got all twos ; however , strengths identified at the final feedback meeting included high , English and maths , high quality work experience , and excellent partnerships and employer engagement . <p> It was with great surprise , then , that the written report sent for factual checking included some new additions . The words " college leaders have tackled the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared on the front page in fact , in the second bullet point . These words were not used at any point during the week and the statement is untrue and extremely emotive . <p> The words were inaccurate and emotive <p> It also said " leaders and teachers should ensure that a higher proportion of learners attend their English and mathematics lessons and achieve their qualification " . <p> Again , this had not been mentioned as an issue by any of the inspectors . <p> Also on pages one and two of the report , and listed as part of a significant recommendation , was the statement that there were " lower levels of success for the small group of 16- to 18-year-old learners with mixed heritage " . <p> The total group of mixed-heritage learners was 22 . The percentage difference in success rates compared with other groups was equivalent to two learners . This is important but hardly significant . <p> As the nominee , and an Ofsted inspector myself , I would have been able to challenge these statements if they had been fed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statements through the Ofsted accuracy-check process to the lead inspector . I explained that the words were inaccurate and emotive , and that there was no evidence base for the assertion about poor attendance in English and maths . I also pointed out that the mixed-heritage data was not significant . <p> His formal response was simply this : " No change required " . <p> For the first time in my career , I was left with a decision : whether to challenge Ofsted or not . Would it be worth it ? <p> Following discussions with the chair of governors , we agreed to put in a formal complaint the Ofsted term for an appeal . It is not easy to do , as it is based entirely on an electronic form , with a choice of three types of complaint : conduct ( inspector behaviour ) , process ( did inspectors follow the handbook ? ) or judgement ( does the evidence match the decision ? ) . <p> I submitted all of my points under the process category . <p> As an Ofsted inspector myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they had been fed back during the inspection process <p> An Ofsted investigating officer was appointed and spent time reviewing the evidence and interviewing relevant people . <p> I asked to have the report suspended until the investigation was completed , as I felt the emotive words would upset many of our excellent existing staff and governors . Ofsted refused and published the report on November 16 . <p> On December 22 I received the formal response . Ofsted had upheld the three complaints . They removed the emotive words from the report and replaced them with : " College leaders have improved the quality of provision . They have created a culture in which staff work resolutely in the best interests of their learners and the college is a purposeful community . " <p> All reference to poor attendance at English and maths was removed due to insufficient evidence and the mixed-heritage recommendation was removed from pages one and two as it was not deemed significant . <p> I am left with mixed feelings . I am pleased that Ofsted has proved to be what I always thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am disappointed that the initial report went public with an unfair flavour .

 <h> News <h> Winners from the National Apprenticeship Awards 2016 announced <p> Britain celebrated the best of its vocational education on Friday night , when the country 's top three apprentices and its six best employers were crowned the winners of the National Apprenticeship Awards . <p> London 's Grosvenor House hosted a ceremony with the theme ' Nation of Champions ' , which showcased the success stories of individuals and employers . <p> The victorious apprentices went through a tough process to make the finals , in which they had to demonstrate how they have benefited from their apprenticeship and detail their contribution to their employers ' business objectives . <p> Charlotte Blowers , from oil and gas firm Exceed , won ' intermediate apprentice of the year ' , while Adam Sharp from nuclear decommissioning company Sellafield Ltd picked up the award for ' advanced apprentice of the year ' . <p> Holly Broadhurst , who works for manufacturer J C Bamford Excavators Ltd , was named ' higher or degree apprentice of the year ' . <p> After these individual triumphs , six employers were then recognised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony , which was once again run by the National Apprenticeship Service . <p> ' Small employer of the year ' went to Environmental Ltd , the ' medium employer ' award was taken home by Troup Bywaters + Anders , and Mercedes-Benz UK won ' best large employer ' . <p> ' Macro employer of the year ' was won by Mitie Group Plc , Craggs Energy Ltd was named as ' best newcomer SME ' , and the award for ' newcomer large employer ' was snaffled by Bond Dickinson LLP . <p> Sam Lee , head of recruitment at Bond Dickinson , said his law firm took on apprentices because it was " the right thing to do ; for social mobility , improved staff retention and for the future of our business " . <p> The ' apprentice champion ' award was then handed to John Clarke , a technical manager with BT . <p> He was recognised for his commitment to apprenticeships , which included working evenings and weekends to organise career seminars and educational visits to inspire BT apprentices to " make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister Robert Halfon told everyone assembled he was " absolutely delighted " to be with them to " celebrate the magnificent achievements of employers and apprentices from up and down the country " . 
 <h> Roundup <h> Young developers create chart-topping PC adventure game <p> Three young games developers from Oxfordshire have made a splash in the online gaming world after their first ever release received worldwide support and topped an indie gaming hot list . Samantha King reports . <p> For most people , the Christmas break is a time of eating , drinking and relaxation , but for three Banbury and Bicester college students , it was the chance to develop and launch a PC adventure game . <p> Matthew Hill , Lewis Taylor and Oliver all study an extended diploma in games development at the college 's Banbury campus , and using skills learned on their course created free-to-download PC game called ' Realm of Rulers ' . <p> The medieval fantasy game tasks players with building a city , and managing its resources and population in order to create a world that controls itself . <p> The three uploaded their creation onto Game Jolt , an online community for indie games , and within just two days had topped the site 's ' hot games ' list , receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world with more following on . <p> Screenshots from the game <p> Matthew Hill , 17 , one of the developers , said : " We began to create the game in December , as we had already completed our college assignments in the run-up to Christmas . Over the break we worked on making it as presentable and playable as possible , and uploaded it to Game Jolt just to see what kind of reaction it got . <p> " You can upload games with early access , which means they are n't yet complete but are open for people to try and give feedback on . We were n't expecting much but it has just exploded . Seeing the number of plays and views go up so rapidly was amazing . " <p> Word of the new game has been spreading fast in the online world , with fans of the game recording themselves playing it , and posting it to their YouTube channels , amassing thousands of views . It has also been a particular hit with players in Russia , who make up a substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now working on building new elements for the game in order to improve user experience and maintain interest levels . <p> Currently , the game has an overall rating of 4.2 out of 5 , making it one of the best-ranked games on the Game Jolt site , something that is more than just a personal achievement for the three students . <p> Oliver , 18 , said : " We all want to go to university to continue to study games design and development , so having this as part of our portfolio is a big bonus . The most valuable thing is being able to show that you have had so much engagement from players , beyond your own friends and family , and been able to take on board feedback to make improvements .

 <h> FE Experts <p> Almost a year ago George Osborne used his budget speech to commit the Government to a review that , at the time , many of us hoped would catalyse a comprehensive national conversation about the role of adult learning in modern Britain . <p> The signs were good , with the budget report containing this eminently sensible promise : " As working lives lengthen and jobs change , adults will need more opportunities to retrain and up-skill ... To promote retraining and prepare people for the future labour market , the government will review the gaps in support for lifetime learning , including for flexible and part-time study . " <p> Since then , however , with little debate on the issue in the House of Commons , and no public consultation , it appeared to be taking place behind closed doors . <p> Light was finally shone on the illusive review of lifetime learning last Friday , in an adjournment debate on ' Night Schools and Adult Education ' called by Labour 's David Lammy , who proclaimed " the Government 's post-16 skills plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 2016 , but it did not appear " . <p> Halfon could choose to be radical <p> In his response , the skills and apprenticeships minister , who could easily have skipped over the question without consequence , provided a little insight . Robert Halfon admitted it was very much alive , and said the government would " soon bring forward potential policy options from the current review " . He also listed its priorities as " meeting our skills deficit , helping the socially disadvantaged and the community , being as widespread as possible , given the funding pressures , and being good quality . " <p> For me , the minister 's response ticks a lot of boxes so I 'm looking forward to seeing what gaps and policy options have been identified . Furthermore , I see the publication of further policy options for lifetime learning to be particularly timely , now that the prime minister has announced ' hard ' Brexit , which should force the government to examine the ' competitiveness ' and skills need of the domestic population . <p> For me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlinked realities . Firstly , the skills deficits the minister talked about , and people 's lifetime learning needs in modern Britain , ca n't be solved by apprenticeships alone . I do n't expect , or want , a sudden abandonment of the three million target at all , but instead hope that the government places value on other types of adult learning . <p> Far too many people do n't see learning as being for them -- even though these are often those who have most to gain <p> Secondly , far too many people do n't see learning as being for them -- even though these are often those who have most to gain . the Learning and Work Institute 's ' Adult Participation in Learning ' surveys consistently show that participation in learning is determined by , among other things , education levels . In other words , you 're more likely to see adults in learning who already have qualifications than those without . This is a big challenge and will need much more policy integration between employment support programmes and the sector . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister could choose to be radical here and publish options that move the way we organise and fund education away from a system in which you might have ' spent ' all of your entitlements by the age of 19 . Devolved budget holders could be empowered to do things differently and improved learning accounts could resurface , with links to savings incentives or pensions . <p> Finally ( for now at least ) , the government has promised a consultation about how to make basic digital skills training free to all adults who need it , which is welcome . But there also needs to be a strategy to tackle the UK 's poor performance on other basic essential skills . It is frankly embarrassing that one in five adults struggles with poor numeracy and one in six struggles with poor literacy in one of the richest countries in the world . <p> We must recognise that for a lot of people we want in learning , including older people , just walking into a college and enrolling on a course is not as straightforward as you might think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step to gain the self-confidence and belief that learning has huge benefits for them . <p> I hope I am right and that it is finally time for a serious conversation about lifetime learning . <p> Shane Chowen is head of policy and public affairs at the Learning and Work institute 
 <h> News <h> Institutes of technology ? 170m windfall going to existing providers <p> The extra ? 170 million the government has promised to set aside for a new wave of " prestigious " institutes of technology will go to existing providers , FE Week can reveal . <p> The title will in effect work as a badge of honour given to specially chosen FE providers that excel at higher-level technical education , like the old Centre of Vocational Excellence ( CoVE ) status . <p> The government first announced plans for the institutes in July 2015 , then again in its post-16 skills plan in July . <p> Now , a green paper unveiled on January 23 has confirmed that a new ? 170 million in capital funding is to be spent on creating IoTs to " increase the provision of higher-level technical education " , and ensure that it is available " in all areas " . <p> The paper explained , for example , that a person " could study a level three ( A-level equivalent ) at a local college , before moving on to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city " . <p> But it also said the government would expect most of the IoTs " to grow out of high-quality provision " . <p> A spokesperson said that details would be announced in due course , leaving it unclear whether independent training providers could apply for the money <p> The Department for Education told FE Week that the new institutes are to be based at existing providers . <p> This means they will effectively amount to a quality mark , like the former CoVE status . In this case , colleges were told , by the former Learning and Skills Council in 2001 , that they would receive " up to ? 300,000 in the first year they join the CoVE programme " . <p> The DfE also confirmed this week that the ? 170 million would come as capital funding across the next three years , and would therefore work out at around ? 57 million per year for each of 2017/18 , 2018/19 , and 2019/20 . <p> A spokesperson said that details would be announced in due course , leaving it unclear whether independent training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be restricted to colleges . <p> " For all the soundbites about rebooting Britain as a high-skill economy , the total of ? 170 million is the equivalent of 10 misfiring rockets , " she wrote . <p> Mark Dawe ( pictured ) , chief executive of the AELP , said : " Independent training providers , with their expertise and experience , are ready to take the lead or be active partners in the establishment of each of the new institutes of technology . <p> " Our training provider members work with 350,000 employers and so the links to make quick progress happen already exist . " <p> Wide-ranging reforms to technical education , in which the new institutes are likely to play a role in implementing , were first revealed exclusively by FE Week last May and then announced by the government two months later . <p> They followed a review led by former Science and Innovation Minister Lord Sainsbury , which detailed plans for a radical overhaul to replace 20,000 courses with " 15 high-quality routes " . <p> The green paper was generally less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sector 's underwhelming performance had created the opening for the new institutes . <p> The report said that too many of FE colleges " only offer a broad , generalist curriculum at lower qualification levels " and that " the sector has too little provision of higher-level technical qualifications " . <p> Having read the green paper , AoC boss David Hughes said : " I am pleased that the role of colleges from level three , through four and five , to degrees has been understood and that the institutes of technology will build on the specialisms that exist across the college sector . <p> " We want an investment approach which supports every college to provide excellence .

 <h> FE Experts <p> The NHS will build strong partnerships with colleges and training providers , as long as they are honest about their capacity , says Lucy Hunte . <p> With the imminent introduction of a public sector target which will require all public sector organisations to have 2.3 per cent of their workforce on apprenticeships , the NHS will have an estimated target of 28,000 apprenticeship starts in 2017/18 a 75 per cent increase on 2016/17 . <p> With such a rapid ramp-up , capacity and quality of delivery from training providers is a key concern . <p> The annual NHS levy spend will be ? 27 million across London and ? 200 million nationally . With this money effectively being taken away from frontline services there is a huge focus across all NHS trusts on planning to maximise levy spend and ensure funds do not expire . <p> Realistically trusts will not have the vacancies or budget for salaries to spend the levy solely on training new recruits , although this is a key focus , so a large percentage of funds will be used on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hiding place for poor quality providers <p> Many hospitals already deliver elements of their apprenticeship programmes in partnership with chosen training providers , and have applied to the new register of apprenticeship training providers to formalise these arrangements on either the employer-provider route or the supporting route . <p> This is an attractive option for many trusts as they can be paid for their expertise , and funds that come back into the trusts via these partnerships will be incremental revenue . <p> Hospitals recognise that their expertise is in the clinical domain , and for non-clinical apprenticeships ; most NHS trusts will continue to depend on partnerships with colleges and training providers . The focus will therefore be on building effective partnerships with training providers . Our priority is quality training and added value we are not interested in a race to the bottom on price . <p> Due to some negative experiences in the past , the dedicated regional apprenticeship leads have started to share best practice around apprenticeship delivery between trusts . We are rating training providers based on factors such as success rates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learner progress . <p> This data will be shared centrally with other NHS trusts to ensure quality provision , which means no hiding place for poor providers . <p> We are planning a pan-London procurement exercise in the coming months , to allocate contracts to a core bank of trusted providers . <p> Given the demand for a large volume and variety of required standards and frameworks , multiple partnerships will be required . Colleges and training providers will need to be realistic and honest about their capacity in order to avoid over-promising and under-delivering , resulting in being removed from the preferred suppliers list . <p> While many NHS trusts already deliver part of their apprenticeship programmes such as the Care Certificate , we are recommending that trusts now look to do this on a formal basis and get paid for this delivery . <p> For those looking at the employer-provider route , they will still be interested in partnerships with training providers who could support the MIS and administration functions as well as compliance and Ofsted requirements . <p> These partnerships would then enable trusts to deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expertise , but without the added pressure of becoming fully-fledged training providers . <p> The beauty of many of the new apprenticeship standards is that they do not have a mandatory qualification . This gives trusts the flexibility to work with a training provider to match their existing training programmes to the standards for example a trust 's existing leadership and development programme might map across to the new L5 management standard . <p> Large public sector organisations face significant challenges in implementing the new legislation , including delayed government guidance and a lack of clarity around how honorary contracts will affect workforce count . Despite this , the overall picture looks very positive , and there are substantial opportunities for training providers if they can offer high-quality provision and bespoke training packages , and adapt to trusts ' needs . 
 <h> News <h> DfE silent on FE commissioner intervention reports <p> A stop appears to have been put on publication of FE commissioner intervention reports , despite growing numbers of failing colleges . <p> What 's more , there is no sign of the FE commissioner 's 2015/16 annual report , even though previous reports have been published in November or December . <p> The last intervention report , into City of Liverpool College , was published in October , although the document itself was dated August 2016 . <p> FE Week believes that up to 18 colleges should have been subject to intervention by the FE commissioner and his team since then . <p> But when we asked about the missing reports , the Department for Education was unable to give any reason for the hold-up , and insisted they would be available in due course . <p> Julian Gravatt , AoC 's assistant chief executive , suggested the delay was related to the recent publication of 18 area review reports which were also overdue because " this may be where the government 's focus currently lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FE commissioner in November , told delegates at last year 's AoC annual conference that he and his team were " still finding the same things now that we found in 2013 during interventions " . <p> We 're still finding the same things now that we found in 2013 <p> Intervention is triggered in one of three ways : an ' inadequate ' Ofsted rating , a financial notice of concern from the Skills Funding Agency , or a failure to meet the SFA 's minimum standards . <p> Since the publication of the last intervention report , 10 colleges have been given Ofsted 's worst rating , while eight have been issued with financial notices . <p> Of the 10 grade-four colleges , seven have previously been subject to intervention though it 's not clear whether any of those processes had completed , and therefore whether a new intervention had been triggered . <p> City of Liverpool College became the first college to return to the FE commissioner 's oversight in early 2016 . <p> The DfE refused to say whether any of these seven colleges had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atkins and his team . <p> Instead FE Week was told that the details would be in the reports when they were published . <p> Mr Atkins said at the AoC conference that there had been around 50 interventions since 2013 , and that there were around 20 colleges with which he and his team were currently involved . <p> A total of 46 reports have been published , based on interventions at 40 colleges and six adult and community learning providers . <p> Annual reports by Mr Atkins ' predecessor Sir David Collins , in 2013/14 and 2014/15 , included a recap of the previous year 's interventions , and a summary of lessons learned and common issues . <p> The 2013/14 report was published in November 2014 , while the 2014/15 report was issued in December 2015 . <p> The FE commissioner role was created in 2013 with the aim of tackling underperformance in failing colleges through the intervention process . <p> It was later expanded to include leading on the area reviews of post-16 education and training , which began in September 2015 . <p> Sir David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , when he was replaced by former Exeter College principal Mr Atkins . <p> A Freedom of Information request by FE Week in December revealed that Sir David had been involved in 49 interventions and 22 area reviews between 2013 and 2016 , and had worked twice as many days as had been originally planned . <p> Mr Atkins said at the AoC conference that he hoped his workload would be " lighter after March " when the area reviews are due to complete . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Compulsory under 19 education alone can not address the UK 's growing skills shortages ; we must take the opportunity to work with government to develop a national lifelong learning strategy , says Ruth Spellman . <p> In an interview last week , skills and apprenticeships minister Robert Halfon reassured us that " lifelong learning is firmly back on the government 's agenda " . <p> The Secretary of State for Education had also recently set out in a speech earlier this month how standards can be improved still further by strengthening vocational education and expanding apprenticeships to create a world-class further education system . <p> But reform of the FE system is only one of the changes that are needed . If we are really to improve social mobility and address barriers to learning , we need a national lifelong-learning strategy that allows us to build pathways and opportunities for all adults , particularly those furthest from the labour market , who are educationally disadvantaged or who are in low-paid or unskilled work . <p> According to the Learning and Work Institute , the proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , falling from 41 per cent to the previous level of 35 per cent found in 2013 . The AOC has highlighted a 35 per cent drop in adult skills funding between 2009/10 and 2015/16 . And furthermore , there has been a catastrophic decline in adult participation in HE ( a 40+ per cent drop since 2010 ) . <p> Meanwhile the overwhelming focus of government policy and funding continues to be the under 19s . <p> The recent Commons debate on adult education called by David Lammy voiced concerns we have been raising for some time concerns which were echoed by Sir Vince Cable 's 2017 WEA annual lecture last month . <p> The overwhelming focus continues to be the under 19s <p> It has been encouraging to hear recent repeated statements from the prime minister and Justine Greening on the need for a shared society and greater social mobility and I believe that we now have a real opportunity to work with government to make this a reality . <p> To achieve these desired end points our policies , strategies and delivery need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government to act on the five key recommendations of the APPG for adult education report : <p> Establish a national strategy for adult education . <p> Rebuild and rebalance resources fairly for adults . <p> Provide careers information advice and guidance in local communities . <p> Ensure that we have a systematic approach to gathering evidence on the full impact of adult education . <p> 2 . Deliver funding for those most in need , but who are not ready for a degree course or apprenticeship , and consider introducing an entitlement in English , maths and digital . <p> 3 . Raise standards in HE and FE and create plural pathways back into learning for all learners irrespective of age or current qualifications . <p> None of this is beyond our capability . In the academic year 2015/16 , the WEA engaged over 60,000 students in England and Scotland 23 per cent had no academic qualifications when they began their course , 42 per cent were claiming means-tested benefits and 38 per cent were living in a disadvantaged area . <p> Compulsory under-19 education alone can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not anticipate the way in which technological advancements will require new skillsets . It does n't tackle one of the major forces shaping our society today : an ageing population . <p> A national lifelong learning strategy could do these things and help future-proof our society and our economy . Over a lifetime , we will need to upskill and reskill . The government 's industrial strategy green paper promises ' ambitious new approaches to encouraging lifelong learning ' and we intend to contribute to it . We need more than an approach we urgently need long-term commitment and a plan of action . <p> Ruth Spellman is chief executive of the Workers ' Educational Association 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Once a month , Dr Sue , 's director of policy and external relations , answers your questions , backed by the experience of almost a decade as principal of Canterbury College , in addition to time served in senior civil service posts at central government departments covering education and skills . <h> Question One : New principal <p> I am a new principal with little experience of governance . I have read the Code of Good Governance for English Colleges and talked to the clerk ; what more do I need to do to facilitate a productive relationship ? <p> Answer : First you need to go into this with the right frame of mind , which you seem to have . Governors will rely on you to be their lead advisor as well as the accountable officer . <p> Do n't spin as it will inevitably unwind <p> Second you need to put time into this side of the job . Good relationships are built on the ability to work openly and cooperatively with your governors from the beginning . Work with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paperwork is needed and how you can help them make sense of data and college performance information . <p> It 's a governor 's role to challenge , so do n't be defensive . Proactively pre-empt difficult questions by raising them yourself and assuring governors you have the right mitigating action in place . That way , they will gain confidence and can be supportive of your actions . Do n't spin because it will inevitably unwind , share the bad bits as well as the good . And thirdly , go out and shadow other executives at their boards . See how others do it . It does n't have to be a college it could be a university , a large health authority or housing association . The main attributes of good board and executive relationships are the same whatever the sector . <h> Question Two : Alienating staff <p> I took on the chair 's role of a failing college two years ago and my first task was to appoint a new principal . The transformation has been first class and our inspection report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of stress . I would n't say the principal offends people , but he is not making friends or allowing staff to express their views . How do I tackle this ? <p> Answer : Leadership and college ethos start with the governors . You brought in someone to turn round the college and they have done that . <p> Staff will use the success as a springboard to move on <p> It is not unusual when an organisation needs to be turned round quickly for a chief executive to take on an ' I know best ' management style . <p> Having a centrally imposed framework and standards gives staff the clarity they need , especially after a period of uncertainly , but it only works for a short time . <p> It 's now time to modify behaviour and get your principal to move from an instructional leadership to one of shared collaborative ownership where he offers as much praise as criticism and shares the success with others around him . If you do n't do that the most able staff will use this newfound success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One way for your principal to consider new leadership styles is to attend one of the thought leadership sessions run by the leadership foundations . <h> Question Three : FE handbooks <p> I am a governor for a school as well as an FE college . the revised schools ' ' Governance handbook and competency framework ' , is 130+ pages , compared to 23 in the Code of Good Governance for English Colleges . Are we missing something in FE ? <p> Answer : No I do n't think so . The Code of Good Governance for English Colleges is similar in length and content to the Scottish and Welsh Codes and shares the same format with the University Sector Code . <p> I am taken by the section on principles and personal attributes <p> The schools ' guidance tries to cover all matters whereas , in FE , many of the issues are referred to in separate guidance , such as the financial memorandum . <p> The new criteria are interesting and I am taken by the section on principles and personal attributes . The principles and suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the College code . However , they have cleverly added an easy-to-remember section that encompasses the seven C's. 
 <h> News <h> Third of employers paying levy in April do n't know it exists yet , according to new report <p> A third of employers who will have to pay the new apprenticeship levy from April are not even aware it exists , a worrying new survey report has shown . <p> City &amp; Guilds has today published the results of a poll with 500 senior decision makers on their knowledge of the imminent apprenticeship reforms , carried out last November and December , but alarmingly the responses indicated that 33 per cent of those who will have to pay the new charge knew nothing about it . <p> And out of those that were aware of the levy , only a third felt " fully informed " about how the resulting employer-led system will work . <p> FE Week has in recent days also spoken now to the Confederation of British Industry , Federation of Small Businesses , and institute of Directors , who all expressed grave misgivings about inadequate government communication with employers . <p> Neil Carberry , CBI director for people and skills policy , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of information they have received from the government about the implementation of the Apprenticeship Levy . <p> Neil Carberry <p> " Since the levy was announced in July 2015 , it 's taken the government 18 months of 21 available to design and prepare the policy , giving firms a very short window to understand and deliver the new changes . <p> " Even at this late stage , businesses are still waiting for clarity on crucial details , including the Digital Apprenticeship Service and apprenticeship standards . " <p> The skills leade at the CBI , which has raised repeated concern about the levy , said it is now " more urgent than ever " that the government " clearly communicates how businesses execute the new scheme and treat the first two years as a transition period to deliver a genuinely employer-led system " . <p> The Federation of Small Businesses also warned of a " lack of awareness among our members where the levy is concerned " . <p> The Institute of Directors added that confusion among employers over how the new system will work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government uses the short time it has left to better explain how it will operate before the launch in April . <p> Seamus Nevin , head of employment and skills policy at the Institute of Directors , told FE Week : " Unfortunately , the manner in which the system has been designed and implemented has left many employers struggling to understand how it will work and what they have to do . " <p> The City &amp; Guilds survey , which was carried out between November 18 and December 5 last year , also found that only 31 per cent of the business leaders intend to increase the number of apprentices that they recruit because of the levy , despite this being part of the government 's campaign to ensure 3 million apprenticeship starts by 2020 . <p> Additionally , a number of employers will be cutting their overall current training budget to pay the apprenticeship levy , with 15 per cent of respondents cutting other recruitment schemes to pay for it . <p> The Department for Education has been approached for comment . <p> Kirstie Donnelly <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " The lack of awareness about the new apprenticeship system among our respondents is a cause for concern and shows that we still have a hill to climb in convincing people about the benefits apprentices can bring to business . <p> " With just two months to go until the levy begins , it 's vital that everyone in the skills sector and government gets out there and communicates with these less enlightened businesses to help them see the huge potential benefits apprenticeships can bring . " <p> The Department for Education was unavailable to comment on the survey results . <p> The levy , first announced by the government in July , is set at 0.5 per cent of an employer 's paybill . <p> As outlined in the new guidance , all employers will receive a ? 15,000 allowance to offset against the levy . This means only businesses with a paybill of more than ? 3m will pay . <p> The money raised will be ring-fenced , so it can only be spent on training apprentices and all levy-paying companies will receive a 10 per cent top up on monthly levy contributions . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> The new apprenticeship programme was designed to put employers in the driving seat , but the contract the SFA will make them sign places them in a risky situation , says Smita . <p> As the jedi master Yoda once observed , " always two there are , no more and no less : a master and an apprentice " . <p> If only life were that simple . <p> The new apprenticeship arrangements have spawned a series of contracts : , provider/employer , ( contract of employment ) , **28;116;TOOLONG ( commitment statement ) , , and assessment organisation . <p> The latest to be revealed , a little over two months before the apprenticeship programme starts , is the contract between the SFA and the employer . <p> It 's therefore a good moment to reflect on where employers now find themselves . The programme is the conclusion of several years of policy initiative designed to put employers in the driving seat on skills . <p> How far removed we 've become from master Yoda 's simple vision <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a levy , returning it to them with complicated strings attached , and then threatening to claw it back if they happen to get tangled up in the rules . <p> As someone on Twitter archly but accurately noted , employers may be in the driving seat but if they get it wrong , they are going to pay for the car twice . <p> The new contract contains a range of provisions in which such suspension or clawback of funds might occur . Some , such as fraud , financial irregularity or insolvency , are obvious and unarguable . Others are likely to be more challenging for employers . <p> For example , funds may be withheld or suspended if an employee or agent has acted dishonestly or negligently or has taken action that the SFA reasonably concludes brings its name or reputation into disrepute . These are broad provisions , and create potentially onerous obligations for employers to access what they may see as their own money . <p> Similarly , breach of the apprenticeship funding guidance constitutes grounds to recover , from the employer , funding paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The funding rules are complex and thus the potential for breaching them , especially within the contractual matrix set out above , is not insignificant . <p> The SFA contract seeks to reassure employers that it will act " reasonably and proportionately " in seeking to recover the sums , but there is scope for disagreement as to when those thresholds are crossed . <p> A number of the complaints we have made to the SFA on behalf of colleges , for example , have been based on what we considered to be unreasonable or disproportionate conduct on the part of the SFA . <p> Employers may be in the driving seat but if they get it wrong , they are going to pay for the car twice <p> Some of the provisions of the contract may be difficult for employers to navigate confidently without legal advice . For example , the state aid provision refers to complicated de minimis provisions , supposedly clarified in the funding rules . The funding rules however simply refer to the state aid regulations . <p> State aid lawyers are amongst the cleverest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it 's a dauntingly complex area , and therefore not one that many employers will have much experience of . <p> Similarly , the contract brings employers within the scope of the SFA 's freedom of information obligations , meaning employers could see their confidential information made publicly accessible . <p> The contract also contains provisions from the " bloomin ' cheek " school of contract drafting . That employers , who are after all being forced to offer apprenticeships or lose their levy contributions , should be forced to guarantee that they have all necessary resources and expertise to deliver them is at best irksome and at worst onerous , as is the broad warranty that the employer has complied with " all relevant legislation and all applicable codes of practice " and will notify the SFA of any departures . <p> Material breaches are grounds for termination of the agreement and the end of funding . <p> The contract creates risks not just for employers , though , but for all of those other contracting parties , whose own rights to payment or employment could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed we have become from master Yoda 's simple vision of only the two : master and apprentice . 
 <p> The success of University Technical Colleges has been called into question lately , with several closing down , and even Michael Gove , who introduced them , weighing in to label them a failure . Yet UTCs perform a vital function in providing high quality technical education for 14- to 19-year-olds , backed by employers , to meet regional skills shortages . <p> Our experience in Sheffield the only city outside of London currently to have two UTCs demonstrates they are capable of making a valuable contribution to the educational landscape . UTC Sheffield City Centre , which is has a ' good ' grade from Ofsted , specialises in advanced engineering and manufacturing , and creative and digital pathways . UTC Sheffield Olympic Legacy Park campus opened in 2016 , specialising in computing , health sciences and sport science . <p> Recruiting students at the age of 14 is challenging and compounded by resistance from some parts of the education system to providing parents and young people with impartial careers guidance . As of this month , however , local authorities are legally required to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices can include a UTC . <p> We know students ' progress accelerates once they join us <p> This is a positive move . UTCs attract a diverse range of students of all abilities who love to learn by doing . And contrary to what Mr Gove seemed to suggest in his recent piece for the Times , it is not a necessary feature of UTCs that students underperform academically . <p> Our own results show that students at UTCs can outperform those at schools . In August , 79 per cent of our Year 11 students gained GCSE grades A* C in maths ; in English it was 66 per cent , and 73 per cent in the two sciences . In technical subjects , Year 11 students achieved a 97 per cent pass rate in their creative and digital and engineering qualifications . <p> With any new and innovative project , some casualties will occur as it matures . But to discard the entire UTC project before successful institutions have the chance to prove themselves would be a colossal waste of the resources already invested in them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive destination , with 45 per cent going to university , including Russell Group institutions , when the national average for schools is 38 per cent , and 28 per cent going on to apprenticeships , compared with a seven per cent national average for schools . <p> And in November , our engineering students ranked joint fifth in the medal table in WorldSkills UK after competing against colleges , employers and universities . <p> UTCs are complex educational settings and the most successful ones are embraced by regional stakeholders , have an employer- and university-embedded curriculum , and leaders who understand how to build good schools . <p> They need a regional focus at the planning stage , supported by employers , councils , universities , FE colleges and partnerships such as teaching school alliances . <p> The strong relationships we have with our sponsors the Sheffield College , Sheffield Hallam University and Sheffield Chamber of Commerce , as well as Sheffield City Council , underpin our success . Around 50 employers also back us . <p> UTCs have far less time to influence students ' progress scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet the government 's new performance measures compare the two . Some of the technical and creative subjects that UTCs have developed with complex projects do n't even receive scores in the Progress 8 measure . <p> Compounding this is the fact that UTCs have far less time to influence students ' progress scores , which are measured over five years starting at the end of primary school . <p> Young people can only join a UTC at the age of 14 yet their education for the three years prior to joining us counts in their final score . <p> We know that students ' progress accelerates once they join us . Progress 8 therefore is n't an effective measure of the performance of a 14-19 technically focused school . UTCs are working with the Department for Education to take action here . <p> The country needs high quality skill-focused technical learning pipelines -- UTCs along with further education colleges and universities can provide this , when working together with employers . The payback to the treasury and employers will come from the reduction in the costs of training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased salaries paid to contribute to the UK tax system . <p> For too long , the education system has focused on academic qualifications at the expense of the essential skills desired by employers . 
 <h> News <h> Ethnic minority target for apprenticeship diversity group <p> The government launched the Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network this week . One of its key aims will be to increase the proportion of apprentices from black , Asian and minority ethnic communities by 20 per cent . FE Week 's Alix Robertson went along to the opening event to find out more . <p> A new employers ' network designed to promote diversity in apprenticeships was launched this week , and it 's put good practice and dispelling myths at the top of its list of priorities . <p> The Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network is chaired by Nus Ghani , MP for Wealden , and is made up of 23 employers , including Rolls Royce , the BBC and BAE Systems , alongside other small- and medium-sized employers . <p> We have to make parents understand that this is a solid step to their child not only learning but earning <p> One major focus for the new group will be to help the government achieve its commitment to " increase the proportion of apprenticeship starts by people from BAME @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first spelled out in a document called ' English Apprenticeships : Our 2020 Vision ' , published last December . <p> FE Week asked the Department for Education to put this target into context ahead of the launch event , at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London . <p> A spokesperson said that the aim would be to increase the proportion of BAME starts from just under 10 per cent at present to 11.9 per cent ( which amounts to a 20 per cent increase ) . The DfE would not confirm where the original 10 per cent figure was taken from . <p> According to our analysis of the latest available statistics , the problem of BAME underrepresentation in apprenticeships appears to lie more in recruitment than in attracting candidates . <p> For example , while 38 per cent of the applications for apprenticeships in 2015/16 were from individuals not classed as ' white British ' , they made up just 17.2 per cent of the apprentices taken on for the same year . <p> We put this to the apprenticeships and skills minister Robert Halfon at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to do to drive change . <p> Halfon with Nusrat Ghani , chair of the Apprenticeship Diversity Network <p> " The ' Get in Go Far ' apprenticeships promotion campaign is hugely important because it is being shown on social media , on TV , on radio , and in cinemas and it is not just about encouraging people to do apprenticeships , but encouraging employers in terms of recruitment , " he said . <p> " The diversity network is something very serious because when you have someone like Nus as the ambassador , and you see companies like Balfour Beatty or Rolls Royce successfully employing significant numbers of BAME individuals , then the culture will change . " <p> He also claimed that schools had to share some of the blame for underrepresentation from BAME groups , saying : " We 'll only achieve this if schools do a lot more to encourage apprenticeships and skills and at the moment they do not . " <p> Ms Ghani told FE Week that the effort was " also about convincing the parents " . <p> She added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a solid step to their child not only learning but earning and opening up their opportunities and their career going forward . " <p> This particular problem was picked out by Mr Halfon during his speech at the launch . <p> " Sometimes I meet families from different black and minority ethnic backgrounds and they say to me that they just want their kids to go to university , because that is seen as the prestigious route . " <p> Cultural preconceptions were also raised in speeches made by apprentices at the event . <p> One of them , Chris Achiampong , a degree-level apprentice with IBM , told his story of growing up on a council estate and being signed by Arsenal football team but having to give up his dream after a bad injury . <p> When I first said to my mum that I was n't going to university ... her heart nearly exploded , she was going crazy <p> He has subsequently become one of the faces of ' Get In Go Far ' . <p> " I 'm from a Ghanian household , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK for a better life and lived in what you would call deprived circumstances . She was a single parent and she believed in the power of education and academic achievement . " <p> Chris explained that after leaving football he had won a place at Loughborough University to study economics , but declined it in favour of an apprenticeship . <p> " When I first said to my mum that I was n't going to university ... her heart nearly exploded , she was going crazy , " he said . <p> However , he added : " I took her into the offices and she saw everyone else in their suits and she said ' ok , I can see my boy here ' . Now she 's telling all her friends . " <h> People with disabilities and women also key <p> The work of the new Apprenticeship Diversity Champions Network is not only focused on improving BAME representation it will also aim to boost the number of female apprentices and those with disabilities . <p> Mr Halfon spoke passionately to FE Week about how he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with disabilities , by tackling simple day-to-day challenges as well as addressing the bigger picture . <p> Mr Halfon himself was born with mild cerebral palsy and developed osteoarthritis partly due to undergoing many operations to treat it . <p> He gave an example of meeting with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association . <p> " One of the problems they have is with apprentices not being able to get there because the bus is so troublesome , " he said . <p> Something as simple as talking buses can help people who have eyesight difficulties to cope with the logistics <p> " People think of macro government initiatives , but something as simple as talking buses can help people who have eyesight difficulties to cope with the logistics . " <p> He also highlighted the importance of sharing positive examples , saying : " I very much want ' Get In Go Far ' to feature a disabled person , and that does n't just mean the stereotype of a disabled person in a wheelchair , I want people with autism to have access to apprenticeship too and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of women in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics . <p> " Jaguar Land Rover is working with Warwick College , and setting a great example with I think around 20 per cent of its apprentices being women . If they can do it , why ca n't everybody else ? " asked Mr Halfon . <p> " Again , unfortunately this goes right back not just to secondary school , but primary school . A huge cultural shift is required . "

 <p> Asign outside a shop in my local market town reads : ' the only constant in life is change ' . I usually ignore such nuggets of wisdom , but this one stuck with me . <p> As we approach a significant milestone in the funding of apprenticeships , reflect on the new roles for employers , review the list of approved apprenticeship training providers , appraise the detail of apprenticeship standards , and await the official launch of the Institute for Apprenticeships ( and Technical Education ) , it is clear that change is all around us . <p> In Ofsted 's 2016 annual report , her majesty 's chief inspector highlighted the increased proportion of apprenticeship programmes found to be ' good ' or ' outstanding ' , but acknowledged that 37 per cent of those inspected were less than good . <p> Apprenticeships work best when training providers and employers ensure that the structure and delivery of the programme helps apprentices meet exacting standards and contribute to the growth of the business . The best employers provide their apprentices with consistent support and effective training , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure their success . <p> Too often employers do not know enough about the requirements of the apprenticeship programme <p> Here at Ofsted , we currently have 32 apprentices . Some are working at level two and others at level three . We offered our apprentices a permanent role from the first day of their programme , making a genuine commitment to their development and future career . As an organisation we are committed to social mobility , so during the recruitment and selection process we focused on the apprentices ' skills and potential , rather than their previous academic achievements . <p> All of our apprentices are proving to be dedicated and valuable members of the team . <p> We know from our inspection findings that too often employers do not know enough about the requirements of the apprenticeship programme or the quality of the training . And , in some cases , they are concerned that the off-the-job training provided does not enable apprentices to develop the skills they need . We need to ensure that apprenticeship provision is of the highest quality so apprentices can thrive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticeships may encourage more businesses to consider developing their existing employees through an apprenticeship . But remember , apprenticeships are not vehicles to validate employees ' existing skills . <p> It 's vital that employers and training providers ensure these apprentices learn new skills and gain the knowledge that will help them to earn a promotion , take on more responsibility , contribute to increased productivity , or get a payrise . <p> We know apprenticeships are switching from frameworks to standards , and while recruitment to standards-based apprenticeships has increased significantly , they still account for just three per cent of apprentices who began their training after September 2016 . <p> Our inspectors want to see that apprentices know something new <p> Currently , around 95 per cent of apprenticeships are at level two and level three , but over a third of the standards that have been developed are at level four and above . The slow development and approval of standards for the majority of apprentice job roles means that providers may have some apprentices on frameworks and some on standards for the foreseeable future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , it is business as usual for Ofsted . Regardless of the format of an apprenticeship programme , our inspectors want to see that apprentices know something new , can do something better , are able to work on their own , and can make independent decisions as a result of their training and learning . <p> We want to see that employers and providers have structured their training programmes to ensure that apprentices can achieve the very best of their potential . So while we might well see change all around us every day , when it comes to inspection , we will simply keep calm and carry on . <p> Christopher Jones is HMI specialist advisor on apprenticeships at Ofsted 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Adult education should be a golden thread running through all government strategies the budget is Philip Hammond 's opportunity to embed it , says Stephen Evans <p> The Learning and Work Institute is pleased to support FE Week 's campaign . Adult education is more important than ever , and we need to turbocharge participation in learning , starting with this week 's budget . <p> For those of us in the sector , the expansion of apprenticeships , including the three million target and the forthcoming levy , has provided a focal point . <p> The skills plan has generated a real debate about reform of technical education , and skills were at the heart of the industrial strategy green paper . <p> This really does feel like a once-in-a-generation chance to make learning and skills a central part of building our post-Brexit national prosperity and providing engines of social mobility . <p> However , behind these headlines are a raft of statistics showing how overall participation in learning has fallen . <p> There are 1.2 million fewer people taking part in learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults learning literacy and numeracy , and a 120,000 fall in community learning participants . That 's pretty dismal given the UK 's poor record on the basics , and the power of community learning to engage people and communities . <p> All of this matters due to the power of adult education . It helps you get a job and build a career . It boosts health and wellbeing <p> The Adult Education Budget might be frozen in cash terms , but higher-than-expected inflation means a seven per cent real-terms cut by 2020 planned at the time of the spending review has now become nine per cent . <p> Finally , the budget for advanced learner loans , vital for intermediate skills , was due to be ? 498 million per year by now . It 's actually ? 260 million and the latest figures suggest a small fall in the number of adults aged over 24 taking part . And of course FE Week is spot on that learners whose providers go bust should have their loans written off . <p> All of this matters due to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job and build a career . It boosts health and wellbeing . It supports economic growth and productivity . And it promotes communities and citizenship . <p> The impact of adult education can be most clearly seen in the stories of adult learners . People like Emily Hicks , who was selected for a Festival of Learning award in 2016 , after balancing caring for her family from an early age with learning . After working her way through school and university , she is now helping others who find themselves in a similar position working with carers ' organisations in York and nationally . She is a truly inspiring person . <p> There are millions of people like Emily , their lives transformed by learning and adult education . But future Emilys risk missing out if we do n't reverse the fall in adult learning . We need to create more opportunities , more routes in , if we are to make sure everyone has a fair chance in life . <p> This week 's Budget provides a great opportunity to start . Better-than-expected growth means borrowing is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 12 billion lower than planned . We would like to see some of that invested in : <p> Increasing funding per student in FE , which is currently stuck at 1990 levels . This would allow more contact hours per week . <p> Investing an extra ? 200 million per year in adult literacy and numeracy , as part of a community engagement strategy . <p> Earmarking money for training for small firms and the self-employed , outside apprenticeships and the levy , just as in Scotland . <p> Improving the links between community learning and health , wellbeing , employment , and community engagement . <p> Developing new personal learning accounts so individuals , employers and the government can invest together . <p> Beyond greater investment , I hope the government will also recognise that adult education , including but going beyond apprenticeships , should become a golden thread running through its strategies for health , regeneration , growth , and more besides . That 's why FE Week 's call for an adult education strategy matters it should be a cross-government approach . <p> Our future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our amazing adult education sector . Together we must campaign for change . 
 <h> Movers and Shakers <h> Movers and Shakers : Edition 201 <p> The Association of Employment and Learning Providers has made two major new appointments to its senior management team . <p> AELP is a national membership trade body for training providers in the UK with over 800 members across the private and public sectors . <p> Jane Hickie has been appointed chief operating officer , which is a new role at AELP . <p> She joins the organisation from her previous position as corporate partnerships consultant at Groundwork , a community charity , which focuses on engaging young people in improving their local environment . <p> In her new role , Ms Hickie will be responsible for building AELP 's membership , which comprises vocational learning and employment providers . She will also run the organisation 's head office based in Bristol . <p> ... Simon Ashworth is meanwhile AELP 's new chief policy officer . <p> His responsibilities will include leading on overall policy work , including the apprenticeship and justice reforms . <p> He will take up the position from his previous role at the training provider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and services . <p> There he was responsible for the development of new products and services linked to the apprenticeship reforms . <p> Mark Dawe , the CEO of AELP , said : " Jane and Simon are already making a big difference to the organisation and we can expect more staff recruitment including new apprentices to the AELP team over the coming months . " <p> ... Mark Hillman has been appointed the deputy principal of Basingstoke College of Technology . <p> He takes up the role at the Hampshire-based college following a three-year stint as assistant principal at the North East Surrey College of Technology , where his responsibilities included curriculum leadership , quality improvement and financial management . <p> He brings to the role more than 20 years of experience in education , beginning his career in FE as a maths lecturer and curriculum manager at Sixth Form College Farnborough , a position he held for six years . <p> As deputy principal , he hopes to " continue to build a curriculum that is focused on achievement " , adding : " has an amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to secure . I want to continue to build a curriculum that provides successful pathways for all students . " <p> ... Jon Grey has been appointed assistant principal at Cornwall-based Callywith College , which opens in September this year . <p> The new college is being opened in association with Truro and Penwith college , and will offer 27 A-level courses and 16 progression and diploma options for 16- to 19-year-olds . <p> Mr Grey , who is currently programme team leader for science at Truro college , will lead on teaching and learning in the new role . He will be working closely with principal Mark Wardle in ensuring a consistent quality of teaching throughout the college . <p> He says he " ca n't wait to get started " in September , and is excited to be " part of the team that we are building Callywith College " . <p> Speaking of the importance of the new college , he added " Too many 16- to 19-year-olds in north and east Cornwall are forced to travel unacceptable distances to get an outstanding education .

 <h> FE Experts <p> To increase social mobility , government needs to look beyond grammar schools and universities and invest properly in adult education , says Sue Pember <p> In his autumn statement , the chancellor specifically identified the UK 's poor productivity as a matter of national concern . <p> Part of this productivity gap is down to poor skills , especially adult skills . Adults working today will still make up more than two thirds of the workforce in 2030 , but the autumn statement was nevertheless a zone . <p> The 2017 budget must be an education and skills budget . The government 's industrial strategy must have a strong human component as well as physical capital . <p> Adult education has a role to play in raising productivity , strengthening community cohesion , increasing social mobility , reducing unemployment and inactivity , enhancing progression into well-paid jobs , extending working lives , tackling health and mental health issues , and attracting inward investment . It is not just one thing , it has many aspects and should be there all through our lives . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element in the budget that 's good news but my concern is that the government 's idea of skills only means level four and above . <p> We will never achieve extensive social mobility through a narrowly defined route <p> We have to face up to the fact that the nation continues to have a legacy of poor basic skills ; 40 per cent of our young people still do n't achieve level two at 16 . One in five adult employees does not have the basic English and maths skills required in the workplace , which means labour productivity is low . Although we know how to support the basic skills learner , it is no longer seen as the priority it should be and little is done by employers . We need to address this now and put the energy back into the programme . <p> The EU referendum has raised tensions over the place of migrants in our society and local communities , whether they have come to the UK to work or study , have relatives in the UK , or are seeking asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever their status post-Brexit , are given the chance to learn English ; not just for themselves and their futures , but for their children 's and grandchildren 's welfare , and to achieve stronger community cohesion . <p> Although the government invests in this area , there is no clear policy , with different government departments regularly starting and stopping initiatives . <p> Research demonstrates that adult education can strengthen community cohesion . However , to be effective it needs central and local government to work together to provide an integrated structure for adult basic skills and family learning , including language training and ESOL . <p> The government says it is committed to increasing social mobility . All too often , however , the challenge is framed in terms of helping children from poorer backgrounds to access high-quality academic education by attending selective secondary schools , high-performing school sixth forms and into full-time higher education . We will never achieve extensive social mobility through such a narrowly defined route . <p> Social mobility should be improved by developing alternative pathways . Access to higher- and degree-level apprenticeships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at 18 and over . <p> And yet , if we are to encourage more 18-year-olds to study higher-level technical education courses ( which are so vital to boosting our productivity performance ) on a full-time basis , they need access to maintenance support like traditional full-time HE students . <p> We also need to ensure the provider base is robust and weed out all those who wish to defraud students or undermine the reputation of good providers . <p> We need a strategy that brings politicians from all parties together and a commitment for at least 10 years . There is shared ground and this should be an area where we can come together to meet the challenges . <p> It is not that we do n't have any framework ; we still have the Coalition 's 2011 document ' New Challenges and New Chances ' , which set the direction , and we have the rules in the funding guidance . What we do n't have is a strategy that sets the ambition post-Brexit , brings departments together , and establishes an overarching agenda for the devolution of the adult education budget . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> The government should learn from past mistakes and revise its reform timelines so it does n't set the sector up to fail , says Kirstie Donnelly <p> Asking how long it takes to develop and launch a qualification is like asking the length of a piece of string . It depends , among other factors , on whether it is a new qualification or an adaptation , on required teaching and assessment models , and on its expected duration and level . <p> A better question might be : how long does it take to develop qualifications that are truly fit for purpose the purpose being to help learners gain the skills needed for meaningful employment and progression ? Or , as in the present landscape , how long will it take to develop a qualification that aims to fundamentally change the way we deliver professional and technical education ? <p> The government 's latest skills timeline answers this question . It allows just under a year from selecting an awarding organisation to finalising the content , then implies teaching will begin four months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a Whitehall office these timings might seem ambitious yet achievable but here in the real world , they are nothing short of fantasy . <p> Creating qualification content is not a case of sitting in a room , writing . When you set out to develop qualifications that meet the needs of employers , employers need to be consulted ! Professional and technical education must genuinely reflect the latest technologies and practices in industry , but this only happens through close collaboration with employers in the development phase , which takes time . <p> The behavioural changes required to introduce new ways of teaching and learning must also be considered . Moving from a model of teaching underpinning theory to one that prepares learners practically for the workplace involves a mindshift that does n't happen overnight . Practitioners must be convinced of the value of new approaches and additional training and support are needed to embed new content and changes to assessment models . <p> And what about the learners ? Young people , and their parents , need time to understand the benefits new types of education can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into employment does n't happen overnight . <p> I can say all this with the experience of someone who has been there recently . Over three years ago , well before the current government existed , we began to develop our City &amp; Guilds TechBac 14-19 programme at the heart of which sit our technical qualifications , designed to give young people deep industry knowledge through meaningful work experience , alongside the skills and behaviours needed by employers . This decision was about making the right investment and being bold in innovation , without any government intervention . <p> Current government thinking does n't show any appreciation of real timescales or impact <p> Three years later , after extensive consultation with employers , engagement with the FE sector and a year of piloting , we are half way through our first year of teaching . Even now we still have a long way to go in terms of educating the sector itself , as well as end users . We always accepted it would be a significant investment ( over ? 3 million ) , and a long-term one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't show any appreciation of real timescales or impact and it 's worrying that they seem not to be learning from past mistakes . The sector still recoils , remembering the well thought-through reform on which government compromised due to pre-election nerves . Then , the risk was mitigated as we still had a fully functioning qualifications market . If current government plans are allowed through , any last-minute U-turns will leave us without a system to fall back on , which would be catastrophic for the sector and the country . <p> Professional and technical education really matters . It has the power to transform lives , businesses and economies and if we are to create the skilled workforce the UK needs for the future , our sector has a huge role to play . <p> That is why government has to get this right . My plea to them is to look 10 years ahead : be bold , go further than your predecessors , ask for help from organisations like ours who believe the right change is needed but want it to be done properly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gain fiasco ; we need a healthy skills system focused on developing high quality professional and technical qualifications that are given time to succeed . I urge the government to learn from past mistakes , genuinely work with the sector and revisit its timelines so it does n't yet again set the sector up to fail . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Dr Sue , director of policy and external relations at Holex , answers your questions , backed by her experience as principal of Canterbury College and in senior civil service posts in education and skills . <h> Question One : Where have all the adults gone ? <p> David Lammy 's passionate speech on the return of night schools prompted me to ask whether we open our buildings to the community . We were told there was no local call for evening classes and it was mainly self-financing gym use and some ESOL classes . I felt this was not enough but did n't know whether to press further . <p> Answer : You should ask for this to be an item on your next governors ' strategy day . All the evidence suggests adult education will be a growth area in the future and you need to know your local demographics : for example , how many adults locally need ESOL or basic skills support an area that government is fully funding . <p> There is a growing need for people to retrain and/or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market are changing rapidly and there is a growing need for people to retrain and/or change career mid-life . The opportunity to learn in the evening and at weekends will be an important part of the future adult skills landscape . Government has confirmed they will they provide loans for level 4 and above , as well as maintenance loans . That 's a real sign that they see this to be an important issue . <p> If you just think about how driverless vehicles could affect the haulage industry , you soon understand the magnitude of the potential retraining scheme for lorry drivers . <p> Also , do n't underestimate the future market for full-cost education for those who want to learn new skills . Soon the largest slice of the population will be the over 60 's and research shows that people 's wellbeing and life expectancy are enhanced if they continue to learn , integrate and socialise . <h> Question Two : Governor visits to sub-contractors <p> When I walk around our college I see a lot of young people but very few adults or students with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the senior team explained they thought it was best to contract out adult work and LLDD to specialist partners . It started me thinking about governors ' responsibilities and whether I should do drop-in visits to sub-contractors and partners as I do in the college . <p> Answer : As the college owns the contract with SFA , the governor body is responsible for quality and the student experience , including safety and Prevent . Even though these areas might be covered in the contracts with , the governors are ultimately responsible . <p> Out of courtesy you should discuss this with the principal <p> Therefore , you and your fellow governors need to be assured that all the normal policies , safeguards and quality assurance mechanisms are in place and working for any sub-contracted provision . You should also see performance reports for each subcontractor/partner and there should be regular appraisal of whether the partnership adds to the student experience . <p> If there is a visit or pop-in scheme in main college , there should be the same arrangement for sub-contractors . Out of courtesy you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the partner know . Once that is done you should go ahead and make the necessary visit arrangements , following the agreed practice , and if you are not comfortable with what you find , you must speak up and let the chair and principal know .

 <h> News <h> Breaking : SFA delays announcement of allocations for non-levy funding <p> Allocation worth up to ? 440m for delivering apprenticeship training to non-levy employers have been delayed by the Skills Funding Agency , FE Week can reveal . <p> It is understood that everyone who applied for the non-levy funding has been sent a notification on the government 's Bravo e-tendering portal seen by FE Week confirming the delay . <p> It will cause huge sector frustration as the delay , with no alternative date supplied , comes shortly before the apprenticeship levy is due to go live next month . <p> The SFA message stated : " We are notifying you that we have amended the timetable for communication of results to applicants that was published in the specification document for ITT 30190 . <p> " As soon as we are able , we will advise you of the amended timetable through this e-tendering portal ( Bravo ) . If you have any questions , please ask them through this message board . Thank you . " <p> Mark Dawe , chief executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement on Bravo does n't offer any timetable on when providers can now expect to be notified and the ' early March ' deadline looks like it has been missed . <p> " Providers really need to know their allocations so they can properly plan their provision and confirm with their existing employers whether or not their partnerships can continue , many of which have been in place for many years . <p> " More uncertainty is not in the interests of apprentices either who want to be confident that they can complete their programmes without unnecessary disruption . " <p> FE Week reported on March 8 that a key meeting that the SFA was supposed to hold that day , to reach final decisions on which providers will be allocated a non-levy employer funding allocation , had been cancelled . <p> We also learned that no date had been set , for when this would be rescheduled . <p> The SFA had been due to hold the meeting , where amounts that providers would receive was supposed to be agreed . <p> FE Week has asked the Department for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the delay , but they declined to comment . <p> The levy , first announced by the government in July , is set at 0.5 per cent of an employer 's paybill . <p> As outlined in the new guidance , all employers will receive a ? 15,000 allowance to offset against the levy . This means only businesses with a paybill of more than ? 3m will pay . <p> That money raised will be ring-fenced , so it can only be spent on training apprentices and all levy-paying companies will receive a 10 per cent top up on monthly levy contributions . But the government will still allocate funding for apprenticeships with non-levy payers . 
 <h> News <h> Exclusive : National College fails to make Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers <p> A high profile new government-backed national college has failed to make it onto the new Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers , due to what it claims is a " technicality " in its application . <p> The Skills Funding Agency announced the full list of providers that will be eligible to deliver apprenticeships from May this week , but the submission from the National College Creative Industries was unsuccessful . <p> The new college , based in Purfleet , Essex , opened to students in September . It began with 35 apprentices and , according to a spokesperson , has a commitment to sub-contract a further 12 . <p> A statement from the college , sent to FE Week today , said : " The National College Creative Industries will be re-applying to the Skills Funding Agency to be accepted on to the RoATP . <p> " The original application submitted in November did not meet the criteria , in section nine of the 14 main assessment areas , due to a technicality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of March , when the college expects to " be successful " in its reapplication . <p> " This delay will not have any impact for apprenticeships currently being delivered by the National College Creative Industries . <p> " We are working closely with employers and we intend to deliver apprenticeships to non-levied employers , including small and medium enterprises as planned . " <p> The release said the college " remains committed to delivering high quality apprenticeships " , and intends to " pioneer apprenticeships with industry specialist assessors who are dedicated to working with our apprentices and employers " . <p> Those left out in the cold include Bournemouth and Poole College , Hartlepool College , Birmingham Metropolitan College and Northbrook College . <p> In May 2016 , the government announced details of nearly ? 80 million in funding to support the creation of five new National Colleges . <p> The sector skills council , Creative &amp; Cultural Skills , and its employer partners provided the National College Creative Industries with a start-up grant which enabled it to be incorporated and employ industry practitioners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been allocated to it by the government for a " capital project " , but this is still under tender and the college is currently operating out of The Backstage Centre , a theatre venue in High House Production Park . <p> So far only the National College for Digital Skills and National College for the Creative and Cultural Industries are up and running , since last September , but FE Week understands the National College for High Speed Rail and the National College for Nuclear are in development . <p> The National College for Onshore Oil and Gas was expected to open in 2016/17 , but plans were understood to have stalled when Theresa May became prime minister , due to a need to assess what level of support her government intends to give to fracking in the future . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> It can be a struggle to win media coverage , but there are ways to increase your chances of getting heard , says Ruth Sparkes <p> Could it be that vocational qualifications just are n't sexy enough ? Granted , they are getting recognition , but they 're not up there with the likes of GCSEs and A-levels just yet . <p> I mean , I do n't remember seeing female twin or triplet apprentices jumping up and down in strappy summer tops brandishing technical certificates on the front pages of national daily newspapers . <p> FE has suffered over recent times and the apprenticeship ' brand ' has taken a bit of a beating . But ( the levy and register aside ) there is definitely a new positive buzz , and even awareness surrounding apprenticeships that I have certainly not experienced before . <p> Cybersecurity , law , marketing , veterinary nursing , journalism , software development and auctioneering are just some of the new and exciting industry areas for apprentices and we are seeing some fabulous marketing initiatives . <p> This buzz could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FE sector as a whole in the public consciousness . <p> The apprenticeship brand has taken a bit of a beating <p> So , what is it about vocational qualifications that gives journalists ( other than the fabulous staff at FE Week ) that glazed look ? Is it the way we 're ' selling ' that puts them off ' buying ' ? <p> Granted , not everything that happens in the world of FE is newsworthy , however with a hook , a good picture and careful timing you can very often leverage column inches . <p> I 'm running a session at the Annual Apprenticeship Conference 2017 that will look at : <p> The ' dull story ' hall of fame : What is and is n't news . <p> Messages : For parents and apprentices , your message might be ' employers are hungry for certain skills and this is the most cost effective route to a rewarding and well-paid career debt free ' , but the message for employers might be something different . <p> How to leverage current national stories : Topics to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , women in STEM , males in primary schools , aerospace and Brexit . <p> Using a personal or unusual angle : Looking for something unique .

 <h> News <h> No funded qualifications for over a third of approved standards <p> More than a third of the apprenticeship standards that the government has deemed ready for delivery involve no funded qualifications other than a final assessment , exclusive FE Week research has revealed . <p> While the standards have end-point assessments in place , they will not provide apprentices with the chance to accumulate qualifications as they go along -- as was the case with the previous apprenticeship frameworks . <p> This structure was designed to allow apprentices to build up their achievements , meaning that if they were unable to finish the full apprenticeship , they had still gained qualifications ( or partial recognition in the form of units ) from it . <p> It was also considered beneficial when a learner chose to change sectors , as it broke down the course , making transferable skills clearer to employers . <p> But the apparent lack of qualifications within new apprenticeships standards has raised concerns in the FE sector over the transferability of current training , and how well its quality will be measured . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualification " <p> Mark Dawe ( pictured ) , AELP 's chief executive , told FE Week that he believes every standard " should include or itself be a recognised qualification " . <p> " The omission of qualifications from standards will adversely affect the portability and transferability of apprenticeships , make it difficult to make comparisons between standards of level and breadth , and present difficulties in inspecting for quality , " he said . <p> " There is a serious question about whether we have the right assessment with a need for skills and competency to be measured throughout the apprenticeship , rather than placing so much reliance at the end point . " <p> AELP has already recommended that the government 's Technical and Further Education Bill , which is currently moving through the House of Lords , be amended to take this into account . Mr Dawe said he was " encouraged to see both MPs and peers agreeing " with the proposal , even though " ministers still remain unpersuaded " . <p> Andy Walls , head of vocational policy at the Joint Council for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The evidence shows that learners benefit in their careers from obtaining a recognised qualification as part of their apprenticeship , " he said . <p> " Although it is right that employers decide the requirements of their sector 's apprenticeship standard , we want to see learners gaining the advantage that a recognised qualification brings . " <p> Teresa Frith , senior skills policy manager at the Association of Colleges , acknowledged that end-point assessment " does represent a change from the old system " , but said from her perspective the new approach could still be effective . <p> " In some industries , taking qualifications alongside an apprenticeship will still be important but for others the EPA is sufficient and the apprenticeship itself is the qualification , " she said . <p> The previous system was overly complex <p> " Providers need to continually challenge the rigor of the EPA system , so that we can be confident that apprenticeships remain high-quality , nationally recognised qualifications . " <p> A Department for Education spokesperson said the government 's apprenticeship reforms remain focused on " quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a huge number of qualifications that tested incremental progress , but did not necessarily demonstrate that an apprentice was competent at the end of their apprenticeship , " she said . <p> " We have therefore introduced new apprenticeship standards which are developed by employers themselves and rigorously checked . <p> " We have also taken steps to protect the term ' apprenticeship ' from misuse helping us to achieve our target of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 and providing excellent value for money . " 
 <h> FE Experts <p> The government is right to identify work experience as vital to high-quality technical education , but the cost of managing all those placements should n't be underestimated , says Sam Parrett <p> The FE world and indeed the wider education sector welcomed last week 's budget statement , which included a ? 500 million windfall for technical education reforms . <p> Rarely the recipients of such a gift , all of us in FE have been eagerly studying the proposals to find out what it may really mean for us and our students . <p> The introduction of T-levels with 15 career-focused pathways is central to the reforms , which will consolidate thousands of vocational qualifications . <p> So far , so good . I am fully supportive of any initiative which aims to raise parity of esteem between academic and technical education , and I very much hope this will move things in the right direction . <p> Next year we 'll have to triple our work experience coordinators <p> But what will affect colleges , learning providers and businesses even more significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is flagged as being crucial to all vocational education programmes , and it 's a vital theme in the new technical education reforms . <p> All 16- to 19-year-olds working on a new T-level programme will see their study hours increased by 50 per cent to around 900 hours a year , and will be required to do a three-month work placement as part of their course . <p> This is a significant undertaking for employers and colleges , particularly at a time when many businesses are already taking on more young people in the form of apprentices and trainees . <p> FE is generally much better than schools at providing more industry-led learning experiences . Many colleges having excellent links with employers , realistic learning environments and facilities , and teaching staff who are experts in their vocational field . <p> Good careers advice can help young people identify where their passion lies , and is the best way to reach their career goal . <p> But ultimately , if the government is going to realise its ambitious vision for work experience , we need to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must we ensure placements are worthwhile for young people , we need to make sure that employers also benefit in the short term as well as the long term . Having an extra pair of hands can be a hindrance if a student is uninterested and lacking in basic communication skills , but a keen , enthusiastic and motivated student can be a real asset to any business . <p> It also needs to be made easier for businesses to manage their placements and create strategies to ensure the young person gets a meaningful experience , for example : careful monitoring , mutually-agreed objectives and documented outcomes . Employers need to see that the time they are putting in will result in a skilled pipeline of talent further down the line . <p> What should n't be underestimated is the cost of planning , organising , monitoring and managing placements <p> At my college , we are already preparing for the work experience revolution by setting up an employment and skills board , with 11 subgroups covering each industry area . The aim of these groups is to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn provides them with reassurance that our students will be equipped with the necessary skills . <p> Establishing a relationship with a diverse range of employers is not only helping us shape our study programmes effectively , but will also give these businesses an insight into the importance of providing young people with work-related experience . <p> The government is absolutely right to identify work experience as important . However , what should n't be underestimated is the cost of planning , organising , monitoring and managing placements for , in our case , around 4,500 students . <p> Last year we had to triple the numbers of our maths and English teachers , next year we 'll have to do the same with our work experience coordinators ! <p> This is no easy task for an already squeezed FE sector and I ca n't help feeling that the ? 500 million may be a drop in the ocean . <p> However , I do firmly believe that working collaboratively with employers will move things in the right direction for both students and our economy .

 <h> News <h> More than half of apprenticeship standards still have no assessor <p> Too many uncertainties in the new apprenticeship system is fuelling the acute lack of assessment organisations for new standards , according to the boss of their industry body . <p> FE Week research has revealed that more than half ( 87 out of 162 ) of the apprenticeship standards approved for delivery by the Skills Funding Agency still do not have an approved assessment organisation , despite ongoing concerns from sector figures . <p> Responding to these findings , Stephen Wright , chief executive of the Federation of Awarding Bodies , told FE Week that the current apprenticeship system contains " too many uncertainties " , and that awarding organisations are likely to be " cautious " about engaging in any assessment that might " compromise their reputation " . <p> " With the high development cost and the memory of previous failed initiatives it is n't surprising that many awarding organisations have taken a wait-and-see approach , " he said . <p> The lack of clarity around external quality assurance and external assessment could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Implementing the reforms to apprenticeships will require a high level of development and investment <p> Earlier this month , the awarding giant OCR pulled out of delivering final apprenticeship exams altogether , potentially sending out a negative message to others in the sector . <p> " Implementing the reforms to apprenticeships will require a high level of development and investment , and OCR has recently decided that , unfortunately , we will not now be pursuing or developing any new apprenticeship standards that incorporate changes in assessment , " said a spokesperson for OCR at the time . <p> Terry Fennell , the chief executive and responsible officer at the specialist awarding organisation FDQ , told FE Week that there was a range of issues contributing to " a worrying time for awarding organisations " . <p> He agreed that the environment is " uncertain " , and that assessors may not want to " pioneer " services and would " probably wait until the market is more stable " . <p> Mr Fennell pointed out that cost remains a grey area , as there is " still much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He also warned that the EPA at best lacked " sufficient detail " for some standards , but at worst was " virtually undeliverable from an assessment organisation 's perspective " . <p> Graham , managing director of awarding organisation NOCN , said : " There are risks as well as opportunities in the AAO market , and trying to link EPA charges to training costs does not help . <p> " Government needs to encourage the IfA 's employer groups to engage with potential AAOs as early as possible in the development , so that their knowledge and understanding is incorporated at the beginning . " <p> The environment is " uncertain " , and that assessors may not want to " pioneer " services <p> Commenting on FE Week 's findings , a Department for Education spokesperson said : " We continue to make good progress in growing the number of AAOs on the register and are taking action to ensure there is always EPA provision by the time apprentices complete their apprenticeship . " <p> Back in October , FE Week reported that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their plans for EPA were inadequate , after the interim chief executive of the IfA , Peter Lauener , told the parliamentary subcommittee on education , skills and the economy that the SFA had " knocked back quite a lot " of applications . <p> His comments followed FE Week research which revealed there were at the time no approved AAOs for over 40 per cent of learner starts on new standards . <p> This revelation provoked Dr Sue Pember , who stood down as the civil service 's head of FE and skills investment in February 2013 , to label the situation " diabolical " . <p> But in November , Mr Lauener told a roomful of delegates at the AELP Autumn conference that the shortage of approved end-point assessors was not a serious problem . He accepted that the situation was " not ideal " but insisted it was " manageable " . 
 <p> " Off-the-job training must amount to 20% of the apprentice 's contracted employment hours across the whole apprenticeship . <p> " We do not stipulate how this should be spread out . <p> " It can not include time spent on English and maths , or on training to acquire skills , knowledge and behaviours that are not required in the standard or framework . " <p> Thus , if an employee is on a two year apprenticeship and has an employment contract of 7 hours x 5 days x 46 weeks x 2 years that is a total of 3220 contracted hours . Hence , at 20% the minimum off-the-job training would be 644 hours ( equivalent to one day per working week ) . <p> And for current completeness , here 's what version 2 of the ' Apprenticeship funding and performance-management rules for training providers ' says : <p> The 20% minimum off-the-job rule <p> " To use funds in an employer 's digital account or from government-employer co-investment for an apprenticeship , you must have evidence that the apprentice spends at least 20% of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 20% off-the-job training , for example if they need English and maths . It is up to you and the employer to decide how the off-the-job training is delivered . This may include regular day release , block release and special training days/workshops . " <p> Definition of off-the-job training <p> " Off-the-job training is defined as learning which is undertaken outside of the normal day-today working environment and leads towards the achievement of an apprenticeship . This can include training that is delivered at the apprentice 's normal place of work but must not be delivered as part of their normal working duties . " <p> The off-the-job training must be directly relevant to the apprenticeship framework or standard and could include : <p> " progress reviews or on-programme assessment required for an apprenticeship framework or standard <p> " training which takes place outside the apprentice 's paid working hours " <p> Evidencing the off-the-job <p> " The evidence pack must , among other things listed in the funding rules , contain : <p> " evidence to support the funding claimed and must be available to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the 20% ' off-the-job ' training , excluding English and maths , will be quantified and delivered . <p> " details of employment including : the name of the employer and the agreed contracted hours of employment , including paid training and 20% ' off-the-job ' time , the total planned length of the apprenticeship . " 
 <h> FE Experts <p> If employers have to let apprentices out one day a week as the SFA wants , the whole system may grind to a halt , says Chris Taylor <p> The Skills Funding Agency has confirmed its definition of off-the-job requirements for apprenticeships . Apprentices must spend 20 per cent of their contracted work hours , the equivalent of one day per week , off the job to meet funding rules . <p> This has thrown apprenticeships in the UK into turmoil and raises questions about the viability of delivery and take-up by providers , colleges and employers . <p> This requirement will have three unhelpful results : <p> Providers and colleges will be unable to deliver apprenticeships which are now economically unviable . <p> Employers wo n't engage in the levy due to its burden on staffing and resources , and will pay it as a tax . <p> The government will not reach its three million apprenticeship target . <p> Apprenticeship funding simply does not pay enough to train apprentices one day per week for at least a year , excluding maths and English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it took this decision : customer service level two at ? 1,500 , minus 20 per cent for end assessment , equals ? 1,300 . Divide this by 46 weeks , and then again by five to represent one day in five means ? 28 per day . Divide this by seven hours comes out at ? 4 per hour . Which college or training provider can deliver training at ? 4 per hour per person ? This excludes observations and everything else required to deliver an apprenticeship which funding must provide for and forget about quality delivery . <p> This decision will have a real impact on employers and will reduce productivity and operations . There will be additional costs for travel and substance , and not many employers can lose employees for one fifth of their contracted hours for a year or more plus holidays . <p> In the worst case , some employers and providers may withdraw from apprenticeships altogether <p> Using the apprenticeship levy to upskill existing employees is not now an option for most employers and providers across the UK . The programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and employers in those sectors which use day/block release . <p> Many providers and colleges which did not make it onto the register of accredited training providers may now be glad they were unsuccessful , while employers may want to terminate programmes with providers . employers will now walk away and just pay the levy as an additional tax , a simpler option that 'll prove less costly to employers than training and employing apprentices . <p> Some employers and providers may withdraw from apprenticeships altogether , seeing them as simply too unworkable and risky . <p> This requirement needs to be redefined as soon as possible by the SFA to avoid disaster . It needs to ensure apprenticeships are delivered using methods and funding rules which employers want in a technological , post-Brexit economy , especially as many will be directly paying for their apprenticeships sooner rather than later . 
 <h> Roundup <h> LGBT campaigner Peter Tatchell tells students about his 50 years of activism <p> Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell paid a visit to Bradford College last week to talk to students about the 50 years he has spent campaigning for LGBT rights . <p> The 65-year-old recounted tales of his activism over the last half century , including being the 300 violent assaults he has sustained from anti-gay and far-right extremists . <p> Tatchell maintained that " queer freedom is an unstoppable global force " despite citing figures which show that " 73 out of 193 countries still criminalise same-sex relations " during his talk . <p> He appeared as part of Human Rights Day , and this was actually the second time he has paid a visit to the west Yorkshire college . <p> Speaking of the event , Tatchell who runs a human rights organisation called the Peter Tatchell Foundation , said : " There were lots of great questions .

 <h> News <h> Confusion and anger as hundreds of apprenticeship providers left disappointed <p> Training providers without a current apprenticeship contract have hit back against the government 's surprise announcement this morning to deny them direct access to non-levy funding from May , saying their time tendering has been " wasted " and their viability " threatened " . <p> The Government were due to release the results on the 14 March , and until today there had been no information about the delay beyond statements of " in due course . " <p> The recent procurement process for up to ? 440m of funding was said to have been significantly oversubscribed , and the ESFA claimed the postponement would allow it to " review our approach to ensure that we achieve the right balance between stability of supply and promoting competition and choice for employers " . <p> The ESFA confirmed it will extend existing contracts held by current providers until the end of December 2017 to help continuity , but the hold up has frustrated those who were applying for a contract for the first time and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week estimates over 400 main providers on the new Register of Approved Apprenticeship Providers ( a third of the 1,303 ) will now not be able to directly deliver to over 98 per cent of the non-levy employers from May , owing to the pause . <p> All main providers on RoATP without existing contracts will be able to continue to subcontract with a lead provider to access the non-levy funding . However , there is no indication that the tighter subcontracting rules from May , whereby the lead provider must deliver some training for the employer , are also being paused or delayed . <p> FE Week spoke to Liam Ryan , owner and commercial director at First Avenue Training , a specialist training provider for the early years childcare sector , about his concerns . <p> Mr Ryan said : " Ninety nine per cent of our employers are SMEs small- and medium-sized employers so we only applied for RoATP to get the ITT invitation to tender contract . <p> " Like many others we spent a lot of time ( and money for consultancy ) which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He added : " We can continue as a subcontractor for the time being but I 'm not sure that there is currently a viable business model in our sector when you combine cuts in funding rates , 20 per cent " off the job " training and mandatory 10 per cent contributions . <p> " I predict starts will plummet , particularly for 19+ learners , which is a great shame since we just spent two and a half years overturning the last government mistake in the sector ( the mandatory GCSEs in early years ) . " <p> Mr Ryan said the refusal of the ESFA to grant Advanced Learner Loan contracts to providers that do n't have Adult Education Budget funding or apprenticeship contracts was a further problem for his company . " Once again this threatens our viability and I 'm sure that we are n't alone , " he said . <p> Others took to Twitter to express their concerns about the ESFA announcement . Here are some of their comments : <p> only in this world would there be a requirement to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be told it is now on hold 
 <h> News <p> After significant political pressure the Department for Education has added one of the Birmingham colleges onto the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers ( RoATP ) . <p> At least one provider had already gone bust when the register was first published , so FE Week yesterday asked the Department for Education why there had been no revision to the list of providers with permission to start apprentices next month . <p> Today the register was quietly revised , something only clear from the file name which was previously and is now , although the provider that went bust was still included . <p> However , three new ' main ' providers had been added , including South &amp; City College Birmingham . The other two are private training providers : Norfolk Training Services Limited and The IT Skills Management Company Limited . <p> It is understood the change of heart follows a new DfE process to revisit applications in exceptional circumstances . In this case , we understand the rethink came about because of pre-existing Treasury Transaction Unit funding arrangements , which were agreed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable future . <p> In the case of Norfolk Training Services Limited , a source has told FE Week that the decision to overturn the rejection related to the way the RoATP Ofsted grade rules were being interpreted for an inspection which has yet to be published . <p> FE Week was first to report that none of the eligible major colleges in Birmingham ( Birmingham Metropolitan College , Bournville College , South and City College and Solihull College ) had made it onto RoATP when it was first published in March . <p> At the time David Hughes , AoC 's chief executive , said he was " concerned about the exclusion of some high-quality colleges from the register " . <p> And a spokesperson for South and City College said " we were very shocked to discover that our application had been unsuccessful , given our grade two Ofsted report and excellent track record . " <p> Several local Labour MPs had also expressed outrage , along with the shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden and the Labour mayoral candidate for the West Midlands Sion Simon , also reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dromey MP raised questions in parliament with Ms Stuart , the MP for Birmingham Edgbaston , saying their absence from the register was " destroying technical education for 16-year-olds in the West Midlands " . <p> And Mr Dromey , the MP for Birmingham Erdington , asked the skills minister Robert Halfon to meet with the 10 MPs representing Britain 's second city to discuss the issue . Mr Dromey told FE Week that the decision to exclude the colleges " on the basis of the answer to one question is inexplicable " . <p> " The process is fundamentally flawed and it is essential that the SFA thinks again , " he said . Roger Godsiff , the MP for Birmingham Hall Green , said the process for applying to the register " smacked of a box-ticking exercise " . <p> He told FE Week that the Birmingham colleges had been " given to understand that the SFA would engage with them if their application was deficient in some form " but " all of them say that the SFA did n't " . <p> Meanwhile , Richard Burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " shocking and out of order " but added that it " can be nothing other than a mistake " . <p> Sion Simon , the Labour candidate for mayor of the West Midlands , has launched a campaign to overturn the decision , after just three of the county 's 16 colleges made it onto the register . " This decision will all but end technical education for young people in the West Midlands as we know it , " he said . <p> Although the RoATP application process was immediately reopened following its first publication , it is not believed these new additions are a result of a second attempt at applying . <p> At the time of publication neither the college nor the DfE had been approached for comment . <p> So see the next edition of FE Week for further information and reaction . 
 <h> News <p> Tonight , the Institute for Apprenticeships held a launch event in London at Mansion House . The apprenticeships and skills minister , Robert Halfon , was there to deliver a congratulatory speech . Afterwards , against a backdrop of the snap election announcement and as the event continued around us , I had the opportunity for a short interview and asked him three topical questions . <p> The minister said he " was n't going to comment on that " as he " did n't know what was going to be in the manifesto " but went on to say : " I 'm very proud that we 've got 900,000 apprenticeships in our country at the moment . " <p> I pressed him on whether he wanted an apprenticeship starts target to be in the new manifesto , even whether it should be increased to 4m . He said it was " a very good question " but would only add that he " would love millions of quality apprenticeships definitely . " <p> Lack of English and maths policy shift <p> Last November the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AoC annual conference that the policy on forced GCSE English and maths resits for grade D students was n't working . The following month the Ofsted annual report was also critical of the policy that was introduced last year . <p> So , I asked why , as reported in FE Week , the 2017/18 rules on mandatory GCSE English and maths resits remain unchanged . <p> After a long pause , the minister would only say : " If there was n't an election announcement today I would say there is a lot more work to do and watch this space . " <p> Impact of the pause to the non-levy procurement process <p> The Education and Skills Funding Agency was due to share the results of the ? 440m non-levy funding procurement process on 14 March , but after a delay of nearly a month they announced last Wednesday they were ' pausing ' the process until the end of 2017 . <p> Those already holding an SFA contract would have it extended during the pause . But , as reported in FE Week , there are estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May will not have direct access to funding for more than 98 percent of employers , those that do not pay the levy . Many are hoping the agency will also pause changes to the subcontracting rules to allow existing arrangements to continue . Some , those with current allocations that did not make it onto the Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers are also calling for its use to be paused . <p> Despite the promise of further guidance and clarification , nothing has yet been published . <p> So I asked the minister , about the " concern , confused and worried " providers after the pause was announced and what happens now . <p> He said " Well , exactly what we said in the press release that went out . It 's been paused until December " . <p> I pressed the minister on the hundreds of providers that applied for an allocation and now wo n't have direct funding to non-levy funding in May . Do they do bust ? <p> The minister repeated " we paused it until December and we will set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been an election announcement we would set out what was going to happen . " <p> I pressed again , asking what FE Week readers really want an answer to . Does the minister accept that following the procurement pause there are now several hundred apprenticeship providers that do n't know if they have a business from May ? <p> " What I accept is that we 've listened and we 've extended this until December to make sure that we listened to the concerns that were set out and that 's what we 've done . " said the minister . 
 <h> News <h> Government secretly grading all colleges and training providers <p> More than half of providers have been secretly rated by the Education and Skills Funding Agency as posing a potential risk , FE Week can exclusively reveal . <p> They are surreptitiously marked using a four-grade system in the ESFA 's ' profile and assessment ' software tool , which FE Week has discovered listed 563 ( 55 per cent ) of 1,025 private training providers , colleges and councils with agency contracts as either being watched closely by officials or receiving formal intervention , as of January 2017 . <p> The Department for Education has refused to comment on the scheme , but sector leaders who were shown the list of providers and grades have lambasted the ESFA 's secrecy and are now calling for urgent transparency . <p> The four categories included in the PAT are ' formal intervention ' ( red ) , the most severe , ' active engagement ' ( amber ) , ' close watching brief ' ( light orange ) , and ' standard monitoring ' ( green ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it means the government is concerned about their performance and places them under scrutiny . <p> FE Week understands that a total of 73 providers were receiving formal interventions in January , with 299 in active engagement with the DfE , and 191 on the brief . <p> " As a public body there should not be any secretive processes and this should all be transparent to all providers that they fund , " he told FE Week . " This is clearly something the AELP will need to raise with the ESFA on behalf of our members . " <p> David Hughes , the boss of the AoC , said it was " appropriate " for the ESFA to be assessing the financial and overall health of the providers it funds . <p> However , he added that it would be " good for the agency to be more transparent about what the triggers are using to move providers into and out of each category " . <p> He also wants further information to help " understand more how the agency uses these categories for funding decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAT are treated like those with a notice of concern or serious breach , and face having their funding contracts terminated if they do not meet the government 's conditions for improvement . <p> The Department for Education would not provide FE Week with any further details about these categories , or the way they are determined and used . <p> " We do not comment on leaked documents , " said a spokesperson . <p> You can view the full PAT list , which states what category each of the 1,025 providers were in PAT in January 2017 , here . <p> Editorial : What secret grade did you get ? <p> This week we expose the ESFA 's top secret four-level grading system that gets applied to every one of just over 1,000 post-16 providers that they fund . <p> We learned that funding agency staff use what 's called a ' profile and assessment tool ' to assign every prime provider one of four ' intervention status categories ' . <p> On the face of it this seems a well-structured and proportionate approach to intervention , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and concerning -- is that over half ( 55% ) of the providers that it contracts with are of concern , typically based on their finances . <p> This might be something the Education Select Committee , Public Accounts Committee and the National Audit Office will show an interest in . <p> And it 's disappointing that the DfE has refused to explain the basis on which a provider is given a grade or any detail on what they are used for . <p> So we 've published the full list , with providers and grades , on our website -- and hope this will prompt some overdue transparency . <p> The AoC and AELP are united in their expectation the agency should come clean .

 <h> Roundup <h> College sets new record at the Cornwall Teacher Awards <p> Hosted at Truro Cathedral by BBC Radio Cornwall 's Daphne Skinnard , the Cornwall Teacher Awards recognise excellent educators across 13 categories , with accolades up for grabs such as the Lifetime Achievement Award , Outstanding Headteacher and Governor of the year . <p> Truro and Penwith College -- judged outstanding by Ofsted in its most recent inspection -- beat schools and providers to the top spot for Educational Support Worker of the Year , Special Educational Needs Teacher of the Year and Employer Engagement Initiative of the Year . <p> The collection of accolades was quite the contrast to the college 's entry to last year 's awards , which they left empty-handed . <p> Clive James with his award <p> Three Truro and Penwith lecturers also battled it out for Outstanding FE Lecturer of the year , with the accolade going to the college 's deputy team leader for English , Clive James . Mr James , who started working at Truro and Penwith just this year , was shortlisted alongside colleagues Dr Sue Skuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was " someone who makes the students feel as if they have achieved something in every lesson , someone who has made a subject that is sometimes thought of as ' dusty ' , relevant to modern life and inspired his students to study the subject at University .

 <h> Uncategorized <h> Ofsted accused of hiding huge gaps between inspections <p> Ofsted has been forced to deny that it removed inspection dates from its new promotional logos due to the length of gaps between inspections . <p> The inspection watchdog recently released new logos that schools , colleges and providers are entitled to use in their own promotional materials if they receive ' good ' and ' outstanding ' ratings . <p> The decision to omit dates did not go unnoticed , however . <p> " The question why Ofsted has taken the dates off must be asked , " said Mary Bousted , the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers , who pointed out increasing that schools and colleges deemed ' outstanding ' can wait for more than a decade for another inspection . <p> " It could be because the date between inspections is an embarrassment . If I were Ofsted I would n't want to be advertising the length of time between inspections . <p> " I do n't think is an effective way to run an accountability system . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . Its decision to design one for those rated ' good ' amounts to an embarrassing U-turn following sector anger last September , when Ofsted threatened legal action against providers using its logo to promote their grade two ratings . <p> This was n't officially allowed at the time , but many providers had used unofficial logos in their materials without repercussion for years . <p> Ofsted also redesigned its logo for ' outstanding ' providers -- which the best institutions have long been allowed to use . <p> However , inspection dates , which had appeared on previous ' outstanding ' logos , have conspicuously disappeared . <p> A spokesperson for Ofsted would n't comment on whether the introduction of a ' good ' logo amounted to a U-turn , but did acknowledge that FE Week 's reporting had played a part . <p> " We decided the time was right for a review of our logo policy , taking into account all the feedback we have received from providers , which in some cases was brought to our attention by the press , " they said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an unnamed training provider , Ofsted said it would bring legal action to bear if its logo was not removed from all promotional materials within 14 days . <p> Although obscure policy guidance which has been in place since the year 2000 clearly states that " we do not issue a ' good ' logo " , many providers graded ' good ' over the years had used modified versions of the logo in their materials . <p> The move was welcomed by Mark Dawe , the chief executive of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , who described it as a " very positive step " . <p> Ofsted was recently also criticised for allowing huge time gaps between inspections , as we reported last November , when we found that two colleges in England had gone more than a decade without a full inspection -- after they had received ' outstanding ' ratings . <p> More providers have since passed the 10-year mark -- as you can see in table below -- bringing the total to seven , with more imminent . <p> When two formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College in Manchester , were revisited earlier this year after 10 years without inspection , both crashed two grades , and were rated ' requires improvement ' . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> To avoid a conflict of interest , it would seem logical for Ofqual to take over external quality assurance for the Institute for Apprenticeships , but this would put off many organisations wanting to offer end-point assessment , says Simon Martin <p> Apprenticeship standards are intended to drive forward the workforce skills that UK employers have identified for competitiveness in the world economy . Yet many standards do not include any technical or vocational qualifications to benchmark the skills , knowledge and behaviours to be acquired by the apprentice , and even where they do , successfully passing the standard relies on passing the end-point assessment . <p> This means the robustness of EPA , and the quality assurance needed to underwrite that robustness , is a fundamental requirement for instilling confidence in the reliability of the new standards . But this remains highly questionable , given the fragmented approach that is emerging towards external quality assurance of EPA . <p> At the Annual Apprenticeships Conference in March , Peter Lauener , Shadow Chief Executive of the Institute for Apprenticeships , openly reiterated in a plenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apprenticeship quality through its role as the regulator of standards and Assessment Plans . He added that one of the three key features of the new apprenticeship system was external quality assurance of EPAs ; indeed , that IfA itself would ' establish an approach to Institute-led external quality assurance ' . <p> It is far from clear how this is materialising <p> It is far from clear , however , how this is materialising in a market where the employer groups themselves are choosing one of five different EQA organisation types , and moreover where one of these is the Institute itself , alongside the Quality Assurance Agency , Ofqual , professional bodies , and employer-led approaches . <p> Furthermore , in a workshop at the conference , Mike Keoghan , Deputy Chief Executive of the IfA , reported that a key area of concern arising from the sector consultation on the IfA was its role in ' ensuring reliability and consistency of assessments with EQA organisations and the Institute 's role in quality assurance ' . <p> There is , therefore , a core issue that needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted as the professional and industrial Gold Standard that is hoped for . <p> At the conference Mr Keoghan described the Institute as the ' back stop on quality ' . This implies , and it would be reasonable to assume , that the Institute will therefore be the ultimate adjudicator across the mixed approach to EQA ( there are already nearly 25 different EQA organisations ) . Yet the Institute itself is already being chosen by the standards development groups as the most popular EQA route , despite it supposedly being a ' last resort ' option only . It is even more popular than the official qualifications regulator Ofqual . <p> There is manifestly a potential conflict of interest here <p> There is manifestly a potential conflict of interest here . To remedy this , Peter Lauener was clear at conference that the Institute will not employ staff to undertake EQA , but that this will be ' tendered out ' . In plenary and in workshops it was hinted at several times by senior representatives of both organisations that the Institute and Ofqual will be ' talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If Ofqual takes a bigger space in the EQA arena -- for example , by tendering for IfA/s EQA provision -- any organisation looking to offer EPA where Ofqual is nominated as the standard 's EQA choice , has to become Ofqual-registered first . <p> This is a lengthy and daunting process for any organisation ( such as an Awarding Body , for example ) that is not already Ofqual-registered , and in reality has to be completed before even contemplating an application to the Register of Apprentice Assessment Organisations , which is in itself a considerable task . <p> Therefore , unless Ofqual changes its current rules , any move by the Institute for greater Ofqual involvement in EQA is likely to be off-putting for many organisations wanting to offer EPA . <p> Moreover , it will further delay the process , thus amplifying the travesty of current apprentices already following standards that do not have an identified EPA organisation in place -- worryingly , already over half of all ' live ' standards . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Apprentices need help getting the right mental health support in place to give them the best chance of retaining employment once qualified , says Chris Kingsbury <p> It is great to see the mental health of young people so high on the agenda . This is something I notice increasingly as I attend conferences and seminars across the UK . However , we still need a culture shift for them to feel it okay to talk openly about their mental health and seek the right support . <p> Many young people do n't realise they are experiencing symptoms of mental ill-health or are not aware that there is something wrong . They are also afraid to openly share what they are experiencing . <p> With the boost in apprenticeship numbers that will accompany the levy , training providers , colleges and employers are looking at their infrastructure and ways they can support young people with mental ill-health . <p> If mental health is not addressed appropriately , it can have a negative long-term impact on people 's lives . Statistics have shown that when someone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder for them to secure another job -- more even than someone with a physical disability . <p> To ensure equality of opportunity we have to do three things : <p> Provide access <p> First , we need to make sure that they have access to tailored , individual support . <p> Providing mental health champions or mentors is one way . Others are : engaging with local community and mental health teams , seeking support from local NHS provision , or facilitating access to support groups . Colleges must also ensure student services can signpost staff and students to the appropriate services . <p> An apprentice with mental health challenges should have the same career opportunities as anyone else <p> Challenge stereotypes <p> Second , we should be challenging preconceptions of mental health . Colleges and providers can help by creating a positive environment that allows open conversation about mental health and creates a culture of support , not stigma . <p> I have already started to see some great examples of this . For instance , Total People , a not-for-profit apprenticeships and work-based training company , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental health aimed at staff and apprentices . <p> The videos are now posted on all its internal sites and are shown during inductions , meaning that apprentices are fully aware of the support available and can access it when needed . <p> Addressing mental health in a variety of contexts is vital to normalizing the topic and encouraging young people to access support services when needed . <p> Educate staff <p> Third , we should be ensuring that employers , colleges and training providers have a strong understanding of mental health in the workplace . These institutions need a greater appreciation of the challenges that young people experience , coupled with knowledge about how to offer an appropriate system of support . <p> My role at Remploy is to work with organisations to create a culture in which apprentices feel it is natural to talk to someone about their wellbeing and gain the relevant support . <p> Social taboos combined with this lack of knowledge can mean we shy away from offering opportunities to young people with mental health difficulties , but education about how support functions in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and training providers alike . <p> The Access to Work Mental Health Support Service , funded by the UK government and provided by Remploy delivers a tailored programme of vocational support to apprentices . Since 2011 it has supported more than 7,000 people , with more than 90 per cent retaining employment within the first six months . <p> An apprenticeship is such a fantastic opportunity enabling young people to build a long lasting and fruitful career . It is critically important that young people facing mental health challenges have the same opportunity to complete their apprenticeships as their peers . <p> Chris Kingsbury is partnership lead for the mental health support service at Remploy 
 <h> Roundup <p> A budding beautician has taken the first prize in a college fashion competition with her fairy-inspired creation . <p> The College of Haringey , Enfield and North East London hosted a competition for beauty therapy students to create a look based on the themes of history , fantasy or special occasions . <p> Entrants were required to do the make-up , style hair and choose the clothing themselves to complete their creations . <p> Kasturi Tandel , 34 , ( pictured third from right ) who is taking a level two diploma in beauty therapy , used her 10-year-old daughter 's obsession with fairies as the inspiration for her entry and took the top spot -- winning a selection of hair and make-up products donated by Redken . <p> Second place in the competition was awarded to Valbona Bajrami , 31 , and in third was Tudey McKoy , 22 , who both opted to create special occasion looks . <p> Speaking of her creation , Ms Tandel said " I wanted to do something creative and imaginative and so decided on a fantasy fairy look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the inspiration behind it .

 <h> FE Experts <p> As political parties scramble to write their manifestos , carefully crafting their words to minimise the number of broken promises if they get into power , Graham Taylor sets out some suggestions for further education policies . <p> Preserve FE funding <p> If politicians believe their own rhetoric , that education and skills are the future of our country 's economic success , then at least preserve funding in real terms . Pay for this by decoupling the triple lock that increases pensions at a faster rate than workers ' pay -- admittedly not a vote-winner , but fair . <p> Promising to replace European funding for education when we Brexit would be a bonus . <p> Invest in adult learning <p> Now that the EFA and SFA have at long last merged , scrap the funding divide between 16-18 and adults . Too many providers are chasing too few 16-18 learners as school leaver numbers fall , so let us use any funding shortfall here to reskill or upskill adults . We could vire funds in the past so why not now ? <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts . Has every party given up on lifelong learning and the benefits of learning for its own sake ? If the UK is a knowledge-based economy , are we supposed to gain knowledge by osmosis ? <p> The parties are strangely silent on this . Tried and tested professional and technical qualifications , which learners and businesses want , seem to be treated as second class . <p> If the UK is a knowledge-based economy , are we supposed to gain knowledge by osmosis ? <p> Let the customer decide <p> Give employers paying the apprenticeship levy , a payroll tax which threatens jobs , freedom to spend it how they wish . <p> Apprenticeships may not always be the best solution for workforce training needs . Do n't pick favourites ; this only distorts the market . <p> Streamline training budgets <p> Switch training budgets from other government departments such as the Department for Work and Pensions to the Education and Skills Funding Agency , to reduce duplication and waste . <p> Reduce hypothecated funding <p> This leads to underspend or rushed work and is costly in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different names and ministers attached . <p> Publish success rates <p> Success rates should appear on provider websites , in the form of a percentage retention rate multiplied by their percentage achievement rate . This is a simple and understandable quality indicator , unlike the present ( 16-18 only ) performance tables . <p> Make English and Maths accessible <p> Allow applied options as alternatives to the GCSEs . Alternatives are permitted at level three , when students can take English language or literature or a combined English A-level , just as they can take core maths or standard maths , so why not at level two ? <p> Stop sixth-form waste <p> Close all school sixth forms with under 100 learners -- on grounds of both quality and value for money . The next round of area reviews should include small-school sixth forms in the mix . <p> Welcome international students <p> Exclude international and EU students from the net migration count . They are a real asset , particularly for HE . One in 10 world leaders was educated here . Most have fond memories and are pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want ? 
 <h> News <p> The announcement of results of the first ever procurement process for the adult education budget has been delayed until after the general election , FE Week can reveal . <p> An email seen by FE Week was sent to providers earlier today via FASST , the online services hub for organisations working with the Education and Skills Funding Agency , confirming that the Department for Education had " paused " the announcement until after the general election on June 8 . <p> It was signed-off by the " DfE sourcing team " and said : " In the run up to a general election , the ESFA , along with all government departments , has to comply with a series of restrictions imposed on communication activities . <p> " The timetable for announcing procurement results for the AEB has been paused in accordance with these restrictions . We will provide an update after the general election . " <p> Providers that did n't have to tender for AEB funding will have already received their allocations , but those relying on the process for their financial support will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of the Association of Employment and Learning Providers , called for a long-term pause relating to the AEB procurement on April 25 . <p> Mark Dawe <p> He said at the time : " The ESFA have just set a precedent for placing a pause on the non-levy apprenticeship procurement , so why not set aside the AEB invitation to tender for a year and give ITPs an allocation for the year 2017/18 essentially based on what they had before ? " <p> It is thought around 500 training providers will have applied for a share of the AEB , which totals around ? 1.5 billion . <p> But only around ? 250 million of the budget was actually up for grabs through the tendering process , because colleges , local authorities and universities -- which contract with the SFA through a grant funding agreement -- were not affected by recent changes and therefore did not have to tender . <p> FE Week subsequently revealed that the total value of bids lodged through the now-paused procurement for apprenticeship provision allocations for non-levy-paying employers was around ? 1.6 billion , almost four times more than the sum available . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Both Labour and the Lib Dems have made some pre-manifesto pledges on further education , but these should all be taken with a pinch of salt , says Gemma Gathercole <p> The opening salvos of the election campaign have been fired and now we 're getting to the good stuff -- well , at least for policy geeks like me . <p> The messages from Labour and the Liberal Democrats in their pre-manifesto -- and leaked draft manifesto -- pledges on education will , I 'm sure , be welcomed by the sector . <p> FE features in the headline promises from both parties , although the pledges made by the Labour party go further to address the needs of the whole sector . Though the Conservatives are yet to release any commitments on education , it will be interesting to see their pledges . <p> One of my favourite quotes from the epic US political TV show ' the West Wing ' is about campaigning : you preach to the choir , " because that 's how you get them to sing " . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to natural party voters and how much will actually cut through to the general public . <p> It 's good to see the ' Save Our Adult Education ' campaign <p> Labour 's key pledges for education cover the full spectrum of the sector : there are promises affecting schools , colleges and universities -- announcements that I 'm sure will be welcomed broadly . <p> For the FE sector , there is a promise to restore the education maintenance allowance and an increase for the adult skills budget . <p> The increase to the adult skills budget is sizeable : an extra ? 1.5 billion over the course of the parliament , to create a system of free lifelong learning . <p> The announcement talks about providing courses for adults wanting to upskill and reskill . It 's good to see that the shadow skills minister 's contributions to the ' Save Our Adult Education ' campaign have translated into election pledges . <p> In the announcement , the pledges were said to be funded by reversing the Conservative government 's cuts to corporation tax , a figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the announcements in Labour 's press release , I get a figure closer to ? 30 billion . It will be interesting to see the full breakdown in the manifesto when released . <p> The announcements from the Liberal Democrats focus on some familiar areas , including the protection of the pupil premium that they championed in the coalition government . However , their pledges focus much more on the schools sector rather than full breadth of education . <p> A single pledge is made for FE ; a promise to protect FE funding per pupil in real terms . While a welcome promise for a sector that has seen the impact of significant cuts in very recent memory , it is essentially a focus on 16- to 19-year-olds . <p> It remains to be seen what the Lib Dems propose regarding adult education or apprenticeships , which is also missing from these pledges . It seems as though we 'll have to wait for the manifesto ... <p> As with all pre-election pledges , they need to be taken with a pinch of salt ; after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win votes and more importantly , get people to the ballot box to allow them to take power . <p> But the hard part is that delivery needs to happen when in government and the fantastic thing about a forecast , as my accountant sister reminds me , is that it 's only accurate until it 's written down . It 's quickly out of date , either for positive or negative reasons , as the economy is that it does n't always perform as expected . <p> The actual policies that follow will be largely dependent on how the economy performs and/or how much a future government can or will borrow to meet their promises . After all , while " you campaign in poetry , you govern in prose " . <p> Of course , much of the detailed analysis of the affordability of any of these proposals can only come when we have the full manifestos so the full set of promises can be costed . I for one will be eagerly awaiting them , albeit from my sunbed on holiday . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Writing exclusively for FE Week , Shakira Martin , the new president-elect of the NUS discusses her ambitious plans to represent students of all stripes by leaning on her own background in further rather than higher education <p> I sat down for breakfast with my two daughters over the weekend , back to normality after the rollercoaster of NUS National Conference . Finally , I had the chance to reflect on my journey , how my FE college gave me what I needed to put food in front of my kids and how my student union gave me -- a black woman and single mother -- a voice . <p> It was a conference where students -- FE , HE and apprentices from across the UK -- put their faith in me to lead the NUS as president . As just the second president to be elected from FE , following Toni Pearce in 2013 , I want to continue to fight for the voices of the often forgotten FE learners nationally . <p> Since taking office in July 2015 , the theme of my vice-presidency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sceptical of the reviews , but have fought and lobbied government through the NUS ' #FEunplugged campaign to make sure the voices of learners are heard and our rights are protected . <p> As education was changing around us , we had to be at the table making the case for the future of FE we wanted to see . We needed to show what learner voices can do to those who have undermined them for years . <p> The general election gives us a great opportunity to put FE learners in the spotlight <p> Since then , there have been announcements on possible funding for merging colleges , using loans from the treasury to plug the gaps in the sector , the insolvency regime , the post-16 skills plan and T-levels , the apprentice levy and a new Institute for Apprenticeships , which will take on colleges as well from 2018 . <p> Even the terms ' further ' and ' vocational ' education were forgotten about in favour of ' technical education ' . I 'm surprised anyone is able to keep up ! <p> So much reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to student governors who tell me that they have seen two or even three strategic plans for their colleges over the last two years , just to respond to the changing landscape . Providers are being given such little time to pause , plan and move forward . <p> We have to make sure that learners are not forgotten , but seen as equal partners to the needs business in an economy struggling through a chaotic Brexit . <p> Our FE Unplugged campaign has taught us that debt is not solely an undergraduate issue . Learners are feeling the pinch through 19+ loans . Crucial grants such as EMA , disabled students ' allowance and the adult dependants ' grant have been cut over the last few years , putting up barriers for tens of thousands of current and potential students to the education they deserve . <p> The general election gives us a great opportunity to put FE learners in the spotlight . In the wake of the Brexit vote , work is being done to enhance vocational education , but my student movement wants big answers from political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barriers faced by so many to getting a decent education . <p> Last week , the NUS conference promised to run the biggest voter registration drive we have ever held -- and as the president-elect , I plan to make sure we do exactly that over the next four weeks . The voices of every student must be heard at the heart of every election manifesto , and the NUS is runnning a #GenerationVote campaign across both FE and HE . <p> Whoever forms the next government will find me at the front of the queue to number 10 . Alongside Emily Chapman , my excellent successor as VP FE , and the rest of my officer team , we will put a coherent case for strong , active student unions in every provider . <p> We will hold the new government to account over a Brexit which the majority of students did n't vote for , and we will amplify the voice of learners for a generation , both locally and nationally in a country that is forgetting to listen to them . <p> It was FE that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sector to make sure that it does the same for millions of others . <p> Shakira Martin is vice-president for FE and president-elect of the National Union of Students

 <h> FE Experts <p> After Brexit , the government must replace the ? 500 million provided every year by the European Social Fund for people in disadvantaged circumstances , says Shane Chowen <p> It 's only been a month since that windy Tuesday morning when the prime minister announced that the country will face a general election on 8 June . <p> When parliament resumes on June 19 , the new government will have to negotiate Britain 's exit deal with European leaders . <p> But among talk of negotiations , " divorce payments " , trade deals and " " , the next government also has to find ways to align its domestic policy agenda to a post-EU legislature . The Conservatives want a great repeal bill to cut many EU laws from the UK . <p> The new government must also provide some clarity about the future of projects and provision currently in receipt of EU funding , specifically the European Social Fund . <p> The Brexit white paper , published in February , confirmed that projects funded through European Structural Investment Funds , which includes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which have end dates after the UK leaves the EU in 2019 , will still be fully funded . <p> But ? 400 million-worth of projects currently cofunded between the ESF and the ESFA have an end date of March 2018 -- a year before we 're due to leave under Article 50 -- and the 76-page white paper makes no specific reference to ESF at all . <p> Learners and providers have been offered no security or assurances on the future of their funding <p> Elsewhere , there are 19 open calls for proposals for projects funded through the current ESF programme through DWP : Enterprise M3 LEP is looking for projects to improve digital skills for unemployed people , Hertfordshire LEP has ? 1.5 million to invest in upskilling its health and social care workforce , and Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire LEP have ? 5 million available for projects to develop higher-level skills in key sectors . <p> These calls for proposals specify varying end-dates ; some stipulate that projects have to be done by October 2020 , and others " after three years " , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . <p> Providers have the right to know where they stand . Users of the ESF span the private , public and charity sectors . They employ specialist practitioners who work with often the most marginalised and disadvantaged across the UK . <p> At the Learning and Work Institute , the work we 've seen done with ESF funding over the years through the Festival of Learning and the Adult Learners ' Week Awards has been extraordinary . <p> Take Bad Boys Bakery for example . With support from ESF , this programme based in Brixton prison provides skills and work experience to offenders which improves their chances of securing a good job on release . That investment has also led to a dramatic cut in reoffending rates . On average , 47 per cent of ex-offenders reoffend within 12 months of release from prison . For participants of Bad Boys Bakery , that figure is just 3 per cent . <p> Despite this , learners and providers have been offered no security or assurances at all on the future of their funding , which just is n't good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the campaign to protect the kind of learning opportunities that the ESF currently provides following Brexit demands action . The country can not afford to lose the ? 500 million that is invested every year in the life chances and opportunities for people in deprived areas , people with disabilities , older people and ex-offenders . <p> Replacing the ESF with domestic social investment must be central to the next government 's economic and social justice strategies ; whether that 's " a country that works for everyone " or " for the many not the few " . <p> Shane Chowen is head of policy and public affairs at the Learning and Work Institute 
 <p> The Liberal Democrats spokesperson said the party will aim to achieve its target , in part by boosting the number of apprenticeships in " new sectors of our economy , like creative and digital industries " . <p> Most recently available government figures showed that 22,980 employers posted vacancies between last August and March this year -- which was actually down by 810 from the same period the previous year . <p> The total number of employers that posted vacancies over the whole of 2015/16 was 37,560 . <p> " The Liberal Democrats will reverse cuts to frontline school and college budgets by protecting per pupil funding in real terms and introduce a fairer national funding system , which includes protection so that no school loses out , " the spokesperson said . <p> The party said it will protect FE per pupil funding " in real terms " at ? 660 million , and " invest in continuous professional development for teachers " through a ? 165 million cash commitment . <p> The party 's shadow education spokesperson Sarah Olney told FE Week at the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational system is cut to the bone . <p> " This extra ? 660 million to protect FE will ensure that students are not taken for granted . " <p> FE Week checked that this was just referring to 16 to 19-year-old learners , and what in that case did that mean for older FE learners . <p> A spokesperson said : " The figure is for pupils up to the age 19 . But we will be setting out other commitments to support adult learners in our manifesto , which will be out in due course . " <p> FE Week previously asked the Liberal Democrats if they supported the Association of Employment and Learning Providers ' own manifesto call , made on May 3 , for the next government to commit to four million quality apprenticeships over the life of the next parliament . <p> This would be up from the conservatives ' pledge , before the 2015 general election to create three million by 2020 . <p> A Liberal Democrats spokesperson said in response : " We welcome this ambitious target to grow the number of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting out our own plans to for an increase in apprentice numbers when we publish our manifesto . <p> " In the coalition government , Liberal Democrats championed apprenticeships and were proud that more than two million apprenticeships started over that time . <p> " We believe that high quality apprenticeships are an essential part of building the UK skills base . " <p> It would also " set targets to increase apprenticeships for people with disabilities , care leavers and veterans , and ensure broad representation of women , ethnic minority groups , the lesbian , gay , bisexual and trans community , and people with disabilities in all kinds of apprenticeships " . <p> The Conservative Party is expected to unveil its manifesto later this week . 
 <p> Over 800 providers attended the training in April , but the ESFA has never actually published details of this requirement , leaving many to wonder whether it had been scrapped . <p> Despite this , a Department for Education spokesperson confirmed to FE Week that the mandatory training was still necessary , and admitted the government would be writing to the new providers about it shortly . <p> The only communication any of them have had from the ESFA is the notification of their successful applications to the register on May 17 via the government 's tendering portal Bravo , but there was no mention of mandatory training nor the date they could recruit funded apprentices . <p> The ESFA 's updated RoATP web page notes May 17 as the date for delivery for new entrants -- implying starts are acceptable from then , an undertaking impossible for new providers as they have n't yet completed the mandatory training . <p> An ESFA spokesperson told FE Week that " all providers " were " notified of the steps they need to take to set up with our systems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Further communication will be issued shortly , including information about mandatory training and details of their provider manager who will be their point of contact in the ESFA . " <p> Keith Smith <p> In March , the agency 's director of funding and programmes Keith Smith told delegates at FE Week 's event that " any new provider will be required to attend mandatory training " , something that 's " going to happen before any apprenticeship activity starts " . <p> New providers would all " be with an account manager in the agency " for " one-to-one sessions " . <p> He said the agency would then take a " snapshot " of the new provider 's delivery three to six months into their training , at which point they could potentially be taken off the register following a " pass-or-fail judgment " . <p> FE Week understands that the training sessions for providers included in the first round of the RoATP was comprised of one-day sessions which included videos on how they can claim funding . <p> The mandatory training is only for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One person operating from a rented office in Knutsford , Cheshire had succeeded in getting their three companies , Cranage Ltd , Obscurant Limited , and Tatton Solutions Ltd onto the approved ' main route ' register -- even though none of them had run government-funded apprenticeships . <p> An Essex-based private provider was also accepted onto the RoATP despite only being incorporated in February last year , apparently from a residential property . 
 <h> News <h> UTC founds feeder school against Baker trust 's wishes <p> A university technical college that has struggled to recruit students is opening an 11-14 feeder school next door . <p> This comes despite opposition from opposition from the Baker Dearing Trust , responsible for overseeing all UTCs . <p> The school , which will be called ' the Inspiration UTC ' will open in September , operating on the same plot of land and directly opposite Leigh UTC ( pictured above ) in Kent . <p> It will be run by the Leigh Academies Trust ( LAT ) , which already sponsors 15 schools in Kent including Leigh UTC . <p> The school will take 120 students per year who will follow a STEM ( science , technology , engineering and maths ) -based curriculum , and who will win an automatic place at the neighbouring 14-19 UTC . <p> Leigh UTC has struggled to attract students on its own since opening in 2014 . It is rated ' good ' by Ofsted but less than a third of places are filled and it experienced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Stephen Leahey , who will lead both the UTC and the Inspiration Academy , said student numbers at the college " will go up as a result of the new school " . <p> However the new system will go ahead without the blessing of the Baker Dearing Trust , which said it would not grant a licence for schools to operate as UTCs if they include students at key stage three , because " children should not be specialising under the age of 14 " . <p> It is this barrier which forced the Inspiration Academy to open as a separate school , rather than simply creating an 11-19 UTC . <p> The trust sees the new system as a form of 11-19 UTC , though students are able to enter or exit the pathway at three ages -- 11 , 14 and 16 . <p> If students reach the age of 14 and do not want to continue at the UTC , they will be offered a place at one of LAT 's other secondary schools , which are all rated ' good ' or better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary of the National Union of Teachers , said it " does not make sense " to base a new school around efforts to preserve a UTC . <p> " The closure of UTCs up and down the country is evidence that this model of 14-19 education has failed . There is a danger here that decisions that will affect children 's education are being made to support structures rather than learning . " <p> Mr Courtney added that " potentially limiting " the opportunity for a " broad and balanced " curriculum at age 11 is " a backward step " . <p> But Mr Leahey said that while the new school will have a " specific focus " on STEM subjects , learners will be taught a " broad and balanced " curriculum and will study art , PE , languages , and a " healthy minds " programme . <p> He told FE Week that children aged 10 and 11 already " have a passion for STEM " and it was a " no-brainer " to build a school that " meets that need " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many pupils from the key stage three feeder school would want to move to Leigh UTC but " we would not wish them to feel that they were obliged to do so " . <p> The first cohort of year 7s at the new 11-14 academy will initially start in Leigh UTC 's building in September , with its new adjacent building due to be ready after Christmas . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> To circumvent the problem of recruitment at 14 , LSEC is setting up a vocational free school -- a UTC in all but name . Sam Parrett argues that UTCs should be allowed to start at 11 <p> Another week , another story about a failing UTC . <p> Seven of them have now closed their doors and 60 per cent are rated as ' requires improvement ' or ' inadequate ' by Ofsted , so many young people are missing out on the pioneering education they deserve . <p> The former prime minister David Cameron famously called for " a UTC in every single major town " , and the concept of employer-sponsored , specialist and technical education for young people is indisputably a good one . <p> With the country 's ever growing skills gap likely to be impacted further by Brexit , the need for high-quality technical education has never been as great . <p> So why , despite pumping millions of pounds into buildings , marketing and excellent headteachers , are many UTCs failing to recruit ? <p> One barrier is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly been 11 , it is a challenge getting parents , students and teachers to opt for a move in Year 10 . Such transfers will usually happen only if the child is not getting on at school , as opposed to a conscious decision for a well performing student to move . <p> We at LSEC have first-hand experience of this challenge . We established our own direct entry 14-16 technical academy in 2014 , offering 14-year-olds a real alternative to a traditional school route . Students were able to choose a vocational specialism ( engineering , hospitality , childcare ) to study alongside rigorous GCSEs in academic subjects . <p> We reached out to headteachers , explaining who we were and what we could offer . We had hoped schools would then offer impartial advice to their students about the options and act in the best interest of each individual . <p> We have been seen as the place for schools to offload students <p> Sadly , the reality is that we were viewed as alternative provision . Instead of attracting children with a real passion for vocational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideal place for schools to offload students unlikely to pass their GCSEs who would ultimately pull their original schools down the league tables . <p> This meant we were unable to recruit with integrity and realise our key vision : to offer local 14- to 16-year-olds a high-quality vocational alternative . <p> Despite this , we absolutely maintain our belief in career-led pathways , working closely with employers to provide young people with industry experience . <p> In 2014 we were approved by the Baker Dearing Trust to develop a health and wellbeing UTC in partnership with a major local employer and university partners . After some detailed scoping work , and with the benefit of our experience , we approached BDT with the suggestion of allowing us to pilot a new 11-19 model of UTC . We were confident this approach would turn what is a great concept , into a viable and successful school model . <p> Our proposal was duly turned down by BDT , on the basis that UTCs are strictly 14-18 . This was despite our plan to keep all the key elements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curriculum offer with the post-14 specialism . <p> We also embraced the innovative teaching methods and pedagogy showcased by the UTC movement , via employer-led projects and the extended day incorporating enrichment and homework time . <p> Yet despite our obvious passion , our proposal was rejected . I feel this was extremely short-sighted and would question why BDT has n't been put under more official scrutiny in relation to recruitment challenges at 14 and the sustainability of UTCs . <p> We remain undeterred and are now instead setting up a specialist vocational free school in Bromley , which we expect to open in 2020 . <p> This will be a high-performing school for 11- to 18-year-olds specialising in the science , health and wellbeing industry . It is supported by key employers and will help address the shortage of secondary school places in the area as well as skills gaps within this expanding industry . In other words , a UTC in all but name . <p> In the majority of cases , our education system is simply not set up to allow transfer at 14 to succeed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt UTCs would be thriving -- offering young people the real technical alternative employers are crying out for .

 <h> FE Experts <p> Apprentices need to understand why completion is so important , and this needs to be led from the top , says Alan Woods <p> The phrase ' I 've started so I 'll finish ' might be commonly associated with University Challenge presenters , but it also articulates a mental resolve that should be adopted by young apprentices . <p> When it comes to the national apprenticeship agenda , the spotlight has firmly focused on the number of new starts the government will commit to . <p> The recent Association of Employment and Learning Providers manifesto , for example , suggested an increase from three to four million in the next parliament . <p> While getting young people into apprenticeships is crucial in terms of securing employment and creating a skilled workforce , these outcomes are dependent upon one critical factor : the completion of apprenticeship programmes . <p> The real measure of success in apprenticeship reforms is not in the number of new starts but in the number of completed programmes , and as such , it is vital that the next government commits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to stop <p> The most recent figures show that in 2015/2016 , only 67 per cent of apprenticeships were completed . To increase this rate , learners need to be shown that apprenticeships can be engaging , worthwhile , and ultimately rewarding . <p> If we are to achieve this , the learner perspective must be at the heart of initiatives , rather than allowing the national narrative to be too employer-led , or economy-driven . <p> Apprentices ' voices have been somewhat drowned out in all the industry noise . We hear so much about skills gaps identified by employers -- particularly in the STEM sector -- which are perceived to be the answer to improving the UK economy . <p> But learners pursuing other types of apprenticeship have to see the value of completion . We need a top-down recognition of all apprenticeship routes , rather than a STEM-centric approach . If a learner is made to feel that their skills are n't appreciated , that their chosen career path is n't important , or that they wo n't meaningfully contribute to the economy , it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Incentivising a learner to complete an apprenticeship needs to hinge on more than just conceptual support , however . There needs to be a real , tangible end-goal : in short , an apprenticeship needs to represent a direct line of sight to a job . <p> This clear pathway sometimes gets lost in tactical employer positioning . An individual can often be encouraged to undertake the next level apprenticeship immediately after completing their current one , effectively establishing a type of permanent apprenticeship position . <p> In many cases , this is not about providing the apprentice with a substantive job at the end , but so employers can be seen to be doing apprenticeships . <p> This deliberate manipulation of the apprenticeship system needs to stop , or else we risk entire cohorts of disillusioned apprentices who see no apparent end in sight . We need to make sure that employers and training providers are wholeheartedly committed not just to ensuring the learner passes the course , but actually gets a job at the end of it . <p> With that in mind , we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employers should be encouraged to see apprenticeships as an opportunity to retain the very talent they have nurtured ; providers should in turn deliver a programme of excellent teaching that meets employer set standards ; awarding organisations need to make sure quality is upheld and duly recognised . The commitment of all these individual players will ensure that leaners are reassured that they are at the centre of a process which is primarily about helping them . <p> Getting young people into apprenticeships should be celebrated , but we need to remember that crossing the finish line is just as important as starting the race . The way to facilitate this is by ensuring that all routes are valued , and that all routes lead to job opportunities with market rates of pay . <p> The number of completed programmes will serve as the only meaningful indicator of the success of government reforms . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Dr Sue , director of policy and external relations at Holex , answers your questions , backed by her experience as principal of Canterbury College and in senior civil service posts in education and skills . <h> Question One : Advice for chairs <p> I am new to FE but have chaired a charity and found the National Council of Voluntary Organisations useful . Where should college governors look ? <p> Answer : Colleges are exempt charities and the Charities Commission website should be your first port of call . You already know about NCVO and much of the material on their website is useful , but because colleges have a strong business ethos you will also find pertinent items on the Institute of Directors website . However , the material on these sites has not been contextualised for the FE college world . The most useful source is the material funded and supported by the Education and Training Foundation which sits on the Association of Colleges website . This material has been developed by college clerks and chairs and is an invaluable bank of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects and areas most relevant . <p> There is also a relatively new organisation on the scene called the Association of Chairs . They have been formed to support chairs and vice chairs of charities and non-profit organisations in leading their boards effectively and ensuring delivery of their organisation 's mission . They provide peer network , chair-focused seminars , speakers and briefings and resources specifically for chairs and vice chairs . They have also published a supportive document called the Chair 's Compass , which offers guidance on the role and impact of chairs . <h> Question Two : Job share <p> My role as chair of governors is becoming more substantial as I work full-time . I have a governor colleague who wants to job share . Is this possible ? <p> Answer : I can see that in circumstances like the one you describe job sharing or co-chairing could offer a suitable , practical and effective solution . Although not widely practiced in the FE sector , school governing bodies have had the option to do this for a while . First you need to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly disallows co-chairing . If it is silent on the issue then I see no reason why you should n't go ahead . However , the board would need to ensure that any role-sharing arrangement does not lead to a loss of clarity in its leadership . In order for co-chairing to work , there needs to be transparency and trust and probably some work with the clerk to produce a formal programme on who does what . <h> Question Three : Election advice <p> As we receive most of our funding from public sources , are there any election guidelines for governors to follow ? <p> Answer : Colleges are exempt charities and the Charities Commission has produced a clear guide . In summary , campaigning and political activity can be legitimate and valuable activities for charities to undertake . However , it must be undertaken by a charity only in the context of supporting the delivery of its charitable purposes . Unlike other forms of campaigning , it must not be the continuing and sole activity of the charity . <p> Charities can campaign for a change in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the charity 's purposes . Therefore , as long as you are even-handed , do n't financially support in any way and/or do not try to influence results , there is no reason why as a trustee or governor you can not make your views known to prospective MPs . Ensuring the financial stability of your college is a clear part of your role and prospective MPs need to know what impact government policy or proposed policy changes have on colleges . Remember any material used must be factually accurate and have a legitimate evidence base . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Labour manifesto pledge : Abandon plans for new technical colleges and use funding for more teachers <p> Sue Pember argues AGAINST <p> The Conservative and Labour manifestos both advocate investing more in the future of young people and both embrace the concept of lifelong learning , which is to be applauded . However , the way they suggest this can be achieved is different and one of the main variations is around Institutes of Technology . Conservatives would make them degree level institutes and Labour would not create them at all but invest in more teachers instead . <p> From my experience , there is nothing more fulfilling than working in an environment that is dedicated to a single discipline , where the teachers and students are immersed in the subject . Creativity and innovation flourish and those who are new progress quickly when they can see the accomplishments of those further along . Therefore there is a role for Institutes of Technology but whether they are separate institutions or they share buildings and backroom support with other programmes is a secondary matter . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years and , although there has been some confusion over scope , most have accepted the definition described in the area review guidance and the Industrial Strategy green paper , which also confirmed the previous announcement of ? 170m capital funding to support their creation . <p> However , the Conservatives now seem to have re-interpreted the policy and instead of building on that previously published -- which was to establish a new network of prestigious Institutes of Technology and national colleges to deliver high standard provision at levels 3 , 4 and 5 -- they now state in their manifesto that they will establish new Institutes of Technology , backed by employers and linked to leading universities , in every major city in England . They say these " Institutes of Technology will provide courses at degree level and above , specialising in technical disciplines , such as STEM , whilst also providing higher-level apprenticeships and bespoke courses for employers . They will enjoy the freedoms that make our universities great , including eligibility for public funding for productivity and skills research , and access to loans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure this change will help the goal of ensuring more people have high skills in technology . The previous remit is still required , there is still a need for a progression route and new investment focused on level 3 , 4 and 5 will be essential . <p> While Conservative party manifesto drafters were redefining Institutes of Technology , the Labour party drafters were building on a UCU call from earlier in the year saying : " If government wants to support technical education it should invest in our further education colleges who desperately need thousands more teachers , rather than another set of gimmicks . " <p> If government wants to support technical education it should invest in our further education colleges <p> To support this approach , Labour in their manifesto state they would abandon Conservative plans to once again reinvent the wheel by building new technical colleges , redirecting the money to increase teacher numbers in the FE sector . <p> However , whether we rebadge all or part of HE or FE institutions to become Institutes of Technology or create new ones is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of proposals is that both political parties recognise that as a country we need more technically qualified people . <p> To fulfil that commitment , they will need to support expansion , they will have to invest in physical resources to make that possible and also increase the number of teachers . In doing so , they will also need to consider the requirements of T levels and increasing student hours to 900 a year . Again , this will increase the number of teachers needed . The priority will be to find them , recruit them and ensure these teachers have the advanced skills needed to teach at these levels and have industry relevant experience . And any new proposals must also cover the costs of teacher development and retraining . 
 <h> News <h> U-turns on mandatory vetting of apprenticeship qualifications <p> In an embarrassing U-turn , the National Skills Academy for Food and Drink has dropped controversial plans for mandatory vetting of apprenticeship qualifications . <p> The body , which leads the food and drink apprenticeship trailblazer group , recently announced that any awarding organisation wanting to develop their own versions of qualifications included in food and drink standards must submit a draft to the chair of the group for approval . <p> But the NSAFD was forced into a climbdown after FE Week pointed out that the policy contravened the Institute for Apprenticeships ' rules . <p> The announcement had sparked fears that the NSAFD , which happens to own the only awarding body offering the qualifications in three of the standards , was trying to restrict the market . <p> After its change in heart , NSAFD 's chief executive Justine Fosh told FE Week that there " had been a widespread understanding in what is a complex landscape , that the employers had a responsibility , to confirm that proposed mandated qualifications were in line with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> She continued : " However , in dialogue with the it is now clear that this can be done as a voluntary , rather than compulsory approach , " Ms Fosh said . <p> She also gave her thanks to FE Week " for identifying and helping clarify the situation " . <p> Four standards developed by the food and drink trailblazer group and approved for delivery include mandatory qualifications . <p> The qualifications for level two food and drink process operator , level three food and drink advanced process operator , food and drink maintenance engineer at level three are currently only offered by Occupational Awards Limited , which the NSAFD bought in July 2016 . <p> Terry Fennell , the chief executive of awarding body FDQ , which plans to submit a version of the diploma mandated in the level two food and drink process operator standard for approval by Ofqual in June , hit out at the NSAFD . <p> " A free and open market must come before self-interest , " he said , criticising it for attempting to " arbitrarily extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of restricting or sanctioning qualifications that may offer competition to the version already offered by its own AO " . <p> Mr Fennell said the FDQ version of the food and drink process operations qualification would " comply with Ofqual general conditions of recognition and align with the IfA approved assessment plan " . <p> He continued : " With validity assured by the regulatory and responsible quality authorities it is for employers and providers to decide , on which qualification they wish to procure . " <p> The IfA was unable to comment on the controversy , due to the purdah , or period of silence , it is obliged to maintain during the run up to a general election . <p> Guidance published by the IfA makes it clear that trailblazer groups ca n't limit which awarding bodies can offer mandatory qualifications . <p> Where a standard includes such a qualification , it " must name the qualification in terms which do not ascribe it to a specific awarding body so that any awarding body which is Ofqual regulated and offers that qualification can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulated qualification , you should not specify a particular awarding organisation , as you could otherwise prevent another awarding organisation from developing a qualification for the standard . " <p> In March , FE Week reported that the UK 's food and drink apprenticeship frameworks could be switched off against the government 's wishes . <p> The NSAFD , which retains the powers of an issuing authority from its previous incarnation as a sector skills council , ran a consultation on whether or not to cancel the frameworks it administers . <p> Details of " any actions to be taken is expected in April " , according to its website -- but nothing has yet been published .

 <h> News <h> Employers slam " inordinately long " development time for apprenticeship standards <p> Employer groups have complained about the " inordinately long time " it has taken to develop the new apprenticeship standards , some of which were first published over two years ago but are still unready for delivery . <p> FE Week analysis has found that 16 apprenticeship standards published on the gov.uk website between April 2014 and March 2015 have still have not had an assessment plan passed by the Institute for Apprenticeships , meaning they can not be finally approval for delivery . <p> This process seems actually to have slowed since the Institute took responsibility for the standards , with the number of new assessment plans approved per month rising from two to six between January and March this year , but dropping back to just one in April when the IfA began its work . <p> A further three assessment plans were published in May , but there have been none so far in June . <p> Keith Donnelly , a business development manager at facilities and construction services company Carillion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FE Week : " It has taken an inordinately long time to get our carpentry/joinery apprentice standard and assessment plan developed , approved and ready for use . <p> " In my opinion the main reason for the delay has been that the official guidance and rules surrounding the content and structure of assessment plans have continually changed over the last few years . " <p> He continued : " I am absolutely amazed that I have still been able to maintain the interest and support of the employers in my group for this length of time , but their frustration is now at a critical stage . " <p> FE Week enquiries revealed employers working on the beauty professional apprenticeship standard were similarly exasperated . <p> Hilary Hall , who is chief executive of the National Hairdressers ' Federation , said developing the standard itself had been " a relatively quick process " , but " developing assessment plans has turned out to be much more time-consuming " . <p> Their frustration is now at a critical stage <p> " There have been many policy changes and changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reworking , " she said . <p> " For all the trailblazer groups who started in the early phases , there has been the added complexity of wholesale changes to funding mechanisms . " <p> She added that although " employers are supposed to be ' in the driving seat ' " , changes to government policy have " continually got in the way " . <p> A separate spokesperson for the beauty trailblazer group said despite the " frustration " caused by " a number of policy changes in recent years " , it remains " committed to quality apprenticeships that deliver value " , adding : " We have submitted to the Institute at the end of May and now await the outcome . " <p> FE Week put the concerns raised by the trailblazer groups to the IfA and was told the organisation is " looking at the end-to-end process as part of the development of our new website " . <p> A spokesperson said the site , which will be independent from gov.uk , will " improve the visibility of standards and assessment plans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also speed up the process through web based development and submission processes , " she said <p> Of the other standards first published two or more years ago , the security first line manager and the building services engineering craftsperson standards are now close to being ready . <p> Donna Allan , the chair of the security standard 's apprenticeship working group , and head of learning and development for security company G4S , said : " The standard is in place and we are working with assessment bodies and qualifications regulator Ofqual to allow learners to start by September . " <p> Lindsay Gillespie , a skills development and policy coordinator at the Building Engineering Services Association , who is the trailblazer contact for the sector 's craftsperson standard , said on June 6 that it had " recently received final sign-off from the IfA " . <p> " It has a further check to go through due to the general election , but should be published shortly , " she added . <p> Kristin Watson , director at EY and a trailblazer contact for the professional accountant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard had been designed " some time ago " , the trailblazer committee had been " working on other levels in the meantime " . <p> She added that it had been revised " quite significantly " , but the team was " close to finalising " the work . <p> Meanwhile , a spokesperson for People 1st , an employment and learning organisation which has been involved in developing apprenticeships for in the hospitality sector , said the trailblazer group had been developing seven new standards in total and had prioritised level two and three standards , which have gone live . <p> " The level four hospitality manager assessment plan is subject to some final revisions in response to industry feedback and is currently being brought in line with the new guidance . " <p> She said the group intended to submit this standard to IfA for approval " at the end of June " , followed by the assessment plan for a level four senior chef culinary arts standard in July . <p> The trailblazer contacts for six further construction industry standards and one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded by the time of going to press . <h> Case study : two years and seven months of waiting <p> The level three early years educator apprenticeship standard has faced particular difficulties since it was first published in November 2014 . <p> The standard initially required English and maths GCSE at grade C or above , but a sector campaign called was launched in April 2016 in an effort to prevent this . Led by groups such as the awarding organisation Cache , it called for level two functional skills to be accepted as an alternative qualification for entry onto the apprenticeship . <p> A consultation was subsequently launched in November 2016 by Caroline Dinenage , then secretary of state for women , equalities and early years , into which literacy and numeracy skills are required for EYEs . <p> She then gave her support to the campaign and it ultimately succeded . In March this year the government confirmed it would broaden the apprenticeship standard to accept level two qualifications including functional skills . <p> But these changes undoubtedly had an impact on the process for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U-turn , the employer-led early years apprenticeship trailblazer group was disbanded by the Department for Education , due to what a spokesperson described as " slow progress " . <p> Fay Gibbin , training manager at the Busy Bees Training Academy , is now part of the new childcare apprenticeship trailblazer group . She told FE Week : " The assessment plan for the EYE level three apprenticeship standards is due to be submitted to the sector for consultation in July , which all employers will have the opportunity to provide feedback and help shape the assessment plan . " Consultation and gathering feedback from industry professionals around the changes is an important part of developing any set of standards . " <h> IFA proposals to tackle the delays <p> Clearer expectation-setting at the outset , including the Institute and trailblazer signing up to an ' Expectations of the role ' document . <p> Review of proposals , standards and assessment plans submitted for approval to identify those that require additional work .

This will halve process time . <p> An offer for the trailblazer chair to participate in the approvals meeting to answer questions in the support for trailblazers , including access to assessment specialists when needed . 
 <p> The Conservative manifesto again included a commitment to deliver three million apprenticeships by 2020 . It 's easy to see why . It is clear and comprehensible pledge which works well for a party seeking to rebrand itself and pitch for the votes of ordinary people . But it is a bad policy which risks driving a focus on quantity alone , potentially at the expense of quality . <p> Even before the recent reforms to the apprenticeship system , there were concerns about the focus on quantity over quality . The growth in apprenticeships in recent years has been driven by a surge in the number delivered at lower levels . Most apprenticeships are at level two , and 94 per cent are below level four . While the numbers of higher and degree-level apprenticeships is growing , they are a fraction of the total . <p> The labour market returns for vocational qualifications at level two are relatively poor . We may be less concerned about poor wage returns for low-level apprenticeships if they lead to higher-level qualifications , but for too many the level two apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system more employer-led , the government has introduced the levy , which will raise ? 3 billion from large employers by 2020/21 , delivering a huge boost to employer investment in apprenticeships . At the same time , the government has put employers in charge of designing apprenticeship standards and removed the requirement for apprenticeships to contain a recognised qualification . <p> The levy is a welcome recognition of the need to intervene to boost employer investment in training . UK employers invest far less in training than our EU neighbours , and investment has declined . However , there is a risk that under the new system employers will seek to recoup their levy funds by rebadging existing training as low-level apprenticeships , which offer limited benefit to the individual , and limited progression . <p> Labour committed to keeping the apprenticeship levy , but not the target . It would double the number of apprenticeships delivered at level three . In 2015/16 , there were 191,000 apprenticeship starts at this level , 37 per cent of the total . They have also pledged to guarantee trade union representation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next government needs to focus not just on the quantity of apprenticeships , but on the quality of training and how employers are using skills in the workplace to boost productivity . <p> While employers should be given a role in shaping the system , empoyees deserve a say too <p> The arbitrary target should be abandoned , with the focus shifting to quality and progression . The government should drive up both the proportion of apprenticeships delivered at level three , four and above , and ensure that level two leads to career pathways and higher qualifications . There should be robust monitoring and reporting of outcomes following apprenticeships , to ensure that they are delivering strong wage returns and progression to higher level qualifications . <p> We also need to look again at the governance of the system . There are benefits in an employer-led approach and it might work well in high-skill sectors with a strong sense of occupation formation and a collective commitment to training the next generation of employees . However , it is less likely to work in the low-skill , low-productivity sectors which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the low-quality provision . <p> As part of a modern industrial strategy , we must develop strong sectoral institutions to drive a collective commitment to skills . These institutions should support demand for , investment in , and use of skills as part of a drive to boost productivity . While employers should be given a role in shaping the system , employees deserve a say too , both at sector level , and in relation to the way standards are set through the Institute of Apprenticeships . <p> We should learn from the most successful apprenticeship systems on the continent , which are characterised by a social partnership approach , with government , employers and unions working together to ensure the system delivers high quality training that works for all . While employers are vital in shaping the system , employees must be given a voice too . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Conservative manifesto pledge : Continue with the target of 3m apprenticeship starts by 2020 <p> Mark Dawe argues FOR <p> Fears over quality are misplaced : three million is a modest target , but the right one , claims Mark Dawe <p> The Conservatives were right to retain their 2015 pledge of three million apprenticeship starts by 2020 . Even without the subsequent levy-related reforms , the original target was always going to be a fairly modest goal , especially if we recall that there were over 2.5 million starts during the coalition government of 2010-15 . <p> Nor does the three million figure present the scale of challenge , or tension over quality , that some observers want us to believe . Three quarters of apprenticeships are delivered by independent training providers , and the latest Ofsted annual report found that 82 per cent of ITPs were good or outstanding . The government 's own ' Get in , Go far ' campaign also rightly stressed the positive outcomes that apprenticeships generate for both employers and young people . <p> The worries about using starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggesting that they represent the ideal measure of success , but a switch to a programme completions target would be a mistake . <p> Since the May administration entered office , ministers have referred to apprenticeships as a " ladder of opportunity " and a driver for social mobility , and AELP has always stressed the programme 's importance in terms of social inclusion . If we moved to a completions target , then employers and providers would shift their recruitment of apprentices to only those most likely to complete , when presently there are thousands of young people who start an apprenticeship from a position of disadvantage who then make amazing progress and go on to build a successful career for themselves . <p> In the same vein , ministers deserve credit for recognising that level two apprenticeships provide a vital starting point for many young people and the social mobility agenda demands that there should be no departure from this policy . If the new ministers get a grip on the current reform issues after the election , employers and young people can look forward to benefiting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifesto started by setting out ' five giant challenges ' that Britain has to meet and we believe that skills and apprenticeships have a fundamental role to play in overcoming all of them as follows : <p> The need for a strong economy : Improved productivity through increased skills <p> Brexit and a changing world : Support many industries in replacing their workforce by making lower-level skills training available <p> Enduring social divisions : Availability of training opportunities no matter where you live , whatever your starting point <p> An ageing society : Making retraining and apprenticeship opportunities available to anyone whatever the size of employer <p> Fast-changing technology : Proper investment in digital skills development at all levels , embedded in all programmes . <p> The emphasis on making opportunities available wherever you live is why AELP is pressing for properly sustained and guaranteed support in the non-levy-paying business community -- which is not just a reference to apprenticeships . But above all , the three million apprenticeships target should not be achieved with apprentices only employed by levy-payers . We need guaranteed apprenticeship funding for non-levy-paying SMEs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and the non-levy-payers on the apprenticeship system as soon as possible in order to generate a genuine employer-led system . An immediate review of the impact of employer contributions on the SME apprenticeship starts is also required . <p> On quality , the Institute for Apprenticeships should work with key stakeholders to ensure that all existing and new apprenticeship standards are fit for purpose , their assessments are valid , reliable and available , and there is adequate funding to deliver a quality programme . Until these criteria are met , apprentices should n't be started on new standards . <p> Mark Dawe is CEO of the Assocation of Employment and Learning Providers 
 <p> The manifesto pledge to support apprentices with discounted train travel is hard to argue against -- but does it go far enough ? <p> We think not . The pledge seeks to solve the problem of young people being put off from taking an apprenticeship because they ca n't afford the associated travel costs . However , the real issue stopping many young people signing up for apprenticeships is the paltry wage rate of just ? 3.50 per hour . <p> If the next government really wants to put apprenticeships on the map and demonstrate to school leavers that they are a viable , credible career pathway to quality employment , they must pledge to raise the apprentice pay immediately . <p> Boosting apprentice pay is something EEF , the manufacturers ' organisation , has called for in its recent submissions to the Low Pay Commission . We see a strong argument to protect the apprenticeship brand and safeguard quality admissions by increasing pay , alongside other incentives to attract more candidates such as the proposed discounted travel initiative . <p> Governments have never set out what they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be done . Quality should be determined on the positive outcomes achieved : long-term employment , opportunities for career progression , salary thresholds . Importantly , these are influenced by factors during the apprenticeship , including the length of the apprenticeship , the level of training and what is paid to the apprentice during training . <p> So to what would we increase pay ? The age-specific minimum wage rate . Such a move wo n't complicate matters , it will simplify them . And what employer would n't want an easier life after the raft of apprenticeship reforms , in particular the apprenticeship levy ? <p> The apprentice rate is currently set at ? 3.50 per hour , applying to apprentices under the age of 19 or in the first year of their apprenticeship . Any apprentice outside these parameters is paid their age-specific rate . <p> This is easy to understand if the apprenticeship on offer is 12 months long , where no matter what age the apprentice , they are entitled to ? 3.50 per hour . Not so easy when your apprenticeship , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An apprentice starting aged 25 would be eligible for ? 3.50 per hour their first year , but that would increase to ? 7.50 per hour in the second year when they become eligible for their age-specific rate . <p> Increasing pay could attract better quality candidates <p> So why not make it easy and simply pay apprentices their age-specific rate from the start ? Those employers that do recruit apprentices aged 16 would pay ? 4.05 until they turned 18 , which is not a huge hike up from the current apprentice rate . <p> And if the apprentice rate is to do what it was set out to achieve at its introduction -- strike the balance between a minimum wage level that prevents the exploitation of apprentices and wage costs being so high that they reduce the opportunity for employers to offer young people training and employment -- then this is a fair argument . <p> But it 's not just about making things easy . Increasing pay could attract more and better quality candidates to take apprenticeship vacancies . We know manufacturers plan to increase apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers doing the same , however this will come to nothing if it is not met with demand . <p> Of course there are major challenges to tackle careers provision in schools and move parents away from the mind-set that apprenticeships are for other people 's children , but increasing pay is surely an attractive selling point ? <p> Our own pay benchmarking data and previous government apprentice pay data reveals that pay for engineering apprentices is almost double the minimum rate . On top of that , apprentices in engineering are more likely than others to receive bonuses as they progress on the learning pathway . We know pay is not the problem in our sector . Our industry needs to shout louder that pay in manufacturing and engineering is higher than average , but in addition we also need to lose the tagline that the apprentice rate is still just ? 3.50 per hour . <p> So , by all means offer discounted travel for apprentices , but a real boost to apprentice pay would more than pay for the bus . <p> Verity O'Keefe is head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Both were for services to FE . <p> A popular new recipient of the MBE will be Gill Clipson , who was a deputy chief executive at the Association of Colleges from 2013 until March this year , when she retired . <p> David Hughes , chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said Ms Clipson had " been a champion of the sector for many years " and " thoroughly deserves " the recognition . <p> He gave his congratulations to all the FE winners , saying : " College staff work tirelessly to provide high-quality education and training for their students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other new MBEs for service to the sector went to Pat Carrington , principal of City College Peterborough ; Kevin Clancy , lately head of construction at York College ; and Gareth Higgins , managing director of KMF precision sheet metal ltd , for his work with apprenticeships . <p> The British Empire medal has been awarded to FE stalwarts Natasha Dalton , tutor at City College Peterborough ; Franklyn Harris and Amanda Scales , learning ambassadors for the Learning and Work Institute ; Dr Samantha Healy , campaign director , the 5% Club and QinetiQ ; and Chris Syrus , founder , Syrus Consultancy CIC . <p> Dr Susan Pember , director of policy and external relations at Holex , said she was " delighted " to see adult education and lifelong learning recognised amongst the prizes . <p> " We know that all these individuals have dedicated not only their working lives , but also much of their own time to inspiring adult learners , " she said . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> With Edward Timpson a shock casualty of the election , we ca n't let his SEND overhaul drop off the agenda , says Clare Howard <p> Edward Timpson , the minister overseeing a complete overhaul of the Special Educational Needs and Disabilities ( SEND ) system , lost his seat at the election . Widely respected for his dedication and passion , he will a hard act to follow . <p> It remains to be seen how a new minister will affect the future policy , but what lessons can those working to implement the SEND reforms learn from the election itself ? <p> 1 . Negative campaigning does n't work <p> Those that ran the Remain campaign during the EU referendum admitted their biggest mistake was to focus on the negative consequences of Brexit . <p> But Theresa May 's general election campaign made the same mistake , and voters -- especially the young -- ignored the screaming headlines . <p> Those of us implementing reforms must take heed . Dame Christine Lenehan and the team working on the review of independent specialist schools and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negativity from all sides , and more should be done to focus on common ground , to produce the outcomes we are all working towards . <p> 2 . Leaders need to be inclusive , approachable and visible <p> One of the many talking points of the campaign was Ms May 's leadership style : the repetition of " I " rather than " we " , the no-show in the debate , the closed inner circle , and the lack of consultation with cabinet ministers on key policy lines . Contrast Jeremy Corbyn 's open rallies and straight-talking leadership style , which caused even his fiercest critics inside the Labour Party , who believed him to be unelectable , to eat humble pie by the end of the campaign . <p> With a disparate and uncoordinated SEND system involving 150 LAs handling high-needs budgets , mainstream and specialist FE providers barely coping with increased administrative costs and reduced budgets , increasingly frustrated parent and community groups , and around 25,000 FE students in the middle of it all , the question is : do we have the leaders across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire and motivate ? <p> 3 . Confidence can become a weakness <p> There 's a fine line between confidence and arrogance . Ms May displayed both during the course of the campaign , and the electorate refused to be told what to do . <p> Let 's make sure we do not fall into the trap of repeating mantras and soundbites from the SEND code of practice , without clear action . The latest SEND data shows that there is a long way to go before the system is truly person-centred , transparent , easy to navigate , and efficient . <p> 4 . Beware assumption and echo chambers <p> With social media now the main source of information for many , we are all guilty of confirmation bias : surrounding ourselves with views , memes , articles and videos we agree with , and ignoring contrary evidence . <p> There are too many assumptions and false perceptions driving SEND policy , particularly relating to post-19 provision , and these need to be challenged . <p> 5 . Do n't mess with the young , the old or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , FE and skills , the dementia tax or the future of the NHS , the Conservatives underestimated the capacity of people to register a protest . For SEND policy and funding , now could be the time to work out a new approach to joining up health , education and social care budgets so that post-16 and post-19 students can receive integrated programmes that result in savings in the longer term . <p> 6 . Protect core values <p> Any reflections on the campaign can not ignore the atrocities in Manchester and London . The response of everyone involved demonstrated courage , unity , and determination not to allow these events to interrupt the democratic process . <p> The young people we work with demonstrate a similar unbreakable sprit , and whoever takes over from Edward Timpson must show courage of convictions , work hard to protect the principles of the Act , and finally achieve the vision that he set out . 
 <h> News <h> BREAKING : Apprenticeship vacancy adverts plummet in May <p> Update : At 17:45 the DfE responded by saying the data they published for May is not full the full month . A Department for Education spokesperson said : " The data published did not reflect the full vacancy figures for May , and was only for the first few days of the month . The updated data covering the whole of May will be published shortly with an explanatory note , as part of the June release . " <p> Latest government figures for apprenticeship vacancies , published this morning , appear to show a dramatic fall for the month of May , when the levy reforms kicked in . <p> As few as 10 employers posted around 70 vacancies in May , compared to 2,220 employers and 13,960 vacancies the previous month . That 's a massive fall of 99.5 percent , although FE Week believes May 2017 figures represent only a partial picture . <p> Comparing the April 2017 release of data , which subsequently rose , the fall on a more like for like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last May there were 17,310 vacancies posted by 3,490 employers ( see below ) . <p> These figures will be a great concern to those that feared the levy reforms would result in employers switching their provision to support only existing employees . <p> AELP chief policy officer Simon Ashworth said : " These deeply concerning figures simply confirm what our members have been telling us over the last few weeks , namely that apprenticeship start figures have plummeted since the levy started . Levy-paying employers are holding back on their starts and the predicted calamity with the size of the non-levy funding allocations is being realised . <p> " We are also getting a lot of feedback that employers in some sectors are refusing to pay the 10 per cent co-investment contribution and in other sectors there is definitely a shift to high-value management training rather than highly valuable level 2 and 3 sector-specific apprenticeships . We hope that the government would want to use our expertise and intelligence to help determine what action needs to be taken . " <p> Interestingly one of our consortia members has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only realised when they looked into why they 'd received so few applications . They were told they were removed as they did n't have a direct contact , however , we are in the same position and have n't been removed . Could this be happening to other providers without their knowledge ? 
 <h> News <h> ' Maximum disruption ' criticism of strike picket line planned for enrolment day <p> Striking union members have been criticised for trying to cause " maximum disruption to the community " , by taking the unusual step of holding their industrial action on a college 's weekend enrolment day . <p> The University and College Union announced today that strikes will take place at the Willesden and Wembley campuses of the College of North West London , on Wednesday ( June 28 ) and Saturday ( July 1 ) , in a row over the sacking of their colleague . <p> The union openly admitted that the aim of the latter strike will be to " disrupt an enrolment day for students looking to start courses in September " -- with potential learners and their parents likely to come into contact with picketing staff . <p> It provoked a college spokesperson into saying : " It is disappointing that UCU has chosen to target key dates in the college 's calendar for this action , particularly on the Saturday which appears to have been chosen in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will be doing everything possible to minimise disruption to learners on Wednesday and will proceed as planned with our enrolment day on Saturday . " <p> FE Week invited the union to respond to this criticism . <p> Una O'Brien said that while any walk-out is a last resort , " effective strike action is supposed to cause disruption " . <p> " The college would be best off focussing its efforts on resolving the dispute , rather than sniping about the action union members feel they have been forced into , " she said . <p> UCU members have already walked out twice in support of mathematics teacher Indro Sen , who the union said was suspended in October 2016 while representing a former colleague at an employment tribunal . <p> A union spokesperson said : " The college says that Sen did not have time off to attend the hearing and that representing his co-worker amounted to gross misconduct . UCU feels that the college is using this as an opportunity to sack Mr Sen for his trade union activities . " <p> The college firmly denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for representing a colleague at a tribunal , but for gross misconduct following a disciplinary investigation and hearing in line with established procedures , which included an appeal , " the spokesperson added . <p> " The college rejects any suggestion that Mr Sen 's dismissal was the result of anything other than the disciplinary matter mentioned above . " 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Government should expect quality from the skills programmes it funds , but the National Achievement Rate Tables are not the only measure , argues Nichola Hay <p> This week 's FE Week contains a full analysis of the government 's newest National Achievement Rate Tables 2015-16 for apprenticeships and education and training . <p> Our own company shows a 19 per cent decline in its achievement rate from the previous year , but I would argue taking that figure in isolation as an indicator of quality is dangerous , and I believe there may be other providers identified in the analysis who have good reason to feel the same . <p> In February of this year , as part of an overall grade two judgment , inspectors from Ofsted found that Outsource Training and Development was " ensuring good assessment practice which promotes a consistently high standard of apprentices ' skills . The quality of teaching and learning remains good . " <p> They also said that " your data indicates successfully reversing a short-term decline in apprentices ' achievement " . <p> This shows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might prompt a need for further investigation , it is Ofsted inspections and ESFA risk reviews which should be the ultimate arbiters of a provider 's quality . Our NART numbers took a short-term hit because under the QAR data , learner transfers count negatively as leavers . <p> Headline data on its own can not tell the whole story <p> In 2015-16 Outsource had two cohorts of learners who were transferred for reasons that were taken in learners ' interests -- even though they negatively affected our provider data . <p> In the first case , both the ESFA and an employer asked us to take on a group of engineering apprentices even though we do n't operate in the sector . <p> We engaged a third party to carry out the technical delivery and an engineering assessor to do the assessment . When the third party was ready , the apprentices were transferred to that provider , but in the process , we were penalised in our QAR data . <p> The second case involved a contract that the employer put out to competitive tender . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdrew from the contract . We worked closely with the incoming provider to transfer existing learners , ensuring that the learners were not disadvantaged and there was a seamless transition . <p> Ofsted looked at both cases and talked to the employers and learners involved . It agreed with us that when the transfer data was ' removed ' , Outsource 's QAR was above the national average . It accepted that the right action had been taken for learners -- and for the right reasons , not just ESFA box-ticking . <p> This clearly shows that headline data on its own can not tell the whole story -- there is context for every cohort . There are also frameworks that always have high national success rates irrespective of provider , due to the nature of the sector and learner . <p> We want every apprentice from varying backgrounds of prior attainment to succeed across different sectors and levels . An individual provider 's QAR can be made up by a mix of apprenticeships , which is why AELP is asking Ofsted to consider national benchmarks for each standard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly in respect of breaks in learning , have muddied the picture . It 's true that in some cases , BIL can disguise a poor success rate and it is right those providers should be challenged . However in many cases , there are valid reasons for a decrease in the rate , and we are seeing Ofsted 's risk-review approach identify providers where inspectors have subsequently gained a clear understanding of why the data has shifted . <p> NART must not deter providers and employers from delivering challenging standards or recruiting disadvantaged learners , e.g. without English and maths , or from difficult backgrounds . Otherwise we will end up with a narrow range of on-paper high-quality apprenticeships that fail to fulfil what UK industry needs , and a higher set of barriers for those individuals who will need training most in a post-Brexit Britain . <p> The country should expect a lot from government-funded skills programmes , but we should have the right measures with the right understanding . NART can only ever offer a starting point .

 <h> FE Experts <p> Neil Carmichael told our sister paper Schools Week that before he lost his seat in Parliament , his next plan for the Education Select Committee was going to be " a big piece of work on training and skills " . Here he outlines his vision <p> When the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in 2019 the economy will require a significant overhaul to even come close to delivering our current standards of living . Indeed , a key test of the success of Brexit will be the impact it has on family and personal income . <p> This will be no small task when the UK 's relative economic success over the last 20 years has been shared by too few . <p> To her credit , the prime minister appears to get that a more interventionist approach may be necessary , and her government has already recognised this , in part , by formulating a new industrial strategy . It is rightly ambitious , and has encouraging parallels with the active economic management pursued by Edward Heath 's government as it prepared the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the European Economic Community . <p> Mr Heath 's endeavours were rooted not only in consensus politics but also in the economic theories of John Maynard Keynes , at a time before monetarism was in vogue and when concerns about economic productivity were as paramount as the need for the economy to compete in export markets . <p> The modern economy will require greater investment in teachers <p> Keynes was an all-encompassing thinker who encouraged governments to invest in public areas in order to stimulate economic activity . This was often manifest in huge infrastructure projects , a theme that has seen a welcome return in the industrial strategy . <p> If we take Keynes as our guide , we must , of course , take into account the new economic circumstances we face . The education select committee recently visited South Korea and Finland , and its experiences provide a revealing insight into what might lie ahead for the UK economy as we leave the EU . <p> Both Finnish and South Korean economies were in dire straits at around the same time . Finland emerged from the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created after another gruelling conflict saw the partition of Korea during the early 50s . <p> Both countries were unable to rely on natural resources or raw materials to rebuild their economies . But they came to the same conclusion : maximise the potential of their people . Their fledgling governments had an unerring focus and commitment to investing in education and training as a way to drive economic growth and raise living standards . <p> Today , the success of this strategy endeavour is obvious to all as they have built innovative , productive and resilient economies . While both countries have encountered occasional economic bumps , their ability to respond effectively remains impressive and is an example many other nations would dearly love to emulate . <p> Returning to Brexit , one of the reasons Leave won the referendum was because of salient concerns over immigration and , in particular , the sense that jobs were going to foreigners rather than locals . There are , of course , record levels of employment in the UK but there was a truth to this charge -- mainly due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses competitive . <p> The newly coined ' just-about-managing ' designation illustrates this conundrum , as such people may often lack the skills to advance into higher-paid jobs . <p> To make the best of Brexit and , indeed , to address some of the primary factors in the Leave vote , the government should be considering a game-changing approach to education . Investment in the Keynesian way should be uplifted , alongside major structural reforms to ensure UK workers have the skills we need to push our economy forward . This could be a new brand of Keynesian economics fit for the decades ahead . <p> Our economy will benefit in multiple ways . Equipping our people with the skills and know-how to be successful in the modern economy will require greater investment in teachers and trainers -- following in the footsteps of Finland and South Korea -- and ensuring they are granted higher status . <p> The challenges are not new ; governments and policymakers have grappled with them for some time . But more than ever we now have an obligation not to add a learning deficit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering from an economic one . <p> Neil Carmichael is a former MP , and chair of the education select committee 
 <h> News <h> Second FE college gets grade one Ofsted in two weeks <p> The sector may have had to endure an agonising 14-month wait for Ofsted to rate a general FE college ' outstanding ' -- but there 's now been a second published in the space of two weeks . <p> And as with Dudley College before it , Grimsby Institute Group earned its grade-one report after it asked for its scheduled short inspection to be upgraded into a full one . <p> Grimsby , which had 10,000 learners over the previous full contract year , received top grades in all headline fields except apprenticeships , which were considered to be ' good ' . <p> " I 'm so proud that we got top marks in so many areas , which shows the quality of our offer across the board , " its chief executive Gill Alton told FE Week . <p> " It 's hard to say why we have got a grade one and other colleges have n't , but I hope it sounds out a very positive message across the sector that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's wonderful to have two ' outstanding ' college ratings in the space of two weeks . <p> " I think the inspectors saw that the whole learner journey here is geared towards building aspirations , and making sure that learners reach their potential <p> " It 's so important in an area like ours , where 50 per cent of students come from the most deprived areas . <p> " We asked Ofsted to covert what started off as a short inspection to a long one , because we were confident it would give us a good chance of achieving ' outstanding ' , and I 'd definitely recommend it to other colleges . " <p> Ms Alton , who took over the college previously rated ' good ' from Sue Middlehurst in March 2016 , added : " You do n't get outstanding in 15 months , this is a long journey that I have my staff and predecessor to thank for . " <p> This huge vote of confidence in Grimsby follows a grade one-overall rating for Dudley College unveiled on June 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College was recognised last April . <p> It said : " The chief executive officer and her leadership teams have worked relentlessly to secure swift improvements to the quality of teaching , learning and assessment .

Teachers have consistently high expectations of learners and plan sessions very effectively , " the report concluded . <p> " Learners become very confident and self-assured individuals as a result of their learning . They enjoy and value their learning and are highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learners who achieve their qualifications was said to have been " consistently high for the last three years " , while the achievements of adult learners had " improved considerably from a low-point at the last inspection and are now above current national levels " . <p> Outcomes for 14- to 16-year-old learners were also recognised as ' outstanding ' , with their learners achieving " an excellent Progress 8 score , which places it high in the national tables for all schools in England " . 
 <h> Roundup <h> Tutor makes giant millionaire 's shortbread to celebrate the end of term <p> Hospitality and catering students celebrated the end of the college year by indulging in a giant millionaire 's shortbread . <p> The huge biscuit was made for the Kirklees College students by curriculum team leader , Gary Schofield , for the culmination of an end-of-year prize-giving ceremony . <p> The creation was just under a metre wide , and contained 6kg of shortbread , 10kg of fudge and caramel and 5kg of chocolate . <p> In order to make the enormous treat , a cake tin was created especially by the engineering department of the West Yorkshire college . <p> " It 's nice to be able to celebrate our students ' fantastic achievements , " Mr Schofield said . " They work hard all year , so it is great to be able to round off the year with something fun . <p> " The millionaire 's shortbread only took two hours to make . The real challenges were steaming the condensed milk in the tins for four hours , and getting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I had help from a learner to do that .

 <h> FE Experts <p> FE and schools rubbed shoulders at this year 's festivals of education and skills -- would n't it be interesting to get them talking more , asks Graham Taylor <p> It was great to see education and skills -- schools and FE -- combined in one festival this year , at the splendid location of Wellington College . The Festival of Skills ran alongside the Festival of Education , separated by nothing more than some hay bales and an iced coffee stand . Pimm 's on the lawn , anyone ? ! <p> It was great to meet primary , secondary and FE teachers to share thoughts , and there were many ideas , themes and challenges in common that would merit further integration at next year 's festival . I will explore some ideas below , but first , some of the highlights from this year . <p> Comedian Hugh Dennis , who opened the festival to an overflowing tent , was a knockout . His parents were teachers and his work on TV show ' Outnumbered ' and some canny research threw up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best jokes , there were truths that lay beneath . Indeed , three of them even turned up on ' Mock the Week ' that evening ! <p> Like all the best jokes , there were truths that lay beneath <p> Sadly I missed the Amanda Spielman interview and the fiery panel on student behaviour that both caused such a fuss . I used to make both days when it ran on Saturdays and Sundays -- it was the best value CPD I 've come across -- but some of us have other things to do on weekends . <p> On the skills side , while there was lots of stuff on apprenticeships , I was still left with more questions than answers , as the system remains in a state of undress . May 2017 starts are " way down " -- not a surprise when many levy payers are n't ready for them and have n't even tendered for the work . <p> As for the non-levy-paying market , the very late abandonment of the register of apprenticeship training providers process and the tiny funding allocations seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's still uncertainly over standards and end-point assessments in some areas . Because of this , apprenticeships remain a difficult sell , despite the ( almost ) 100 per cent subsidy compared with 50 per cent for most other adult qualifications , or the loan option for level three and above . <p> These qualifications could well be crowded out if employers and learners go down the free apprenticeship route and levy-paying employers relabel their existing training to claw back some of the tax . I 'm not sure how it adds to productivity -- and I do n't think much of the sector is either . <p> In short , while much is specific to the FE sector , the prospect of more dialogue with schools is definitely an attractive one . So what might that look like ? <p> Themes that spring to mind include panel debates on the challenges of providing useful careers advice , or whether schools fail adequately to inform pupils about FE pathways . This would be a fiery one , especially for those schools with their own sixth forms that wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progression . <p> I 'm sure there are other themes on which FE folk would love to work with schools and vice versa . How about panels where schools could grill FE people about the best vocational options for different types of pupil , sessions on how levy-paying MATs and LAs can deliver high-quality apprenticeships , cooperation on GCSEs -- especially English and Maths and how we can help each other to improve outcomes ? <p> And there 's so much to share that is relevant across the years and settings , on curriculum development , transition , motivating learners , behavioural strategies , or nudge techniques . <p> And finally : Mother Theresa 's hung parliament . Grammar schools are now off the agenda . Is there a better chance of maintaining learner funds ? Will schools get their usual preferential treatment ? Note the funding reductions for schools proposed in the Tory manifesto -- seven per cent real-terms cuts over five years -- were tiny compared to how FE has been decimated . <p> So at next year 's Festival , as Mrs Merton would say : Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working together . We have much to learn from each other .

 <h> FE Experts <p> Demand for health and care apprenticeships is set to soar , yet providers seem unprepared to grasp these business opportunities , says Sally Garbett <p> The 2013 Cavendish Review identified significant weaknesses in induction training for 1.3 million healthcare workers delivering the bulk of hands-on care . This led to the introduction of the Care Certificate , which now forms a crucial first stage of the trailblazer health apprenticeships . <p> Demand for these apprenticeships is set to increase significantly , given that 23 per cent of all new jobs ( that 's almost 320,000 ) are expected to be in health or adult care by 2022 -- according to the City and Guilds Great Expectations report . But are providers ready to meet this demand ? <p> The new health standards have been available for implementation since February 2017 and although the funding allocations to colleges and providers were lower than expected , money started thumping into levy accounts in May . So why are several of the colleges I have spoken with lately not going to be ready to deliver these health apprenticeships until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need in the way we need it <p> Is it possible that problems in provider understanding might be delaying implementation of these standards ? <p> The health apprenticeship standards are central to the new Health Education England career pathway from health care assistant to registered nurse ( see the HEE report ' Raising the bar : Shape of Caring ' ) and will include new nursing associate and registered nurse apprenticeships by September 2017 . <p> The healthcare apprenticeships at levels two , three and five are part of this career pathway and the future healthcare workforce depends in part on their availability . <p> The apprenticeship must be delivered in the way we need , not the way the college or provider prefers . This requires a partnership with us , with the employer delivering some of the teaching and assessment and being paid for that as a subcontractor . <p> But provider understanding is patchy : in recent weeks in my work across England I have spoken with a provider who told me that the level three senior healthcare support worker apprenticeship took 15 months -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a college that suggested part-time apprenticeships were not allowed ; another who insisted the employer could not choose the qualification they wanted in the level two healthcare support worker standard , which they can , as none is specified . One provider made no mention of the Care Certificate , a key component of the health apprenticeships . <p> As the vocational programmes manager for St Christopher 's Hospice , a levy-paying employer-provider , apprenticeship delivery partnerships are of paramount importance . <p> The primary function of St Christopher 's Hospice is of course to provide skilled , compassionate end-of-life care but we , like many other hospices , also deliver education and as charitable organisations we have a heightened responsibility to use our levy wisely . To do so , we need providers that are able to work with us . <p> We need providers who can deliver what we need in the way we need it . We need providers who are flexible and able to work with us to develop meaningful delivery models that include off and learning . <p> We need quality approaches that cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , so that those who achieve the apprenticeship can carry out the job role it was developed to support . <p> St Christopher 's has an established relationship with our local college ; we co-deliver apprenticeships . Our clinical staff are dual professionals -- healthcare professionals with teaching and assessment qualifications , so there is no problem with due diligence or contractual arrangements . <p> The partnership is not without challenge but we work together to resolve problems . If our college can do this , so can many more . <p> Let 's start a dialogue to open channels of communication and work better together . Our future nursing workforce may depend on it . 
 <h> News <h> Ofsted survey tools used by only 2% of learners <p> Two Trip Adviser-style tools for rating providers during inspections which cost Ofsted just over ? 90,000 to develop receive responses from just two per cent of learners on average , FE Week analysis reveals . <p> Learner View was launched in 2012 and cost ? 65,000 to create . It was designed to draw together the opinions of students about their courses to help steer provider ratings . <p> But FE Week has uncovered a shockingly low completion rate . <p> Of the 10 most recent inspections for colleges ( as at June 29 ) , less than two per cent of learners on average completed it . And for four of those 10 , the completion rate was under one per cent . <p> Ofsted also launched Employer View in 2014 . This tool cost around ? 26,000 to develop but this time , as the name suggests , its aim was to collate views from employers about the college they work with . <p> But its take-up has been just as abysmal as the learner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspections had less than five employer respondents . <p> David Corke , director of education and skills policy for the Association of Colleges , said the surveys could be " abandoned " as a result of the poor response . <p> " AoC is working with Ofsted to look at this , including whether these surveys can be abandoned in favour of colleges own surveys , as they provide a much more representative sample compared to any satisfaction survey , " he said . <p> The Ofsted handbook makes it clear that the colleges should be sharing the surveys to both Learner View and Employer View to gain as high a completion rate as possible . <p> " During the initial telephone call , the lead inspector will ensure that the provider alerts all learners , employers , parents and carers about the inspection and that they may give their views by means of Learner View , Employer View and the parent/carer questionnaire , " the handbook says . <p> But at Telford College of Arts and Technology , for example , just 78 of its 19,500 learners used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The highest completion rate for the learner survey was found at Carshalton College , where 97 ( five per cent ) of its 1,798 students took the survey . <p> The highest response for Employer View of the 10 most recent inspections was found at Telford College , where 32 employers filled out the survey . <p> But at Grimsby Institute Group , only one employer used the tool , while just two employers used it at Carshalton and St Helens College . <p> A spokesperson for the watchdog did n't directly say whether Ofsted planned to continue using the tools , but did admit that the response rates to <p> Learner View and Employer View " have not yet reached the levels we had hoped for " . <p> She told FE Week that the watchdog has worked with organisations such as the National Union of Students and the Confederation of British Industry to promote the surveys , " for instance through Twitter and at their conferences and events " . <p> However , she said the inspectorate had " recently been reviewing how we can increase engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be grateful if <p> FE Week could help us promote them , in the interests of learners and employers " . <p> Both surveys have outlived Ofsted 's FE and skills data dashboard , which closed last year just two years after it was launched . <p> The dashboard was designed to help governors and members of the public keep a check on the performance of providers . 
 <h> News <p> An " inspirational " refugee student from Salford City College has been crowned ' BTEC student of the year ' at a prestigious national awards ceremony hosted by Pearson this afternoon . <p> The stunning Royal Horticultural Halls in London was the setting for the seventh National BTEC Awards , where 22 students , teachers and employers were singled out for excellence , from almost 1,000 applications . <p> The BBC television presenter and journalist , Steph McGovern , hosted the ceremony and unveiled Maryam Taher ( pictured above centre ) as the overall winner of the BTEC Student of the Year award . <p> Steph McGovern presenting the National BTEC Awards 2017 <p> Maryam , who studies a level three applied science extended diploma course at Salford City College , and who was also named ' BTEC science student of the year ' at today 's event , " exemplifies that spirit of inspiration and dedication " , according to judges . <p> Her " devotion " to biomedical science took her from her war torn home country of Libya in 2011 , speaking not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a new language and achieved six A* and A grade GCSEs . <p> From there , she went on to Salford City College and in addition to her studies in December 2015 , Maryam was named ' Heart of Salford young volunteer of the year ' for her work in raising awareness of health issues among non-English speaking communities in her local area . <p> The panel said that after overcoming many " economic and personal hardships " , Maryam won a scholarship to study biomedical science at the University of York . On graduation , she plans to specialise in haematology , studying , diagnosing and monitoring different blood disorders . <p> The 21 other awards were presented by education and business leaders , including Peter Jones from BBC TV 's ' Dragon 's Den ' , who presented the award to the ' business and enterprise student of the year ' , Tiffany . <p> The college , based in Hull , is a specialist land-based and sports college with " impressive " student destination data . For the last academic year , 97 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study within six months of completing their course . <p> Pearson judges said Bishop Burton actively promotes BTEC as a pathway to parents and students , and that progression from one BTEC level to another is also heavily promoted through events such as the college 's annual progression week . <p> Its links with local businesses are " superb " and every single BTEC course includes a period of work placement with an industry-relevant organisation , judges added . <p> Rod Bristow speaking at the BTEC awards ceremony today <p> Rod Bristow , the president of Pearson in the UK , said : " BTEC provides a proven pathway , not just to a job , but to a career -- whether that be directly , or via university . BTEC combines knowing with doing , practical with academic . It is the most highly regarded career-focused qualification in the world . <p> " The fantastic winners being celebrating at today 's ceremony exemplify the dedicated students across the country who have been helped to make progress in their lives and careers through BTEC and I am delighted to congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it was an " honour " to host this year 's National BTEC Awards . <p> " I know from personal experience how BTEC , with its mix of academic and practical learning , helps all kinds of young people to engage with the subjects that they feel passionate about in a way that works for them . <p> " I salute all of today 's winners and entrants for the dedication and talent they have shown and wish them and all BTEC students , every success in the future .

 <h> News <h> Investigates : Are T-level plans in trouble ? <p> -- Greening begs big business for help with " substantive " work placements , while DfE refuses to commit to original plan for 2019 launch <p> The education secretary has explained to FE Week how she 'll tackle the mammoth task of convincing huge numbers of employers to run three-month work placements for T-level learners . <p> Justine Greening called on businesses to help develop and deliver the government 's new T-levels . <p> In an exclusive interview with FE Week , she outlined plans to urge business groups to help deliver substantial work placements . <p> She also pleaded with employers to throw their support behind the " gold-standard " technical qualifications , which were first detailed a year ago by the government in its post-16 skills plan and are set to be introduced from 2019 , during a speech at the British Chambers of Commerce Education summit . <p> The project , she said , would require a major commitment of time and resources from businesses across the country , as was explained in the Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government would " make sure each student does a three-month work placement as part of their course " during their T-levels . <p> " Today was a clarion call to businesses to say ' I need them to help us deliver this ' , " she said , after her speech . <p> " Part of the work will involve talking to the big organisations like the BCC , the Confederation of British Industry , or the Federation of Small Businesses about how their members can help . <p> " But it 's why we really need this much broader push , it 's why we are going to follow up straight after the summer , getting our biggest and best companies into the DfE to have one plan on doing things like work placements , because they are critical . " <p> In the speech she told delegates that " I want to create an army of skilled young people for British business " , but , she said " I need your help : government ca n't do it alone . " <p> Before she spoke , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from April 2018 in " high-quality work placements " at T-Level , and ? 15 million " to contribute to improvements in FE so we have the colleges and teachers we need to deliver " the qualifications . <p> This will be the first instalment of the ? 500 million annual investment in T-Levels that was pledged during the budget in March . <p> The qualifications wo n't be taught until at least September 2019 , and wo n't be fully rolled out until 2022 , so the ? 500 million is expected to begin in 2022 . <p> Before that , however , it will be phased in , with the ? 65 million coming in April 2018 , more than a year before any of the new courses are taught . <p> But when FE Week asked for detail , the DfE was unable to explain how this ? 65 million would be spent , or whether it would include financial incentives for the employers . <p> It is clear , though , that the DfE is desperate for help from firms not only to develop the content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also to deliver " substantial work placements " that should last between one and three months ( 140 and 460 hours ) . <p> " I will bring together top leaders from the business community -- to agree the overall shape of the reforms , " said Ms Greening during the speech . <p> " One of the main areas of focus will be the high-quality work placements that are a component of every T-level . These will help to prepare young people for skilled work . Our research shows they are beneficial to businesses , colleges and young people . <p> " I ca n't do that important piece of work without you . I need your help again . T-levels will only work , only be successful , if we can deliver these work placements together . " <p> She also stressed her determination to help " every FE college " to be ready for " a streamlined set of just 15 technical skills routes " . <p> " Because we need to beat countries with the best technical education -- we need to invest in more hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branded ' impossible ' <p> Evidence is mounting that the government 's T-levels plan is already in trouble , amid desperate pleas from awarding bodies for a rethink on the " impossible " timetable . <p> According to the Skills Plan published July 2016 , the first two pathfinder routes are meant to be ready for teaching from September 2019 -- but this depends on reaching a number of milestones on time . <p> Panels of industry experts were meant to have begun meeting earlier this year to set out new occupational standards for each of the 15 routes . <p> The Department for Education advertised for panel members and chairs back in January -- but has kept quiet since then on who has been appointed , or whether the panels have been going ahead as planned . <p> FE Week also understands that the DfE 's consultation on developing T-levels had been due in the summer , but has now been put back until the autumn . <p> Kirstie Donnelly , the managing director of City &amp; Guilds , said the government had been " worryingly quiet " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching we can only assume there will be no detail until the autumn " . <p> " This is a concern for those of us who need to develop the new qualifications as we are already faced with unrealistic timelines and any further delay means a successful outcome gets less and less likely , " she said . <p> Ms Donnelly urged new skills minister Anne Milton to " review what are simply unrealistic and impossible timelines " and to " listen to the experts who have experience of developing and delivering high-quality qualifications " . <p> Andy Walls , the head of vocational policy at the Joint Council for Qualifications , which represents the seven largest awarding bodies in the UK , said he was waiting " with interest " to hear from the DfE on its T-level proposals . <p> " JCQ and its member awarding bodies expressed our concern to the DfE that their original proposed timeline -- with first teaching of new technical qualifications from September 2019 -- was unrealistically tight , " he said . <p> " This could well be counterproductive to developing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned . <p> Other important stages in the current timeline for T-levels include procurement for the new technical qualifications , which is due to begin in October 2018 . <p> The first two pathfinder qualifications are scheduled to be approved by February 2019 , with the teaching of these two routes beginning in September of that year . <p> The remaining routes are intended to be phased in from 2020 to 2022 . <p> ... Work placement ' fatigue ' sets in before T-levels begin <p> Employers may already be experiencing work placement fatigue , before the government 's reforms to technical education have even kicked in , according to research commissioned by the Department for Education . <p> A report by the Learning and Work Institute , published on July 6 , examined one of the central requirements of the new T-level qualifications -- the introduction of a lengthy work placement for every learner . <p> T-Level work-placements are planned to be " substantial " and will last between one and three months ( 140 and 460 hours ) . <p> " The evidence suggests further investment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successfully engage employers and boost the number and range of work placements offered to the levels described in the Skills Plan , " the report said . <p> However , " concerns were raised at the workshops that employers may already experience fatigue as a result of the number of requests they receive from learning providers , and that a more coordinated approach will be necessary to ensure this issue is not exacerbated " . <p> Justine Greening recently committed ? 50 million from April 2018 to fund " high-quality work placements -- a key component of every T-level -- to help prepare young people for skilled work " during her speech at the British Chambers of Commerce education summit on July 6 . <p> The issue of finding enough good work placements for all learners on T-levels is one that many across the sector have raised concerns about . <p> Difficulty is anticipated in persuading thousands of businesses around England to offer the placements , which are likely to require financial incentives . <p> Sufficient availability of local placements and travel costs -- particularly in rural areas -- could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The LWI 's research was one of two projects commissioned by the DfE to look into the issues around work placements . <p> The institute , in partnership with workforce development body Fair Train , was charged with looking into what effective practice in work placements looks like and how it can be scaled up to the level required by T-levels , as well as identifying any challenges . <p> As well as calling for extra investment , it also recommended a " nationally mandated set of standards and guidance for implementation , moderation and assessment of work placements " , to ensure " a consistent approach across the country and ensure parity of learning for young people " . <p> The second project will be delivered by social cohesion charity The Challenge , and will focus on developing model work placement projects , based on research into existing good substantial work placements . <p> The contract for that work began on March 16 , and is due to run until the end of July . <p> ... Institutes of Technology still just words <p> There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the technical education reforms : any reference to Institutes of Technology . <p> The institutes were first announced in July 2015 , and mentioned again in the Skills Plan in July the following year . <p> At the time , they were intended to " provide technical education in STEM subjects at levels three , four and five " , in order to address the " particular need to improve higher-level STEM skills " . <p> But material on the next steps , originally expected last autumn , has so far failed to materialise . <p> Tantalising glimpses of the government 's thinking were revealed in the industrial strategy green paper in January -- along with a commitment of ? 170 million in capital funding . <p> It suggested the aim was to " increase the provision of higher-level technical education " , and ensure that it is available " in all areas " . <p> A person " could study a level three at a local college , before moving on to study a higher-level technical qualification at an institute in a nearby city " . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of high-quality provision " , according to the green paper -- which meant they would be based at existing providers . <p> But a leaked document , seen by FE Week the following month , indicated that they could be based at " wholly new " institutions . <p> Amongst the suggested delivery and governance models were ideas such as " extending technical education provision from within an existing high-performing college " , " delivery through partnerships of FE and HE " , or " a group of employers partnering with an education provider to create an IoT " . <p> The Conservative Party manifesto , published in the run-up to June 's general election , caused more confusion by hinting at a change of policy on the institutes . <p> It committed to establishing an IoT in " every major city in England " -- though these would be " linked to leading universities " and would " provide courses at degree level and above , specialising in technical disciplines , such as STEM , whilst also providing higher-level apprenticeships and bespoke courses for employers " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears . <p> In a written response , dated July 3 , to a question from shadow education secretary Angela Rayner , skills minister Anne Milton said : " As part of our industrial strategy , we will launch a call for proposals to establish new Institutes of Technology later this year . <p> " The number of new institutions we approve will depend on the quality and number of bids we receive . " <p> ... Editorial with Nick Linford <p> As reported last week , the new Skills Minister Anne Milton is seen as a fixer , brought in to sort out the stumbling apprenticeship reforms . <p> And this week we have revealed how DfE plans for T-Levels appear in trouble , so its little wonder Ms Milton ( who is also responsible for them ) has already spent so much time with her civil servants . <p> Where the former minister Robert Halfon was keen to be out on the road visiting colleges , so far she has only toured one provider ( Carshalton College ) after 18 days in the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil servant briefings , rapidly getting up to speed on policy developments . <p> This bodes well for quick decision making , something the sector has sorely missed since Theresa May 's administration first took office a year ago . <p> It is clearly too early to judge if they will be good decisions , but decisiveness and clarity it badly needed . <p> And do n't think if apprenticeship and T-Level reform gets back on track , Ms Milton will have it easy . <p> Does anyone have the faintest idea how to implement devolution of the adult education budget from next year ? 
 <h> FE Experts <p> There has been a marked increase in refusals to assess young people for education , health and care plans . Fixing this will require a shift in attitude from government , says Pauline Bayliss-Jones <p> The latest government figures about learners with special educational needs and disabilities ( SEND ) make for sombre reading . <p> In 2016 the number of requests for education , health and care plans refused by local authorities rose by of 35 per cent from the previous year . <p> Yet the figures still do n't tell the human cost of a system that is struggling and , in the end , letting down some of our most vulnerable young people . <p> The Children and Families Act , which still remains aspirational in its objectives , became law in 2014 . It introduced EHC plans -- legal documents that would represent the realistic ambitions , aspirations and needs of young people aged between 0 and 25 . <p> To get that extra help in education -- i.e. the funding -- you need an EHC plan . But the figures released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused more EHC needs assessments in 2016 than they actually carried out . <p> In total , local authorities turned down 14,795 requests for an assessment -- an increase of more than a third on 2015 . Just 56 per cent of assessments were carried out within the required 20-week timeframe . <p> This leaves many vulnerable young people in limbo <p> This leaves many vulnerable young people in limbo -- young people who may not have the cognitive understanding of the delays and how to manage their anxiety . Many do not find out if they are successful in their funding until August or even September . One National Star student found out that her funding application had been successful a week before college began . <p> That was after her request had been rejected two by local authority panels , she had been rejected by her local mainstream college and her family had hired a lawyer . The process took six months and that young woman found the uncertainty of her future so stressful that she required prescribed anti-depressants . <p> Last year National Star supported 11 students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ten were settled before the hearings were held -- often on the day of the hearing when the barristers met in a room to talk . <p> Since the introduction of the Children and Families Act there has been a marked national increase in the number of tribunals for post-16 students . <p> And when it comes to post-16 and post-18 , the SEND reforms are not sufficiently robust . An Ofsted thematic report last year found that too many young people with SEND are poorly prepared for adult life . <p> Nicki sustained a brain injury at the age of 17 ; when she arrived at National Star she could not safely cross a road on her own or go out independently . <p> Following a period at a specialist college she is living independently , and has just finished two years of mainstream college . <p> But in order for her to access specialist education , her parents were faced with the decision of refusing to allow her to move back home following the accident . They had to prepare a 107-page document and the process took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their aspirations is what the Children and Families Act was meant to be all about . This will only happen when the government learns that value for money should mean more than just this year 's bottom line . <p> Until then local authorities will continue to struggle with the increased demand for ECH plans and extra funding , with the real losers being the vulnerable young people we should be protecting . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Ofsted recently lauded the Grimsby Institute Group 's outcomes for 14- to 16-year-old learners as ' outstanding ' . Paul Thundercliffe , headteacher of the school they opened in 2015 , explains how they approached the challenge <p> As 2012 drew to a close , the DfE announced that from September 2013 colleges rated good or better by Ofsted would be able to recruit 14-to 16-year-olds directly , without the need for a written agreement with a school or local authority . <p> The Grimsby Institute of Further and Higher Education always had good 14-16 provision in collaboration with schools . But although outcomes were strong , never reaped the benefit of having those cohorts on roll . <p> Plans were drawn up , with two very important decisions made immediately . One , that the 14-16 provision would have its own secure site . Two , it would also have its own identity : thus , the Academy Grimsby was born . <p> Labour market data suggested that engineering and healthcare were the two main areas of growth , in an area scoring high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multiple deprivation . <p> We took a concept and ran with it <p> I took over as head in the January of 2015 and the first two terms were hard . We were running at a loss but slowly the 29 students who greeted me on my first day grew to 35 , and then we recruited for the year after . <p> We had put a lot of stock in big , bold open events , but quickly learned word of mouth was a bigger seller . <p> One reason I took the job was the new performance measures . Progress 8 enables schools to focus their curriculum on individuals , playing to their strengths . In order to open a 14-16 direct entry provision , colleges had to offer maths , English , science , RE and vocational options . That hit seven out of the eight baskets immediately . Adding an experienced history teacher filled the lot . <p> The next thing got absolutely right was offering the same pay and conditions as schoolteachers . If we were going to run it as a school then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect . The vocational side would be taught by lecturers from Grimsby Institute . <p> In September 2015 we added geography , Spanish and as a pathway digital and media . <p> What was most interesting was the spread of ability -- students with high prior attainment were taught in the same engineering group as those who had struggled through school . Yet they all made progress and accessed the curriculum . <p> Our focus on inclusion , small class sizes and personalised teaching enabled TAG to achieve a Progress 8 score of +0.24 in 2016 , the third highest in the LA . Indeed our maths Progress 8 score was the highest locally and in the top five per cent nationally . <p> But these outcomes are only part of the story . We took a concept and ran with it , evolving all the time . We listen to the students and their parents and give them the education they want . <p> September 2016 saw 160 new year 10s enter 13 new classrooms and labs , with performing arts now added to the BTEC roster . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their appetite for good teaching and expansive learning is huge . We have another 200 starting in September . <p> I 've realised that parents do n't just want academic guarantees or a vocational option . They want their children to have the currency of both . In an uncertain world , the more keys a young person has the more doors they are able to open . <p> So what is the secret ? There is n't one , but these are some of the key things we have got right that have helped us achieve our ' outstanding ' rating : <p> Employing staff on teachers ' pay and conditions <p> Employing staff with more than one subject specialism <p> Having one dedicated site <p> Involving the stakeholders in everything you do <p> Running vocational and academic qualifications in tandem <p> Small classes ( no more than 18 for core classes ) -- a personalised approach <p> As a Grimsby boy , being in charge of the only ' outstanding ' school in the centre of the community it serves is very special . <p> I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our young people . Their attitude , their desire to do well and to prove that choosing this new , untested school was right for them is mind-blowing . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> It is apprentices who will pay the price for bad decision making -- so involve us , says Poppy Wolfarth <p> The apprentice panel atthe Institute for Apprenticeships recently had an invitation to present to the IfA board withdrawn until October . On the face of it , this may seem like a small inconvenience but unfortunately , when you 're an apprentice , it 's just another instance of people making decisions that directly affect your education without deeming your opinion worthwhile . <p> I 've thought about why this occurs time and time again -- and only managed to come up with two possible reasons : fear and arrogance . Fear of losing the power that decision makers already have , fear of apprentices having an element of control , or even fear of irrelevance . Or maybe it 's arrogance : the arrogance of not needing the whole picture , the arrogance of thinking they know what 's best , or just the arrogance of reaching a level of authority where your word and decisions are rarely questioned or challenged . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile <p> Three things make up an apprenticeship : a training provider , an employer and an apprentice . So why is it that our sector spends a lot of time listening to training providers and employers but spends little or no time talking to apprentices ? <p> In other areas of education , the learner voice is taken seriously and is a fundamental part of quality . In the workplace , employee voice is taken seriously and trade unions play an important role . In business the customer is listened to and is meant to come first . So why not in apprenticeships ? <p> Better decisions are made when more information and perspective is available . Apprentice voice is about having a legitimate seat at the table , not about taking over . We want to be listened to and we want to be taken seriously , not only to make sure that decisions are made after the fullest picture is drawn but also to safeguard our futures . At the end of the day , it is apprentices who will pay the price for bad decision making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop at the quality of decision-making . There are many benefits to apprentice voice that go further than the meetings we are or are n't invited to . <p> How many times have we heard business leaders talk about our education system not producing people with the skills that business needs ? Confidence , public speaking , rational thought , civic responsibility , knowledge of governance structures and interpersonal relationship-building are all examples of skills that apprentices can easily access through voice at all levels of decision-making . Without these , businesses are in danger of making decisions that put our futures at risk . <p> Apprentice voice improves the quality of apprenticeships <p> I can see why some people might look at this problem and wonder why apprentices are kicking up a fuss about something that looks like a relatively small problem . But that 's mainly because these people may never doubt their right to be around the table , never experience a fight to have their voices heard or have to argue their legitimacy in a sector that 's about them . <p> The validity of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to speak out about . Apprentice voice improves the quality of apprenticeships . Apprentice voice means better informed decisions . Fear and arrogance are never sufficient reasons to maintain the status quo . <p> Poppy Wolfarth is part of the NSoA leadership team and is on the Institute of Apprenticeships apprentice panel 
 <h> News <h> Ofsted exposed over failure to monitor 1,200 subcontractors <p> Ofsted has completely failed to act on a change in its rules that allow it directly to inspect subcontractors despite an embarrassing succession of major scandals , an FE Week investigation has discovered . <p> Monitoring subcontracting is a huge and increasingly thorny issue -- there were 1,200 subcontractors accessing an eye-watering ? 693 million in government funding as of January . Of these , 161 had a contract worth ? 1 million or more , the highest of which is Learning Curve with over ? 10 million . <p> The former Skills Funding Agency had been warning as long ago as 2010 that the arrangement was " prone to mismanagement and abuse " , words which proved prophetic after the sector was wracked by a string of scandals involving providers with huge government skills contracts . <p> Ofsted finally took action last year by inserting a line into its handbook stating that it " reserves the right to inspect and grade any subcontractor " in their own right for the first time . <p> However , FE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet taken place . <p> The new chair of the education select committee , the former skills minister Robert Halfon , expressed concern with the situation , saying : " The issue of subcontracting and inspection of quality is incredibly important . I hope that Ofsted will make every effort to inspect subcontractors in the same way they inspect other providers . " <p> An Ofsted spokesperson told FE Week : " We already inspect subcontractors and their education and training provision , as part of the inspection of their main contractors . <p> " While we have not inspected any subcontractors as a separate entity yet , where necessary , we reserve the right to do so . " <p> Mr Halfon would not be drawn on whether he would consider launching a select committee enquiry into subcontracting . <p> His former counterpart , the current shadow skills minister Gordon Marsden also weighed in , and said he hoped Ofsted would make more of an effort . <p> " I know that the new chief inspector Amanda Spielman has taken a strong interest in apprenticeships and FE , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form part of Ofsted 's closer engagement with the sector , " he said . <p> Ofsted has so far only directly inspected prime contractors involved in government-funded provision , and may visit and or comment in general terms on their subcontracted provision . <p> But there was increasing concern before the rule change that this allowed substandard and corrupt providers to pass under the radar , while some companies were found to be actively maintaining subcontractor status so as to avoid an inspection . <p> One example FE Week uncovered of the inspectorate 's questionable approach to subcontracting was at grade two-rated NCG . <p> Ofsted 's report on its most recent inspection of what is one of the country 's largest college groups lavished praise last September on its " rigorous " contract management for subcontractors , noting that the group decommissions those " who do not respond quickly enough to improvement plans " . <p> But it said nothing about the quality of teaching among those subcontractors . <p> FE Week asked Ofsted , via a Freedom of Information request , for the names of the subcontractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that none were visiting , and admitted : " I can confirm that , having checked the evidence from the inspection and spoken to the relevant inspectors , we do not hold any information about any subcontractors being visited during the inspection of NCG . <p> " The management of subcontracted provision was discussed with the college during the inspection . <p> " Visits to subcontractors may not be a key focus on inspection dependent upon the provider and the size and scope of this provision . " <p> Geoff Russell , the then-chief executive of the Skills Funding Agency , wrote in 2010 to John Hayes , the skills minister at the time , concerned about the risks of fraud . The letter was leaked to FE Week and reported on at the time . <p> " Subcontracting is the area most prone to mismanagement and abuse , and is responsible for about 70 per cent of our current investigations , " wrote Mr Russell at the time . <p> We also reported in July 2014 how the Skills Funding Agency had indicated to the BBC 's consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on subcontractors . <p> It spoke out following the demise of major subcontractor Bright International Training Ltd , and the results of a four-month investigation by the relevant awarding organisation concluded there had been evidence of malpractice resulting in at least 225 learners losing their qualifications . <p> The agency told the BBC : " We are in discussion with Ofsted about the possibility of having more focus on the large subcontractors . Our priority is to ensure learner interests are -- -- -- - <p> Editorial : What are Ofsted waiting for ? <p> After several scandals involving large subcontractors that left learners out of pocket and without certificates , Ofsted rightly realised they had a blind spot . <p> They realised it was farcical to be undertaking full inspections on tiny prime providers with fewer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learners remained off their radar . <p> But in the past year they have n't undertaken their first full inspection of a subcontractor . Also concerning is that Ofsted did n't visit a subcontractor when inspecting NCG ; which they list as having subcontracting arrangements with 11 providers . <p> If I was being generous I would blame the government for reducing Ofsted 's budget , but is the inspectorate using the limited resource they have wisely ? <p> Twelve hundred subcontractors with hundreds of thousands of learners and over half a billion pounds of public money . <p> It 's time Ofsted not only conducted a thematic review of subcontracted provision , but inspected the largest multi-million pound subcontractors . <p> Waiting for a scandal , as in the case of Bright , is too late for the inspectorate to make any positive contribution . 
 <h> Roundup <h> Grimsby boy swaps fish and chips for funeral services <p> A former waiter in a Grimsby fish and chip shop is hoping to become a funeral director after taking up an apprenticeship in funeral care . Samantha King reports . <p> Ryan Coombes spent four years working in his local fish and chip shop before deciding he wanted to pursue an alternative career , applying for an apprenticeship within the funeral industry . <p> He has now become the 2000th apprentice on the Co-op 's apprenticeship scheme in funeral operations and services . <p> Explaining his decision to move into the funeral industry , 23-year-old Ryan said : " I always felt like there was something more rewarding for me to do out there because I enjoy helping people and this is definitely the business for it . <p> " I was doing food orders all day and now I 'm dealing with the deceased . It 's a completely different job . <p> " My dad moved to the funeral industry after spending 18 years elsewhere and really enjoyed it , and my uncle has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been around in the family . " <p> Since its launch in 2013 the apprenticeship scheme has attracted a diverse range of applicants , from classical musicians and plumbers , to detective sergeants and cabin attendants , with approximately 500 new apprentices joining every year . In 2016 , there was an average of 40 to 50 applicants to the scheme every month . <p> " I think younger people are more accepting of funerals as a celebration of life rather than simply mourning , and therefore more willing to come into the business , " Ryan said . " It is hard to recruit in though as a lot of people think it 's a bit morbid . " <p> Delivered in partnership with Learndirect , apprentices can work towards a level 2 and level 3 certificate in funeral operations and services . <p> Jenny Atkinson , head of HR for Co-op Funeralcare said : " Working within the funeral industry can be an extremely rewarding and satisfying career . <p> " Our intention has always been to provide people from all walks of life with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they possess compassion , empathy , excellent service and organisational skills , we can teach everything else on the job . " <p> Ryan -- who has a degree in criminology -- is currently receiving training at Kettle Funeral Directors in Grimsby . <p> " Before I did this job I 'd never been further than the outskirts of Grimsby , and this job takes me from Skegness to Hull and Doncaster , so I 've got a lot of experience of driving now , " he said . <p> " One of the main challenges I came across was getting used to driving the ceremonial vehicles . I 'm used to driving a Peugeot 108 which is a tiny car . " 
 <h> FE Experts <p> The 20 per cent rule should be immediately reviewed as a universal requirement , suggests Mark Dawe <p> AELP totally supports the drive to ensure high quality apprenticeships with proper progress in knowledge , skills and behaviour enabling progression from one level to the next . We just do n't believe that the off-the-job element of the programme should necessarily comprise 20 per cent of working hours across all standards . <p> The reforms have put employers in the driving seat and the new standards are designed by employers for employers . are now funding the programme as well , so employers should arguably have the biggest say on what they can offer . <p> Let 's be clear : since the apprenticeship legislation of 2009 , off-the-job training has been a mandatory requirement for any apprenticeship . But as Tom Richmond reminds us , civil servants allowed themselves to be persuaded in 2013 that the old-style equivalent of a weekly day release to college means that the requirement should comprise 20 per cent of working hours . Yet the 20 per cent is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . <p> Different levels in different sectors need different approaches . In some cases , such as dental nursing , working with a supervisor demonstrating on state-of-the-art machinery and explaining the theory behind it is better than sitting away from the workplace being pummelled with some unrelatable theory . <p> A mandatory 20 per cent does n't offer any correlation with the quality of the provision actually being delivered ; it is simply a blunt broad-brush stick to be used as a compliance measure -- in essence a requirement of funding by government . From public platforms in recent weeks , it appears that Ofsted shares our view , and senior officials have confirmed that they have absolutely no interest in auditing the number of hours being chalked up for this purpose . ESFA audits mean however that employers and providers will still have to keep evidence that the requirement is being met . <p> We must go back to the employer-driven principles behind the reforms . In trailblazer employer groups , there are already credible vehicles which should be given the flexibility and responsibility to define the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire the skills , knowledge and behaviours for individual standards in each specific sector . <p> We need to act quickly on this because employers are already telling their training providers that the rule will limit both their participation and appetite to embrace apprenticeships . Many thousands of organisations now have no option but to pay the levy , but then they see yet further additional cost in losing employees one day a week . We speak to employers who have to backfill positions as cover and even extend contracts to provide additional working hours in which to shoehorn in the 20 per cent training time . <p> In some sectors , the employment costs and tight margins mean that employers ca n't afford to cover the cost of unproductive hours along with the other demands of having apprentices . Are we really going to stop an apprenticeship even when the provider , employer , and learner agree an alternative approach which meets with the government inspectorate 's approval ? Furthermore , what about the fact that it costs the same to have someone teaching the apprentice whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The funding does not support the 20 per cent requirement . <p> As the Taylor review has recognised this week , low-wage sectors are the ones that often most need skills development , especially in the light of Brexit , and these sectors often contribute most to social mobility . Therefore we should n't be pricing them out of apprenticeships . <p> Opposition to 20 per cent might be less vehement if the rule was n't fixed on contracted working hours . All other forms of education where the state is making a financial contribution encourage young people to do homework but apprenticeships appear to be singled out for off-the-job learning to be part of a 35-hour working week . <p> The 20 per cent rule should be reviewed as a universal requirement and reconsidered in relation to each sector 's needs . <p> As of May 1 anyone that starts an apprenticeship -- whether on a framework or new standard -- must now receive at least 20 per cent off-the-job training , according to new Education and Skills Funding Agency rules . <p> The requirement , which was first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's core principles for protecting the quality of the apprenticeship programme . <p> ' Off the job ' is defined as : " Learning which is undertaken outside of the normal day-to-day working environment and leads towards the achievement of an apprenticeship . <p> " This can include training that is delivered at the apprentice 's normal place of work but must not be delivered as part of their normal working duties . " <p> Guidance published by the Department for Education in June stipulated that " each apprentice should have a commitment statement that , among other information , outlines the programme of training that the apprentice should receive " and which " should set out how the provider intends to fulfil the 20 per cent off-the-job training requirement " . <p> And the provider must submit evidence that the training is being delivered in order to draw down apprenticeship funding . <p> But actually working out what counts as ' off the job ' -- or even how much there should be -- is far from simple . <p> The percentage is calculated on the basis of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration of their apprenticeship . <p> For example , if someone is on a two-year apprenticeship and has an employment contract for seven hours a day , five days a week , for 46 weeks that adds up to a total of 3,220 contracted hours over the two years . <p> So the minimum amount of time they should spend in off-the-job training would be 644 hours , or the equivalent of one day per working week . <p> But this does not have to be undertaken at set times : " It is up to the employer and provider to decide at what point during the apprenticeship the training is best delivered . " <p> Nor does it have to be delivered in a set format . <p> For training to count towards the 20 per cent rule , it must teach " new knowledge , skills and/or behaviours that will contribute to the successful achievement of an apprenticeship " . <p> It must also be " directly relevant to the apprenticeship " and could include teaching of theory , practical training or time spent completing assignments . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workstation , as long as they are learning new skills -- " it is the activity , rather than the location " that counts . <p> And some -- but not all -- off-the-job training can be delivered via distance learning . <p> No training the apprentice does in their own time counts towards the 20 per cent rule -- except in exceptional circumstances , and only if the apprentice is given time off in lieu -- nor do performance reviews . <p> And any English and maths training does n't count either -- if it 's needed , it must be on top of the 20 per cent . 
 <h> FE Experts <p> Who first thought up the 20 per cent off-the-job training requirement , which is now an ESFA funding rule ? It seems that policymakers felt that something like the old-style day release from a local college would still be relevant in 2017 to apprenticeships across all sectors . <p> Do n't get me wrong . At Remit Training , we love the change in focus from assessment to high-quality teaching and learning that enriches an apprentice 's experience . It allows us to build some great programmes , and it 's a positive change from the previous , restrictive focus on assessment . But just because a standard stipulates 20 per cent off-the-job training , it is n't necessarily going to improve quality . To make a difference , the emphasis must be on a programme 's overall quality , not an arbitrary percentage . <p> We would like the government to relax the policy to allow the learners to do some of this learning as homework . No other education programme omits homework as a set criteria , right from school through to further and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With ministers remaining steadfast in their belief in social mobility , i.e. if a young person from a disadvantaged background wants to put some extra hours in to get on or to improve their English and maths , surely the manner should n't be prescribed ? Instead , this newly-published official guidance insists that any out-of-hours learning must be formally recognised , usually as time off in lieu , while English and maths are both excluded from the off-the-job definition . <p> Some apprenticeships that are vital for the economy , such as health and social care , need additional funding to accommodate the 20 per cent requirement . It is no cheaper to deliver training for a programme that attracts ? 3,000 of maximum funding than to deliver some of the IT programmes that attract ? 15,000 of funding . If the government was serious about parity across all apprenticeships , this element would be funded as a fixed cost per annum . <p> We need to discuss the needs of the employer and combine this with a mix of blended learning ; in most cases we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a classroom . An employer may want a face-to-face visit , or online learning , webinars , time for writing assignments , or even to build part of their programme around mentoring . <p> Once we have mapped out all the months with the detail of the programme , we can place this document in the learner 's base file to show how we plan to deliver 20 per cent off-the-job training . The employer and learner can then see what they are committing to and agree this as part of the contracting process . This is the evidence we all need to have ready for any ESFA audit . <p> Ofsted was clear again at the AELP conference that it is not prepared to audit hours , but will dig into teaching and learning if it feels that learners are receiving a poor experience . It does n't care whether these hours are paid or unpaid -- considering this irrelevant to the quality of the learning . <p> Anne Milton , the new skills minister , took just two weeks to fix some elements of the apprenticeship reforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard look at the 20 per cent requirement . I wonder which Whitehall room this concept was invented in and whether anyone involved in on-the-ground delivery was part of the discussion ? <p> Either the ' off-the-job ' label should embrace all training and learning , no matter what time of day , or it needs a new name . In the meantime , the main message is that off-the-job training in itself is not going to go away . Embrace it , have some fun and deliver some fantastic apprenticeships . <p> As of May 1 anyone that starts an apprenticeship -- whether on a framework or new standard -- must now receive at least 20 per cent off-the-job training , according to new Education and Skills Funding Agency rules . <p> The requirement , which was first announced back in 2013 , is one of the government 's core principles for protecting the quality of the apprenticeship programme . <p> ' Off the job ' is defined as : " Learning which is undertaken outside of the normal day-to-day working environment and leads towards the achievement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is delivered at the apprentice 's normal place of work but must not be delivered as part of their normal working duties . " <p> Guidance published by the Department for Education in June stipulated that " each apprentice should have a commitment statement that , among other information , outlines the programme of training that the apprentice should receive " and which " should set out how the provider intends to fulfil the 20 per cent off-the-job training requirement " . <p> And the provider must submit evidence that the training is being delivered in order to draw down apprenticeship funding . <p> But actually working out what counts as ' off the job ' -- or even how much there should be -- is far from simple . <p> The percentage is calculated on the basis of an apprentice 's contracted hours of work , spread over the duration of their apprenticeship . <p> For example , if someone is on a two-year apprenticeship and has an employment contract for seven hours a day , five days a week , for 46 weeks that adds up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So the minimum amount of time they should spend in off-the-job training would be 644 hours , or the equivalent of one day per working week . <p> But this does not have to be undertaken at set times : " It is up to the employer and provider to decide at what point during the apprenticeship the training is best delivered . " <p> Nor does it have to be delivered in a set format . <p> For training to count towards the 20 per cent rule , it must teach " new knowledge , skills and/or behaviours that will contribute to the successful achievement of an apprenticeship " . <p> It must also be " directly relevant to the apprenticeship " and could include teaching of theory , practical training or time spent completing assignments . <p> Training can be carried out at the apprentice 's normal workstation , as long as they are learning new skills -- " it is the activity , rather than the location " that counts . <p> And some -- but not all -- off-the-job training can be delivered via distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own time counts towards the 20 per cent rule -- except in exceptional circumstances , and only if the apprentice is given time off in lieu -- nor do performance reviews . <p> And any English and maths training does n't count either -- if it 's needed , it must be on top of the 20 per cent . 
 <p> Mr Dakin asked how much of the Department for Education 's " budget allocated to 16 to 19-year old education was reallocated to other budgets in the financial years ( a ) 2014-15 , ( b ) 2015-16 and ( c ) 2016-17 " . <p> In response Ms Milton said that 16 to 19 budgets were set using " estimates of student numbers " : <p> " In 2014-15 and 2015-16 student numbers and associated costs were lower than these estimates , which resulted in lower spending than the forecast , by ? 135m and ? 132m respectively , representing 2.2% of the budget . This was available for reallocation , " she said . <p> But Ms Milton stressed that this underspend " did not affect funding per student " . <p> She was unable to say if there was a similar shortfall in spending for 2016/17 as " final expenditure is not yet available " . <p> The news has prompted angry responses from the sector . <p> James Kewin , deputy chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges ' Association , said that any underspend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding cuts and cost increases " in 16 to 19 education that have led to courses being cut , class sizes increasing and support services being reduced . <p> " This money was intended for sixth form students and it should be spent on the education of sixth form students -- every last penny should reach the front line , " he urged . <p> Julian Gravatt , deputy chief executive of the Association of Colleges , said that Ms Milton 's answer was " the first acknowledgement that there 's a sizeable underspend " in the 16 to 19 budget . <p> He argued that the unspent cash should have been used to " increase funding rates in line with inflation " . <p> " Instead colleges have been forced to cut back on courses and restrict teaching hours . The losers have been the current cohort of students , " he said . <p> Both the AoC and the SFCA , along with the Association of School and College Leaders , will be working to ensure the cash gets redirected back to schools and colleges , Mr Kewin and Mr Gravatt said .
