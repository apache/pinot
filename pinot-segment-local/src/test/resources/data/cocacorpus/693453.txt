@@29834800 @3534800/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> On the matter of Knowledge Skills <p> As different releases of the EP2 playtest have come out , the subject of knowledge skills and how they 're handled ( and divided into multiple skills ) has come up a lot in both rule and chargen conversations . With the June 8 release , the big change is collapsing all knowledge skills into one " " Know . " <p> I 've got some thoughts I wanted to write up about that , but it feels like a dedicated thread for the discussions about knowledge skills might be good . It 's not QUITE the same as some of the other complex mechanical conversations in the chargen thread . <p> So , in EP1 we had a giant pile of fairly granular knowledge skills like Profession , Academics , Interest , Art , and Language . The mechanical distinctions between some of them were fuzzy , and their usefulness really depended on how good the players and GM were at integrating them into the flow , but they were great for capturing a character 's flavor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Initially , EP2 's move towards skill simplification collapsed these down to just three : Profession , Academics , and Interest . Language is just a separate thing , Art is now under ' Exotic Skill ' if it 's important to define , and the skill list is shorter . However , questions about the distinctions between the three and how they 're used still remain . In addition , since all are COG-linked field skills , they contribute to the COG-heavy skill breakdown . <p> In the June 8th release , there 's a REALLY big change : All knowledge skills are now collapsed to one field skill : " Know . " Its extended description includes discussion of the distinctions between Professions , Academic training , and Interests , but they 're not mechanically enforced as they would be with distinct , separate skills . <p> I talked this over with my players and there was a lot of ambivalence about it . The older approaches were n't ideal , but they captured an interesting distinction between Theory and Practice that seems to be missing now ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know **29;0;TOOLONG Field : Specialization . In addition , collapsing it without changing how *many* knowledge skill points players get will make the " Know " skill dominate most charsheets . <p> Any thoughts on going halfway " collapsing Academics and Profession into a single skill ( perhaps **31;31;TOOLONG ) while maintaining Interest as a separate one ? Something that captures the distinction between , say , knowing music theory and being a huge fan of the Rolling Stones ? If the " interest " style skill could be moved to INT instead of COG , it 'd be one more bonus <p> The main reason I feel they 're collapsed , and the main reason I do n't feel we should uncollapse them , is that mechanically they all did the exact same thing , being a skill you used to show your character 's knowledge of the world . Yes there 's a difference between knowing music theory and being a fan of the rolling stones , but there 's also a distinction between knowing those and ancient history or how model trains function . <p> It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent job of allowing people to express nuances between iterations of it . <p> Now , the one thing I will ask for , is to allow Art skills to use the allotment of knowledge points again . <p> The main reason I feel they 're collapsed , and the main reason I do n't feel we should uncollapse them , is that mechanically they all did the exact same thing , being a skill you used to show your character 's knowledge of the world . Yes there 's a difference between knowing music theory and being a fan of the rolling stones , but there 's also a distinction between knowing those and ancient history or how model trains function . <p> It 's already a field skill , which I feel does a decent job of allowing people to express nuances between iterations of it . <p> Now , the one thing I will ask for , is to allow Art skills to use the allotment of knowledge points again . <p> Fair . Perhaps what weirds me out is that they 're emphasized enough ( via @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're skill-like , but collapsing them into a single skill makes them feel a bit more like D&amp;D5E 's proficiencies : a smorgasbord of arbitrary things you can get situational bonuses for knowing about . Unlike proficiencies , though , they carry the full point-allocation overhead of skills , are all linked to COG , and ( now ) have a weird subdivided explanation that treats **29;64;TOOLONG as if they were separate things without differentiating them mechanically . <p> I 'm not sure exactly what 's off , but the conversation with my players and their attempt to look over charsheets and figure out what would change seems to indicate that it 's not my imagination . <p> This is an odd subject for me , I 'm not sure how to handle it . Being both perfectly comfortable with the seperate skills and being one of several who do not find the collapse particularly helpful ( Oh gee , look at all these " Knows " I have now ) this is going to be a day one rule zero for me in that I 'll probably just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ) for the sake of clarity and sanity to still use the **28;95;TOOLONG distinction on their sheets - the game basically still makes it anyway and I find actually calling them seperate zones of fields more helpful for the players as a roleplaying exercise in understanding what they know and where that knowledge comes from and as a GM for actually arbitrating use of the skill - which is pretty loose anyway . The current " Know " system does n't actually seem to help address any issues . And aesthetically ( or for sake of reading comprehension if you think that applies better ) does not seem to flow well . If I did n't already know what the game was trying to get at I 'd think I might find the current formatting for Know both as a skill and how it appears in many skill packs to be confusing . <p> Maybe we should break way from treating knowledge as a full fledged skill entirely ? Eaton mentioned d&amp;D 5E 's proficiencies system , maybe we could have Knowledge Skills turned into COG and INT aptitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledges ? Sort of like the traits that give bonuses on Aptitude tests already ? <p> Hmmm , that could have some .... interesting interactions with morphs that have the Astute trait . <p> I 've been arguing for a while that the complementary skill bonus should be the focus of Knowledge skills , so you 'd buy them as ' floating ' specialisations of either +10 , +20 or +30 , but it has n't caught on . That also makes the Attribute bonus moot , because the applicable attribute would be defined by what you 're actually ' doing ' with the skill when you use it . <p> Either way , one reason I 'm so behind mixing them together is that in play the difference between Interest ( Thing ) , Profession ( Thing ) and Academics ( Thing ) does n't have anything to do with ( Thing ) , but rather elements which are only tangentially related ; Profession ( Thing ) could theoretically provide details about the business side of things which the other types would not , but at that point any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguably be the domain of a separate ( Business Management ) or ( Finance ) skill . <p> I 'm also really pushing that the categories be used to represent different levels of expertise because the main difference between them is the extent of knowledge ; a professional in a field ' should ' know more about the field than someone who 's just interested . <p> " <p> In the past we 've had to compensate for weaknesses , finding quick solutions that only benefit a few . But what if we never need to feel weak or morally conflicted again ? <p> As the local EP1 curmudgeon , I do n't see the problem with EP1 **31;125;TOOLONG that required a collapse of the skills in question , and I very do n't see the problem with Art as its own field skill . It is pointed out in several places in EP canon that artistic expression is , in a very real way , the ONLY new thing transhumanity is creating . Everything else is either iterative or skimming dangerously-close to The Singularity 's still-tender underbelly . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since the sharp dichotomy between " fluent " and " non-fluent " is generally the most significant factor in RP " but , given the choice , I would of course choose the curmudgeonly path . <p> eaton wrote : <p> Any thoughts on going halfway " collapsing Academics and Profession into a single skill ( perhaps **31;158;TOOLONG ) while maintaining Interest as a separate one ? <p> Professional fields with significant theory/practice overlap , like Engineering and Linguistics , would complicate attempts to merge Profession and Academics .

I find " Profession : Carpenter " to be a much simpler expression of " Business Management ( Contracting ) " , " Trade ( Carpentry ) " , " Logistics ( Woodworking Tools ) " , " Pilot : Groundcraft ( Pickup Truck ) " and " Language : English ( Vulgarity ) " , for example . " Know : Carpentry " kind-of gets at this , but seems off . Might be my EP1-glasses talking . <p> ThatWhichNeverWas wrote : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to represent different levels of expertise because the main difference between them is the extent of knowledge ; a professional in a field ' should ' know more about the field than someone who 's just interested . <p> I will point out that for those who are pushing for uncollapsing the skills , there really is nothing stopping you from listing it as " Know : Profession : Asteroid Mining " for example . <p> As for a personal reason for uncollapsing them , I 'd like to point out that I find Profession a bit concerning . With the skill overlap in EP1 , I 've run into DMs who insisted I use one skill out of several that could fit the bill . This meant a LOT of skills purchased for certain roles , as any tangential skill or skill that may come up in the course of using your primary skill was essentially a requirement . It also meant that for any active skill that could conceivably be done as a profession , you were required to take the profession skill as well if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( say , a medically trained character ops to help a disaster relief effort . ) <p> By not having Profession be its own skill , I feel that helps keep the bloat of required skills down , which is good for character creation . You can now just assume your psychotherapist character has some skill running a clinic . Yes , the distinction is lost for the character who somehow became well trained without on the job experience , or the character who somehow got ahead in an industry with no knowledge of how to do the basics of their job , but I really think edge cases like that should be covered with background and RP , and not bloat up the skill requirements just to accommodate them . <p> I 'm a proponent of decompressing the Know skills back into **29;221;TOOLONG because the distinction between each is not only made in character , it 's still made in the ( current ) drafts of the rules . <p> While , yes , there are simple ways of categorizing what 's what , they also lead to arguably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit more space than Academics : Fine Arts ) . <p> Additionally , there are some major distinctions to be made between the three , as suggested in the rules write-up : <p> Academics are your near-professional level studies , or studies backing up a profession , where you most likely have to have some ability to competently recall specific , pertinent facts from the field in question , or demonstrate your knowledge - possibly on a regular basis . The information your character knows is pertinent to them in the same way modern studies are confirmed , debunked , endorsed or otherwise influenced by the community of people who study the subject . <p> Interests on the other hand are your wiki-walkers , avid fans and people who do n't take the same , measured , studious approach - and as such might have a greater body of minute knowledge on the topic at hand that may be disregarded or dismissed by academic communities who study the same field . With this lack of a filter , an Interest might reveal things like conspiracy theories , tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismissed by academics or professionals . <p> And Professionals are , as the name suggests , the guys who explore and act on a given field - presumably for a living , or at least a paycheck . Pro 's might not be accredited in their knowledge , or be invested in every tall tale about their field , but they have the hands-on ' real world ' perspective that academics and the interested might not have , or otherwise have a skewed outlook on how the field should be pursued , and how it is pursued . <p> I 've made the point in other threads on Art - I like where it is , and I 'll sum up my thoughts on it quickly : <p> It should stay active and exotic because : -you can create tangible objects/works which then have a pertinent value -you can screw up the creation process -you are applying more than just studied recall of facts -artists are uncommon in lore , and this encourages the same in characters <p> What does it Imply if you have Interest Economics at a level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic description of an ' Interest ' . Is that CP worth less than the same number of CP put into a Profession : Economics ? the differences , while interesting from a flavor standpoint , seem rife for GM abuse of not wanting to allow a character to use their Academic skill to do work in industry because it 's not the Profession form . <p> If I have Academics : Economics 60 , Interest : Economics 60 , and Profession : Economics 60 , with a COG of 20 , what exactly am I supposed to be getting out of these 120 skill ranks that makes it worth those 120 ranks ? Consider that Fray works for all " do n't get hit " tests regardless of if it 's a sword , a bullet , or tank shell you 're trying to dodge ? ( Granted , with a penalty from ranged attacks ) <p> I 'd be careful about presenting the Know types as different levels of expertise . The skill rating should really be the indicator for that . Einstein 's early paper , published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been based on an Interest skill ( arguments could be made for both Academics and Profession as well ) . Similarly , I would characterize a professor as someone holding the Academics variant , and those individuals often have more knowledge than the Profession version . <p> I do like the way they add flavor . The Academics version of the Know : Archaeology is more likely to know the history of the artifact , while the Profession version is more likely to know who to bribe to get the artifact out of the region . I certainly do n't think a GM should require you to roll one , rather than the other , but perhaps the Academic version has a +10 to know the original owner , while the Profession version has a +10 to know who to bribe ( sort of like a free specialization ) . This should be enough that players only feel the need to focus on one . <p> In this model , it 's really more Know : Archaeology ( Profession ) than Know : Profession : Archaeology . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's probably ok to get rid of the **28;252;TOOLONG distinction . That sort of thing can go in the character notes if it 's important , but just as a character with Guns may have a lot more experience with a pistol than with a rifle , the skill does n't need to reflect this . <p> Interest Skill = Someone that know about the trends , history , and pop culture surrounding a subject . they know the movers and shakers , big brands/companies involved , could recognize the stars that orbit around a subject ? <p> While profession represents someone who works in said area . They know the logistics , the days to day operational needs of the subject , how do deal with paperwork surrounding their profession , politics involved , and could do the job of the subject ? <p> While an academic would be someone that knows the history , the theory , and various branches of the subject . They understand what lead to the current day version of the subject , as well as the pioneers and different philosophies surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - A skill politicians most likely have . To know the police , lawyers , and judges of the area ? Profession : Lawyer - The skill of being a Lawyer Academics : Law - The study of law . Something a lawyer , judge , police officer might need . <p> Maybe I am missing the mark here but , those are completely different skills . While interest lawyers will tell you about the happenings and culture of common day law professionals it 's not going to tell you that Dr. Wilbuk of the Titianian Common Wealth wrote a treaties on law that affected everyone before the fall in the inner systems and his paper is still used today to teach modern law . Dr. Wilbuk may not have any profession Lawyer because he never became one , just studied law to the Doctorate level . At this point he 's totally given up law as a study and is now the proud owner of a Micro-corp and his buddies are worth millions of Q-bits . <p> " <p> Alpha Fork Initialized . P.S. I often post from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typos and grammar issues . <p> Pretty much hits the nail on the head for how I would try to explain the distinction . Because the distinction is made in the current draft of the rules , and this is me being pedantic , then it should be clear what is useful for what situation . <p> I actually have no issue with boiling down the three main ' knowledge ' categories into a single skill , but because of the way they 're defined and described as covering different - if overlapping - fields on , potentially , the same subject the distinction and separation seems necessary . <p> However : <p> One way I can see having things work is to remove that distinction from the Know skill descriptions , and use an alternate , inclusive way of framing how characters come into such knowledge . I.e : <p> Hypothetical Description wrote : <p> Know skills represent information your character has acquired , things they know . They play a less dramatic role , but are often critical for helping your character solve mysteries , understand situations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge or training acquired from sources such as academic study , avid interests or hobbies , or professional training . <p> That way the distinction becomes far less important , but players can still say their character knows about things by way of being a professional in the field , or a studied academic , or an interested hobbyist . <p> One of the goals of EP2 is to collapse what some have called skill bloat . One of the negative effects of modeling lots of different skills is that you get to the issue Urthdigger brought up above , where a player needs all three to have the knowledge they were after . By collapsing the three skills into one , you get simpler character creation and cheaper advancement for skills that are not mechanically as strong as active skills . <p> There 's always the danger of collapsing too much , where you 've eliminated some character concepts . For Fate Accelerated Edition , they have a stat called Forceful , which represents how good you are at breaking down a door , but also how good you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , you 're going to have problems making a Professor X. When Professor X deadlifts 100kg with his high Forceful , the players lose their sense of immersion ( plenty of ways to avoid this situation , but I think it gets the idea across ) . <p> I do n't think that this collapse of Know skills really runs into this . If your professional lawyer ends up knowing about Dr. Wilbuk 's treatise , despite not having an academic background , that 's not unreasonable . <p> In my examples , I viewed the **29;282;TOOLONG as the reason someone learned the knowledge , and then imagined how they would end up with different areas of expertise . Maudova 's approach , which is also the EP1 approach , is that they are different sets of knowledge . I think the game developers are trying to switch to one set of knowledge . Changing the way I imagined these skills to the condensed version still gives me a believable world , and makes the game simpler , so I 'm happy with it . <p> Having skills split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the player that their character is bad at something . I do n't think it 's very common for players to want their character to be bad at some aspects of the Know : Law skill . <p> For Maudova 's examples , I think you could also still model this as : Know : Lunar Players Know : Law Know : Police Procedures <p> With something like this , it 's clear that if the character only had Know : Law or Know : Police Procedures , they would know about Miranda rights . If they only had Know : Law , they might have a penalty to their roll to know whether the police are likely to use lethal force . <p> The system gives players enough points for around 5 know skills . There is some danger of collapsing skills enough that players do n't know what else to buy ( or they buy them all to 80 , even though they 're not trying to be a specialist ) . I have n't run into that myself , but perhaps others have . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of knowledge character creation skills , rather than fragmenting the skills . <p> The more I read through this , the more it seems like having Interest , Academic , and Professional as sub-fields inside a field is actually coming at the matter backwards . <p> Really , it 's probably more useful to keep those distinctions ... as specialities for the Know skill . <p> Since the Know skill already will be prone to collecting strange oddball skills like Martian Beers and Video Games , subdividing those even further into specialties somewhat becomes ... silly ? If , however , all Know skills get an automatic option of ( Interest ) , ( Adcademic ) ( Professional ) as specialty options , then we have the ability to represent where your knowledge of things is coming from , and you get some mechanical benefit a decent chunk of the time , for the comparatively cheap cost of a 1 CP Specialization . Arguably still steep , but a non-crazy amount to invest in a flavorful extension of your character . <p> Now , this is of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but since Know is more than a little weird to start with , maybe we can make it work out ? <p> In this case , someone with Know : Law ( Professional ) is still perfectly able to handle Academic style tasks , they simply are n't getting their specialty bonus on it . Probably competent , but not excelling , which feels like it should work out pretty well at a game table . <p> If taken with my suggestion for explaining away how things are condensed in general ( the different ' fields ' being the source of the knowledge , rather than the outcome/focus ) , it could represent characters still actively involved in the field , versus characters who are less active , or out of the field for various reasons - but still retain pertinent info . <p> Another vote for specialities ! All the RP benefit , none of the mechanical dross . <p> DilfPickle wrote : <p> The only difference between that and EP1 would be however you propose that these floating specialisations be purchased .

@@29834804 @3534804/ <p> Overall I kinda like having Knowledge Skills being kept in their own bucket and sharing similar rules .

Given that I 've played/run a bunch of EP1 , the current layout of knowledge skills is intuitive to me , but I ca n't speak to the new player experience . I 'm also not heavily invested in the naming . <p> What I do think is really important is getting art back into the Knowledge side of the Active/Knowledge divide . Active skills are , largely , about how effective characters are in-game . Putting Art into that category means that it 's competing for points with stuff like Fray , which has very clear in-game uses . Theoretically , a point in Art should be as useful as a point in Pilot or Research . That ... just does n't seem likely . It 'll have a chilling effect on Art skills and significantly reduce the number of artists , DJs , and the like among PCs . <p> DivineWrath wrote : <p> Is there much difference between the following ? -Academic : Archeology -Interest : Archeology -Profession : Archeologist <p> Academic : Archeology would be the academic study of archeology and how it is presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writing technique that goes into it , but it would be the rigorous study of the subject and cover the scientific approach . <p> Interest : Archeology would be the high-level outsider viewpoint on archeology .

How to put together proposals for funding , the logistics of organizing an expedition , how to recoup expenses , and the like would all be covered . <p> So ... in brief , they 're different things . <p> The more pointed question is whether it adds anything to have all of these be separate skills or opposed to having one skill that 's Know : Archeology that encompasses all three areas . I 'm leaning toward " no " . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not INT based . As artists are very expressive and it does n't necessarily have anything to do with intuition but with the ability to express thoughts and ideas into/onto a medium . <p> A counter argument could be made that not all artists are very expressive verbally and not all social people are artistically inclined . I would make a counter argument that some of those artists are introverts and possibly have traits that hinder their in person social skills or have mental disorders that make social interaction uncomfortable for them . Also not all socialites have an interest therefore drive to develop their creative side . <p> P.S. I know the description of intuition describes one of it 's functions as creativity I just do n't think it belongs there . <p> I voted the last one however I would like to keep the ' Know ' skill as well as a form of general knowledge/trivia skill as opposed to a field skill . Maybe even have it similar to how native language is done ( but perhaps with a different number as native tongue is 70+INT ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is similar to how Savage worlds does it : They have ' General Knowledge ' being stuff that most people know in-universe but it 's still a skill you can roll on the off chance that you are n't among the ' most ' - and then a ' Specific Knowledge ' skill for esoteric stuff that requires specialised knowledge or really uncommon training to achieve . <p> Like : most people should know what a TITAN headhunter is - that would come under a Know roll if you happen to be one of the few people who would never have seen one ( i.e. an original space colonist who was offworld when things went to hell ) . But very few people would know what the Fractal Forests on Earth actually do - Interests : TITANs for that . <p> What I 'd be more interested in actually is : - Clarity on the knowledge fields ( what they are , what you can do with them , hard and fast rules basically ) - Incentives to use them ( many of my players forget they 're there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's more important , 10 points in Archeology or 10 points in Fray ? ) <p> I do n't necessarily mean mechanical incentives , but investing in knowledges can often feel like investing in a dead end on par with investing in the swimming skill in a campaign that happens entirely on Locus . <p> I like the idea of a single Know skill to streamline things . To ease the need of splitting hairs on the subject , I 'd recommend removing the detailed distinction between Academics , Interest and Profession , and have Know skills described as an all-inclusive umbrella for knowledge that comes from such sources . <p> I also like the idea of Arts being an exotic active , to represent an uncommon ' craft stuff ' skill that 's as uncommon as is suggested in the fluff . <p> I definitely prefer the " Know " solution compare to the old division of Knowledge skills . Since Knowledge is such a big group of skills , having everything under Know is simpler to use and describe . Last week I played 2 adventures with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but not to role playing ) . They just checked under Know and find what they need . Easy and fast . I know that it 's not a difficult or long task to find a skill under EP1 Knowledge group but I think now it 's more " natural " . If you have it , it 's under Know . The player can think of that Know as the result of years of studying , pure interest or just a job . Ciao Luca <p> I voted second , because that is closest to what I feel , which is , that there should be no different categories like Interest , Profession and Academics , but the players should be allowed to choose any base aptitude , if he can argue it and the GM allows it . Basically it would be COG for everything based on IQ , logic , math or science , INT for creative stuff , SAV for people-related things like the former Interest : Brinker groups . Right now , I can not think of anything for SOM , REF or WIL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> If this was suggested already I apologize but if we 're using a single Knowledge skill to represent interest , profession , etc , then it seems like those categories could turn into flavorful descriptors of your rank totals ( a la Delta Green distinguishing features ) . 10-20 in a skill ? You have an interest . 30-40 ? Perhaps you use this skill professionally . And so on . Not that this matters in game play but it would satisfy the part of me that wants to keep those categorizations around . It could also gives you a good idea about where your skill totals should be during character creation . And , yes , this does nothing to address Art . <p> The thing about doing it by skill level is then you have to decide " is Profession higher or lower than Academic " when that 's not really their relationship to each other . They have different directions . <p> That only mostly works for an Interest , and even then why ca n't someone be very highly skilled in some niche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of of ? Old Films perhaps , or someone who critiques art but is n't actually creating it . <p> IMO , treating Interest , Academics , and Profession as specialties of the single root Know skill seems cleanest , but it 's sadly not an option on the straw poll . <p> Though I do think there are differences in the academics vs profession vs interest , I 'd be more apt to allow your actual skill level determine what level of knowledge you have , and just keep things otherwise as a know skill for simplicity . If your total for the skill list is less than 30 , you probably just have a passing interest , if its 31 through like 50ish you have probably studied it at an academic level , and if it 's 61 though 80ish your probably a professional . Something like that anyways . <p> I think the difference should be simply a roleplay thing more than anything dictated by the skill level itself . While interest certainly implies a low level of knowledge , profession and academics are two separate branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied something before making a career of it , or a professional who has since gone on to teach it . <p> When I think of academic , I do n't think of it as someone who has some book knowledge of the subject . I think of the people actually qualified to teach the subject , or the researchers who devise new methods and tools . It is n't a matter of one leading in to the other , they are two distinct approaches to the same subject matter . <p> ... that all said , I feel about this the same way I do about Guns or Athletics or Provoke . Yes , the methods used are different , but how someone utilizes it is something best served by something similar to specialties or roleplaying ( Especially as it can likely be safe to assume most people with a decent skill in a field have some knowledge of all three branches. )

This attachment can only be applied to armour suits - exoskeletons and similarly complex robotics are too bulky and unwieldy . <p> Inspired by the likes of the briefcase suit ' from Ironman 2 , agents and security types might need to affect a more cordial social appearance - only suiting up during times of duress .

I suggested flexware , both because I think it 's a cool idea , and because I perceive ( possibly incorrectly ) a trend of removing/limiting shape adjusting compared to 1st Ed . <p> Edit : Other thoughts that come up is to replace Modular Design with Flexware , as originally suggested , but leaving Shape Adjusting as a separate ware for recreating some of the more interesting shell designs , which are n't flexbots . <p> My theory of Shape Adjusting being toned back/phased out is also due to the way some morphs which had it previously have been reworked with wares that more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a defined/static structure , unlike Flexbots ( i.e. the Reaper now only has Pneumatic/Telescoping Limbs , and Articulated Weapon mounts ) .

In the Rimward part of the system , it 's easy enough to get a grip of , CivicNet in the Sunward part seems a little strange though . <p> The inner system seems to use credits as their currency , but they still have an established Rep in c-rep ( there is also f-rep too for the real high fallutin ' types ) . <p> I was wondering if the Networking:c-rep and Networking:f-rep are mainly used to get a connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the goods requested ? Is that correct ? <p> Lastly here is my current rep scores . I have Networking : @-rep ( as they are Scum ) and Networking:r-rep ( as they decided that my character gets software from the RNA , upgrades it with their Hardware skill and then open sources the improved software to pay it forward and get rep ) . <p> @-rep ( 80 ) c-rep ( 60 ) - Note this will be used to burn , leaving me to pick up less expensive goods . g-rep ( 60 ) - Noted hacker , but I 'll be burning this too . i-rep ( 40 ) r-rep ( 60 ) <p> That 's 25 CP from my character in Rep. Is that an ok amount to spend on Rep ? I know the full 35 is pretty looked down upon , would you think this is an ok way to spread rep about ( not counting the Burn of course ) ?

A nice little story giving ideas for what might be going on here and there in the EP universe : <p> Verbaluce <p> This is a language fluency enhancer , making users more eloquent . It not only removes inhibitions against speaking , but helps produce a poetic state where the user can describe experiences vividly and exactly . Emotions , perceptions and ideas seem clear and possible to describe . <p> +10 for skill rolls helped by eloquence such as writing , public oratory or seduction . It also produces somewhat annoying gastric problems afterwards . <p> Amorine , Vivistif , LuvInclyned , ED289/290 etc . More than a century after Viagra , sexual enhancement drugs are a big ( no pun intended ) field , covering everything from improving the responses of the C-tactile nerves ( making caresses more enjoyable ) to boosting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but equally profitable ) field is drugs that produce feelings of romantic love , mutual attraction or pair bonding . These drugs tend to require nanotech targeting in order to focus the feelings on the right person ( although many users of older low-tech infatuation drugs claim they enjoy falling in love with everybody they see , no matter who they are ) . Another important group of drugs help inhibit or even remove romantic bonding between people . While psychosurgery is more exact for this purpose , it is often useful to prevent lingering imprinting for purely recreational love drugs . <p> ED556 Reduces feelings of shame , making users unable to feel embarrassed and willing to do things they would not normally do ( if they otherwise make sense ) . It does not remove feelings of guilt ( violating one 's own values ) , just shame from violating social expectations . However , the line is blurry and many users report that feel less guilt on the drug too ( a related experimental drug , ED934 has the opposite effect - users stop caring about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ) . <p> A related , earlier drug , ChatEase , removes some social inhibitions and increases the tendency to speak as per Verbaluce . <p> Darkenfloxx A literal depressant , producing intense aversive feelings - pain , sadness , horror - without any focus . In fact , it abstracts away from the detail : it is pain without any sensory component , sadness without anything to be sad about or a way to express it , horror that does not involve being afraid of anything , just horrified of existence itself.The user feels intensely bad : life is not worth living , has indeed never been worth living . Anything related to the experience afterward becomes dreadful and worth avoiding . <p> VeriTalk A " truth serum " , reducing the ability to formulate deceptions . It makes users very literal : metaphors just slip away , irony is hard to understand and thinking tends to be very concrete and reality-oriented . <p> Produces -20 on attempts to withold information or deceive , as well as skills requiring imagination . <p> Some other drugs mentioned : Docilryde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would need to punch the first person I ever saw on Darkenfloxx .

I 'd like to see them as a little FATE Core Extra - probably with 1 or two skills and an Aspect , but that 's about it . I do n't think they need to be any more complex than that . <p> Yeah , I was thinking something very similar . I was thinking maybe a skill column of 3 , so a single rank at 3 , 2 , and 1 . I figured academics , infosec , and maybe a social skill , Notice , or generic Profession : Muse skill . They should probably be more of a role-playing opportunity and plot device then a mechanical bonus . <p> Three is really high and even 2 is pretty high . If you set the top of your skill pyramid at great then only your top skill beats a 3 , and even it does n't beat it by enough to make it worthwhile to get when your muse is almost as good . The logic is similar with 2s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apex skill . I mean why invest one of your two precious goods when your muse can already do at fair ? <p> IMHO if you must give muses skill , you should leave them at average* . However , why even do that ?

Adding a skill roll to the equation just seems like a way to gum up the works - " I wanted to tell my players something about the statue that they saw but unfortunately their muse failed it 's academic roll " or " that was a really smart question Janice asked , too bad her muse did n't come through for her on it .

Just an aspect like Info muse or Security muse . That way it would give you a significant bonus to rolls if you 'd use a fate chip , but it would be as simple as that . Most of the time the aspect related functions of the Muse should be automatic . <p> Invested muses are a whole different ball game and should be as strong as any ally , if the player wished to invest in it enough . <p> I 'd want to see some skills for a Muse so that it defines what special knowledge that Muse has .

Nobody said you had to do that - nobody is going to come to your gaming table and make you roll : D But if it 's necessary to see how well a muse did something I 'd want to have a numerical figure to base that on . Otherwise we 're just playing make-believe and we might as well just throw away the rulebook . <p> If the GM needs to use the muse as a vehicle to give the character some information , just do it . Skill ratings come into play when the character wants the muse to do something for them - muses ca n't just be get out of jail free cards . They need their own skill pyramid for use in these circumstances . <p> Unless there 's something really special about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in adressing it as a separate entity in the rules .

NOT having a Muse would perhaps be worth mentioning as part of some Luddite type Aspect though ! <p> Seriously . For PCs , one of the core functions of a Muse is to keep them on an even mental keel in the face of sanity-shredding experiences like waking up to the memory of their own death . If you want interaction with your muse to try to reduce the amount of mental stress you take from that sort of thing , it 's reasonable and well within their intended function , but likely not a conversation you want to spend time on at the gaming table .

It 's obvious that you ca n't be both a citizen of the Planetary Consortium and the Jovian Republic , for instance , but the Argonauts are officially neutral and highly decentralized . Could someone be a professor at the University of Mars or Titan Autonomous University and still be an Argonaut , or do you need that Hypercorp or Titanian background to be members of those societies ? <p> I think it 's possible to be an Argonaut and something else at the same time . They 're a really strange organization . They combine a advisory group , social movement ( all those n-casts with blueprints on them in the inner system ) , and independent state . <p> For most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's basically endorsing open information in the capacity that that individual has . I 'd expect that Argonaut higher-ups may be pretty exclusive , especially if they 're at remote stations . <p> I interpreted them as the EP equivalent of an NGO , or an advocacy/lobbying group- like they have members everywhere there are experts and/or proponents of open source this-and-that . Of course anybody who runs an independant habitat , much less a bunch of them across the system might be considered a polity unto themselves in some respects , but they operate within the rest of transhumanity . Theyd have members , chapters etc in both core and anarchist space . Whether they have membership requirements , or if just liking a post or attending a seminar/rally is enough to get into the club is a good question , though . <p> Hmm . Jovian argonauts . Wonder if that 's an oxymoron , or just an affiliation that would get a Jovian blacklisted . <p> I think you could be any combination of factions , so long as you could make the combination make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hypercorps , ultimates , scum , titanians , etc . They probably could n't be a member of a soul trading gang like 9 lives ( they are on the shit list of nearly everyone ) . <p> Eclipse Phase does n't seem to force your characters to fit specific molds . In games like DnD , being a fighter makes you different from a barbarian in ways you could n't easily blur . There is a lot the rules do to make it very clear what your job is and is n't . Same for spells , feats , etc . In EP , it is very much open to explore what the future could be like . If you have a good explanation for a piece of gear , then you are encouraged to make it happen . If you have an interesting character type , then go for it .

So do n't worry about what you are not allowed to do , worry about how to make the exceptions interesting ... <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research Institution . They have members all over the place and membership is open just as long as you abide by the rules of their charter ( open source being a big one ) . <p> So for example , you could be a private corporate researcher , but also be a member of the Argonauts . It could , however , create a clear conflict of interest , since the Argonauts would expect your findings to be shared with everyone , but the Corp would want everything proprietary . You could balance it out by sharing openly any research that you do on your own time , but anything part of a project with an NDA for your Corp would obviously not count . I imagine being an Argonaut is something that it 's checked against in many projects to ensure there 's not a conflict of interest . <p> The Argonauts probably receive funding from all over the place , as I imagine they probably do some research or training on-demand in exchange for a retainer , though of course , and once again , ensuring that everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Android , if we imagine Google as a Hypercorp ( not unlikely as things are going ) and Android as an OS developed by the Argonauts and paid for by Google .

I just had an ahha moment and I think the concept might have some utility . <p> What if you had a convoy of ships on the same trajectory and the first ship was carying the reaction mass while the following ships used bussard rams to collect the first ship 's exhaust while it was still fairly concentrated ? <p> Could you accelerate 10 ships for the price of one load of reaction mass , or did I just break physics ? <p> Would n't this be a pretty cheap way of getting lots of material around the solar system ? <p> If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just have an original thought ? <p> " <p> Mea Culpa : My mode of speech can make others feel uninvited to argue or participate . This is the EXACT opposite of what I intend when I post . <p> the main issue is that the exhaust would be helium , and then after the second ship uses it it would become Beryllium I think , and then Oxygen , and so on . fusing together heavier elements is harder then fusing lighter ones . so with each pass through a fusion engine the process becomes harder . <p> Another main issue is that there is nothing slowing the exhaust down , so it is going backwards with same force it pushed the ship forward . so when the second ship hits the exhaust it will get pushed back or destroyed by the incredibly fast helium cloud , and if it succeeds in scooping it up and accomplishing helium fusion without being pushed back too hard , then the next ship has to catch the exhaust without being hit and pushed back , and then successfully fuse beryllium. magnetic funneling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter without it touching your ship , but it would not be easy . and I 'm not certain it is possible at all . <p> I may be wrong as to what order of elements you would get . I am assuming that 100% of matter is fused , so all the hydrogen makes helium , so all that is left to fuse is helium . so it follows a exponential increase in the amount of protons , which will give you the atomic number on the periodic table . if any matter is not fused by the first ship then hydrogen could be fused with helium making lithium . this is the process by which different elements are produced by stars . <p> The idea is clever , but I do not think it is feasible in short you would need to catch the mass without it impacting you so much that it pushes you back . you would need to be able to fuse together increasingly heavy elements <p> Stationary Bussard scoops would likely see use as fuel collectors . Especially in the PC where atmosphere skimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is undesirable . Solar wind farms would be set up on Luna , the vulcaniods , and Mercury ( for conversion into antimatter ) . <p> On interstellar ships , the collectors would serve best at the deceleration stage.Eliminating the need to carry the fuel required to stop at the target star . <p> In space , everything is moving . You wo n't have to try to fuse helium , because the helium will be somewhere else by the time the next rocket gets there . You also wo n't have to worry about your rocket spitting a particle beam out the back end , because rockets are n't well collimated . The exhaust will spread out and be meaningless to any other rockets , unless you 're absurdly close . <p> However , it 's really , really hard to fuse protium . On top of that , you have to fuse it without slowing it down , so you 're trying to do incredibly difficult fusion on a moving target . If you slow it down , you get drag , which kills the benefits of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so the exhaust will not spread out anywhere near as much as in atmosphere . For example when the curiosity Rover was dropped onto mars , the exhaust from the sky crane dug a hole straight down into the martian ground . The thin Martian atmosphere was unable to spread out the exhaust plume enough to disperse the force , so the exhaust hit the ground with close the the same force it left with . fun fact the curiosity rovers first job was to investigate this hole/crater made by the exhaust to study the soil further down then the surface . <p> And the OP 's original idea was that the convoy sticks close enough together to catch each other exhaust and reuse it for fuel . so they would be that close to each other . <p> As for the rockets not fusing their reaction mass I guess I was mistaken . I need to re-read how the engines work in EP . <p> It 's a gas . The exhaust velocity wo n't change , but it will expand , meaning very few actual atoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not comparable to several thousand kilometers or more . I was responding specifically to your post , but I should have read the OP more thoroughly . <p> It would be tricky but by adjusting distance and making your scoops wide enough to allow for dispersal it could happen . There would certainly be loss , but that could be compensated for . <p> My concern is diminishing returns on accelerating mass ... how fast you can push the hydrogen per stage would decrease as the exhaust velocity approaches c !

" <p> My concern is diminishing returns on accelerating mass ... how fast you can push the hydrogen per stage would decrease as the exhaust velocity approaches c ! " Last one in line gets a relativistic particle beam to the face !

If you collect them you will add their momentum to your own and therefore loose forward momentum . If you somehow avoid that , the time they will spend in your reaction chamber will be very short , maybe too short to impart any momentum on them . <p> I 'm sure there are more problems . <p> Consider the following : <p> Two identical ships travel together , one behind the other . We just assume the second ship gets every single exthaust molecule from the first . <p> If the molecules are stopped the second ship would get just as much momentum in the wrong direction ( backwards ) as the first got in the right direction ( forward ) . As it is an identical ship the momentum it can get from expelling the molecules backwards is exactely the same as it lost from collecting them . It stands still . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets just as much momentum as the first ship did . But if the reactor can accelerate fast moving molecules to double their velocity , why did n't we do that in the first ship ? Throw away all the parts except the reactor and we can transport even more . <p> The Bussard ramjet is a concept with a major flaw ; when you scoop up the hydrogen in front , you need to accelerate it to your own inertial frame . This is , effectively , a form of drag . First you 're accelerating a small amount of hydrogen , which loses you speed , and then you shoot it out of a rocket to gain you speed . The net effect of this is that you ca n't actually go faster than the engine 's exhaust velocity . <p> What then happens when you string along a bunch of Bussard ramjets like you propose is that the first ramjet accelerates some hydrogen from rest to its current speed ve , then shoots it out the back at a relative velocity -ve , returning it to rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hydrogen to ve , and then shoots it out with a velocity -ve , returning it to rest , whereupon it 's accelerated by the third ramjet ... <p> As you can see , there 's no actual gain here , you 're just accelerating the same reaction mass several times , instead of accelerating more mass only once . ( You do actually gain a little from not having to deploy the scoop on the trailing ramjets , but Bussard ramjets are pretty terrible anyway , so why bother trying ? ) <p> You could go with a RAIR , but there 's really no need to string them along ; rocket #1 has to accelerate the hydrogen stream to some greater velocity . Then rocket #2 has to accelerate the hydrogen stream from that greater velocity to an even greater velocity , which rocket #3 then has to accelerate even further velocities ... This is probably more difficult than just accelerating three ships in the first place . What you 're actually doing here is making a very powerful engine and then splitting it into several parts among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceship , rather than hassle with several , if you have rocket engines that powerful . <p> In short , your idea is unworkable because it 's just a roundabout way of making a single very big rocket , and there 's no actual gain anywhere on the process . <p> So is it correct to sah that the drag on the second ship from collecting the exhaust of the first ship is equal to the kinetic energy imparted to the first ship ? <p> You need to look at impulse , not kinetic energy . KE is a scalar and it is n't conserved . <p> If we assume that the ships are moving at speed v1 and v2 and exhaust speed is ve , then the trailing ship would gather reaction mass at v1 - ve and eject it at v2 + ve . The net effect is v1 - v2 . So you need an amount of reaction mass equal to the mass of the ship to match velocity with the ship in front . <p> This is of course assuming that you have to match the collected exhaust 's velocity to the ship's. 
@@29834881 @3534881/ <p> Been reading the pre-release version of the PDF a bit . It has a huge section on trans/posthumanism in there , including examples of how to transform your character into a ship , fleet , or city . <p> They take a great approach , listing a few general types of possible post-human philosophies or goals , and then a ton of examples of how each those might be implemented as a character . <p> The science is tilted much more towards space opera , with gravity manipulation and hyperspace and force fields and matter creation ... but you could use big chunks of it even in a much harder sci-fi game . <p> Yeah , strange as it is , Social Realism is still alive and kicking in EP , and still boring as hell . But most people still go big and get simulspaces with square jawed muscular hunks who are great listeners and in tune with their feelings and would rather paint the fence and do the dishes than watch sports games , or pneumatically breasted , slim babes en masse who are waiting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil henchmen ass . <p> You could project nearly any kind of idealistic environment using simulspace , why limit it to a setting that 's similar to the one the customers are trying to escape from ? <p> the best lies carry a grain of truth <p> Yeah , imagine forgetting about the TITANs and imagining that the tech level was beyond what it was to the extent that you 'd feel safer from the TITANs should they return ! I imagine a server where it 's just 8 or 9 thousand years into the future of EP , with a backstory that the TITANs came back and transhumanity whupped ' em one ! Take that , we got revenge long ago ! Revenge ... for ... my ... everyone ... I ever knew and loved ... *starts to sob , Muse disconnects them and highlights their drug cache in the entoptic display* <p> Yeeeeeah see that 's kind of why I might like Mindjammer a bit more . Less " Call of Mechthulu " and more " The Culture meets Star Trek . " <p> In terms of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I like works of fiction that reflect that . Again , it ties into my faith in transhumanism as something that will elevate us above our limitations and allow us to conquer that which would destroy us . First of all , death . <p> Not to say , I do n't like Eclipse Phase anymore , far from it ! I think it succeeds very well in portraying political sects and ideologies in a post-scarcity and post-human environment . I just prefer games where the thought going in is n't , <p> that is the reason why i can not stand the next generation and a large part of the premise of star trek . I do not believe homosapiens can out grow their destructive and selfish natures and that given the resources we would all pursue hedonism to its unproductive conclusion . We 'll see what happens when we mutate into what ever species succeeds us humans . different genes a different premise . <p> The EP default setting is that humanity got boned , and you 're part of a secret group trying to fix it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The MJ default setting is just the reverse . Humanity is doing great , and you 're part of an official government organization trying to maintain the status quo . It 's actually a little bit dystopian if you read between the lines -- the government is totalitarian and you belong to the thought police . <p> It 's just the general attitude of most Eclipse Phase players seems to be that there is no light beyond the dawn . A lot of time is spent on what 's wrong with the universe as it stands , but the books give very little detail on heroes fighting back . Most of the in-universe stories play out like " Alien . " Even Firewall has the Templar mentality of burning a village to kill one witch . <p> Yeah , I understand your line of thought . That 's part of the reason I like the newer Fallout games . The world has been blown to Hell , but YOU can save lives and leave the Wasteland just a little bit brighter and better than how you found it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance of it 's universe 's tone . It gives players the option of playing gritty , light hearted , philosophic , and everything in between . <p> From what I read though , you do n't HAVE to work for the Commonality . They do say your character can be of any stripe and your campaign can vary on it 's attitudes . <p> I know I certainly would n't be caught dead working for a homogenous pan-stellar government that calls itself , " the Commonality . " <p> One thing I will say EP has over Mindjammer , how it handles death . It 's made clear in Mindjammer that personality backups are not the same person as the originator . Excuse me creators , but is n't one of transhumanisms founding principles , TO END DEATH ? ! <p> Now eclipse phase makes it hard but i am pretty sure you can do a campaign where you do not work for firewall . Project ozma comes to mind but may be that 's to similar . how about a covert action group of the Junta or PC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are implanted titan operatives that think they are transhumans but are actually something far worse . or along similar lines to that a transhuman faction that believes we had our shot and and blew it so let 's put the bleeding husk out of its misery <p> my point is its all about how creative you can get and what your players will get yo away with : P <p> My best theory on how to defend against the TITANs and other X-threats , is to create a Seed AGI of our own , or elevate the Prometheans to another Singularity . <p> I mean , if they tried to defend us during the Fall , are still around , and we 're not dead yet , I think it 's safe to assume they have a vested interest in our lives even if they are n't strictly benevolent . <p> Unfortunately , Firewall is of the thinking that ANY attempt at Singularity is an X-risk . <p> Post-apocalyptic , conspiracy and horror themes in my sci-fi is all I want , so EP is perfect for me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but EP is where it 's at for my personal tastes . I kind of like the idea of injecting a truly apocalyptic campaign arc into Mindjammer , actually , one where the Commonality breaks down from within due to conspiracies and from without due to cosmically horrific new neighbours along the lines of the ETI . Kind of like what would 've happened if everything went Consortium-side-up and no TITANs happened ... but post-Singularity benevolences within the post-hypercorp Commonality still managed to trigger the ETI 's very rapt and very other intellect thousands of years later . I 'm not a huge fan of the Fate mechanics , though that 's not hard to figure a solution to . <p> Sounds like a collapse for the ages . Certainly there would n't be a dull moment in that scenario . Of course , part of me would be whooping and hollering at the Commonality 's collapse , while another would cry at the loss of lives . Because oh yeah ! People can still DIE in Mindjammer ! ( My only big issue with it . ) <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has a real impact ! Permadeaths ! But maybe in the collapse , the glimmer of hope is the discovery of an EP-like way of complete personality continuity discovered by one of the PC Singularity planetary artificial intelligences that held the line to the last against the ETI 's infinifleet ... or some other suitably PC-oriented discovery of a transhuman hope in the ruins of the Commonality . <p> Glimmers of hope can seem like goddamn hope conflagrations against utterdark . I take a very Taoist approach to campaign creation . Always a dot of yin in overwhelming yang , always a dot of yang in overwhelming yin . <p> There 's something to the old phrase , " a light shines brightest in the deepest darkeness " . <p> Frankly , I think the reason why EP does n't waste a lot of time detailing the fight of " heroes " ( and I use that term very loosely ) is because that 's all stuff you can see if you read between the lines . After all , think of your average Sentinel : barring anything happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against extinction forever , with no promise of reward beyond knowing that transhumanity will get to continue for one more day , with all of its wonderful problems and struggles intact . And yet these people ( or perhaps beings is a better word ) continue to fight all the same , because as disparate as they are , the one thing they all agree on is that transhumanity deserves to keep existing . <p> There 's a poetic kind of beauty in that , but then again , I 'm sentimental and weird . I do n't need my heroes to change the world to feel like a story is good . Hell , Leon is one of my favorite movies , and I would n't change a thing about it . <p> But can we truly understand our descendants to come ? And will they be able to understand their forebearers before it is to late ? will we err into being reckless with godlike powers when we reach the point where we no longer see sapient lifeforms as living beings ? <p> The people of eclipse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily shackled to tunnel vision of the titans and understanding their past failings all to well . The best way to give hope in EP would be to find a way to broaden transhumanity 's horizons . <p> I know some of my players , one or two in particular , might read this , so I do n't want to say anything specific even under a spoiler tag but ... yeah , I 've got some pretty contemplative , mind-bending , psychedelic and epic ideas for a path towards a broader ( and deeper ) LONG ... that I plan to provide larger and larger windows onto as my campaign goes on . Lotta different ways it could conclude , too . All depends on them . <p> I have the book , and while it 's an amazing implementation of fate with a rich universe , I 'm puzzled by how the Commonality is described in the " theme , genre , and styles of play " as the " Golden Age of humanity " and " its greatest hope " , with lots of optimism thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The culture is interventionist because its humanism is universalist , although they are n't very militaristic by nature and try to use a light touch whenever possible . The key thing , though , is that they are ( trans ) humanists to begin with . Heterodoxy and essential freedoms are protected within the culture , as a rule of thumb . Want to pray to a bunch of god ? Pray as much as you like if that floats your boat . But Mindjammer 's Commonality is quite totalitarian . Not the worst there is , or the worst there could be , and still a far cry from , say , 40k 's Imperium of Mankind , but still far from promoting humanist ideals . Democracy and quite a few freedoms and liberties we consider essential are illegal in the Commonality . Now , a dystopian setting is fine in itself , especially since a lot of the campaign world is on the border or outside of these totalitarian stuctures , allowing for a " living the free life and defending that freedom " theme . But why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean , it 's not Commonality propaganda that says this , it 's in a GM advice section on themes and styles . <p> " <p> " What do monsters have nightmares about ? -Me ! " -Mme . De Pompadour and The Doctor , the Girl in the Fireplace , Dr. Who . <p> It does n't have to be . That same section does say you can portray the Commonality as evil . Which I know I would . <p> I do get what you 're saying though . Kind of a mixed message in terms of tone . It 's like the Commonality is the Tau , to use your 40K metaphor . A gentle totalitarian regime but a totalitarian regime nonetheless .

Pavarti is described in Sunward , which boils down to Pavarti being an independent aerostat floating in the Venetian clouds , and making its money by being the red-light district of the inner system . It is a great place for clandestine work , as lifeblogging is not allowed and the whole place is swept for bugging and surveillance gear very regularly . So far , I 've made up a telecasting and resleeving shop called Sleezy Sam 's Resleezing Shop , but I 'm a bit stuck . Maybe I 'm just not creative enough , but I need some help with building an aerostat that is vibrant vacation spot that is n't entirely made of pink unicorns and alliterative humor . <p> I think that one of the reason why lifeblogging is forbidden on Pav 's is two-fold <p> -it 's a serious threat to the anonymity of the people coming there , plus the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've heard some unspoken rules like no cellphone use is allowed in Shinjuku Kabuki Cho . It 's not the cops you 'd have to answer if you snatched compromising picture but the Yakuza . Although that had changed a lot in the late years . <p> -lifeblogging is essentially compromising the monopoly of Pavarti 's porn industry . why pay for something you could have for free on someone 's lifeblog ? <p> Many people own ( and few admit to owning ) virtual seraglios , the 10AF interactive simspace counterpart of a porn stash . Most are collections of scenarios , characters and add-ons that allow people to live out their fantasies . Ishtar Design is one of the larger companies producing material for these seraglios . It is a fiercely competitive field , but I 'd has stayed on top for a few years now . Partially it is because it is more an umbrella for allied companies and consultants than a homogeneous corporation . <p> Based in Parvati , I 'd is a modern hypercorp with stringers , consultants and temporarily hired people anywhere needed . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are developed and tested , making use of the cluster of erotica-related industries and professionals in the city . The privacy rules there allows it to develop products with a bit less chance of them being scooped by some nosy passers-by . <p> The mainstay of I 'd are erotic characters . These are specialized AIs with skills suited to different scenarios - everything from massage to bus driving - and carefully crafted personalities and quirks . Because that is what customers really want : appearance is easy to skin ( although a truly delicious virtual morph does take much work ; this is commonly subcontracted to various playmate designers ) , but adding enough complexity to make them interesting to interact with several times requires plenty of skill . Some companies focus on the matching between customer and character , using various forms of personality modelling or even ego scans , but I 'd is still using the old-fashioned method of making good characters . Some are believable , others exotic . <p> Erotic characters are a particular tier of the market . The simplest erotic systems make use of crude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - often far more adaptable and clever than AI , even when they are mainly controlling a character using macros and telepresence . Infomorphs are however expensive compared to AI characters , and there are enough regulations and unions to make them cumbersome . Above them are the real hedonic professionals , who can demand normal market wages . I 'd is pursuing the best AIs that are cost-effective but also interesting and easily copyable . <p> Some of the design work consists of merging elements from gamma forks of hedonic professionals and suitable base personalities . I 'd has some competent psychosurgeons , XP designers and AI programmers on staff . They also have headhunters looking for interesting characters who could be enticed to sell a fork for design components . Some critics worry that I 'd are making use of too large chunks of forks , spreading personal traits or even memories around the adult mesh . <p> The company hub also maintains extensive testing facilities , where visitors can enjoy new scenarios at reduced prices in exchange for detailed monitoring and feedback . The " deluxe dome " instead aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erotic guides designing suitable experiences on the fly for the customers . In order to compete with the real sex workers and their own virtual products they focus on careful customization - the library of scenarios , the experience of the guides and the creativity of the " wet surprise department " are extensive . They also offer transfer of favourite characters to sex pods for a small fee . <p> " Real " sex workers disdain this artificial competition , but rarely worry about it as much as infomorph adult workers , who really cut prices . <p> Arenamontanus , you never cease to amaze me . I 've been kicking around how to take Amsterdam and filter it through the changes of identity psychology in Eclipse Phase , and this does a fantastic job of it .

I can imagine that there are some pretty tough interactions between the unions and other groups in the city - everyone wants to maximize their benefit , everyone can mess up the situation for the others yet they need to keep enough stability to maintain the city . <p> " In related news , the Parvati Erotic Worker Union today finally reached an agreement with the Tsu Wing chain of brothels on overtime compensation , narrowly avoiding a strike that would have seriously impacted the Mayday festivities . Mayor Oldehaart expressed hope that further situations like this could be resolved by the new Parvati arbitration board before they went too far .

" If there is no law against it , it is no crime ! " <p> Of course , what is love compared to steaks ?

Some provide it by having expert chefs prepare meals near the table , guaranteeing something delicious and unique - no hidden fabbers here ! 07 is perhaps the priciest , boasting some of the best chefs in the inner system ( and requiring pre-booking a year in advance ) . Restorant Lara has excellent Russian dining , while Maison extReme runs French neo-fusion . Others focus more on entertainment or setting . Calvin Cirrus is built into a transparent dome on the outside of the habitat , showing a splendid view of the cloudscape and aerial acrobatics/firework dances . Metal Wu is the place in the solar system for traditional rock . Arnauld 's maintains a genteel atmosphere of classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using *flat* humans ) and food prepared in pre-industrial ways . <p> Of course , there are places where eroticism and food go hand in hand ( so to say ) . From mere strip clubs over nyotaimori and nantaimori restaurants to the somewhat infamous xianrou places where one can first enjoy an animal carnally and then get it freshly prepared . But most visitors seem to prefer to keep their pleasures somewhat separated . <p> At the lower end of the scale the ubiquitous self-serve printburger places can be found , where adequate food is rapidly ( if sloppily ) fabbed and eaten at recyclable graphene tables . Chew on This is a Chinese-Thai fusion convenience food chain found across Venus , but the original place can be found in the foyer of Eligon Building . Pizzeria Kroc at Motavalli Avenue is one of the best pizzerias ; their combination of traditional ovens , modern ingredients and skill in preparation makes it well worth a visit . <p> Do n't forget the ' fawning adoration " services , where one can hire sycophantic crowds to hang onto every word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any subject imaginable ... they never tire ) . <p> Of course , good sycophants are hard to find . Mere yea-sayers and nodders are cheap , but truly good sycophants make you feel like they *actually* agree and that they feel good about you . <p> It is a bit like geisha services ( another thing Parvati undoubtedly has ) . It takes a lot of social skill to make people feel at home and important - and you can charge premium for it ! <p> Another idea : Anonymity masks . These elegant masques , looking like anything from Venetian masks to Roman metal masks to African tribal to veiling clouds of nanomachines , serve as disposable identities on Parvati . Besides hiding the face in an aesthetic way , they also jam meshIDs and other forms of identification - some even deliberately blind sousveilance sensors or send noise into person recognition algorithms . At the same time the mask maintains a consistent anonymous I 'd while worn , allowing people to contact each other using their masks without knowing who the other are . Perfect for maintaining anonymity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playmates again . Of course , there is nothing stopping people from exchanging masks , but that is part of the fun ... <p> Of course , good sycophants are hard to find .

We picked dragonflies as a synthetic morph design because we wanted something smaller with flight capabilities . A lot of robotics engineers are looking into biomimetics ( mimicking natural biological shapes and functions ) these days , and dragonfly wing design is especially good for hovering and maneuverability , and so useful in microgravity . The other non-human morph is a neo-avian--an uplifted crow in this case--one of several uplifted animal character/morph types available in the game . 
@@29834886 @3534886/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> EP Character Questionnaire <p> Alright , so , I made a Thing . Specifically , I made a Questionnaire to be given out to players , for them to fill out for their characters , as a character-building tool , a way to get into their character 's heads , for them to flesh out their backgrounds , and such . <p> It 's quite long , and I do n't really want to reproduce it here , because the EP forums squeeze everything down to a tiny viewing area , which will make it gigantor long . Also , since Eclipse Phase is licensed under a CC license , I did n't know whether or not the questionnaire would be considered an adaptation thereof , so I erred on the side of caution and cited it as an adaptation thereof , under the same CC license , and it would get more Inception than I want to get to try and revamp the disclaimer at the end to note that this forum copy is itself an adaptation of an adaptation . <p> Please note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so ! Feel free to point out any spelling errors or egregious grammatical errors , but do n't bother pointing out to me that I put punctuation inside the close parenthesis . <p> And please , if you think of any good questions to ask that are n't on here , speak up ! I 'll probably add them ! <p> ( General comments are more than welcome , too . Comment everything ! if you see fit . ) <p> As a word of caution : Moira 's copy , the one I used as an example , will probably be horrifying to many folks from our modern day . Personally , I kind of think that anyone who considers themselves a transhuman of some stripe or another should be at least a little scary to modern-day humanity . <p> I still love her , though .

I know length can be an issue with these kinds of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality . I think this needs to be balanced out a bit the inclusion of more topics .

How they feel about functional immortality . A question on forking might be a good idea to include . A section on past regrets and what they would prefer to change if it was possible . inf other words i think Number 15 is far to general . <p> The prompts for a lot of the factions still show bias .

What I need is an active dictionary and gazetteer that I can run on my Kindle/tablet " . And constructing one would be a good way for me to learn my way around the Eclipse Phase universe . <p> After spending a handful of hours on the project , I 'm now up to 600 terms , and I probably have 2-3x that many to go . I plan to produce a Mobi-format . prc dictionary , though it could easily be output as HTML or other formats . On a Kindle , for instance , you could set it as your dictionary , and it would look up the definition of any term ( e.g. " futura " ) or location ( e.g. " Feynman " ) you scrolled the cursor over . It could also be used standalone as an e-dictionary . <p> So ... has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not .. is there any interest in it once it gets closer to completion ? <p> Sounds like a pretty neat idea to me . I do n't game with my Kindle since two-column PDFs do n't display well on a standard Kindle screen , but so long as it was also usable from my laptop , I certainly would n't mind something like this . <p> Update : It 's up to 1269 entries , not counting acronyms : 83 corps , 316 locations in the Solar System and 50 outside , 102 political or criminal associations , 47 people , etc . Basically , there 's a definition and page reference for most every proper noun or new term in the books , except character-only terms and things in the Game Information sections , unless it 's already in common usage ( e.g. " pistol " ) .

@@29834895 @3534895/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Extropia : Common Laws ? <p> So Extropia is a combination of a paradise/nightmare of pure free trade , where even basic human rights can only be secured by contract . <p> It begs the question : do Extropian legal firms and security contractors have an agreed upon set of ' common laws ' or charters of rights that everyone agrees to uphold , officially or in a more de-facto manner , simply to maintain a ' baseline ' between the various groups ? <p> More interested from a lore/fluff standpoint , and because I may or may not be experimenting with Extropian characters in the near/immediate future . <p> I can think of a few baseline things that would pretty much be necessary for the system to function at all , so they 'd probably be fairly universal . <p> For example , the integrity of the contracts would have to be upheld or else the contracts themselves would be worthless and the system would fall apart . <p> The right to property falls into a similar category . You can not trade what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute in a trade-based system . <p> Since you can not enter a contract or own further property if you do not first own yourself , self-ownership would also be a necessary condition that can not be removed . A considerable number of basic human rights could probably be further derived from the combination of property rights and the principle of self-ownership . For example , assault or murder would be a no-go because you are damaging that person 's property , ie their body . <p> So those three principles are likely to be essentially immovable pillars of Extropian law , non-negotiable by virtue of their necessity . When you further consider how those three principles interact , a surprising amount of common law could reasonably emerge . <p> For example , the integrity of the contracts would have to be upheld or else the contracts themselves would be worthless and the system would fall apart . <p> This is all but confirmed by the mention of courts/security firms getting their reps trashed ( possibly irreparably ) if they do n't honor the contracts of other courts/firms . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar category . You can not trade what you do not own , therefore property rights must be an absolute in a trade-based system . <p> Makes sense . The only concern I can think of would be more ' flexible ' interpretations of ' ownership rights ' which could crop up . Granted murkiness like that might get clarified by a courts natural inclination to rule for an option that 's safe for the court - in addition to being within the letter of the contract . <p> Quote : <p> Since you can not enter a contract or own further property if you do not first own yourself , self-ownership would also be a necessary condition that can not be removed . <p> This is a good point , but it 's been made clear in fluff excerpts that Extropian contracts are not shy about Indentured servitude as an appropriate way to pay off debts/punish folks that default . This gets into more grey area that could be subject to unfortunate interpretations . <p> Quote : <p> Though it 's not canon , I found Anders Samberg 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a pretty cool article , although after reading and thinking on it , it rubs me the wrong way . Here 's why : <p> A lot of the writing goes on about how the different firms/groups/etc would actively go out of their way to get things done . This bugs me because , elsewhere in the EP fluff , there 's a general feeling from lots of the Hypercorps and other large polities that 's basically " Ignore it until it becomes a problem " . <p> I ca n't help but think the writing , good as it is , is possibly too hopeful or optimistic a take on the Extropian system . My personal feeling in the examples provided , all the participants would be involved proactively insofar as to keep any one transaction from becoming a problem . <p> It would n't be ( and is n't in some of the official examples ) unheard of for larger entities to flaunt their towering rep in ways that get under others skin for profit . If anyone does n't like it , they can suck it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's my take though . Since the Extropian system is n't built up very much in books ( that I 've read ) it 's hard to get a good read for how things would work .

Transhuman largely denotes the artificially-induced evolution from human to posthuman . Uplifts did n't evolve from humans ( albeit they were created by humans ) .

The more likely possibility is that the uplifts in the system today were probably not even born on Earth , likely growing in a number of off-world hypercorp experimental facilities . <p> We 're never given a number .

My guess is it had a 2d6 damage profile in a previous version . <p> There do n't seem to be any rules for using more than one weapon except for the +10 on defense , is the rule from 1e about gaining extra damage gone or accidentally omitted ? Nevermind it 's there just not where I expected . Clarity could potentially be improved by moving where it is . <p> There appears to be no damage bonus based on SOM , which I 'm guessing is intentional but I want to make sure that I 'm not missing something . EDIT : Size matters though , which is mostly good enough for me . I just want Reapers to be able to rip people up I guess . <p> Choking in a grapple seems very strong , but without playing it out I ca n't be sure . I 'm guessing Respirocytes would make it take a really long time though . <p> Ranged Weapons : <p> Do the helper ALIs provide a bonus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do , but an automatic +20 on those checks seems pretty awesome if true . <p> I like how ranged weapons do n't automatically get more attacks than melee any more <p> The rules for suppressing fire confuse me .

It feels a little weird that it would especially at shorter ranges to me . <p> The beam weapon changes feel good . They really have some muscle now and really dominate in vacuum conditions I think . Laser blindness is very strong in situations where one side is n't ready for them , and is awesome from a realism standpoint .

I think it needs a little more to differentiate it from other weapons . Giving rifles No Point Blank might be good . <p> It appears that railguns can now use smart ammo , which is cool , but potentially unintentional . <p> Accushot ammo should be restricted , as standard ammo is , and it looks like accushot ammo has range : Line Of Sight thanks to ignoring all penalties . Seems like it needs an upper bound of some type to me . <p> I like how shredders are n't anti-vehicle weapons anymore , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish there was a reusable full sized seeker launcher . <p> Automatic Accushot for seekers is great , combined with their ability to be fired from outside line of sight you can take some *really* long shots with them RAW .

Like 20 or 30 or something , just to make crew-served intercontinental missiles a little harder to access haha <p> Scatter should scale with range somehow or short range grenade use will become silly . Like throwing around explosive superballs kind of silly . That said , prudent use of various trigger can prevent unfortunate accidents , so it 's just kind of silly rather than really dangerous . <p> Jumping on and throwing back grenades do n't seem like they will be used often still , mostly thanks to how common airburst and impact triggers probably will be . <p> Conditions and stuff : <p> I do n't like how stun grenades and the laser pulser are considered shock so they do n't work on synthmorphs . That does n't feel right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use an action , which is cool , but will probably slow things down thanks to everyone wanting to trade insults and threats while shooting .

Also seems potentially narrative weird . <p> I think there should be more restrictions for using multiple ranged weapons at the same time , like a max limit or something , say 3 or 4 . <p> I 'm going to bed now , but as a final note " suffering moderate torture " kind of cracks me up . <p> EDIT : Gravity Transition zones should go . Simulated rotational gravity does not work that way , someone pushed from the center axis will simply drift down ( helplessly potentially ) until they strike a building or the ground , which is moving *sideways* and likely hundred of km/h relative to them . <p> pg 22 and 23 The table lists Reactive as +3/+3 while the description text lists it as +5/+5 <p> pg 22 Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The former seems to better reflect EP1 , and would avoid stacking this with any heavy armor build . Of course GM fiat can deal with this as layered armor as well . <p> pg 25 Jamming specifies that the drone 's Vigor pool is used instead of the operator 's . The Wirehead infomorph ( Making Characters : pg 24 ) has a Vigor pool . This can still be useful if they use the Ongoing use of the Vigor pool to boost skills before jamming , since the bonus applies for 24 hours , but I 'm not sure if this was the intent . <p> pg 30 Under Improve Aptitudes , the increased cost for skills over 60 seems to have stuck around in this section . It 's significantly worse , since boosting the associated skill by 1 from the aptitude requires the expenditure of 1 RP ( which would buy 5 skill points instead of 1 now ) . This section also refers to a skill cap of 99 ( rather than the 98 in the Making Characters pamphlet ) . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should use the normal skills , but other sections have indicated that vehicle-mounted weapons use Interface ( would drones use Guns ? ) . I 'm also assuming that if I were jamming/sleeved in a Car , I would use Pilot : Groundcraft instead of Athletics , but I 'm really not sure . It looks like the Direct Remote Control mode has gone away , which addresses many of the issues that used to exist here . <p> I know that some people like the new reload system , but it 's not really any better than tracking ammo , and I will have one player who insists they get to fire 50 SA shots and 25 BF shots . <p> Smart ammo for railguns seems like an accident , though this could be wrong . <p> Do polyguns need to be reloaded after changing form ? If so , needs to be stated . Otherwise I will have a player try to load their polygun with a magazine for each weapon type ( which , honestly , is kinda cool ) , then give it the ol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible and just morphing his weapon between forms . <p> Rez looks much improved , which should help with the " CP is the best thing ever and you 'll never see it again " I felt was an issue with 1e . <p> I second the suggestion about the correcting the transitional gravity zones . If you float off the axis you will move on trajectory close to straight line ( for the outside frame of reference ) . IF there is atmosphere , you will experience aerodynamic drag which will curve your trajectory somewhat . To be perfectly honest it is pretty complicated exercise in motion mechanics . Heavy aerodynamic objects will float close to a straight lines and be in danger of meeting rotating deck of habitat . Lighter objects with more drag will get some " rotational " momentum which will give them " percieved " gravity in the rotational frame of reference . <p> If I ever get bored too much I will present you the results of calculations including drag coefficients and mases of objects . Do n't be waiting for them though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons . My players or myself will probably at some point want to use multiple morph mounted guns . Reaper in the official art seems to have 4 coupled guns . Now it is pretty hard to figure out what to do with them . Do you attack once and roll damage 4 times ? Do you add +Xd10 per superior Sucess ? Or make 4 separate attacks WITH or WITHOUT off-hand modifier ? <p> Can not see the purpose of this change - it 's easier to just count ammo . If we go abstract may I suggest the following : <p> 1 ) Each weapon has an abstract ammo rating . Ex . Ammo 4 for medium pistol and Ammo 10 for assault rifle . 2 ) We assume that a character has enough ammo for a fight if they try to conserve ammo ( i.e. single shot or semi-auto only ) and just reload after the fight ends . 3 ) They may choose to shoot a burst . This spends 1 Ammo and either adds +10/+1d10 DV to attack or allows to attack two targets withing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go full auto . This spends 3 Ammo and either adds +30/+2d10 DV to attack or allows to attack three targets withing 1 meter of each other . 5 ) They may lay suppressing fire . This spends 6 Ammo and /insert supp fire desription/ 6 ) If your Ammo reaches 0 you can not shoot this weapon until you spend a complex action to reload . <p> This way we do n't forget to count ammo , but it gets much easier . To convert from EP1 just give 1 Ammo for each 3 shots the weapon normally has . <p> Yeah , I went back for a second read and found the bits I was missing . Probably should n't be proofreading when I should be getting sleep . <p> Though , now I have a concern in the opposite direction . Say I have enough layers to go over 11 AV , for instance bioweave , second skin , and armor clothing with an armor coat draped over it all . Concealability is just on a per item basis about whether it looks obviously like armor right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm prepared for stuff to go down ? <p> Can not see the purpose of this change - it 's easier to just count ammo . If we go abstract may I suggest the following : <p> Generally bullish on these changes , but I agree with the objections RE ammo . I do n't think this improves things much , since " how much ammo do you have " was a pretty easy to understand/intuitive thing for most players . <p> Polyguns : YESS ! FLEX GUNS FOR MY FLEXBRO ! Though some of the technicals are muddy . For example : I always treated automatic rifles and LMGs the same in 1st Ed as they deal the same damage , and often times is the same ammunition IRL . Also , is there a rule stopping me from having an automatic Sniper ? Or a single shot MG ? ... Or an SMG with 2 barrels ? Oh , and can they turn into shredders ? Can they be railguns and chem arms ? <p> Magazines : I do n't like it . As I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit confusing . It also does n't stop bean counting when you think about it ; You have to keep track of mag capacity instead of bullets , and you still have to keep track of a partially depleted mag when you load in a fresh one . <p> Wording : It took me a while to realize that Spurs were really Cyberclaws . Personally I found it 's description sort of hollow too , since it does n't depict them as badass wolverine claws . <p> Overload Grenades : I almost had a stroke when trying to look for my favorite screaming grenade . Just a criticism on the wording again ; these things are iconic ( to me at least ) . On top of that , I noticed that they do n't have a strobe effect , which is unfortunate because I lived the idea of them being pocket sized raves . <p> Axes and Swords : I 'm assuming this was a mistake , because there was a clear power balance between these weapons before . Now there is no point in taking a sword as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is restricted . And why ca n't a sword pierce armor ? I was under the impression that Monofilament meant really sharp . <p> Disorders : Can we have a table for these ? I think that will help the process of choosing one faster . <p> Microgravity Range : While I like the new range system , I find the microgravity range to be too vague to actually be used . How far is " line of sight " exactly ? I can see whole galaxies light years away . Also , just ' cause you can see a spec in the distance does n't mean it 's easy to hit ; being even a single degree off can effect a target 6 km away . There needs to be a solid range cap for 0G . <p> Armor penetration : I do n't see this as being any more simple than before . Instead of subtracting armor , we 're dividing it now . <p> Seekers : I 'd like to see a scatter table for seekers as they do n't just disappear if they miss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seekers that do n't explode ( they are scramjet bullets if you remove the payload ) . <p> Re Trappedinwikipedia 's comment on stun grenades : they do still apply both Knockdown and Blinding . I 'm pretty OK with this . There is a question of " what do you use for riot control when the rioters are cases " , but I think the answer is just " freezers " . <p> Re CordialUltimate 's comment on coaxial/morph-mounted weapons : Except for " coaxial on different axes " , I do n't see why they would n't just use the Extra Ranged Weapons rule , same as everything else ? <p> 1 ) I almost want a specific clarification that the Attacker Behind Cover ranged modifier does n't stack with Indirect Fire , but that might be overly finicky . Some clarification about how Indirect Fire interacts with defender 's cover would be good , though . <p> 2 ) Changing it to a penalty for not using a smartlink/laser sight is good . <p> 3 ) I like the range changes and removal of penetration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow things down . <p> 4 ) No real opinion on " Reload " , but I do have a suspicion it 's going to play out exactly like counting ammo . <p> 5 ) The order of the weapons categories is a bit odd . I would expect weapons systems either at the beginning or the end , for example . Probably **25;516;TOOLONG should be next to each other , with Thrown and Systems either at the beginning or end . ( Possibly do Thrown right after Seeker , since grenades ? ) <p> 6 ) The particle beam bolter description still references having greater " penetration " than the laser pulser . Same with the shard pistol and assault rifle . Possibly this is fine and it just sticks out to me because I 'm used to 1e descriptions . For some reason , pistols and sniper rifles mentioning both stopping power and penetration does n't bother me . <p> 7 ) Surprised that Shard Pistols and Shredders are n't restricted - I tend to place them in the same vein as a laser pulser or light pistol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAW , there 's no reason to use an SMG right now - an assault rifle or battle rifle is always strictly superior . Mostly I bring this up in the context of " why would I ever switch my polyrifle to SMG mode " ? <p> 10 ) Guessing Accushot ammo is supposed to be restricted . <p> 11 ) Is having three different near-identical machine guns really worth the space ? <p> 12 ) Minor thing , but can we get clarification of how big minigrenades are ? I 've always wondered . <p> 13 ) ... what does the missile do to the disposable launcher to increase it 's range that micro/minimissiles do n't do to other seekers ? <p> 14 ) Is there any reason not to list the -1d10 DV for armour-piercing ammo in the ammo tables ? There 's a damage column there already , and having to remember that it 's -1d10 for ammo , but not weapons , is somewhat irritating .

Specialized stuff is allowed to be good at what it does , and I do n't see Shock Proof being a must-have that would crowd out other options .

I thought we were getting rid of 1d10/2 for d6s , but there 's a bunch of them in the Stressful Experiences table ! <p> Have to take a look at the Environmental Factors section some time later . <p> 9 ) RAW , there 's no reason to use an SMG right now - an assault rifle or battle rifle is always strictly superior . Mostly I bring this up in the context of " why would I ever switch my polyrifle to SMG mode " ? <p> For me SMGs were more easily concealable and less restricted , making them perfect for urban combat . But now that there is a concealable trait , it seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have that trait . <p> Vae Dei wrote : <p> 11 ) Is having three different near-identical machine guns really worth the space ? <p> Agreed 100% .

Minimissiles travel twice the range of micros , and standard missiles travel twice the range of minis . <p> Also , there 's one thing I forgot to mention before . Exotic throwing weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now throwing a knife is it 's own skill ? REALLY ? <p> Mental Health I , too , have a copy of the Delta Green RPG . And the Delta Green RPG is a well-made product tooled specifically for running the kind of cosmic horror Eclipse Phase occasionally wants to be , so cribbing its mental health system wholesale is n't too bad of an idea . <p> But . <p> It 's not a perfect system , and suffers somewhat from trying to unify the Stress Gauges in NEMESIS with the traditional CoC Sanity points . One place where this becomes very apparent are the rules for Adapting to Violence/Helplessness , where accumulating small stresses not only makes a character adapted to handling that kind of stress , but any other stress in its category - meaning that seeing enough corpses can make you immune to torture , and prison terms , bankruptcy , and being fired can immunize you to watching your loved ones be tortured to death . This comes from DGRPG abandoning the 10-point scales of NEMESIS , which made hardening only work against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a problem that carries over to EP2E it seems , because being drugged a lot and experiencing enough spacesuit malfunctions can apparently make you immune to the stress of being tortured . <p> Which is a bit weird ! <p> ( Also I do n't think DID really belongs on the list of disorders . It 's a pretty controversial disorder in the first place , and fundamentally in a gaming and even fictional context it has problems with how it 's presented as fundamentally something kinda cool , without any attention paid to the claimed real-world drawbacks , which include amnesia - a symptom EP2E does n't mention at all . I think you 'd emphasize the horror angle better by replacing it with , for example , psychogenic amnesia . ) <p> Except you need to receive a TRAUMA to work towards hardening , which for a base 15 WIL character means 6 points or more from a single source . So , " small stresses " wo n't build up to immunity . For instance , seeing a corpse or committing violence in self defense will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 18 or more WIL , most stresses wo n't lead to traumas , at least if I 'm reading this right . <p> On the topic of healing , I was curious about first aid ( and this is actually something that 's concerned me since 1st ed ) . It states that you ca n't perform first aid on an injury that 's been treated with medichines or the like . Do we assume that medichines work on all wounds kinda equally , in which case all first aid is invalid after an hour without getting hurt ? Does it triage and treat the worst injuries first ? On top of that , any guidelines on how to track the number of injuries would be appreciated . I can see each Wound counting as their own injury , but for damage sources that do n't incur wounds do we treat each round they took damage as an injury ? The whole encounter as one ? Take total damage that did not lead to wounds and divide by 10 ( which admittedly avoids the possibility of healing more damage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarify , nanobandages do indeed stack with healing vats correct ( I seem to recall it being a little different in 1st ed ) ? So if someone was on the brink of death , ideally one would use first aid on all the injuries they can , slap three nanobandages on the worst of what remains and then toss them in a healing vat to do injuriesd10 over an hour or so , then 6d10 for the first hour , followed by 3d10 per hour for the rest of the day . <p> I will say , as someone who actually bothered to take the skills in the past , I 'm kinda glad that applying first aid allows for quick removal of wounds whereas gear-based methods like medichines need to heal any and all damage before taking additional time to repair the wounds . <p> I like that there is now a weapon quality table , but armor piercing giving negative DV is sort of pointless . Just have the weapons or ammunition be adjusted . Otherwise it gets confusing because there are too many use cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it only applies to AP ammo , which means it should probably be a part of AP ammo , not a part of the weapon trait unless there 's more ammo/not weapons which give AP in the pipeline . <p> The new grenades are nuts I have to say , they basically all gained a d10 of damage across the board and most have even larger blast radii ! There 's a couple of funny parts of the table though , like the cost of TMP grenades looks like it 's in the wrong column , but that 's really minor , and High-Explosive grenades appear to be duplicated- once as an option for TMP , and once alone , and there seems to be no need to get HE instead of TMP , or even an entry for HE grenades in the description list . <p> I second the machine guns being kind of weird . They 're all pretty similar , but basically just get better as they get larger . Giving some of them No Point Blank or even No Short Range ( perhaps a lessened version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the blanket ban seekers get ) . <p> I also think giving the rifles No Point Blank is a pretty good way to give them SMG more of a role . <p> It strikes me as a little odd that of ranged weapons , only beam weapons have a Ware section , and they are the only ones which can be bonded to a shell without a weapon mount . I 'm not sure if that section just did n't make it in for other weapons or if it 's because they 're all recoiless , and if it 's the latter a few spray weapons should be similar . <p> I really like how taking two wounds at once no longer prompts two tests . <p> Except you need to receive a TRAUMA to work towards hardening , which for a base 15 WIL character means 6 points or more from a single source . So , " small stresses " wo n't build up to immunity . For instance , seeing a corpse or committing violence in self defense will NEVER grant more than 5 stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the way smartlinks are handled . This was a change I 'd made in my own " 1.5 " rules hack . <p> Now , as for armor ... let me float an idea . Just like in 1E , every piece of armor here has very close to the same E and K armor value , and the ones with a large difference have less E than K. This is mathematically the same ( or close enough ) as all energy weapons having a small bonus to damage - but the latter is cleaner in terms of rule bloat . I 'd ask you to consider either ; <p> ( 1 ) Give energy weapons a small boost to their listed damage values ( or no boost ) and drop E and K armor in favor of just Armor ; have armor mods like 1E 's Refractive Glazing provide " +3 bonus armor vs Energy " ( the same way Fireproofing gives +8 bonus armor vs fire ) <p> ( 2 ) Further differentiate between E and K armor ; make players choose which they 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together across the board <p> I see you also did the same thing as 1E with Fireproofing and Refractive Glazing . They 're both the same cost , one gives 3 bonus energy armor , the other gives 2 bonus energy armor and 8 bonus armor against fire . It 's ... hard to make an argument that Fireproofing is n't just better than Glazing . I 'd say either increase Glazing 's bonus ( by a lot ) , or take out Fireproofing 's bonus and make it just +10 vs fire . <p> GRAVITY TRANSITIONS <p> Quote : <p> If you are cast adrift in the microgravity zone at the axis of a rotating space habitat , you will slowly drift outward until you begin to encounter simulated gravity , at which point you will fall . How long this takes varies on the size of the habitat . <p> Again , guys - I 'm sorry , but this is not how rotating reference frames work . See this gif for reference . Also , you 've all seen Babylon 5 right ? Remember this scene ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference frame looks . <p> There is no gravity transition zone in a rotating space habitat , because there is no gravity in a rotating space habitat ( centrifugal force is a fictitious force , and is felt only by an observer " standing " on the inside of the circle ) . If you are cast adrift at the axis - unless you have some means of keeping station - you will gradually drift according to your initial momentum , at roughly the same speed , until you are accelerated to the speed of the rim slowly by air resistance or rapidly as you hit structures on the inner surface of the habitat ( from your frame of reference this will appear to be a sudden acceleration - followed by death - but from the perspective of observers on the inside surface you will appear to be spiralling slowly outward from habitat 's central axis ) . <p> Oh yeah , how do airbursts interact with the attack sequence ? Say there 's a hostile target fifty meters away from me . I fire a seeker not at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and program the seeker to detonate after travelling 50.03 meters ( my muse ran Pythagoras and outputted that as a sufficiently accurate value for the line between me and the indicated point ) . I fire , and roll a success on my Guns test . <p> Does my target get a Fray roll to dodge , even though the seeker is n't going to impact him ? <p> Suppose he does ; what happens ? Does he roll Fray to leap out of the radius of the explosion ? If so , does he then return to his original position , or stay at his new position outside the radius ? How far can he move in this manner , and does he get to move again on his next turn ? <p> One other thing : There 's some oddness with the rules for armor-piercing ammo . AP kinetic ammo just gains the Armor Piercing quality , ie -1d10 damage , half armor ; RAP kinetic ammo gains Armor Piercing and +1d6 damage ; so is that +1d6 -1d10 or what ? Seems clunky . Same with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -1d10 from Armor Piercing or what ? <p> Are shardguns and shredders armor-piercing or are n't they ? The description says they are , but the stats say they are n't . Also I 'm not sure I 've ever understood how flechettes can be " very traumatic to flesh " , and yet be less effective versus unarmoured targets than hardened ones . <p> I do n't think the damage penalty from Armor Piercing necessary ; either you 're using it instead of regular ammo ( which should be cheaper - see below ) , or you 're paying a utility cost by using it instead of ammo that increases damage , or you 're using a weapon that has it built in and the damage is already adjusted anyway . <p> EDIT : I thought regular ammo was cheaper than AP , so the first version of this post referred to it as though it were . Really though , it ought to be . I mean if we are n't playing Gear : The Shoppening , you 're buying a gun but are n't buying speciality ammo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reload as often as you need to ... why not make regular ammo free with the gun ? <p> The shredder description says they struggle with armor and they do n't have AP , this is a change from 1e . <p> Which is something I heard people complain about frequently about flechettes and diamondoid structures . Now if only we can fix Gravity Transition Zones , people will laugh less at EP . <p> For RAP - I assume you reduce the base damage by a d10 , but you add back in a d6 effectively you only lose like half your damage potential . Presumably this is why the AP trait says adding it removes a d10 , because then you 'd have to write something stupid for RAP like -1d10 +1d6 <p> Shredder : A heavier version of the shard pistol , the shredder fires a larger cloud of lethal flechettes , enough to shred a portion of the target into a fine mist . <p> The Shard Gun says this ( emphasis mine ) : <p> Quote : <p> Shard Pistol : This weapon fires a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot . A blast of these micro-flechettes is very traumatic to flesh , but their armor-piercing capabilities are offset by their low mass .

Assuming this effect applies to railguns , then it 's completely unacceptable ( Railguns are known to set the projectiles on FIRE when they hit something ! ) . I see it also applies to sniper rifles , which is funny because the description says : <p> This also actually fits with many principles of armor penetration if you want to hit a hardened target you have to sacrifice overall damage to that target because your shot will often bleed less energy into the target . <p> And I think Railguns do the same ? This I will say could use some clarification . It says the DV stays " as above " , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It lists the quality directly , and it 's inherent to the railgun weapon , so I would assume this means they are an overall improvement over using AP ammo in your firearm , but now you have the battery limitation and can not use speciality ammo . <p> But rapiers are n't good at penetrating armor . A rapier was a gentleman 's dueling sword . You may be thinking of an estoc , which was basically a metal-hafted spear . <p> Unless estocs were top heavy and meant to be swung around like an axe , my point still stands that mass is n't the only key factor in penetrating . <p> UnitOmega wrote : <p> Also , Grue is right about rapiers .

I did assume that you could combine the Called Shot : Bypass Armor with Armor-Piercing to get the AV 0 . If you can double up on Armor-Piercing , it makes the Sniper Railgun worthwhile , but I do n't know that it really makes sense from a simulation standpoint . <p> The rules on Layering Armor ( pg 21 ) make it pretty difficult for a morph like the Steel Morph to keep up with biomorphs on armor .

I 've left off the cheesier things , like adding Second Skin and Armor Clothing to these , since hopefully the GM 's discretion would kick in there . <p> It 's possible the SOM limit in the layering section is intended to apply to characters with only a single layer of armor as well , in which case , this armor stacking is n't a real problem . For example , a 15 SOM would probably result in an Armored Vest ( light ) and Second Skin for 6/13 armor . The average flat would just wear the Armored Vest for 4/10 . Even the extreme soldiers ( SOM 30 ) would be limited to Battlesuit Exoskeleton and Dermal Armor for 29/30 . In this case , the Reaper can close the gap with an Impact armor coating to get to 28/27 which is probably close enough . If we go cheesy ( adding Second Skin ) , we can get the Reaper to 30/30 . In any case , the SOM probably serves as a good guideline for a GM on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shock attacks are extremely effective against biomorphs ( since even on a success , you still take -30 for 3 turns ) , so this might equalize the battlefield enough that the Reapers dominate even if the biomorphs have 8 more armor . <p> If the SOM limit is n't intended to be used this way , it would be nice to have an option for a synth to remove their frame level armor so they have access to things like the Battlesuit Exoskeleton ( perhaps even making the scale/carapace armor option available in that case ) . <p> Complexity values are missing for a number of these entries , though I assume that 's a known issue . It would also be nice to be more explicit about which armor sets include a helmet . I assume Combat Armor does ( which makes the standard Body Armor with a Helmet ( Full ) more protective vs . Kinetic attacks ) . <p> The rules on Layering Armor ( pg 21 ) make it pretty difficult for a morph like the Steel Morph to keep up with biomorphs on armor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally expect everyone to be sleeved into Reapers , together with the Synthmorph Armor ( Heavy Combat ) for a total of 28/24 . Meanwhile , our Fury with Scale Armor and a Battlesuit Exoskeleton has 31/32 armor . I 've left off the cheesier things , like adding Second Skin and Armor Clothing to these , since hopefully the GM 's discretion would kick in there . <p> Well , first off a fury already comes with bioweave armor , and I 'm not entirely sure you can have multiple forms of bioware armor ? Secondly , the reaper also comes with more durability , more vigor , 4 weapon mounts ( on top of it 's two usable limbs ) , and ability to ignore one wound . Lastly , the main issue seems to be the frankly MASSIVE armor provided by the battlesuit exoskeleton , which does n't even have a description listed . I would n't be surprised to see it give a native action penalty or other such drawback . Heck , we do n't see a complexity offered , the cost to acquire one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edit : Also , the reaper does n't necessarily need to be the best in every way . Using the examples you gave , the fury can get 3/8 more armor points , sure . Compared to all the other bonuses a reaper naturally gets . But , if armor is truly your biggest priority , maybe you would prefer to go with a fury . <p> Have n't read the thread yet , just recording my thoughts as I go through the booklet . Apologies if there are repeats of previous comments in here . <p> If attacking with multiple weapons in melee collapses down into single attacks , why does attacking with multiple ranged weapons not do the same thing ? it seems like " extra volumn of fire " should have much the same upshot , at least for game mechanics . <p> The point is to avoid the guy with an octomorph and six machine pistols from having to roll 6+6 times for attack and damage . Just let him apply a bonus to the attack roll and damage roll for extra weapons . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Looking at the Social Modifers table , I see much the same issues as the original general function modifers had . Just we switch that to " Very hard , hard , slightly hard " , I would say Social table should move to " Very Unfriendly , Unfriendly , slightly Unfriendly " , and then likewise with " Cooperative " . Meanwhile , The request modifers seem fine . <p> So , during the Surprise Round , neither side can use Vigor for extractions ? Interesting . Somewhat mutes the deadliness of an Ambush , but it seems reasonable to make fights not end in the opening round . <p> Armor Piercing having a build in damage reduction seems odd and would tend to mean that a lot of the time you do n't actually deal any more damage . If we must , have it be a flat -2 rather than a full roll -1d10 . Then it 's a small , predictable penalty and using a big AP round on a soft target is less scary than hollow points , but still pretty dang good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to have an Ecto or better to ride in . Means the group has to designate who 's the babysitter for the TacNet ( Probably whoever has Radio Boosters , meaning probably me . ) Do the Tacknet skills have the ALI 's Aptitudes ( or lack therof ) already factored in ? <p> In the Micrgravity Section , the note on Escape Velocity has been mistakenly labled " Termnal Velocity " , which is actually the max speed you can fall through an atmosphere ( Potentially also interesting ) <p> The section on Dangerous Atmospheres mention oxygen , but not CO2 poisoning , which actually tends to become a problem faster . <p> Hmmm , the Timeframes for Rep mention you can get a Major item " once per campaign " but then in Downtime Actions you appear to be able to do it once a week with a strong enough Rep net . Is this intended to represent you having an entire week to pay back the relevant favors to account for such things ? May also be a good time to remind people of the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : <p> IMPROVE APTITUDES Raise aptitudes at the cost of 1 RP per aptitude point . Aptitudes may not be raised above 30 . Raising the value of an aptitude also raises the value of all linked skills by an equivalent amount . If this raises any linked skills over 60 , an additional 1 RP must be spent per linked skill over 60 ( with the exception of the character 's native language skill and skills capped at 99 ) . <p> I would rather say that the linked skills generate a refund of the affected skill points , if the player prefers that to going over the 60 line . Easier to track , just spend the skill points at the same time the refund happens . Also , Languages do n't have a skill ranking anymore , you either have it or you do n't .

An ear or finger will take a week , an arm or leg a full month . Healing vats greatly accelerate this process to somewhere between 4 hours ( ear/finger ) and 2 days ( full limb ) , and can even restore a full body from just a head ( 1 month ) . <p> Woah ! That last one , while hella cool , conflicts with elsewhere stated fabrication rules where a from scratch Biomorph takes a full six months to put together .

And are you intended to re-take that stress when re-encountering the same life again later ? since it 's called ' The Unknown ' I would expect that is not the intent , but it 's a matter very vulnerable to arguments of pedantry . Likewise , does " witnessing async sleights " apply to slights you yourself are casting ? <p> Regarding Hardening : does anything stop me from , instead of treating it the normal way , just spending 5 rez ( or cp ) and buying back the lost SAV or WIL the hard way ?

There are no nano-treatments or quick fix options ( other than killing yourself and reverting to a non-stressed backup ) . The options for recuperating are simply natural healing over time or psychotherapy/ psychosurgery . <p> No , you 're right ; mathematically , there is no value of armor or damage for which it is more beneficial to halve armor than double damage . In fact , halving the target 's armor , unless I 'm mistaken , will always result in exactly half of what you 'd get by doubling damage . 
@@29834898 @3534898/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Technology Questions <p> I am new to the Eclipse Phase setting ( as a player ) and my game-master suggested I come here for some of my questions regarding technology in Eclipse Phase . They are rather specific questions , so bear with me . I realize all of these may be subject to modification based on the ruling game-master 's whim and fancy . In absence of real answers , I will accept suitably realistic pseudoscience . <p> What type of He-3 fusion reactor does the setting use ? Is it similar to the TOKAMAK design or something entirely different ? Do they use RF heating or something else ? Does it change by habitat ? <p> How are synthetic morphs powered ? Do they have an on board reactor ? Is it battery powered ? Nuclear battery powered ? Along those lines , do they require He-3 to survive ? How long do the batteries last ? What radioisotope is used in the nuclear batteries ? <p> Semi-related to the last question , what radioisotope is used in the nuclear batteries used to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Betavoltaic ? photovoltaic ? <p> Is the neutrino detector 's active material toxic ? Is it hygroscopic or similarly degraded in ' normal ' atmospheric conditions ( like one would expect in a habitat ) ? I.E. is a damaged neutrino detector dangerous to those around them ? will damage to the outside destroy the actual function of the detector ? <p> My last question is more of just a rules interpretation question . Do nanophages protect against , say , disassembler nanoswarms or is a guardian nanoswarm needed to protect against them ? <p> Most synthmorphs will use either a nuclear or rechargeable battery , not an internal reactor . The particular type/s of battery/batteries used will depend on the needs of the synthmorph . Your average synthmorph living in a big city or on a hab will use a standard rechargeable battery because it 's safer and there 's not likely to be a shortage of power . Nuclear batteries will be common for those living in isolated areas , or who regularly venture outside of habitats ( such as Martian terraformers or gatecrashers ) . Anarchists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The specific forms of nuclear battery used will depend on the power needs of the morph . A standard synth or even a case will have far lower demands for power and , hence , will place longevity over output . Hence , their batteries will have much longer half-lives . Meanwhile , someone sleeved in , say , a reaper will be using much higher output batteries . Most likely , anyone using a nuclear battery will also have a recharge battery , which will absorb power when in low-use mode and provide it in high-use mode . <p> Nanophages/Disassemblers <p> Nanophages are assumed to affect nanobots attacking your body , with a particular focus on internal security . They 're designed to work inside the body . More specifically , they affect nanotoxins most effectively of all . Disassembler swarms , meanwhile , attack from the outside in . As such , they 'd be ripping you to pieces and have already done considerable damage before your nanophages even detected them .

Is it similar to the TOKAMAK design or something entirely different ? Do they use RF heating or something else ? Does it change by habitat ? <p> I do n't think it has been stated , but I assume something like a tokamak using RF heating ( or maybe laser heating , given the advanced optics ) . I assume at least older reactors used deuterium +helium reactions , but in modern reactors it might be just pure helium ( and hence less radioactive ) . <p> Quote : <p> Is the neutrino detector 's active material toxic ?

I assume at least older reactors used deuterium +helium reactions , but in modern reactors it might be just pure helium ( and hence less radioactive ) . <p> In the text it is clearly stated that Helium-3 mining operations occur for fusion fuel . This means that EP reactors are probably of the Hydrogen-2 + Helium 3 variety , due to the rarity of He3 , this would use the limited Helium 3 in the most efficient manner . It is also the most energetic fusion reaction , slightly more energetic than the Deuterium-Tritium reaction . <p> While Hydrogen 2 + Hydrogen 3 does eject a neutron , Hydrogen 2 + Helium 3 does not . Therefore , for reducing secondary radiological effects , the He3+H2 reactors would be ' cleaner ' . He3 + He3 fusion is even more difficult to achieve , given the increased Coloumb forces required to overcome the extra proton 's electromagnetic force ... <p> As to what sort of reactors are used , given that EP magnetohydrodynamic technology allows morphs to survive in the solar corona , it is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . However , for compact military applications , I envision Laser/Maser/etc-pumped pulsed inertial fusion reactors to be used , despite the extreme tolerances required in construction and operationg ( injection of Hohlraums at precise time intervals , etc ) , and additional fuel processing cost ( Manufacturing Hohlraum fuel pellets , etc ) <p> " <p> As mind to body , so soul to spirit . As death to the mortal man , so failure to the immortal . Such is the price of all ambition . <p> Thank you all for your comments ! I am sorry it took me so long to respond , I became a little discouraged after finding the part of Panopticon on fission power . While I appreciate some leeway must be given for sci-fi , it hurt my little brain . I was hoping for a little more specifics in nuclear battery/rechargable battery lifetimes ( like how long one might expect a synth battery to last on a typical Martian model ) but I suppose my poor gamemaster will have to deal with that . : ) <p> NewAgeOfPower wrote : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hydrogen 2 + Helium 3 does not .

He3 + He3 fusion is even more difficult to achieve , given the increased Coloumb forces required to overcome the extra proton 's electromagnetic force ... <p> Yes , but D-D fusion can produce neutrons . With a plasma of He-3 and D , you will inevitably have D-D fusion . If the goal is to reduce neutron emissions entirely , this would be a poor choice . That being said , some of the rarer elements could potentially be manufactured via neutron activation . Since I get the impression that nano-fabrication has resulted in elements , not materials , having value , this may be a wise choice . Of course , using a fission reactor may be a wiser choice for this sort of activation anyway . Accepting you are going to have D-D fusion , it might be worthwhile to go the whole shabang and utilize D-D , D-T , and D-He3 fusion by breeding tritium via lithium inside your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a cryogenic coolant for your massive , supercooled superconductors . This waste , once loaded with heat , could be vented into space ( in the case of orbital or lagrangian habitats ) to avoid the necessity of heat loss through black body radiation . Of course , this would require some source of deuterium as well ( the solar wind , perhaps ) and some way to dispose of the activated reactor components at the end of the reactor 's lifetime . Thinking about it , you may even want to use the He-4 as a coolant . The rankine cycle is more efficient at higher temperatures and ' futuristic radiation/heat resistant materials ' could survive much higher temperatures . All that being said , from a design standpoint , having neutron free fusion would be absolutely fantastic . Gives those with an ample supply of He-3 for sale quite the political bargaining chip . <p> The game actually lists an average rechargeable battery life of 400-500 hours , or approximately a week and a half . However , microwave power transmission is so ubiquitous that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to charge . <p> As for nuclear batteries ... Again , depends on the half-life . Some could have batteries that last a very short time indeed . Meanwhile , if you can somehow run yourself off a lump of uranium-238 , you 're looking at a lifespan measured in more time than human civilization . The longer the half-life , though , the less power . <p> Ah , thanks Axel . I guess I missed that when I was reading through the books . Week and a half , good to know . <p> As far as RF heating ( of He-3 reactors ) goes , I realized it would n't work . At least not initially . Helium-3 has no net proton spin ! RF heating only works on nuclei with an odd number of protons ! After you have some fusion , however , you will have hydrogen buildup in your reactor ( as well as deuterium and tritium buildup ) and those can be heated using RF techniques . That being said , the buildup of these elements will also produce neutrons ( as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plus you would get a buildup of positrons ! Yay , Antimatter ! <p> A couple more fresh questions : I realize in the case of children it may be favorable to grow the morph from a wee-child , allowing their ego to grow with the body . In the case of a biomorph to be used to sleeve in a tourist , why would you bother growing it ? It seems like nano-fabrication would be much easier ? The only reason I can think of is the longer process has a more stable load on the electrical system . Since fusion reactors are better fitted for base loading anyway , this might be preferable for the habitats systems . Other than that ? <p> Secondly , why are n't there ' disassemblers ' or ' reverse engineering nano-defabs ' ? If seems like if you have the technology to use nanomachines to perfectly build an object , you could disassemble something and create a perfect blueprint . While it would replicate any wear or damage on the object , it seems like it would have some major advantages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would allow autonomists to steal the same technology . Yeah , it would probably regulated to heck and back , but should n't it exist ? <p> I realize in the case of children it may be favorable to grow the morph from a wee-child , allowing their ego to grow with the body . In the case of a biomorph to be used to sleeve in a tourist , why would you bother growing it ? It seems like nano-fabrication would be much easier ? <p> There have been some discussions here about how good nanoassembly of soft semifluid materials really are . One can certainly grow cells in a medium and then stack them together , but pure nanofabrication seems to be tricky ( and inefficient : general manufacturing is often more expensive than specialised , even in nanoassembly ) . This is likely the real difference between biomorphs and pods : pods use living materials that were put together artificially without long-range growth ( it takes about a year for a limb axon to grow to full length even with speeded up proliferation , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeves , pods are presumably the cheap solution . <p> Quote : <p> Secondly , why are n't there ' disassemblers ' or ' reverse engineering nano-defabs ' ? If seems like if you have the technology to use nanomachines to perfectly build an object , you could disassemble something and create a perfect blueprint . <p> General nanodisassembly is a much trickier process than it looks . Molecules are often bound together with strong bonds in manufactured objects , and there are no ways to " see " what lies under the surface - so you have to do trial and error , quite likely breaking both your tooltips and the surface . <p> In practice automated reverse engineering is possible for more constrained domains . If the only thing that matters is shape down to a certain resolution , one can imagine a counterpart to laser measurement scanning to replicate it . Most everyday objects are made of standard nanomodules fitted together , which makes recycling easier . The big problem is devices with dense or soft structures , strained chemical bonds , or deliberate anti-reverse engineering measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they are emptied , for example ) . <p> So I think reverse engineering is big business , often uses automated systems ( I posted about some AI papers about automated mechanism inference at this forum at some point ) , but it is not quick and easy except for very simple things . Making backups of your kid 's beloved toys , scratches an all , is easy . Backing up your dog , not so easy . <p> That brings to mind the first Homeworld game . Hi-sci-fi I know but is it plausible to just atomize something you want to recycle then using some kind of torch and then collect said atoms with some kind of magnetic ram scoop and let the nano-systems filter and sift through what base elements remain , that way you have raw materials to work with . Nice and recycled . <p> " <p> " And yet , across the gulf of space , minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes .

From the minds eye of the Lost they had at least ten years ( despite it not being that in reality ) of infection with the Exsurgent virus before their " birth " into reality - by the time it was realised that there was a problem the damage was already done and counselling techniques of the time did n't help because of either a complete lack of knowledge of Watts-Macleod at the time or complete ignorance of their infection .

@@29834910 @3534910/ <p> I needed to give some thought over how well things fit together before commenting . I do n't know if the characters are better or worse off in Eclipse Phase . In Eclipse Phase , you can die frequently and come back the next day . Hell , some mad scientist might be willing to try some experimental flash cloning tech that might have some " unpleasant side effects " . Of course death never stopped Futurama before . And there were horrible things in Futurama that could happen to you that did n't require that you die . In Futurama , they flew around finding dangerous and unpleasant things far off in space , but in Eclipse Phase , it has some horrible things that can make collecting WMDs seem like a healthy hobby to have . <p> As for the translations , the guy has managed to translate some characters reasonably well , and keep some of the humor in. 
@@29834911 @3534911/ <h> **Updated**My take on a custom 2ed beta Character Sheet , not form fillable <p> Hello , first time poster and just wanted to share my custom character sheet we 've been using . Just to note I 'm not a graphic designer and this was originally created in word which hates it when you start putting lots of tables together on the same page . This pdf is n't form fillable because I do n't own the right software for such , however my original word file is what we edit , which is complete with some added functions like apt linked to skills . I then exported it to pdf for printing because the word margins are too wide and does n't fully print correctly from word . <p> Also on the third page morph sheet , if you fold it , probably adjusting the fold areas according to your printer setup and maybe even trimming a little of the sides , you should be able to fold it over the right side of the base character sheet for morph changes . <p> I 'm personally not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not hard to make a blue version to be easier on the eyes . <p> Also " SAVY " is correctly spelled " SAVVY " , with two V 's . <p> Only six lines for Slights , but five for melee weapons ? I 'd reduce the melee section to 3 or 4 , and increase PSI to 7 or 8 lines . <p> The " Morph " card in the upper left is a nice layout , but you only have one of them ? Half the point of morphs is you can swap them around . A third page of spare morph cards plus an extra Notes section seems called for . <p> In the Gear section , a checkbox at the side labeled " Has Blueprint ? " would be appreciated . <p> You may be misinterpreting the Empathy trait . I suspect it 's +5 to SAV rolls ( i.e. SAVx3 ) , rather than +5 to SAV linked skills . If it 's the latter , it 's really worth 5 CP ( or more ) instead of 1 CP , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as letting you exceed 80 ( 2 CP per skill ) . <p> The character sheet looks nice , though like o11o1 , I think it would be nice if all the ego stats would fit on one page , while the gear and morph were on the next . Psi could go on its own page if it does n't fit , since most players wo n't use it . With that setup , players could have add sheets as needed for their morphs . <p> Unfortunately , since the ego is more important , it has more information , and it may not fit well on a single page . <p> I 'll make some mods to it and see what it looks like . My original idea was trying to make a sheet like in Monte Cook 's The Strange , that would of had the morph as a extra character sheet that folded over the main sheet . But there is so much info , that it 's hard to fit all the ego stuff and leave room for a second sheet cover area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I can also throw up a blue version , I 'm personally more fond of the red , but that all comes down to personal preference . <p> Finally got around to getting an updated version of my beta character sheet up . Formatting the tables was giving me some problems but I finally got it to work . This version is still a two page set up with a third page given over to a foldable morph sheet that should , maybe with a little trimming of the left and right margins , fold over and cover the base sheet morph for morph changes . This third sheet would update weapons , armor , pools , traits , upgrades , gear and implants . It 's not connected to skills , though , so you may still have to adjust a few things like skills and such as needed . For my printer set up , I folded just slightly left of the weapons table and trimmed about a 1/2 inch of the left margin for it to cover the correct areas of the base sheet . 
@@29834913 @3534913/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Plausible Monsters <p> At first glance , multicellular organisms would seem like the least effective means for trolling a population . Not only are they visible to the naked eye , but they cast an infrared signature is a mile wide . Synthetics are quicker to build , cheaper to maintain , and more easily modified once fully grown . Knowing this , why bother with plants and animals ? <p> Several reasons , in fact . For one , autonomous replication . While synths may eventually outlast an animal , they ca n't effectively reproduce fine components except through nanotech , and self-replicating nanotech does n't exist yet . They could carry special fabbers on their bodies , but this puts a floor under their size ; not even protean hives scale below that of a large insect . Reliance on nanoassembly also leaves these robots dangerously vulnerable to EMP . True self-replicating machines are beyond the understanding of all but transhumanity 's worst nightmares . <p> Organic molecules , on the other hand , are a proven and reliable alternative . Replication from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not be very large . While circuits , sensors and batteries need exotic elements that can only be scavenged from similar electronics , organic compounds are often cheaper and more ubiquitous in most environments . Where food is plentiful they can replicate exponentially . A small investment of time at a sequencer can wreck immense returns in damage , as several Consortium ships found out when they were seeded with aerogel-eating weevils after the first Battle of Locus , and lost heat just long enough to freeze a few dozen biomorphs . <p> Complex organisms can also mirror the threat vectors of larger robots . Basic biomods augment the body 's immunity to most bacteria and viruses , and nanomedicine can take care of the rest . So while engineered pathogens are still a threat against the unvaccinated , they are not in intractible one . Neither are teeth and claws , of course , but medichines can only heal their damage , not eliminate the source . Thus multicellular life still has a place in the genehackers ' arsenal . <p> It should be noted that not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mercurials . Some are just harmless pranks that will irritate a population for one breeding season before hab security scrubs them back to the Pre-Cambrian . Tenacious species will often hide quietely in the slums or sensor blind spots of larger habitats , their presence reduced to a tolerable nuissance not worth the diminished returns of a more thorough eradication campaign , which will only provoke the trolls into releasing an upgraded batch . <p> Reactions can vary widely between factions . Sometimes the presence of multiple genopunks keeps them all in equilibrium , and forward-thinking societies employ ecologists to help with these calculations , even inserting their own safe organisms into the equation . This is the route taken by many Lunar-Lagrange habitats , particularly those with an Indian cultural majority . Some Anarchists take it even further , their adherence to animal liberation spurring research into zoosemiotics in an attempt to communicate with the creatures . By stark contast , Jovian Biosecurity will torch any unlicensed transgenics on site . <p> Extropian habs regard population control as a problem of individual proprietors and their contractors . Sometimes these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more commonly pests just get pushed only someone else 's property , prompting an endless torrent of litigation . Scum fleets tend to tolerate even the most dangerous creatures , as watching a swarm cat fight an Uberratte makes life more interesting . Customs authorities around the system issue especially loud groans whenever one of their shuttles makes planetfall . <p> It 's not even the case that biologicals are always harder to hide than synthetics . They do n't set off metal detectors , and chem sniffers are useless when they share the same basic components as every biomorph . Without a deliberate x-ray scan it 's especially difficult to detect organisms hidden inside another , which makes parasites particularly effective against targets without medichines . <p> Genehackers can further conceal their progenies with a bit of creative with bioware . Chameleon Skin is a common choice , and they can augment it with heat sinks like a Chameleon Cloak . Chitinous radar-absorbant exoskeletons are another option ; the giant Stealth Urchin even attains full invisibility with transparent metamaterials . Still , the easiest method by far is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Threats and pranks aside , most genopunks are actually harmless and well intentioned . Like smart pets , people create them for aesthetic reasons , companionship , or just because they can . Many roam freely on habitats , fed by residents or the native plant life . <p> Over the years , numerous species have been released into ecosystems of Mars , to mingle with the more purpose-built terraformers . Even the dangerous ones are largely left to their devices , too firmly rooted to be worth eradicating just to make life a little safer for rednecks no one cares about . Besides , they breath , and more biomass means more carbon dioxide to heat the planet . Carbon never does go out of style . <p> Example : Somatek Geijigeiji <p> An experimental smart pet gone waaaay wrong . Somatek attempted this years ago , basing it on the large scutigera centipedes once kept as pets by some Japanese people . The idea was to create a geijigei that looked cute and could produce rudimentary speech . Unfortunately , Somatek did something to cross one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trials but before the first blueprint release they managed to slip a replacement in without anyone knowing . At first , this new design was indistinguishable from the original . Once the geijigei reached maturity , however , things took a turn for the sanity shattering . <p> This monstrous geijigei is approximately a half meter long , with exactly 100 legs attached to a black chitinous exoskeleton , and equipped with dense network of fine hairs enabling it to run on air for short bursts . Its face is like that of the the original centipede , save for a grotesque human-like mouth . Through a heavily modified set of the organs of T+m+sv+ry , it can produce sounds of variable range and amplitude . Lacking a cybercortex it is incapable of understanding what sounds it produces . <p> The geijigei hunts by attempting to mimic the sounds of its prey , repeating single words or phrases over and over . " Please help me " is a common choice . Once the prey has approached close enough , the geijigeiji launches into a full run , travelling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once it has overtaken the prey , it injects a powerful cocktail of neurotoxins via its forcipules . After which it feeds . <p> Naturally , once this problem became apparent Somatek immediately issued a recall and built itself a bunker out of lawyers and PR consultants . A thorough extermination ensued on the habitats effected , but biosecurity teams could not account for all the purchased specimens . Contrary to the standard reproductive restrictions on smart pets , female geijigei can lay hundreds of eggs . Specimens survive by hiding in out of the way places like Lunar and Martian slums , the sanitary sewers of the same , or on the less stringently maintained habitats and ships of scum fleets . Also in nightmares . <p> Other Examples <p> Neo-Chupacabra - A scaley , spiny predator in the shape of a large dog , harvesting nourishment from transgenic livestock and other luxury " real foods " , the " reindeer " of Titan 's hulder population , and unlucky biomorphs by extracting fluids and liquefied organs . The Titanian variant 's harvesting bypasses the need to replenish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moledog - A dog with tentacled heads and no sight living as packs in the Martian cave systems . <p> Uberatte - A giant rat with powerful teeth , able to chew through metal and potentially even cause hull breached .

Small habs that see an infestation of something off a ship would be more inclined to let the robots and nanoswarms handle it , while Mars , Titan and Europa are more open environments with lots of organic matter to play with , so the cost gap between artificials requiring deliberate manufacture vs self-replicating biologicals widens . <p> Politically , the Planetary Consortium is strong-arming its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to cut corners and select methods to deliver the quickest results with little concern for long-term consequences , especially those that disproportionately effect the rednecks .

Specifically : after an exsurgent outbreak in a morph-lab , the Sentinels are tasked with locating an brinker scientist slash genegineer prodigy , who may be infected but is otherwise responsible for the outbreak .

It has a break down of their politics ( like Titan ) in the Rimward book , and I know that it is not Jovian , and is very transhuman ( unlike Callisto 's Hyoden which is apparently the transhuman fringe part of the Jovian Republic ) , but beyond that I am lost . <p> What are the laws on weapons ?

You have a bunch of different factions brought together and while ordinarily they do n't get along they 're all there for the same reason , namely to study the amazing life of the moon . One of the strange benefits of the current antagonism between the Republic and the Consortium is that the ability to exploit resources is severely curtailed so most stations are on site research only ( a few samples get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " research " ) . This leads to a more cooperative attitude between the disparate polities , like how nations work together ( kind of ) in Antarctica . <p> Weapons laws are probably pretty forgiving as aggressive native predators would need shooing off . The weapons themselves are rather different . Torpedoes replace missiles , harpoons instead of bullets , ink sprays and eelskin are probably popular . More exotic weaponry could include Shkval-style supercavitating rockets and projectiles based upon the nematocysts of jellyfish . <p> Curiously , the environment allows for more privacy than is normally available . The mesh has to be directly connected between habs via cable so staying off the grid is easy . Different habs having very different environmental setups -standard atmosphere and pressure , trimix , equalized pressure gases , LBM , oxygenated water ( who wants the bubbling treasure chest ? ) - also limit to a degree who can visit . Between habs there may be a regular submarine transportation service like the train coming through town- or even an undersea Scum fleet ! <p> Politically , it 's probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much guarantee that .

Someone with a fusion reactor has a , for all intents and purposes , unlimited supply of fuel available , and the oceans can likely be sifted for organic materials if need be . Running a fusion reactor , of course , is not exactly something anyone can just do for giggles , though , so there 's probably agglomerations of polities centred around a power source . These polities probably resemble Venusian habitats more than anything , since bubble warrens do best with larger amounts of living space . <p> The only downside is that materials beyond basic necessities may be comparatively rarer . They would need to come from the ocean floor , and that 's something worth considering the import of . You 'd probably see cities founded above or around areas in the crust that are tectonically active , simply because it constantly shoots up new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you might even see them follow lines along areas of geothermal activity . <p> This probably means Europan cities are reasonably independent of one another ; they do n't have much reliance on trade with each other but probably do have a rich relationship with each other academically and the same with foreign polities . There also is apparently a formalized government of sorts , which means that each city likely has standardized forms of government in the shape of representative democracy . <p> The economy , therefore , is probably transitional ; a mix of credits and rep , with the local governments providing basic resources to all , thanks to their relative abundance . Given the presence of Jovian terrorists and the relatively progressive mindset , I imagine weapon laws are probably reasonably strict by system standards ; licensing , restriction on types of weapons owned , etc . Everyone remembers the Fall , though , so the idea of banning weapon ownership would likely seem foolish to most transhumans . <p> I have n't gotten very far in rimawrd so the whole time i have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ europa. and then there is a possibility for sub surface habs but the pressures and currents are a big unknown factor <p> Thanks for the input , I was trying to decipher the economic bits and could n't figure out how they 'd be set up .

@@29834923 @3534923/ <p> My assumption is that in-game rep values are just representations of your standing on the various social networks , which in practice are an amalgam of actual rep score , reviews from other users on the network and various other metrics which would typically be collated by a muse . So what someone sees is " his c-rep profile is in the 60th percentile of reputation scores and plastered in glowing reviews . " It would be a little convenient that every disparate social network standardised on the same 0-99 scale or works the same way . My take on it is that each network has its own rating system . The Eye uses some pseudo- " objective " percentile system , while c-rep uses stars and @-rep uses a non-ranking , cumulative system where you " raise flags " for other users , etcetera . <p> It 's certainly possible to run it as rep scores being in-game .

They 're one of the core elements of the game ( as far as I have seen ) but I do n't think we heard or seen much of them but that the effect physical stats/skills . It be interesting to see how they work and what can morphs do . It also be nice to see an example of a morph . <p> One of the ideas we had from the beginning when designing Eclipse Phase was to highlight resleeving , or the ability to digitally emulate your mind , upload it into a computer , and download it into another body . This raised the question of what characteristics stayed with/were determined by the character ( the " ego " ) , as they moved from body to body , and which stayed with/were determined by the meat ( the " morph " ) , or metal in the case of robot bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made sense that skills were copied along with the character 's mind when they uploaded . At first , we considered ditching any sort of physical attributes system entirely , but that nullified the idea that certain morphs provided certain ( usually physical ) advantages and also sort of countered one of the central elements of transhumanism : enhancing your body . <p> Skill-based systems also require a mechanic for making tests when a person does n't have a required skill . There needs to be some sort of inherent/natural ability that characters can default to when they do n't have a skill . For realism , it is better if this inherent ability differs according to the skill in question . Everyone can throw a baseball with some modicum of skill , but not everyone can do a backflip as easily or perform brain surgery . <p> So we went with an " aptitude " system -- a set of 7 inherent abilities that everyone has , and that are part of the ego . These are functionally similar to typical RPG attributes , but conceptually different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your morph , there is no " strength " or " dexterity " aptitude . Instead , we have aptitudes like Somatics , which represents your ability to use the physical characteristics of whatever morph you are in to the best of its capabilities . Instead of a " Charisma " type attribute , which often wavers between physical attractiveness and guile , we have a Savvy aptitude , which is a measure of your social perception and your ability to manipulate people . <p> Every skill in the game is linked to and built up from an aptitude . So your Kinesics skill , used for " reading " others ' body language , is linked to your Savvy aptitude . If you lack Kinesics skill , you default to Savvy . When you buy Kinesics skill , you raise it up from your Savvy score . <p> Tying this back to morphs , we get back to the idea that certain morphs are designed to increase your capabilities in certain areas . This is often represented with aptitude bonuses , and sometimes skill bonuses . Aptitude bonuses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all skills linked to that aptitude . So an Olympian morph , for example , which is designed for increased athleticism , provides a boost to your character 's Somatics aptitude , and thus all Somatics-linked skills . If you switch to a Menton morph , which is gengineered for enhanced cognitive abilities , you 'll lose that Somatics bonus but gain a bonus to Cognition , and all Cognition-linked skills , instead . This means that your morph has a direct impact on your skill capabilities . <p> Morphs also affect your character in other ways . Your character 's Durability , Wound Threshold , and Death Rating are determined by morph -- essentially how much damage and wounds you can take . <p> Morphs are divided into two rough categories : biomorphs and synthmorphs . Biomorphs are ( mostly ) biological bodies , and include standard unmodified humans ( " flats " ) , gengineered human clones of various abilities , uplifted animal bodies , and so-called " pods . " Pods ( from " pod people " ) are biological bodies force-grown grown as separate parts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being much faster than standard transhuman clone growth ) . Synthmorphs are essentially robots with cybernetic brains , and they come in all shapes and sizes , from androids/gynoids to spider bots and stranger things . <p> Almost all morphs come with a basic set of bio-mods and implants , including faster healing , longevity , immunity to most diseases , and cybernetics that provide wireless network access , augmented reality , and digital mind backups . Synthmorphs have their own unique advantages and disadvantages . <p> When you resleeve into a new morph , there is usually a period of adjustment you must go through in order to acclimate to your new body . There is also the chance of suffering from mental stress , either from remembering your death , losing time/continuity , or having an identity crisis with your new looks . <p> Here 's an example of a morph listing from the core book : the bouncer . We previewed the artwork for this one earlier .

This is even after I read the Exhuman section in X-Threats . <p> Forgive the rookie question , but Exhumans seem slightly redundant given the presence of other extreme ideologies and morphological circus sideshowery in the game . : P <p> Like Urthdigger said , most of these ideologies consider themselves transhuman or find the human form relevant to various degrees . The Exhuman decided that humanity and anything human is weak and holding themselves back , so they want to use the new technologies to crank their personal power up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mental power like those walking brains do . The Ultimates still value the human form . Extropians are more concerned with profits and free markets than a strong opinion about human form . <p> From a gamemasters perspective , Exhumans can be used like Aliens when you do n't want to bring the Exsurgent virus into play . The X-Risks pretty much gives you the Xenomorph so you can definitely use these like that . The Brain guys work a lot better as " man behind the man " kinda threat . <p> What I 'm trying to figure out is how a PC exhuman would work---it 's a faction package option in the Transhuman splatbook , after all , but I 'm trying to figure out how one 's supposed to RP an exhuman allied to Firewall if most of the lore on exhumans paints them as either royal sociopaths or just unnervingly unknowable ( like those weird artist bug people from I think one of the Anarchist habitats ) . With the former it could possibly create unwanted OOC friction within a gaming group and I figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I imagine it might need a player to spell some things out to the rest of their group . <p> A PC exhuman would likely be one that considers itself benevolent to humanity for one reason another . Pet apes basically . Or perhaps it feels attacking people to be a waste of time and resources , and would rather set its sights on something that actually poses a challenge . Or maybe it has the kind of superiority complex that needs adoring fans . <p> I have an exhuman in my team . Every instance of PC exhuman should be pretty unique . Her story is that she was a gatecrasher morph designer who spliced a little too much of a xenofauna into her morph and when she sleeved into it , it gave her exurgent virus , psychosis , some atavisms and a taste for live meat . Preferably of the intelligent kind . And she rolled with it . So she has been placed under Firewall observation . Why she was not kidnapped into some blacklab ? Cause her daddy is the head of FaYing corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everyone . She is quantum entanglement agent ; - ) <p> And yes I have an Ultimate and Exhuman in one group . When complimented with AGI emerged from a assassin AI you can START to get the picture of our attitude towards collateral damage . <p> Exhumans are probably best described as survival focused radical utilitarians ideologically . They 're all about taking whatever measures they think will make them stronger and more survivable , which is n't super unique . Where they really stand out is that they are one of the only groups which is heavily involved with major mental/ego alterations . Most transhumans are basically the same sort of person but in a weird body ( which is psychological changes that implies ) , but Exhumans take things a step further and try to optimize their minds to the same extent as their bodies . They tend to be fairly crazy as a result , because this is a young science which they are on the cutting edge of . <p> They 're also generally fairly hostile to the rest of transhumanity , partially because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experiences , and partially because they see greater transhumanity as a strong competitor for other resources they want to use .

@@29834933 @3534933/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Pando Exsurgent Virus <p> So for my campaign I 'm going to be making my own strain of the exsurgent virus , called the Pando Virus . The idea behind it is that a TITIAN got a hold of cells from Tanaka and used them to engineer a new virus . The virus first acts as a digital virus and infects all systems that it can slowly and quietly . Once it has the majority of systems under its control , it takes a fabber and starts to create the nanovirus . The nanovirus uses modified Tanakan genetics to transform biomorphs into a menagerie of different xenomorphs that are akin to the zerg or tyranids . My method for creating each xenomorph was to mix and match between two different categories . The first one is the size of the xenomorph and consequently its armor and mobility with smaller creatures being faster and larger creatures being tougher and better armored . The second category is the creatures function in the swarm which is further divided into two other categories , combat and support . Combat xenomorphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Support xenomorphs assist the combat creatures through Tanakan spores , psi powers , exsurgent magic , or any combination of the three . Here are a couple of creatures that I have already made : <p> Canary <p> COG 5 COO 5 INT 40 REF 40 SAV 5 SOM 5 WIL 10 <p> INIT 10 SPD 3 DUR 20 WT 2 DR 30 <p> Canaries are a chitinous sphere about the size of a cat with four small clawed limbs equidistant from each other on the sphere . Behind it are a set of insect-like wings that allow the sphere to fly . Canaries act as the forward scouts for the Pando virus and exist only to be shot at . Actually killing one is a bit harder thanks to its psi powers , which allows a canary to read the mind of all biomorphs and will know when and how they will try to harm it . While the canary 's power on synthmorphs is useless , it is still a hard target to hit thanks to its speed and small size . Transhumans trying to shoot the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other exsurgents . <p> Skills : Fray 80 , Flight 50 , Perception 70 , Sense 75 <p> Notes : Armor 3/2 , 360-degree vision , echolocation , enhanced smell , wings , small size trait , vacuum sealing . All attacks directed at the canary from a biomorph automatically fail . If a biomorph decides to go full psi defense , roll an Opposed Test using the canary 's Sense against the biomorph 's WILx 3 . If the canary wins , it can read the target 's mind and if it fails it can not automatically dodge and rolls Fray like normal . <p> Sabs are the size of a human and have 4 arms with the larger top arms having pterodactyl-like wings , prehensile feet , and a long flat tail that acts like a rudder when flying . Sabs are covered in quills that pulse with light like fiber optic cables . Sabs are saboteurs of both transhuman and machine , all thanks to their quills . The quills allow camouflage by changing color and if a quill is inserted into a biomorph , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sab was touching it ( typically uses Scenario ) . If a quill is inserted into a synth , bot , or vehicle , the exsurgent nanotech of the quill fuses with the electronics of the machine , shutting down the target and preventing it from rebooting . The quill also seems to form a kind of antenna in the machine , though for what is anyone 's guess . If subterfuge fails , sabs can use their quills as hand to hand weapons and can even shoot them out at distant targets . <p> Does a heavily infected area start to develop a nanofungal coating , as the Pando viriiform subsumes the surrounding area to generate more significant biomechanical soldiers ? ( Not directly threatening in itself , but certainly terrifying to try to move through - xenofungal growth squishing underfoot and the ever-present and possibly imaginary threat of spores infiltrating . With motile outgrowths that brush at anything moving , and occasional nanoswarm hives embedded in the fungus like spore pods . ) <p> What if this exsurgent virus wants to meet up with its megaorganism counterpart ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could finally bring stability to Tanaka long enough to mount some sort of gatewar on transhumanity . That would be terrifying . You could remove the TITAN aspect and just have an exsurgent virus that mutated in a gatecrasher ' carrier ' on Tanaka before spreading itself back in Sol . <p> What if this exsurgent virus wants to meet up with its megaorganism counterpart ? Assuming the TITAN only based Pando on one megaorganism . It could finally bring stability to Tanaka long enough to mount some sort of gatewar on transhumanity . That would be terrifying . You could remove the TITAN aspect and just have an exsurgent virus that mutated in a gatecrasher ' carrier ' on Tanaka before spreading itself back in Sol . <p> I like this idea , actually - the Pando strain is a wild mutation , rather than a specific ETI or TITAN design , furiously knitting posthuman material with the Tanakan material as it seeks to further the original goal of the probe that set it off . <p> Gazelles are called such because they have an outline similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarities end as the creature is covered in smooth navy blue chitin , the head is featureless and ends in a sharp point . Rather than hooves or feet , the legs end in sharp cones , which the gazelle balances on perfectly . When charging , the small hump on the creature unfolds into long mantis-like bladed arms . Gazelles are the front-line skirmishers of Pando and are made to soften up the frontlines for the rest of the swarm . The arms are usually tipped with the Pando equivalent of Twitch . <p> You know those things Sabs plant into synths , bots , and vehicles ? Turns out they 're interfaces for Jammers to control the shells through their Psi powers . Jammers look like large isopods moving on six trunk-like legs . One Jammer controls around 40 different shells using the remote control rules . They are usually very far from the front and well armored and protected due to their importance to the swarm and they also ca n't really defend themselves without their bots . <p> Doppelgangers are exsurgent terrorists . Normally they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp teeth .

@@29834940 @3534940/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Environmental hazards on Mars <p> Recently , I 've read " Martian " by Andy Weir . Cool book and it provoked me to think what are environmental dangers on partly terraformed Mars of Eclipse Phase . <p> At first , I were upset by atmosferic pressure level . I really did n't believe that it 's possible in just about 50 years of terraforming to raise it from present average of 8hPa to something at least greater than Armstrong Limit of 63hPa . It 's the limit below that human 's fluids in contact with open air spontaneuosly boil in the standard body temperature . <p> But it seems that Mars ' poles ( esp . south one ) and soil contain enough CO2 in permafrost that it could raise the pressure as high as 300hPa . To enable it one has to heat up the south pole by 4K only . It seems that it 's largely done and permafrost melted . Sunward mentions that quick terraforming is over and now is the time for slower processes . So much slower that big-bang type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public into thinking that they 'd get further visible results in the lifetime of their current morph . Anyway , it probably means that there are orbital mirrors both at areostationary orbit and focused at poles . Aside : that would make areostationary pretty crowded - imagine those giant mirrors and then little room for communication , navigation and defence satellites . <p> But as it is , solving a problem causes two more . Release of CO2 leads to its greater quantities in atmosphere but if there is not enough other gases in atmosphere , some of CO2 gets dissolved in surface waters . Of course that makes them more acidic but I wonder if it could cause the explosive effect ( see : " Limnic eruption " at Wikipedia ) . Of course Mars does n't have volcanic or seismic activity but perhaps this effect can be triggered by iceteroid impact near body of water ? Or simple landslide ? Lethality would n't be great as everyone has breathers but biomorphs could be knocked unconscious by sonic wave . Also , such occurence could be mistaken ( at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military response or investigation . <p> Second one : it is possible that in some places thawed permafrost released water into the ground . Martian regolith is composed of fine dust and with enough water quicksands could form . Also , with rivers once again flowing and water upsetting previously stable dust formations , there could be substantial landslides . <p> Please correct me if I 'm wrong . If not , well , you have some pitfalls for your players to fall in or use to their advantage : ) <p> What other non-obvious environmental hazards of Mars can you think of ? <p> I 'd have to recheck , but I do n't think the breathers on mars have oxygen reserves . The way I remember , they mostly act as filters . And unless in vacsuits , unadapted biomorph receives penalties from the low pressure . <p> The Primary hazard of Mars should n't be discounted though ; the cold ( Rusters need winter gears , non-adapted morph require specialized extreme condition survival suits , average temp is between -50 and 10 Celcius , and sometimes reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the distance ( Mars is still pretty large ) and Isolation , Mars might have the highest population of the system , but it 's tightly packed in cities with virtually nothing between them . <p> A party could find themselves stranded thousands of kilometers from civilization after a dust storm ruined their vehicle . With your team having to survive with nothing but whatever they packed in an hostile environment devoid of anything to forage . And even with winter gear and adapted morph , the cold would get to them eventually in the colder months . This can also make for an interesting adventure , see how the team reacts . And it 's always a good lesson on preparedness . <p> " <p> In the sea without lees Standeth the bird of Hermes Eating his wings variable And maketh himself yet full stable <p> As far as I understand , of the two " Martian " morphs , only the Alpiner is technically suited to survive all terrains on Mars .

Low Pressure Tolerance does n't specify exactly how low a pressure it protects you from , but it gives you up to five minutes in hard vacuum before you really start hurting . The Alpiner does n't even bother trying to handle respiration on its own , it uses Respirocytes and the Oxygen Reserve to basically internalize an air breather . This is at the cost , also , of the Fast Metabolism . <p> For comparison , the Ruster 's enhanced respiration allows breathing in atmospheres between .2 ATM and 5 ATM of pressure . This still requires an appropriate concentration of oxygen , to my understanding , just it means your tolerance is much wider . They also have regular temperature tolerance , which is -30 to 60 C. <p> In Sunward , it says flat out , there 's not enough O2 for conventional biomorphs to breathe , though the Enhanced Respiration will settle that ( Though personally , I say that in the highlands , the Low Pressure still gets you without some gear and maybe an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domes , and the Ruster is kind of a shill for the " redneck " populace working the lines in the hinterlands who do n't need air masks or tin cans to survive . The Breather backpack unit is n't pressurized , but it does produce a reserve of up to 8 hours of air , but it " recycles " it , so I assume that means it takes in CO2 to store O2 ( normally this is solar powered , but it has up to 24 hours of battery life ) . <p> That being said , I like some of the ideas put forward with the quicksands or the acidic waters ( I could easily see that last one coming into play for nano-ecologists or others trying to build stable rust-cultured organisms and messing with their delicate balance ) . <p> I 'd actually say Isolation is only a problem in the Zone , where communication out is jammed , and communication inside has to be brought with you , and will probably be picked up on , unless you 're deliberately trying . Mars has plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , not counting that because it 's so large , major roadways , air ways and train-lines probably have mesh nodes to connect the various city-states . I 'd only be a concern if you deliberately went out into the middle of nowhere for some reason , and did n't pack your radio boosters when your buggy runs into some quicksand or is buried in a landslide . Mars has a decent amount of small settlements , either terraforming stations , agridomes or nomadic groups , but if you go offroading I could see the terrain breaking up radio enough to make direct calls a problem . <p> Low pressure tolerance/adaptation is probably left purposefully vague so players and GM 's could customize it . <p> ah thought so .

Black and gray markets basically work this way now , but the presence of government authorities keeps a lid on the worst excesses . <p> Also important to note that not all of anarchist space is like this . This is one of the things that sets the criminal world apart from autonomists &amp; mutualists . Economies like Extropia do n't have government authority , but they do have contract law to stabilize them . Predominantly autonomist economies like Locus have anarchocommunist social structures that prevent them from acting like red markets . <p> At the end of the day , though , it has a lot to do with mindset . The distinction between criminal red markets , autonomists &amp; mutualists may seem sleight from a capitalist vantage point . They 're all basically lawless , right ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They self-identify as belonging to one camp or the other , and this should play out in terms of how their reputation networks react to certain kinds of behavior . <p> Example : Let 's say you sell some shady tech that does n't really work ( or works with unintended consequences ) in autonomist space . If you 're dealing with the average anarchist on Locus , your @-rep is going to take a hit and most people will just think you 're an asshole and not want to deal with you . In an Extropian framework , your @-rep would take a hit and you 'd be seen as a terrible business person . In a Guanxi framework , however , nobody cares , and the buyer 's only recourse is to come after you ; the proof is in whether you end up dead . <p> Note that even autonomist spaces like Extropia &amp; Locus have their anti-social criminal elements , of whom the character referred to in " Glory " is one . <p> A lot of people have asked how there can be criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal is to do stuff so heinous that even a place with no large government authority wants you around . Hopefully this post helps illustrate another , more subtle way to fall into the criminal camp : by using a red market style of doing business in a libertarian or anarchocommunist environment . <p> My intention is not to pick on words , but surely a " capitalist " would feel rather at home in a mutualist or , even more so , anarcho-capitalist setting . The distinction between red markets and anarchism may ( to a " capitalist " ) be a matter of degree , though . <p> Sorry . " Hypercorp capitalist " would 've been a more precise choice of words . In the Planetary Consortium 's sphere of influence , the hypercorps with the most political clout enjoy a favorable regulatory environment , while those on the outs may have their actions curtailed . From the hypercorp capitalist perspective , then , mutualism , anarchocapitalism , and red markets all look like the Wild West . <p> Just like capitalists in many Western countries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owns capital ; should he be involved with and protected by political and bureaucratical powers we could call him a " Corporatist " ? <p> Might I recommend " Systems of Survival " by Jane Jacobs ? if you can get past the format of the writing ( it 's written as a Platonic dialogue ) it 's quite eye-opening . It pertains to these sorts of concepts , and might be useful for speculative fiction when trying to invent new forms of commerce or politics . She defines and explores a biological , organic model of how the two ( and only two ) means of human subsistence ( namely , trading and taking ) create two separate , often diametric but completely interdependent syndromes of ethics and morality . The rest of the book explores the nature of various examples of corruption through these terms . Check her out . She 's anti-utopian , brilliant and slightly snarky . She also saved New York from Robert Moses . <p> Even without the problems of thieves or predators , commerce requires some kind of third-party guardianship to enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants themselves trustworthy ; or else the marketplace itself falls apart . Nobody would trade with each other . Trusting commerce to present itself honestly without a third-party to inflict consequences is absurd . As far as I can imagine , a " red market " ( open commerce in a place devoid of any organized guardianship ) would quickly and organically develop its own set of protectors out of the toughs who align themselves , even by threat of force , with certain groups of merchants and providers of commodities . These little warlords would end up enforcing whatever agreements were made and ( if trade were to continue in such a dangerous place ) would find themselves , after a time , judges , inspectors , attorneys , policemen , firemen , &amp;c of their own fiefdoms . <p> Thoughts , yes . Certainly you - ultimately - need the threat of force to ensure contracts are respected . Perhaps most people are honest and law abiding most of the time , but still . However , such enforcement need not be in the form of a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these purposes as they both exercise violence on people who have not voluntarily subjected themselves to their authority ) . In contracts today , companies to a large extent use arbitration clauses in their agreements with each other . In case of conflict ( which could range from interpretation of the contract to breach of contract and everything in between ) either party takes the issue to the arbitrator . <p> Also , historically , the source of legal rules have not been governments , but custom . The threat of expulsion from the community , private punishment etc have compelled people to honour their word / contract and respect other community memebers ' persons and property . It is only relatively late in our history that governments have joined the game and introduced the myriad of rules and regulations that people really could not care less about ( i.e. they have no foundation in our sense of right and wrong ) . <p> As far as I can imagine , a " red market " ( open commerce in a place devoid of any organized guardianship ) would quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toughs who align themselves , even by threat of force , with certain groups of merchants and providers of commodities .

They exist in some parts of the EP solar system because it 's a post-apocalyptic game . H+ is still picking up the pieces of its near-destruction , so even ten years AF , a certain amount of warlordism is going to be a fact of life for a while . Extropia &amp; the more stable sectors of the Guanxi world could be read as places where the solidification you describe has already happened , although in the case of Extropia , stability comes more from a well-developed body of custom than overt enforcement . <p> R/e Jacobs , interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll give it a look .

I would think they would be available as both ego and morph traits ( or at least there should be some bio/cyberware to mimic ambidexterity ) . <p> I Concur with Urth . The ambidexterity trait can be taken multiple times , and applied to any manipulator limb ( such as tentacles , prehensile feet or tails , extra cyberlimbs ) as far as I know . It does n't apply to the just ability to use either one limb or the other , but also the ability to split your focus and use both manipulators at the same time equally well . As such , it 's not something you can engineer into a morph , because its some kind of conscious ability of the ego . <p> As for Direction Sense , it 's not a morph trait because it 's an implant . The morph end of that ability is taken care of in Bioware , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a positive ego trait on p145 , and I see it as the ego 's ability to correctly interpret data coming from the ear , so that up , north , etc. tend to be known to the ego . This , of course , assumes that the morph is in a magnetic field with some form of Gmicro-gravity , otherwise it is somewhat pointless . <p> As for Ambidextrous , the implication is that trait removes malus for off-hand activity , I doubt whether it allows you to perform different tasks unless you also have the multi-tasking trait/augment and have spare eyes so you can see what other limbs are doing . People who are naturally ambidextrous can use both hands to supplement the single task they are doing ; i.e. they can not paint a picture with one hand while a writing a story with the other . <p> " <p> Your definition of horror is meaningless to me .......

The ego version , on the other hand , is the way some people just know their way around . <p> Part of this is training , a lot of it is instinct .

@@29834949 @3534949/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Morat Station <p> So , I recently finished Iain M. Bank 's " Player of Games " , which prominently features an empire whose entire social structure revolves around the playing of a hyper-complex boardgame and butts heads with a Culture run by artificial mega-minds . Ca n't imagine why my mind immediately went to Eclipse Phase ... At first , I thought of adapting it to Bright station , as a way of them imposing more social structure and hierarchy though in the end I decided to make its own station . <p> Morat is a recently-constructed habitat , founded by a number of defectors from Bright referred to as the Players . The Players , like all members of Bright , were highly intelligent , specializing in mathematics and especially game theory . Their services earned them sizable rep and cred accounts , but they found their personal political ideologies did not quite fit in with the Bright ideal . In short , they disagreed with Bright 's ideas that one merely had to be intelligent and desired some form of more advanced screening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bright and sunk it all in the construction of their own personal habitat . Fans of their theories and papers soon followed to live in a more optimized society . <p> For its population , Morat is still rather large and has yet to be properly filled , but much of the open space is left open for the playing of games . From a central hub , multiple interconnecting strands branch off in unusual designs ; unlike most clusters which bud and spawn semi-organically and end up in an irregular pattern , Morat 's construction has clearly been planned from day one . Each ' spoke ' buds off three times - no more , no less - and the size and construction of the modular clusters reflect the three-tier social structure within the station , with differing quality of modules for the different residents . <p> Three could almost be seen as some kind of sacred number of Morat . Residents sleeve into morphs designed around three sexes instead of two ; male , female and apex . The apex ( plural : apices ) gender is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the higher class are apices . While it is permissible for one apex to have multiple husbands and wives , Morat tries to keep its population roughly equally gender-distributed - and thus always divisible by three . Their social structure is modeled around these three genders , which are practically synonymous with castes , with all important functions being carried out by apices . Typically , Morat males are grunt soldiers and unskilled labor , females carry out domestic duties and the apices carry out the roles of government and command . However , this social model is not totally rigid . <p> This is where Azad , or The Great Game , comes in . <p> Every three years , Morat engages in a station-wide tournament of Azad , a game created by the Players to be as complicated and reflective of life as possible . A proper formal game can take several days and moves through multiple stages , beginning with simple cards and moving on to massive boards containing pieces reflecting military actions or natural elements . Informal games are simpler , used to decide conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these games are almost entirely analogue rather than digital , to prevent hackers from interfering . Games are typically one-on-one or played in groups of five to ten , with an adjudicator observing . The adjudicator is mostly an apex , though the tournament will use a shackled and rigidly-monitored AI to impartially adjudicate . <p> The tournament goes on for several months and how well one performs determines one 's allocated social role for the next few years . The player who wins overall is declared head of the station - the current title is Emperor . Due to the gender-caste system , if one performs well or poorly during the tournament , one might be resleeved in order to move up or down the social ladder with new genitalia befitting your rank . Notably , personal motivations and beliefs are also part of the game and are submitted as part of your application to play ; this allows Morat to adapt and alter itself to reflect the dominant and ' superior ' memes , as well as making sure that only those who deserve power ( according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as much about warring ideologies as it is about actual war . <p> Morat is not popular with the Autonomist Alliance , due to is fascistic ideologies and what are seen as gross inhumanities perpetrated by its ruling apices against the lesser genders and even against each other during games of Azad . Betting is common during even informal games and often involve the transferring of goods from the loser to the victor , but males and females are considered property of their apex and so are valid as gambling tokens . One can also wager mutilations , such as the loser having to be chemically castrated . These offend the delicate sensibilities of many anarchists , but have somewhat endeared Morat to the nearby Ultimates , who often send novices to Morat in order to learn strategy by observing and playing games of Azad . <p> They have also become somewhat popular among circles of ... illicit hedonists , those whose tastes would offend both the corporate and the anarchistic alike . Morat makes quite a bit of money through connections with organized crime groups , who put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and non-consensual acts that would offend the Scum , whereas on Morat the victims have no rights anyway and were simply property . They also attract some interest from those afficionados of morph design and alternative social models , who are interested in the social dynamics and sexual processes of their trinary system . <p> On the other hand , Morat sees a statistically-unusual lack of violent crime , due to the implementation of the game . Outside of the torture-industry it practices , the streets are completely safe and event white collar crime rates are very low . This is perhaps due to the small size but extremely ordered nature of the society , as well as the regular filtering the civilization gets through the game . The Players like to boast that there are no outcasts , no disenfranchised , no outsiders , no unemployed in Morat culture - the Game gives a place for all of them . <p> The current Emperor of Morat is known only as Nicosar , one of the Bright Players and a game-theorist whose early writings were key in the designing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is known to be a firm , but fair ruler and maintains regular ties to the Ultimates for security purposes . He is expected to keep the position when the next Great Tournament begins in six months , but has put out a call to challengers from all polities to come and play the game . The other four Bright Players also occupy high office in this small culture , running the security forces , foreign relations and maintenance systems . <p> Potential plot hooks : -The Great Tournament has been declared and all the PC 's have been personally invited to play . -A Firewall Person of Interest in a recent bombing has fled the Inner System to Morat , where they are hiding in the personal retinue of one of the Players . -A dead apex is found on nearby Xiphos and one Ultimate is attempting to overthrow the Game . <p> Thanks for the feedback ! Yeah , I only recently started reading the Culture novels and Player of Games is definitely my favourite so far ; when it talked about the way players submit philosophical ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eclipse Phase 's Motivations and that was where this came from . <p> It was a bit of a challenge because my default idea for " small weird sub-culture " is anarchist space or a scum barge , but the Azad are so fascistic and imperialist that they 'd need something to keep the AA from flashmobbing them constantly , so the Ultimates were the natural connection there . Maybe that helped it fit in a bit .

I was just thrown by " Cyberbrains are not wireless-enabled for security reasons " , but the answer was there right in front of me : " This means that in order to hack a cyberbrain , the hacker either must have direct physical access to the morph 's body in order to jack in , or they must first hack into the mesh inserts and then break into the cyberbrain from there . " <p> Also p.237 : " ... the mesh inserts installed in synthmorphs and pods are directly integrated with their cyberbrains ( creating a potential security concern as cyberbrains are vulnerable to hacking ) .

I was first thinking that maybe they have built in passkeys wired into the morph , but then I realised that the morph is hard-linked to the mesh insert so there is only on/off with no " logout " option . This means that hacking into the mesh would have to be done with an intrusion test and defeating the firewall ( p.255 ) as there is no authentication to spoof . <p> This was also useful on p.253 ( Acitve monitoring ) " Characters may actively monitor their own PANs if they so choose , though this requires a moderate level of attention ...

An AI will have a skill of 40 ( which represents the professional level of skill ) , so if you 're content with that level of skill , AI is probably a cheaper solution .

Having 5 of me would be pretty handy , but having 5 people with my skill level , each of which sees the problem differently is much better . <p> Yeah ... I kinda feel that there a lot of fields out there where you NEED conflicting viewpoints to progress , where different people would come at it from different angles , whereas forks would be more likely to just come up with a small handful of solutions and run with that . <p> Firewall crows have analysed likely economic futures , and they are worried about copyrations .

The PCs are sent to try to undermine a copyration so that its fall will discourage anybody from following it . <p> As a further thought experiment ... if the most important reason to disapprove of such multi-fork groups is because of the risks of a potential future mental monoculture ... could a would-be forker attempt a counter-strategy that still gains nearly all of the short-to-mid-term benefits : avoiding merging the forks as much as possible ( up to and including not doing it at all ) , thus allowing the forks to diverge over time ? <p> Well , you can read up more on the fork law firm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person frequently merged and maintaining singular sense of identity .

It would be like cloning the same body and expecting it to develop variance in immunoresponse based on external factors . <p> For short term it would be resource intensive ( morphs , servers ) and probably not better than just paying people to do the job .

Either way , it was meant to prove that our low numbers was a fixable issue , and not something that people should worry about . It was a failure ( though most people do n't know that the Watts-Macleod virus may have been the reason it failed , and not anything particular with the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though ; there are plenty of infomorphs who want bodies as is , and we should n't be wasting our time making new egos when we already have some to spare . However , their physical needs can easily be handled with synthmorphs . What people are more worried about is the future , when we have already given every infomorph that wants one ( estimated at around 50-60 million ) a body , and we still need to expand the human race . Forking could work , but it also could stagnate our mental capacity , as people essentially become large clusters of the same mind , and individuality wanes . Instead , Cognite was looking to fill our ranks with new minds , speed grown in simulspace , fast enough to be an effective production system , but slow enough that they would n't be ready before their biomorphs were ( otherwise , we could have used time acceleration to grow them to full adulthood in less than a year ) . <p> Then the question becomes , what sort of phenotype does one want to produce at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . what will the personas be comfortable with . and where will the settle .

Terra is out of the question at this point ... <p> Again , the Futura Project was a testbed , not an actual attempt to repopulate humanity . They were trying to see if it was as feasible to quick-manufacture minds as it is to quick-manufacture egos .

Unlike in a setting like Shadowrun , severe body modification does nothing to hamper one 's psi ability , so long as the brain remains organic . To that end , enough psi sleights can make someone significantly more proficient than even the most powerful machine body . Asyncs can , without affecting other minds , grant themselves extra actions , bonuses to aptitudes , gain a +10 modifier to a number of skills ( essentially having the potential for 109 in certain skills ) , a number of other bonus modifiers , and many abilities which perfectly imitate , or even exceed , the potential of implants .

@@29834964 @3534964/ <h> High-skill Forks instead of infugees ? <p> The owners of the corp " Phobos Inc " want to maximize its profit , by maximizing the useful economic output of its workers , by maximizing the skill-levels of those workers for minimal training costs . So , for any given skill , why would n't Phobos Inc 's managers make arrangements to find the particular individuals who have the highest aptitude for that skill , then send one or more forks of them to live in high-speed simulspace studying that skill to the utmost degree ; and , whenever actual work needs to be done involving that skill , making a fresh fork of the most-skilled version of that individual to do that job ? ( Picking individuals who do n't mind being forked for individual jobs might also be a criteria here . ) <p> What would keep Phobos Inc from out-competing its rivals to the point where other corps subscribe to a similar strategy , leading to the corps putting pressure on the available governments to stop bothering wasting time and resources waking up low-skill infugees ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a result of being locked in a tiny box for a trillion subjective years . Soon as they let out of their box they gon na take over Mars and rule it with a simulspeed enhanced fist . <p> What makes you think Corps DO N'T do this ? Or at least , try it . I mean , you 're going to have to psychosurgery them into being willing to work for you forever . And be willing to delete all of the forks that go crazy or want to stop working for you . And prevent anybody with a moral fiber in their body from finding out what you do . Maybe find new egos every once and a while that are a little closer to what you want for a particular job . <p> Oh look , you 're describing Nine Lives . Spoiler alert ! Some arms of some corps have been known to work with Nine Lives . <p> The problems are , I think : Efficiency is nice , but people get REALLY upset about " soul traders . " Indenture is controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People genuinely want to get through the backlog of egos in dead storage , and indenture is a way to do it at a profit . Lots of people have friends or family that are or were in storage . And of course , relating to the above need for psychosurgery : people need hope of getting out of indenture to put up with the bullshit they experience while in it . <p> Creating alpha forks is illegal in the inner system , so if they comply with the law , they 're limited to beta forks , which have a skill cap of 60 . An AI will have a skill of 40 ( which represents the professional level of skill ) , so if you 're content with that level of skill , AI is probably a cheaper solution . If you need a bit more , it does seem like it would be convenient . <p> A real ego will start lower than 60 , but can eventually exceed it . That 's probably a nice feature . You 'll eventually have indentured experts . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . I suspect it 's common for some roles in the inner system as well , when the benefits outweigh the chance of the corporation getting caught . <p> As a side effect of illegal alpha forks , it 's the PC that ends up providing the " housing " for most of the infugees , though at the cost of indentured servitude . <p> There is also some benefit to diversity in your workforce . Having 5 of me would be pretty handy , but having 5 people with my skill level , each of which sees the problem differently is much better . <p> Yeah ... I kinda feel that there a lot of fields out there where you NEED conflicting viewpoints to progress , where different people would come at it from different angles , whereas forks would be more likely to just come up with a small handful of solutions and run with that . <p> Firewall crows have analysed likely economic futures , and they are worried about copyrations . They are competitive , relatively easy to set up , multiply human capital like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billions of forks of the most copied people , working for peanuts while being vulnerable to memes and neuroviruses , and growing rapidly towards a posthuman state with no room for individuality , consciousness or human values . They want to stop copyrations . One way would be to try to discredit them : strike at prominent copyrations like Pax Familia and X-ng Partners , demonstrating that this practice produce dangerous mental , economical and legal instabilities . The PCs are sent to try to undermine a copyration so that its fall will discourage anybody from following it . <p> As a further thought experiment ... if the most important reason to disapprove of such multi-fork groups is because of the risks of a potential future mental monoculture ... could a would-be forker attempt a counter-strategy that still gains nearly all of the short-to-mid-term benefits : avoiding merging the forks as much as possible ( up to and including not doing it at all ) , thus allowing the forks to diverge over time ? <p> Well , you can read up more on the fork law firm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person frequently merged and maintaining singular sense of identity . If you allowed the forks to diverge they would become basically their own person ( people/persons ) . And then you would have just normal corporation . Also I guess that minds are only somewhat more flexible than bodies in their immunity to external mindhacks . It would be like cloning the same body and expecting it to develop variance in immunoresponse based on external factors . <p> For short term it would be resource intensive ( morphs , servers ) and probably not better than just paying people to do the job . ( IMO ) <p> As a further thought experiment ... if the most important reason to disapprove of such multi-fork groups is because of the risks of a potential future mental monoculture ... could a would-be forker attempt a counter-strategy that still gains nearly all of the short-to-mid-term benefits : avoiding merging the forks as much as possible ( up to and including not doing it at all ) , thus allowing the forks to diverge over time ? <p> I do n't think this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but assuming you make the copies of them after they 've earned their valuable skills , they 've spent the majority of their life as the same person .

For the past decade , the vast majority of infomorph refugees who want bodies have found that indenturing themselves to the Planetary Consortium or one of the associated hypercorps involved in Martian terraforming is the most reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both are guaranteed at the end of the contract " <p> So basically , because the Planetary Consortium does n't allow alpha forks , they need more labor , so they build morphs , and put infugees into the morphs ( " housing " ) , which handles their need of labor . If alpha forks were legal there , more of those infugees would stay in cold storage . 
@@29834966 @3534966/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> General Psi Explanations <p> One of the things that benefits players and GMs alike is having a solid definition of how something works ; or , it benefits GMs , anyway . The players are on a need to know basis . One of the mysteries in EP is how psi works ; this mysterious phenomena , granted by infection with the Watts-McLeod strain of the Exsurgent virus , grants access to seemingly reality questioning powers ( or , in the case of Psi Epsilon , reality bending . ) As I was reading through the Rough Magicks supplement product for Trail of Cthulhu , I came across multiple explanations for what magic was in the realm of Lovecraft . Now , ToC makes no claim to be a " hard-science " game and fully embraces the cosmic horror aspect of just how small we are and how uncaring the world is , but some of the technojargon is really interesting ; and makes it seem quiet plausible in some cases . If anything at all , ToC is a sister game to EP , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 've selected two of the ones that I present below : <p> Theory 1collapse Magic is a hyper-scientific discipline of visualizing and manipulating trans-dimensional energy fields . Acoustic signals ( words of power ) and geometric matrices ( sigils and gestures ) act as control systems , which have transcended mere material technology . The energies bleed through universes through pinpoint wormholes , often dependent upon special patterns of stellar and cosmic radiation . /collapse <p> Theory 2collapse When the Elder Things dominated the globe , all their technology was fundamentally biological . The crinoids controlled not just the shoggoths , but their stone buildings , their metal tools , a nd their weapons and prisons and experimental power plants and everything with a vastly complex set of network and circuit protocols embedded int h very genes of their servants . The Elder Thing maintained the control codes and distributed switching relays for the system in specially design plankton fogs stored in the oceans . These relays transmitted signals and information using quantum dipole connections between certain molecules . When the shoggoths rebelled , the system crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentience , went berserk , and programmed themselves to nest and reproduce . Some of them evolved into mammals , and then into humans . Magic , on Earth , anyway , consists of " tapping into " the surviving shoggoth " circuit diagram " which is in almost all terrene matter , not least in DNA , crystals and igneous rocks , and metal . /collapse <p> Personally , Theory 2 is my favorite their of all time for magic . But what I aim to do is convert those three over into EP terms , as few ways to explain how Psi might work . <p> Psi in EP is complicated . It 's not just one uniform phenomena ; for instance , you could group various extrasensory powers together : mind reading , omni-awareness , forecasting the future , and things of that nature group under ESP . In EP , Psi Chi is mostly ESP-related sleights , while Psi Gamma has some Telekinetic related slights ( for instance , sleight that increases the AP of a weapon ) and some ESP related sleights . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cases ( which would require a theory as to how magic works to explain it ) . <p> Because of the dissimilarities , no one uniform " theory " will work . We need several , or several convergent theories , that I 'll draw from the above examples provided for us by Rough Magicks . Before I do , however , I assume three things : the ETI were at one time a biological race like transhumanity or the Factors , the ETI were responsible for the Pandora 's gates , and the ETI is a singular entity rather than a collective race of entities ( perhaps they merged together into one entity many billions of years ago ) . <p> collapse Theory 1 : Explains some Psi Chi and Gamma and most Psi Epsilon <p> Spoiler : Highlight to view <p> One of the possible theories for what happens with the Watts-McLeod virus is that it transforms the ego , rewiring it so that it produces a hyper-computer like effect on the brain . This one was explored in the Aether Jabber intro to the " Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written so that an unconscious part of the ego is the blueprints to transform the brain into a hyper-computer once it 's installed . Being a hyper-computer allows for hyper-computations , at the risk of invoking tautology - what this means is that we can make the leap that psi then becomes the hyper-computational ability to not only mentally visualize but to control on a basic level energies stored in dimensions beyond our own , 4d world ( that is , whatever energies are trapped inside of the Calabi-Yau Manifolds , or inside of structures higher than 6d in our universe , as predicted by both M-theory and various different String theorems ) . Through the use of control words ( or thoughts ) and geometric visualizations , this energy can be channeled and manipulated in our 4d world , or at least intersected with our 4d world in a way that could be used to create some of the more dramatic effects of psi . <p> Now , for Psi Chi and Gamma , it 's the unconscious mind that does most of heavy lifting here . The unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visualization to the manipulation , and the only thing the conscious mind knows is that by doing or thinking " x " , " y " happens . Because this completely unconscious , it forms a core part of the Ego ( the largest part ) , and thus , will copy over , always , with the brain-mapping . It also serves to explain why asyncs feel like something is wrong with them all the time ; their unconscious is a supercomputer that 's visualizing 9d shapes in their full glory not even 10 feet under the surface of the conscious mind . That 's enough to blow anyone 's mind , and that unease and unnaturalness that some asyncs feel after developing psi is this byproduct of having your conscious plugged into a hyper-computer at all times . <p> For Psi Epsilon , this is different . The effects of Psi-Epsilon are far more dramatic , which means that there 's more than just some unconscious effort going on here . Psi Epsilon also drains energy from the surrounding environment , meaning that they 're far more powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads or tails of these hyper-dimensional geometries , and the entire unconscious is probably taken up doing it . What this does is it literally undermines the unconscious part of the ego , and , for lack of a better , less legalistic term , drives the person insane . Perhaps even the conscious is involved in those hyper-dimensional computations , resulting in what is effectively a mind that 's blown out like a bald tire on a stock car . However , including the conscious and more of the unconscious means that more complicated hyper-dimensional computations can be achieved , which means that there 's more there that can be determined and controlled . In short , for Psi Chi and Psi Gamma users , only a small portion of the unconscious is devoted to their powers , or for users of both , a big larger . For Psi Epsilon users , however , the entire unconscious and parts of the conscious become part of the hyper-computer , and the result is spectacularly destructive to the ego . <p> This could also be backed up by the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ETI , or whoever designed the Exsurgent virus ) , are proficient in biological computational systems ; that 's what the gate is , after all . It could also explain why asyncs feel even less comfortable around gates than normal transhumans do - the hypercomputer in the brain is trying to connect to the gate network , and the gates - possibly sentient or even sapient - respond in kind . Because this is all happening in the unconscious brain , except for those rare moments when the gate seizes control over the brain , the async will feel even less comfortable than they do normally . <p> TL ; DR - the ego becomes a blueprint for a hyper-computer due to infection . This hyper-computer allows for hyper-dimensional computations , visualizing and devising means to control and manipulate energy stored in 6d+ manifolds scattered throughout the universe . For Psi Chi and Gamma users , only a small portion of the unconscious ego is used for the computations , but enough so that , for those who have n't had to deal with it their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For Psi Epsilon , the entire unconscious mind and part of the conscious mind is used . <p> /collapse <p> collapse Theory 2 : Explains most Psi Chi and Gamma <p> Spoiler : Highlight to view <p> This theory maintains that part of the ego is still written as a blueprint for transforming the biological brain into a hyper-computer . However , due to a quark in the fundamental biology of life , all creatures have the potential , and some can even achieve partial status on their own , but it 's only with the infection of the Exsurgent virus that one achieves their true potential . Because all biological brains are potential hyper-computers due to that quark in life , psi is basically your hypercomputer networking with the potential hypercomputer inside of the brain of a different person . <p> This explains why things like mind-reading and thought probe work ; by making that connection , you can read the database of their thoughts and find what you want , downloading that information yourself . This also explains why psi becomes more difficult to use on things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , each species is different , and the neurology involved is different , meaning that the potential hypercomputer in question is different - and psi is n't backwards compatible , forwards compatible , and does n't play well with different programs ( much like Microsoft . ) <p> This can also be why the gates have weird effects on people , not just asyncs . Individuals describe feeling nauseous when they see them , which could be more than just sight - it could be the fact that the gate is trying to establish a connection with their hypercomputer that they have n't fully developed yet . Of course , because it 's not fully elaborated , I ca n't entirely be sure ( do they always feel nauseous ? Is it a one time deal ? Is it only from so many feet ? etc ) . <p> TL ; DR - the ego is still a hypercomputer map , but all egos are potential hypercomputer maps , and all it takes is an infection to make it complete . This explains why Psi Chi and Gamma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit on pods ( only half the brain is biological ) and why they do n't work on aliens or synths ( different biology vs. no biology ) . It can also be used to explain why the gates make people feel uneasy and i 'll - after all , it 's the gate attempting to establish a connection with your non-existent or underdeveloped hypercomputer brain . <p> /collapse <p> The third theory is very unsettling . In fact , I developed this theory as a partial response to one of my players , who grew up with powerful , Vancian-styled magic and D&amp;D styled wizardry spells where you blow up whole buildings with a fireball and whined about how EP psionics are " weak , " and convinced me to include things like precognition as a Psi Gamma sleight . I used the general idea of the second magic theory from ToC , but tweaked it just every so much . What I came up with is the third theory of Psi : <p> collapse Theory 3 : Explains Psi Chi and Gamma , some Psi Epsilon <p> Spoiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built around the fact that the ego is turned into the blueprints for a hyper-computer once infected . However , rather than interacting with other hyper computers , what happens instead is that you gain a much deeper insight : <p> Some 13.5 billion years ago , the universe came into existence . When it did , the way that the particles determined what it was they were and what it was they do out of the energy soup of creation had far , far reaching consequences . How does a proton know it 's supposed to be a proton ? An electron it 's suppose to be an electron ? An upquark it 's an upquark and not a downquark ? <p> It 's simple , really . They do . <p> No , really . They do . This was determined the centuries after creation ; history wrote itself out in those first few million years . The particles were what they were because history required them to be . Everything from that scale on down was predetermined from the moment the universe started to settle in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the code for everything that they would do or be in the future . I suppose a short phrase would be something like " quantum predetermination . " <p> When you 're infected with the Exsurgent virus - the Watts-McLeod strain , which is the original strain of the Exsurgent virus , the one that all of the other strains were developed from by the TITANs , you gain certain psi abilities . Things like mind-reading , etc . However , mind-reading is n't mind reading as we 'd recognize it . Instead , what your hypercomputer brain is doing has nothing to do with the other person 's mind at all . What you 're doing with your hyper-computational abilities is reading the history of the universe . You do n't see into that person 's head at all . You see what the universe says is in that person 's head . <p> Basically , you 're reading history . Everything is predetermined . Everything you think , you do , you wish , want , or see , was predetermined by the universe in those moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going to play . When you use your brain to read minds , or see the future , or things like that , you 're interacting with the universe and you 're looking at the universe 's game plan in the long run . Mind-reading is just computing what the universe says that person will think , because it 's predetermined and there 's no escaping it . <p> TL ; DR - you 're still a hyper-computer , but powers that are supposed to interact with others do n't . Instead , you 're seeing the history of the universe , already written out , already predetermined , as it was when the particles at the beginning of history chose to be what they did . Everything that happens in the universe happens because it was determined in those million years or so after the big bang . You as a psi user are just privy to the strings pulling the puppets . <p> It also helps to explain why Psi-Epsilon users are so unstable . After all , if nothing mattered , and everything was predetermined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your death , what purpose is anything ? At the same time , however , you become incredibly powerful once you realize that . Unfortunately , you do n't get to decide what you 're going to do with that power , because the universe decided it for you a long , long time ago . /collapse <p> All three can be stacked for interesting results in any given campaign , because they work well together , and can be used to explain the different types of psi and the different phenomena associated with it . <p> " One of the things that benefits players and GMs alike is having a solid definition of how something works . " <p> No . Negatory . Nada . I ca n't emphasize enough how untrue that is , especially when it comes to mysteries . The absolute death of mystery is knowing how it works . A lack of knowledge , speculation , curiosity , these make things fun , hectic , and even spooky if done right . Given the fact that EP is a game constructed around Lovecraftian-style horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and GMs alike . When you 're allowed to make it up as you go , it keeps players on their toes . Today , you can apparently hurl lightning , but the next time you wake up , the power 's gone . Why ? What happened ? No-one knows , and trying to find out why is a part of the fun . <p> I 'm not saying that you ca n't try and think up your own explainations but mysteries last far longer and are far more intriguing than facts . This , more than anything , makes leaving things in the dark for as long as possible beneficial . Creating solid rules before they 're needed just limits you . <p> I du n no , Axel , I do n't think I would 've been nearly as good an oldschool D&amp;D GM if I had n't been able to explain the physics of how polymorph and greater wish spells worked . <p> On a more serious note , though , Axel has it right . VAST chunks of EP are meant to be unexplainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic ' , and whatever created the Watts-MacLeod strain and how it works definitely fall into that category . <p> I like having enough of an underlying theory to be able to tell whether something makes sense or not . The theory might be " public " in the sense that some people in the EPverse know it ( some of the know-how of the gates ) , " learnable " if players can figure it out with some experimentation ( for example , by playing around with a TITAN artifact ) or " secret " - this is to make sense to the GM at least , but players will likely never get close to it ( the ETI ) . <p> Here is my addition to the psi theories : <p> Psi is having cheat codes to the Matrix . Either *a* Matrix or *the* Matrix . <p> The small version is that either the Fall ended badly for transhumanity and it was completely wiped out ... or that things eventually went very well - posthuman supercivilizations stretching across galaxy hyperclusters doing unfathomable things . But in either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how things were or could have been . Simulations encompassing at least sentient agents , perhaps whole simulated solar systems of agents . These ancestor simulations are complete in nearly every way , but might serve various purposes - they are not all run on " true " physics , for practical or entertainment purposes . In some simulations there are cheat codes allowing you to do things that would n't be possible in the real world - psi . This might be by accident , because the entities running the simulation are investigating something that requires it , or just for fun ( " Let 's do the Fall again , but this time give a few people psychic powers ! " ) The exsurgent virus might actually be a sysop tool - perhaps the Fall was partially due to one of the sysops just messing around with a sim . <p> The big version is that the whole universe is indeed the Matrix . It is not just the exoplanets beyond the gates that are simulated , the solar system is virtual too . The universe is running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar simulation allows some forms of self-reference and hacking . The exsurgent virus is in many ways a real virus , moving between levels of software that are normally separated ( and quite possibly with its own dangerous agenda ) . Psi is just a bit of fudging with the simspace allowing new tricks . You better not do too much or the power users will show up - this is why the Factors are afraid . And secretly hunting down asyncs . <p> Reminds me of an AGI character I 've been running , my namesake here . She is an emergent collective with conspiracy theories about the universe being a simulation and an obsession with existing and developing towards infinity . <p> Which necessarily means becoming an omniscient posthuman intellect that can discern the particulars of the entire universe , so she can escape the simulation and join its creators in ' reality ' . <p> Uh , in case you have n't noticed , Eclipse Phase is n't Dungeons and Dragons . The two are radically different games . To the extent that I 'm willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editions , were basically gamism to the max . If you try to think about the underlying reality of the game world behind the mechanics , you quickly have to realize that there is no such thing - that the game mechanics simply are the reality , full stop . Eclipse Phase rests firmly on another pillar of the GNS triad ; namely , Simulationism . The world of Eclipse Phase is it 's own fantasy world ( I use the word in its most generic sense here ) , with its own ( mostly ) consistent logic backed up by the premise that it runs on ( again , mostly ) real physics . In DnD , it simply does n't make sense to ask how hot a fireball is , because ' temperature ' is n't a game object . A fireball does 1d6 fire damage per caster level . What is a caster level ? It 's what makes a fireball do more damage . What is damage ? It 's the thing that subtracts from hitpoints . <p> Now , this is being a bit unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree , succeed ) at making DnD make sense . Caster level is representative of skill and experience , so naturally someone with more skill can do more damage with a weapon . Damage is roughly indicative of heat content , hit points are a measure of toughness , skill and luck , etc . But that 's not what they , ontologically , are - those are just justifications for the game-constructs of caster level , fire damage , and hit points . <p> So while in DnD , it simply does n't make sense to ask what magic is ... psi is not supernatural . We do n't know how it works , but that does n't make it supernatural . More to the point , magic was n't a mystery in-game . It was not mysterious to the character . In Eclipse Phase , psi is mysterious to the characters . And if the players want to apply reasoning and evidence to it , and want to uncover the mystery ... you better have an answer for them . That does n't mean you have to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mystery , it at least ends it in a somewhat effective fashion . Nothing really ruins a mystery faster than realizing that the answer is " whatever the GM felt like at the time " ; ie , that there simply is no answer . And if you do n't have any idea how it works , that 's what the answer defaults to . <p> For the explanations in the OP ... yeah , not feeling it . It 's ... inelegant , I think .

By using this organ , the user can manipulate things in a seemingly supernatural way to our 3 + 1 perceptions . For instance , telepathy could be a literal touching of a brain by the user 's organ extending through 3 + 1 + " Brain-space " . While precognitive abilities may be explained by the organ touching a space where the intentions/goals of others are visible . There does n't have to be a finite number of dimensions , but most are likely to be uninteresting . <p> To explain the synth immunity to Psi in this theory , I laid the blame on the Watts-McLeod Strain being targeted at biological targets . Thus it is a temporary immunity , due to the " organs " simply not being designed to interact directly with synths . As soon as some TITAN notices this oversight , a complementary " organ " can be designed for/against synths . <p> Why should anyone care ? I do n't know , this was all done because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find my ideas interesting . Using this with players just really gives you the chance to set beyond the current Eclipse Phase setting , to say " what next ? " .

( I 'll make the model available as well , once I 've done something more than a grey crater . ) <p> Per Wikipedia , the US Navy currently has a railgun that can accelerate projectiles to above 3 km/s , a bit more than Lunar escape velocity at 2.4 km/s . And the current version is a little shorter than 200 m.https : **31;762;TOOLONG So with EP level tech , that acceleration is totally within the realm of possibility . Which is probably Trappedinwikipedia 's point . We 'll free you from there one day ! <p> It 's been a long time since I looked it up , but if I 'm remembering correctly experiments with off the shelf electronics potted in epoxy could survive up to 20,000Gs of uniform acceleration . The trick is how small all the ' delicate ' bits are . I think it was for the SHARP project ? <p> Looked up some more data , and sure enough , 1000 G 's seems to be doable according to some real-world scientists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ g 's is doable for what ? Solid inanimate objects ? I believe some of the rail guns being tested today exceed 60,000 G 's in acceleration when firing solid projectiles . I 'm guessing your 1000 g target is based off the object being fired being something where damage is more of a consideration . <p> Incidentally , while they may say that these guns are used to put packages in orbit cheaply they are not the only source of propulsion for those packages . It simply is n't possible to shoot something into orbit without a secondary method of propulsion because the elliptical orbit would trace back through the gun . <p> The full operation is probably something along these lines : Assuming the railgun is 200m in length the package is accelerated at about 650 G to a velocity of about 1.6 km/s . It is given a fairly flat trajectory that would not normally exceed an altitude of 50km and during the trip it fires a small metallic hydrogen rocket that accelerates it to a circular orbit of 50km . To do this the engine needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m/s . This requires a burn of about 13 seconds ( assuming that the metallic hydrogen produces 3 G of acceleration ) . Assuming metallic hydrogen has a specific impulse of 1600 2.5% of the launching mass would need to be reaction mass . You would have a bit more taken up with the nozzles , power supply , and stabilizing em field generator but you are probably looking at about 90-95% of the launch mass being cargo , which is really good . <p> Incidentally , you could also launch at even slower speeds . 250 G 's would give you a muzzle velocity of around 1 km/s but you would be required to now use 6% of your launch mass as remass . This is still better than using 12% of your launching mass which is what is required without the rail gun . <p> It makes it easier to intercept . Picking up cargo is pretty much the same as a docking maneuver and trying to match a highly elliptical orbit is always a pain in the behind . <p> Also , you 've got to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless you just trust people to always collect the cargo before it can complete a single orbit . Otherwise your minimum periapsis is the elevation of the railgun ( it can and probably will be lower but it can never be higher unless your launch velocity is high enough that you are on an escape trajectory ) . <p> If you are already doing that circularizing the orbit actually is n't all that hard . Just make sure the vehicle remains pointed in the direction of travel ( i.e. make sure the engine is pointed directly prograde ) and as you approach apoapsis fire the engines . You will gain a small amount of altitude for your apoapsis since you are n't completely parallel with the surface ( that only happens at apoapsis ) but most of your energy will go into raising your periapsis . Since your initial trajectory was a little shy of 50 km at apoapsis the small amount of increase will bump you up to right around 50 km . Cut off the engine when your apoapsis and periapsis match and you 're circular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( computers keep the ship facing prograde ) in Orbiter all the time and if I 'm being really obsessive I can get a perfectly circular orbit every time by using the RCS for final adjustments ( I mention that I have to be really obsessive to do this . It is n't that its hard , its just that generally you do n't worry as long as periapsis and apoapsis are within a dozen km of each other ) . <p> Or complicated electronics . Things not made of flesh deal with acceleration far better than most people expect . Sharp impacts have insanely high , uneven G forces . <p> Quote : <p> Incidentally , while they may say that these guns are used to put packages in orbit cheaply they are not the only source of propulsion for those packages . <p> They could just get picked up at the peak of their orbit .

If you 're bothering to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd want to bother having anything particularly complicated in the payload . <p> Right . I talked about that in a previous post . The problem with the idea of ' pick it up at apoapsis ' is ' what happens if you miss ? ' . If you 're not equipping the payloads with some form of secondary propulsion that is strong enough to put the payload into a permanent orbit ( i.e. one that can sufficiently reduce the eccentricity of the orbit ) then when someone misses a payload ( and sooner or later it will happen ) the payload will return to the surface with almost the same amount of energy it launched with ( since there 's no atmosphere to bleed off energy ) . <p> I was thinking more the other way around - intercepting a highly-eccentric is hard , but hitting something in a circular orbit with a parabola is much simpler , so the tug would enter into the appropriate orbit and the cargo would be launched at the appropriat epoint to intercept . <p> Missing is an issue , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I think we can assume one way or the other ) then a designated impact point can be selected and prepaired .

His mind , now brilliant with knowledge but confused by fake memories and exaggerated animosity came up with a plan to infiltrate the factions once again , this time not to explore their flaws , but to exploit them and cause a civil war in the Inner System , while the ' original ' Kadmon Aristo egocasts to an overhumanist stronghold somewhere in the Kuiper Belts and tries to gain enough political cred to persuade his peers into going to war against the spoiled vermin the Inner System inhabitants really are . <p> Some of the forks managed to work up the ladder of various terrorist organizations , organizing bombings and other acts of violence in order to destabilize the oh-so-precious social balance in the Planety Consortium and the LLA - the so-called Citizen Zero , a neo-gorilla leader of the neo-primate terrorist cell in New Shanghai is said to be one of them , fueling the mutual hatred between the large uplift community of Mars and their transhuman neighbours . Meanwhile , a bio/technoconservative organization plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aristo 's guide , while a certain hibernoid comet herder secrectly changed the trajectory of the iceteroid to derail Progress out of its orbit and crash it into the surface of Mars . <p> What Aristo does n't know is that one of his original forks , sent before he went mad , have n't returned , but its still alive . Originally sent to the Jovian Republic in a flat morph , without a cortical stack , he was considered dead by his creator , but the truth is different . During his stay in the Junta , the fork discovered a mysterious organization dubbed ' Firewall ' , and decided to discover what 's their cause ... and he liked what he saw . Now acting as a Firewall proxy , Kadmon Aristo sends a group of sentinels to chase his insane selves throughout the Inner System and stop the inevitable bloodshed . <p> What do you think about Aristo ? Any ideas where else this madmen could 've gone to fulfil his dark dream ? <p> I like the explanation of how he got crazy and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The big issue is why he is a threat : there are plenty of misanthropic overhumanists around who want to set the world on fire . Somehow the broad experience must have made him a proper threat . <p> One possibility is that he now has a very good big picture and can coordinate the different plots . Worsening transhuman-uplift relations is not in itself useful , but if Martian society gets into a militaristic phase if the beanstalk is destroyed ( or the plot averted and planted evidence leads towards certain hypercorps ... ) those tensions can blossom into bigger violence . A comet intercepting Progress is not a threat as long as the Batteries are up and running - but a fork might be planning to add a high bandwidth laser link to them pointing down into the Quarantine Zone , expecting something awful down there to take them over . And so on . <p> Another possibility is that over the years of Gatecrashing he has changed . He went somewhere and something did something to him ... he is now an agent for an external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . He does n't really notice this himself ( but the Firewall fork is starting to suspect ) . <p> Yes , the ability to see the bigger picture and coordinate the attacks in a way unsuspected by the authorities is supposed to be his biggest advantage , along with the access to various resources ; after all , a scandal involving uplift experimentation ( disclosed by his ' hypercorp ' fork ) can instantly motivate the organization led by his ' uplift ' self to act in retaliation . A series of seemingly unrelated scandals and attacks which the PCs can discover to be more complex than just simple coincidence and ' bad day at work ' . <p> I thought about making him encounter some kind of alien intelligence behind the Gates , but actually it might be more fun ( and terrifying ) to think that he actually managed to do it all by himself - through forking , merging and psychosurgery , he became a huge threat , which might be a signal that the transhumanity and the technology itself is actually the biggest potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , implanted with some bioconservative ideas actually turned against him . <p> I 'm going to throw some TITAN-related baddies at the players as well ( already thinking about an extreme/suicide sport Mesh celebrity selling illegal XP from the Quarantine Zone , which obviously went bad ) , I think that having both minor TITAN activity and an unrelated greater force ( Aristo ) will keep the players on their toes . <p> I thought about making him encounter some kind of alien intelligence behind the Gates , but actually it might be more fun ( and terrifying ) to think that he actually managed to do it all by himself - through forking , merging and psychosurgery , he became a huge threat , which might be a signal that the transhumanity and the technology itself is actually the biggest potential X-threat .

@@29834973 @3534973/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Shredders and " Dragon 's Breath " <p> In a recent session one of my players acquired a shredder , and upon my explaining to him that he could dose the rounds with any chemicals , drugs or poisons he wanted , he decided to coat the rounds in liquid thermite . Over the course of the session , we started to call these " Dragon 's Breath " rounds , because of the horrifying amounts of damage they were putting out . By my math , a full auto shredder at short range with liquid-thermite-coated rounds does a whopping 9d10+10 damage at -10 AP , plus 3d10+5 damage per Action Turn for the next three turns . As a result he was just straight-up melting his opposition , and it was n't until the party attracted the attention of a HOPLITE and the player took a couple railgun slugs to the torso for his trouble that they finally pulled back . My question is this : am I misinterpreting how this would work ? I could n't see any reason why he could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful than was intended . <p> " <p> " I wonder if in some weird Freudian way , Kojak was sucking on his own head . " - Steve Webster on Kojak 's lollipop <p> So it takes roughly 210g of thermite ( 110g Fe + 48g O + 52g Al ) to generate 850 kJ of energy . The same amount of damage ( 850 kJ ) can apparently be caused by a 3.5kg shell travelling at 700m/s , which can apparently penetrate steel armour of about 40cm ( 2 ) <p> Wow . <p> Assuming that shredder rounds can accept a coating of half the projectile cluster 's weight in liquid thermite , and that each shredder projectile cluster weighs about the same as these shotgun flechette rounds ( 14g ) , that would be 7g of thermite . <p> 7g of thermite would create about 28.3 kJ , or still about the muzzle energy of a heavy machinegun . <p> In EP1 terms , that would be a shredder shot plus a railgun sniper , let 's say , or ( 2d10 + 5 ( AP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , a total of 4d10 + 17 ! If we distribute the rifle damage ( which is a stand-in for the thermite damage ) over 2 rounds to make the math simpler , we get : <p> 2d10 + 5 , AP-10 ( initial shot ) ; then 2 Rounds @ 1d10 + 6 , AP -15 <p> In the extreme case , if we make the shredder rounds heavier and assume they 're nanofabbed to be made of thermite , the damage would be equivalent to a shredder shot and 4 times the sniper 's damage . Since firearms do n't really scale up like that in the EP system , let 's call that a Standard HEAP Missile instead , or 6d10 + 24 , AP -8 . If we keep the shredder 's higher AP ( the flechettes would be burning where the shredder put them , after all ) , the damage would look like : <p> Shredders ca n't be equipped with chemicals , only drugs and toxins . You ca n't make a liquid thermite shredder . <p> ... whoops ? <p> EDIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I could do a manageable version of this rather than just ripping it away entirely , since I do want to reward the player 's cleverness . I 'll have to cogitate on this for a bit . <p> " <p> " I wonder if in some weird Freudian way , Kojak was sucking on his own head . " - Steve Webster on Kojak 's lollipop <p> I like the idea of needles made from flammable compounds like thermite . They probably would n't penetrate armor as well as they 'd be pretty fragile , but they would be pretty nasty when they burn on the surface . I 'd probably treat an attack by them with reduced base damage ( 1d10+1 ? ) and little to no armor penetration , but have them apply a liquid thermite dose to the surface per attack . Makes them quite similar to a sprayer loaded with the stuff . <p> It is a fine idea . Shredders are basically shotguns , and 12ga dragons breath shells are a real thing . <p> But you 're talking about an incendiary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . I think it is going to lose most of its energy during flight , and the rest is going to dissipate outward away from the target instead of into it . <p> It is n't like white phosphorous , it might not even stick . <p> Even if it was something like WP , would that be effective against something that did n't have fleshy skin , or that could turn off its pain receptors ? I think there are rules for it , but it just strikes me as something better used for committing atrocities against biomorph populations , than useful against real AF10 paramilitary targets . <p> I think for dealing direct damage , you want something more like a HEAP shell , a discrete shaped charge . Or a penetrator . <p> the thing about thermite is it requires an ignition source , this is commonly achieved with a magnesium strip . Also there are other chemical variants of thermite , there is one that uses 3 iron atoms and then there is a copper based one . <p> I 'm wondering , what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Breath " ?

I am still learning the rules and I have come up with a few morph concepts that could use feedback . <p> +Tremor-Pod Morph A large worm that is used to hollow out underground areas and asteroids for habitats . Seismic sensors and a powerful stomach to digest all those minerals and earth would be invaluable . <p> +Scalder-Bio Morph A humanoid morph used in areas that deal with hot liquids that would boil a Flat alive . Works well in areas of steam bursts , saunas , and soup mishaps . <p> +Muckboy-Bio Morph A humanoid morph used in wetlands for various roles , from scouting to exploration of swamp exoplanets . <p> The Tremor Pod Morph seems a little ill-conceived when you have nanoswarms to do your mining and have large robotic mining machines . Scalders have potential but you 'd need to identify where it is that having a morph specifically built to survive heat is beneficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mercury tends to be either very cold to human norms or climate controlled . Only place I can think of a use for them is perhaps underground Mercury habitats . <p> Muckboys have potential . I 've an infatuation with amphibian-esque morphs , too , that makes me love the concept . <p> Off the top of my head , I see them having bonuses to REF and COO , along with features like Heavy Bioweave Armour or Carapace Armour ( reduces the nasty effects of animal bites and makes insect bites essentially a non-issue ) , Toxin Filters , Enhanced Respiration , and possibly Gills . Probably temperature tolerance too , because swamps tend to be quite warm or quite cool . <p> Long-term exploration or habitation of underground areas . A Surya for planets or asteroids with extensive caves or tunnels . The Tremor-Pod is optimised for moving through tight spaces , with or without gravity . It has a natural ability to dig through any obstacles , using a set of forward limbs with picks , shovels and hammers . It also produces a natural gel explosive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough to dig through , so it can blast it 's way through . It navigates with a sonar sense . It can even make noises loud enough to destabilise the surrounding rocks , to cause a cave-in . Useful when attacked . It can survive vacuum , though it ca n't normally move without purchase on something . <p> A set of fine manipulators can pop out ( like the graboids grabbers , but far better ) , so that the Morph can investigate anything interesting it comes across . Though it 's normally blind , some of these grabbers have eyes . An Ego would sleeve into one due to the inherent difficult in communicating through large amounts of material . Need to explore a labyrinth of unimaginably deep tunnels and bunkers on an exoplanet ? Need to repair some very deep mining equipment that is malfunctioning ? You can either send robots , who would not be equipped to deal with the unexpected , or you go in a cumbersome humanoid morph , which needs to do a lot of preparation work at every turn to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A striking gang of miners in Tremor-Pods would be formidable foes to any mercenary hypercorps sent in to break up the strike . <p> Tremor ( Exotic Pod ) The tremor is an exotic pod morph developed from non-sapient xenobiology native to the exoplanet Bluewood . Only recently discovered , they seem to fill an intrinsic link in the complex biosphere that makes Bluewood such an interesting locale for scientists . Loosely resembling Earth born earthworms , although magnitudes larger , these armoured behemoths drill through the hard packed soil of Bluewood and return lost nutrients and minerals back to the surface . Captured examples of these curious creatures have resulted in increased exploration of the largely unknown that makes up the Bluewood subsurface . <p> And a big thanks to Codebreaker for creating the Tremor Morph , which is amazing . I can see how it could be misused and the dangers of using it , but who has not wanted at one point to become a giant worm ? <p> I do n't really know much about the Titan subsurface , but I seem to remember an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Europa like subsurface ocean ? If that is the case , probably not . We wo n't know the conditions of Titan in EP until Rimward comes out , and I do n't think that that is slated until Q3 . <p> It could probably find a niche in most of the inner system though . EP 's general preference towards the biological means that it could be considered over mechanical options . Mercury miners might want a few , the Martians might find a use . 
@@29834976 @3534976/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Mind the WMD <p> But i have some questions about the adventure . Did some of you already try it out ? What are your experiences ? Is it advisable to use self-created characters instead of the pre-generated ones ? If you did that , how did you handle the transistion to Mars ? Presented the players the pre-generated morphs or your own set ? <p> I 've run the first half , but not yet on part two ( back to our BRP Classic Fantasy game at the moment ) . First part went okay , but my group are not that conversant on a lot of the tropes and so had some issues . One thing I 'd recommend changing ( or fixing ) is : <p> Spoiler : Highlight to view <p> Have a clear reason for Grey Xu to release the nanoswarm . The ' a stray shot ' hits the canister excuse does not go over well once you really think about it . <p> For part two , I also think there needs to be a better rationale for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inscrutable TITANS ' . <p> I have n't GMed it yet , but I 'm planning on making MTWMD a sequel of sort to Glory . <p> To that end , I 'm going to introduce Gray Xu as a contact NPC for the players . I want them to at least call upon her for a favor , either by locating Mason or Morteza , providing transport to some habitat they could n't reach by egocasting <p> The way I picture her is something like Arya T'Loak in Mass Effect 2 <p> so when they get about her ship , in Mind the WMD , they should get the false impression that they 're more or less safe <p> Also , I believe the reason why there is TITANs stuff in the destroyed habitat is maybe someone wanted them to be found , or left them there for his or her own schemes . That would explain the second group <p> I think the identity of the group will depend of what they did in Glory . <p> Beside , I want them to work hand and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mesh searching . They 'll get hints , not full answers intel like which habitat , and where , they 'll have to find the hardest way . with both the second group and the Consortium on their trail A bit of Screamers would be a nice touch , once they reach the Zone <p> Heh ... one of my gamers decided to do something akin to a Stalker once we came to the " Salvage Ops " Section of the alternative campaigns . <p> He is aboard the Ecstatic Metamorphosis to provide first hand intel to a customer about some pieces he found , so he rented a biomorph for the duration of the first adventure . <p> The other player created a Lost artist/ego assassin who more or less wants to prevent something like the Lost happening again . He 's with Firewall because they have some common goals in this regard . Since the player is still unclear on what he exactly does , i could n't provide a reason as to why he is aboard but the player explicitly stated that his character 's ego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resleeved in his life ( except when he got into the futura but he was n't capable of grasping that i ruled . thoughts ? ) and pretty much finds the idea scary . <p> Well , 12 hours ago , we were in the middle of the necessary legwork to find out more about that " masterpiece " ; ) <p> I await the feedback of one player , but the other one had much fun . Which i have to say : I had too . Especially describing the Ecstatic Metamorphose with its central cylinder and the frame i just called " skeleton " ( Gerippe , more or less ) . <p> They had some clues on whom to ask , first and foremost an earth-artifact expert , a Dock-worker and an antisocial Neo-Avian they had to chase through a maintenance shaft ( where one of the characters flunked his Freefall roll and burned his hand on a hot pipe ) . <p> We finished playing when they were about to talk to Gray Xu and my players seem eager to continue . <p> I 'm surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation is one of the more complex things in the game , I used the provided characters just to streamline the introduction to the setting ( they worked well ) . <p> Also , what 's not convincing about a stray shot ? If it 's a level of force thing you could upgrade " stray shot " to " stray grenade " or " stray seeker round " . Du n no , it seems unneeded , but maybe I 'm just easily convinced . <p> Reviving this thread because I 'll run Mind the WMD ( and Continuity ) at a local Con soon . <p> Did anyone come up with better ways ( less gm fiat preferably ) to let loose the nanoswarm at the end of part I ? As someone already mentioned the stray shot thing is n't that convincing . <p> The " Stray round " thing works perfectly well if you imagine that the TITANs were not worried about their own weaponized nanoswarms , and that they did deploy the canister as a munition meant to be launched a long distance by mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanoswarm . <p> I guess what bothers me about the canister being shot open is that as GM I like to have things happen with clear reasons/motivations in the background . <p> A random/GM fiat event like the stray shot forces me and my players to have that scene where there 's a huge three party firefight near the canister - not to mention that all parties involved are after the canister and would probably try their best to not damage it . As I do n't want to railroad my players into that particular scene , it might well be that they get rid of the third party first and then try to steal the canister or force Gray Xu to hand it over . On the other hand it 's also possible that they stir up the third party while investigating and thereby force them to make a quick move on Gray Xu . In that case the players would be chasing after them to get to the canister . <p> Nonetheless I can see the stray shot thing happening if someone were to botch their roll during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm thinking of an extremely nervous Gray Xu bunkered up in her ship ( because she suspects that someone is coming for the canister ) , who also does n't know exactly how dangerous the nanoswarm is and who therefore is at the brink of using it against anyone trying to take it from her by force . Or maybe that 's not even entirely her but the effect of some basilisk or so that comes with the canister and tries to drive transhumans to use it ( kind of a One Ring-vibe ) . What do you think about that ? Any other ideas or things to watch out for running Mind the WMD would be greatly appreciated . <p> Are we forgetting the odds of critical fail ? One thing i like about EP is that the equipment lends itself to a lot more .. nasty implications of critical fail . One of the easiest is that yes your weapon worked but the shot went wild and since you are now near the hab 's skin you have just caused a minor hull breach .

Besides the fact that you have a higher Moxie max in this game than Edge does in Shadowrun ( 10 in Eclipse Phase vs 8 for humans with the lucky trait in Shadowrun ) , Edge is a more reliable stat . This is because Moxie modifies your roll directly instead of adding to a pool of dice you have to play with . For this reason , you can know exactly what its effects will be in almost all uses of it , and in nearly all scenarios you can say with absolute guarantee whether spending the Moxie will change your failure to success , your success to critical success , or your critical failure to normal failure . The only use of Moxie which does not have this advantage of reliability is the pre-roll use , which allows you to ignore all modifiers to the roll . <p> Otherwise , I agree .

If someone gets into a duel like this , I assume its up to the GM to work out this sort of stuff . <p> As for your actual Ideas , they are interesting and work just fine from what I can see , so thanks for throwing those out . <p> @ORCACommander huh ? <p> " <p> During the fall , humanity received a grim reminder , We lived in fear of the T.I.T.A.N.S and were disgraced to live in these cages we called Habitats . <p> I know I would definitely spend a lot of time amongst these events , though with a preference for swords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single shot weapon though . Perhaps someone is so confident in their abilities ( augmented or otherwise ) that they believe they can pull of a kill with only one of two shots . In addition , mods could make handguns function much like bolt-action rifles in that they have more than one shot but the reloading action is quite speedy while still not being near-instantaneous as the modern weapons of EP 's world are . <p> I figure part of the reason it would be single shot is to keep the lethality down , more then confidence to Win in one shot . That being said , I could also see it as a ' balancing ' factor to keep blades relevant in the duel .. after all , if Its a pistol and only gets one shot , a miss or low damage hit is hardly going to drop your foe , and then your left with either a glorified club , or forced to use your own blade . Could keep things interesting anyway . ( I really like the idea of bolt action pistols though . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not many people found that passage as interesting as I did . Still , At least there was some talk , and some ideas hashed out . <p> ooh , another idea for ' Soft lead ammo ' ( assuming it does n't mean hard case ammo. ) would be to lower the AP of the bullets , since lead is n't really going to penetrate well without some case . which works , since the idea seems to be more about biomorphs dueling , as opposed to actual combat . ( not that dueling is n't as real , but Its certainly more controlled . Sometimes . ) <p> " <p> During the fall , humanity received a grim reminder , We lived in fear of the T.I.T.A.N.S and were disgraced to live in these cages we called Habitats . <p> One thing that 's about to make a comeback in the EP game I 'm running are retro styled chemical lasers . Terribly inefficient and primitive by the standards of post-Fall beam weapons , they use a nuclear battery to ignite and drive a consumable chemical cartridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects of steam and a visible pulse . All of that adds up to make them a great sporting weapon . <p> Maybe ritualized duels of honor could become more popularized with the ease of surviving them , even in a worst case scenario ?

@@29834987 @3534987/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Economics of immortality ? <p> Does anyone ever read or stumbled upon on papers concerning the effect of immortality on economics ? Obviously it would effect pensions , but what about other effects , how would it influence consumer market and borrowing . Would people with perspective of immortality bother to pursue risky or highly careers ? By immortality I understand of course a situation in which you can foresee to live forever barring death by physical means such for example being shot in the head . So basically something close to Eclipse Phase . Would economy turn a drastic turn due to such event ? It would be interesting to see if any scientist ever thought about the effects on investments , service market or pensions if any potential longevity treatments are discovered . <p> " <p> Raise your hands to the sky and break the chains . With transhumanism we can smash the matriarchy together . <p> My favorite SF novel on this subject is Sterling 's Holy Fire , set in a near-Utopian life extension nanny state . A hyper-aged elite is beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they 've set their sights on it . The economy is transitioning into post-scarcity . The one thing still scarce is healthcare , so most of the economy -- which has been tuned for stability -- revolves around small moves in the healthcare system . The conflict in the core plot has to do with a woman -- part of the gerontocrat elite herself -- upsetting that stability . <p> It 's also an interesting book if you want to understand the Titanian economy in EP better . <p> Generally there has not been much good research on this - the topic tends to scare off academics for some reason . <p> Most analysis of the economics of longevity is about far less radical life extension , LONG ... In the small , there is " longevity risk " as the paper expresses it : if people live longer than expected , then pension systems will be in trouble . This is usually where most economists stop , since they fear making too dramatic claims . <p> In the large , economists think that more long-lived people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work more , while less human capital is wasted into the grave at an early age . Estimates suggest that the longevity gains over the past century can be measured in trillions per year : http : **28;795;TOOLONG <p> So immortality would mean a huge boost to the economy : lots more wealth produced since there would be super-experienced people around . <p> If you expect to live long you tend to have a lower discount rate : you can afford to invest and wait , so you will want to save rather than spend your money here and now ( this is one of the things in Holy Fire , and earlier in Simak 's " All Flesh is Grass " ) . Might make a somewhat risk aversive society , but there is going to be a lot of capital around . The long perspective might also make people greener in outlook : http : //ftp.iza.org/dp4564.pdf <p> Of course , the adoption of life extension will depend on cost . This all depends on what form it takes ( gadgets , drugs = becomes cheap , services = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at this , http : **27;825;TOOLONG but it is a fairly crude model . It predicts that if life extension is really expensive forever it leads to an unequal society of mortals and immortals , while if it is affordable enough society eventually becomes totally immortal . Duh . But no doubt it can be tweaked into more interesting and realistic scenarios with some work . <p> Sweden has low a birthrate due also to other factors , such as cost of living , education , low infant mortality , and economic opportunities for women . We 've seen in several countries that the best predictor of birth rate is women 's education . Immortality will naturally suppress birth rate to some degree , as it raises the cost of living and raising children , but the rate of feedback for that is rather long , so you may still get a baby boom before it stabilizes . <p> Another issue is that older people are more likely to be politically involved , and more likely to vote conservatively . However , it would be difficult to posit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person has been alive , or because of physiological changes that come with age . Holy Fire clearly supports the latter .

Since you can take out a loan with a term of 100 years instead of 30 , people would be able to reach even further beyond their means , though I imagine there would be some sort of limiting factor here . 30 years is plenty of time for some sort of tragedy to happen to make you be unable to pay your debts . 100 years would seem to increase that chance ( dependent , of course , on other available technologies ) . <p> What affect would being able to reach for large sums through borrowing have on the economy ? <p> What affect would there be on credit , I wonder ?

It is the opposite to the financial crunch right now : startups can try things , finance companies can borrow to invest , people get long-term mortgages , and so on . Back to the good old 1990s ! <p> However , banks would be foolish to lend a lot just because people will be around decades ahead - they still will not get their money back if people or companies go bankrupt . The real horizon is based on uncertainty : will society be around , will the laws be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I think the real effect of longevity will indeed be that there will be money for long term lending , since there will be long-term people around . But the interest rates will be low . <p> The other issue with credit is that $1 in 30 years is worth a tiny fraction of $1 now . This loss of value increases exponentially . Eventually the result is either no loans beyond a particular time horizon ( because your $2,000 payment in the year 2090 is effectively worthless ) , or the interest completely overwhelming the payments on principal , effectively creating an interest-only loan . <p> Another interesting thought : if one can work at one 's prime for 100 years , then getting together a retirement fund seems trivial . If I could work for 100 more years then I could easily pay off all my debts and put together enough low risk investments that I could live ( modestly ) without having to work indefinitely . That seems problematic in the long term . If hardly anyone is working except the extremely young ( under 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for a capitalist society to work when 90+% of people make an income through their investments rather than their labor ? Also what does this do to inflation ? If the majority of most people 's income is discretionary rather than necessary for survival ( and further , most people do n't need to do much saving ) then there 's a lot more spending , meaning the young have an increasingly difficult time getting to retirement horizon . ( reminds me a tad of Vampire the Masquerade . It sucks to be young ) <p> Of course this picture changes a bit when you add Family into the mix . A 500 year old should be quite capable of supporting his **25;854;TOOLONG ( and everyone in between ) . Especially when you consider how much of a slowdown in fertility rates we 're likely to see . This compounds itself when you consider how trivial it should be for an Elder to essentially be the bank for his much younger descendants . This means interest is paid back to the Elder ( and kept in the family ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an issue , and almost the reverse of the first one about interest rates . <p> If everyone qualifies , the bank raises interest rates to meet demand . If everyone can work ( or has been working ) for 100 years , the value of fixed goods like land and houses explodes . ( And just imagine the cost of college ! The ROI of a college education over 100-200 years is incredible . ) The end result is everyone *has* to work for 100 years to afford basic things . <p> The people best off are those just at the cusp . They buy when people are living ' til 80 , and then continue to work and save indefinitely . <p> Houses have half-life time . Bad things happen - fires , tornadoes , technologies become obsolete/illegal , earthquakes , floods , riots/wars . It is not like you buy a nice house , pay a loan after 50 years and live happily ever after . It is more like having to buy a new house each 70-150 years - or even just spend same amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with effective immortality , you may as well observe reverse trend - increase in lease/rental , because you expect to outlive the house . Given wars , government changes , society changes etc , you may as well find your beatiful mansion repossesed by ' the masses ' in 80 years when communism makes it 's big comeback . Better to rent it ( which is like 100-years loan , just without principal ) with possibility to get rid of it at the whim , if you need to move or environment changes . <p> Obviously prices would reach equilibrium at the level where rental+food+basic recreation is consuming all your income , so you can be tied into infinite slavery . And rich would become even more rich . <p> To a degree , you 're right . But even in a modern metropolitan area , the amount I pay to buy the house is far less than the cost of maintenance or even building it new . And things like land DO have a near-infinite lifespan . Ultimately , that 's most of what I 'm buying with a house .

There are other MMORPG out there like EVE-online . <p> What I found out about Entropia is that it is very inconclusive in many ways . The technology level is what is to be expected from a Sci-fi setting ; Spaceships , plasmaguns , nanotechnology , etc . BUT , and this is a big but , there is no effect on the social or economic systems what so ever . New players are treated almost like indentures and re-instantiated Fall refugees and the veterans are like Hyperelite . <p> The economic system is comparable with that on Extropia , but there is no escape from it . One ca n't just say " Screw this , I am going to Titan ! " <p> It striked my mind that it would be so nice if there was a MMORPG like the world of Eclipse Phase . Or better ; if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want to be a recycling janitor at the Titan Autonomous University 's basement ? : ) <p> What would be the obstacles to achieve something like this except for the money ( which could be founded by a Kickstarter project ) ? What are the opinions of the writers ? <p> Stay constructive ; I know there always are some who wants to tell how much they hate MMORPG . <p> I do n't hate MMO 's , I played WoW for 5 years , but I would much rather see a well written TV-series based on Eclipse Phase than a game . While I am sure it would be possible , the MMO market is a full of not-very-successfull stories and unless you funnel a TON of money into it , it will never be good . <p> I do n't like MMOs , but I 'm not going to get into details and derail things . I 'm going to assume that you said single player computer game . I like single player computer games . <p> I believe that there would be 2 big details @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phase computer game . <p> First is the license for the game . You might be able to negotiate for a license or something . Keep in mind that the devs current attitudes is to make it possible for all players to download the game for free and distribute it however they please . You can buy a digital copy or download a free copy from one of their blogs ( I forget where ) and then make them available to millions through bit torrent . You should expect them to put unusual requirements on any license you get . Maybe they would expect you to make the game itself free to download or something , with the option to buy if they like it . <p> The second issue is ... well ... developing the game . This game is actually quite different from what you would expect in other games . An average person from Eclipse Phase would have mind interface machines like Basic Mesh Inserts . This gives them mind machine interface , which allows them to control machines with thought , it effectively makes electronic the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . They even have AI assistants called Muses which handle a lot of personal business . That is just one detail alone . Another detail is the habitats , like big rotating habitats or microgravity habitats . Overall , this game would be a really difficult setting to portray . Games with real space physics are rare for a reason . <p> I 've tried to come up with ideas with an Eclipse Phase computer game . I think that it would be best to limit the area to a single habitat instead of having the Firewall agent(s) being beamed around where ever the trouble seems to be . Creating a game engine that can produce an actual rotating habitat might be a lot of work by itself ( enough for a single game ) . Including stuff to create a beehive habitat or other habitats might be too much to do with the first game . <p> Yes , the license is one thing . I do n't really want to speculate in that and leave that to the developers to answer . It would be sad though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a halt since Eclipse Phase is such a fantastic world portray and that I think would be much appreciated of many . Entropia Universe IS free to play . It is volunteer to deposit real world money in to the game and that is how the sustain and maintain the game . Many players work in the game to gather money . I would just love to play an indentured Fall evacuee who works his as* of to get a one-way-ticket to the outer rim . : ) <p> Eclipse Phase would , in my opinion , not be " one of many " . It would be something new and fresh and have potential to grow the whole time . New worlds could be introduced easily as they become " discovered " by the gatecrashers . <p> Without knowing anything about coding and game-development I ca n't see that making the game a reality would be a problem . Entropia Universe has many of the features that are in Eclipse Phase : <p> * Revival : Entropia has revival-stations but there is no in-game explanation why one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phase setting it would be perfectly logic to be revived in an resleeving facility after a confirmed death . If one has the Rep och Cred one can get a new body . " Sorry , your Rep- and Cred-account is too low to get a physical body . The only option is to become an Infomorph . " <p> * Augmented Reality : Easy . Most games use this already by showing health-bars , ammo , etc . New equipment could add more info on the HUD . <p> * XP , Virtual worlds : Why not make virtual worlds in the Virtual Eclipse Phase ? Would be a new thing when it comes to MMORPG . One just switch to a recording of a another player and do playback . <p> * Muse : And advanced game AI that one can instruct things to do by scripts . It could tell one when interesting things is happening or give advice about what to do . Even give skill-bonus in-game . <p> * Physics : Ca n't it be done with the settings in the game-engine ? Most games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( CryEngine : http : //mycryengine.com/ ) an it makes a very good job . <p> Maybe I am just naive in my lack of skills in coding , but that does n't restrict my imagination on the other hand . : ) <p> The problem as I see it is not the game itself , it can be done . The problem is to get a players to act according to a set of ideas in a faction and stay loyal to those ideals and not change in a moment just because it seemed most profitable . " Of course I am an Anarchist ! Now give that free Plasma-cannon . " <p> PvP ( Player vs Player ) could cause some great problems because of a players lack of maturity . <p> A Sandbox MMO is one that gives you an environment , some tools , a few toys and expects the players to , generally make their own fun . Any events tend to be player driven , and usually involve player vs. player interaction . That does n't necessarily mean actual PvP combat , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandbox MMO would be EvE Online . <p> A Themepark MMO is one that has set pieces ( the equivalent of rides in a theme park ) that the developers expect players to go through . Outside of those set pieces there is generally very little to do , with most external experiences basically being a method for improving how you will perform while within those set pieces . The most obvious example of a Themepark MMO would be World of Warcraft , which encapsulates this ideal to the highest level . <p> In an attempt to restart the above thread , I 'd like to ask the Eclipse Phase forum members how they would feel about the possibility of a community developed and donation based MMORPG ? Obviously this would be a huge project , requiring a volunteer-based team and some form of initial funding ( via Kickstarter , etc ) , but I 'd like to hear if there 's any interest ... Maybe a few of us could form a focus group and start chipping away at making this a reality one day ? <p> " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a supernova remnant in the southern constellation Vela . Its source supernova exploded approximately 11,000-12,300 years ago . <p> It would n't work sadly . To develop ( and keep running ) an MMO would cost more money than the EP community ( or even the transhuman community ) would/could bring up . Then again , Kickstarter is kinda a test of " would people invest in that " , but you just have so much ongoing cost with MMOs , that you just ca n't kickstart it and keep it alive with subscription based-models . And free 2 play has to be very well designed to keep it viable too . I feel its a bit out of scope and too niche . <p> While an MMO , for the aforementioned reasons , would be super hard to do , what about something like Minecraft or even Starbound , which provides for a big sandbox and is totally user-controlled . I 'm not big into the Minecraft scene but I know there are tons of mods , custom servers , etc . Has anyone experimented with a space-sim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a hab , deal with radiation , resource collection , etc . Have one group build an anarchist collective on the far side of Saturn , another a Barsoomian group scrabbling out an existence on Mars , a third a social club on a Venusian aerostat . Sure , there 's not the persistent background world , but the right set of tools could give you the chance to make a character and " egocast " to other servers , maybe . <p> While it 's not multiplayer , I do n't think it would be all that hard to put together a mod for Shadowrun Returns with an EP feel to it . Restoring from backup can definitely be done ... resleeving would be the tricky part . <p> You know what format would be excellent to utilize for an Eclipse Phase game ? <p> Roguelike . <p> Granted , the interface would be text-majority , but I 've atleast played with the concept of a Roguelike EP game where you start off as an ex-indenture in a Case Morph and work your way up to a Reaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EP universe ( Elysium , Earth , ect , ect ... ) <p> You 'd start off from the point of view of your standard-issue space marine on a shuttle about to do a hostile boarding action on a space habitat which has been overtaken by dangerous , radical lunatics , who practice all kinds of illegal , dangerous and soul-destroying body modifications . Your team are some of the finest soldiers remaining after the fall of Earth , the last defenders of the last bastion of true humanity . Your job : Lead a squad of veteran space marines with the most honed skills and the finest augmentations modern science can safely install in the human body in storming the habitat , fighting your way to the heart of it with a nuclear device , and getting out alive before it blows . Kill the freaks . <p> This proceeds as normal , introduces the player to microgravity combat , familiarizes them with the interface , etcetera , while the player gets to shoot things which are freakishly described and horrific sounding . Then they get to the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuke , when the player character is seized by a tentacled disk that strikes from the shadows , hauled before two red-glowing eyes , then summarily executed by a shot from a chassis-mounted rifle . <p> The viewpoint then switches . The player takes control of the reaper . Their mission briefing is replaced with an entirely different one : X Years ago , which was Y yeas after the Fall of Earth , the oppressed , indentured workers on this habitat , yourself among them , rose up and exiled the corporate owners of the station . You declared your autonomy , declared the habitat an Anarcho-Collectivist safe-haven , and since then you 've lived peacefully , floating freely in the orbit of wherever you 're orbiting , contributing to the research and development of technology which keeps transhumanity alive and thriving . You 've been many things , a man , a woman , a hermaphrodite , a sexless synthetic ; an artist , a habitat technician , an author ; and now , a defender of your people . Your people have embraced the transhuman technologies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were chosen to sleeve into one of the very few high-profile combat morphs your habitat constructed , the deadly and powerful Reaper , a smart-material synthetic shell with a plethora of sensors , even more movement modes , with four tentacles , and four weapons built into the shell .

You must defend your home . Disarm the bomb , then kill their morphs ! If you 're lucky , they have cortical stacks you can extract so you can send them home again . <p> I think the hierarchy is not well off . People take the jobs they want not necessarily what they are skilled to do or have the authority too has getting all access is not that hard . <p> The three most powerful positions on the station are , in order , the Head of Personnel , the Head of Security , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I liked HoP and Quartermaster the most . <p> In my experience , though granted this was quite some time ago , before I got myself banned from /tg/station , an alliance between the HoP and QM was practically impossible to overcome if they had the time to get anything rolling . Get the miners and medical staff going with them , and overthrow is basically an at-will proposition , and if the engineering and Glorious Atmosia throw their lot in as well , the only reason the Captain and Security will still be around is because the Magnanimous Alliance permits it to be so . 
@@29834991 @3534991/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Continuity <p> I am a new poster looking to run an EP game and introduce it to my gaming group , all of them ignorant of what they are getting into . <p> I have chosen to run " Continuity " as a starter , because there is a minimum of required knowledge ( no Firewall , interplanetary politics , gatecrashing etc. ) and because there are the cool audio files that come with it . I have downloaded some tips that another GM wrote to help with the game and have printed out the pregens from EP and Sunward to use . <p> However , I have hit a couple of snags and would like the input from this community on them before I start . <p> Firstly , the robots : In the scenario the maniac AI on the initial station has set the bots to attack the players . It lists the types of bots and gives a page reference on where to find them in the main rule book . Looking them up I found that the bots listed there seem incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing on combat capabilities or Attributes . So I looked around and finally found stats for a bot AI earlier in that chapter . <p> Okay , cool . Using those I worked up a set of stats . Still no combat abilities . So I just slapped an unarmed combat skill chip in them for a skill of 40 , presuming that the Maniac AI would have done this when it programmed them to kill . I also gave them basic unarmed damage . Although the bots have multiple arms , I wont be using them as the -20 to the skill check is a bit too much of a bite from their skill to be a threat . <p> Was this correct ? Is it overpowered ? Am I missing something on bots and combat ? It seemed like a bit of a convoluted way of doing it for some simple rogue bots . <p> The Second snag : In several points in the mission the players are required to ( or it is at least suggested that they ) hack doors , cornucopia machines , airlocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate for the mission include Exploit Software , a requirement for hacking . The only two pregens that do are the Swarmer morph hacker or the InfoLife , neither of these are great for players just starting out . I intend to include some exploit software hidden on the station , probably the rec room , but this seems like a bit of an oversight in terms of mission design . <p> Am I dealing with these issues correctly ? Has anyone else run this and found other problems ? <p> This was actually the first scenario I ran for my group as well ( can listen to it here if you like ) , and honestly I just kind of winged a lot of things for my players ' benefit ( they 're not the , ah ... brightest bunch ) . I did n't bother worrying about the Exploit program and just let them roll InfoSec to interact with systems . As for the bots , well ... that did n't really become a factor as they group ended up firing their guns at each other more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bots listed there seem incomplete . Only movement capabilities , armour and gear is mentioned , nothing on combat capabilities or Attributes . So I looked around and finally found stats for a bot AI earlier in that chapter . <p> This confused me as a new GM , too . <p> If you look at the rules for ' bots on pg . 195 of Eclipse Phase , you 'll find that " robots " are basically just synthmorphs being controlled by AIs . This means that the skills and aptitudes of a ' bot are determined by the AI controlling it . Then if you flip over to pg . 331 you 'll find the stats for a generic Bot/Vehicle AI : <p> Alternatively , for Continuity you could decide that Hans has downloaded delta forks of himself into the robots and then forgotten the instructions he gave to " himself " . ( Played right , this could make things even creepier . ) In that case , grab the stats for Hans and combine them with the stats for the ' bot you 're using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using those I worked up a set of stats . Still no combat abilities . <p> I do n't think this is a mistake . The robots do n't really need to pose a threat -- just be an unpleasant bit of creepiness . In fact , let the players get comfortable with these lightweight opponents . When the real bad guys show up , it 'll provide a nice contrast . <p> But it also works the way you 've modified it , too . <p> melanikus wrote : <p> In several points in the mission the players are required to ( or it is at least suggested that they ) hack doors , cornucopia machines , airlocks etc . However none of the pregen characters suggested as appropriate for the mission include Exploit Software , a requirement for hacking . <p> This appears to be a problem with most/all of the pregenerated adventures I 've seen for Eclipse Phase .

I had pretty much figured out all of the robot stuff myself , but you are right that they should be just a little spooky addition to the main attraction . I like the idea of using Hans ' stats as the AI , but I think I am going to keep the default ( all 10s ) one to keep the threat low . The only ones I may beef up a bit are the Dwarf Drones on the docking ship . These are inactive unless the Infomorph hidden on the ship activates them to defend it . I think that these should be a little more of a threat . They break apart asteroids and comets after all , and having one of these come crashing through a wall to get at you should be a shock . Plus the players have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quote : <p> I think I may end up just dropping the idea of " required " software altogether and instead have software that grants a +10 bonus ( or more ) to associated checks .

Then it still becomes a required piece of kit for hacking , but hacking is not impossible without it . <p> Cornucopia machines do not need to be hacked to make basic stuff , you just need to use the Programming skill to make the blueprints you want . Interacting with most devices on the Kepler only require Engineering ( Industrial , Electronics ) or Interfacing . There are only two instances when the characters need Infosec is to hack a fabber or crack the encryption on Hans ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed , and you do n't even have the time to make anything worth while . The weapons presented are enough to deal with the threats , though the pistols may need more ammunition . <p> Hey , I 'm glad you enjoy Continuity . I run this a lot at conventions . In my experience , for most PCs the robots are a sufficient threat without actually making the robots combat-capable . The PCs are naked , unarmed , and oftentimes getting sucked out of the airlock . In the last game I ran , the robot mostly just wandered around cutting ropes and cables and opening doors . That resulted in one PC getting spaced , and another nearly following ( this all in the first hour of the game - hopefully PCs survive until at least hour three ! ) <p> The other issue is that the dwarfs have such high durability and armor that many groups find they just do n't have any way to effectively destroy them . Normally I have to tone the robots down because of that . <p> If your group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an actual combat threat ( rather than an environmental threat ) is probably a good tweak . <p> Quote : <p> In several points in the mission the players are required to ( or it is at least suggested that they ) hack doors , cornucopia machines , airlocks etc . <p> As undocking mentioned , most of these do n't require exploit software . This is the PCs ' equipment , after all ! They already know its functionality and passwords , so they just need the appropriate skills to make the test . For other tests ( such as on the Istari ) , I generally let the PCs make hacking attempts with a penalty for not having exploit software ( and a bonus for the Istari 's software being so out of date ) . Ultimately though , the goal with a lot of that is to waylay the PCs long enough for them to get infected ; not to require they have a particular piece of equipment . <p> Well , I have run the game and I think that it went pretty well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a little looking up of rules and equipment as the game went on , however the small group of 3 players really enjoyed it , and got the hang of the basics pretty quickly . One of the players had read some of the Sci-Fi books that form the basis of the game , so he already got the concepts of resleeving and cortical stacks . <p> The players ( the Titanian Explorer , Jovian Spy and Anarchist Techie ) did not end up leaving the station , and most of the game was spent trying to get the Kepler under control . By the time the Istari turned up they had pretty much accepted that they were screwed . They took quite a while to realise that the cold and low pressure was due to one of the airlocks venting atmosphere , and they insisted on getting equipped before doing anything . One of them ( the techie ) had his Muse infected and when he accessed a fabber in the med bay his Muse started production of the Nanoplague . They encountered two of the 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the end I only used one rotbot ( the one welding the airlock open ) which was pretty combat ineffective and only made them roll infosec when they tried to break the programming of the docbot , Hans ' core memory server and when they tried overriding medical fabber to make it manufacture weapons . <p> We all had a great time and I have been asked when we are going to play it again . I do n't know when yet , but will probably run them through " Glory " next followed by " Think before asking " . <p> Sounds like a great game ! Glad you guys enjoyed it , and thanks for posting the recap . Yeah , that mission is pretty deadly . A friend and I run it a lot for conventions and between the two of us , the kill-rate is generally about 85% . My favorite was the guy who got one of the spiders in his suit , then got locked in the airlock for the next hour of gametime ( with that spider crawling around somewhere with him ) .

They work just like rez points , but ca n't be traded for rep gains . <p> I do n't like the loss of rez points mechanic on a party wipe ; it was the right call story wise for them to blow themselves up ; it even was an awesome dramatic moment when they realized there was no realistic way out . rez points are an important reward giving sense of progress and growth .

I do think your rules are fine but wanted to add my thoughts of these two . <p> Rez points on death , I think it is important for their sacrifice to have weight .

I keep in mind , an 8 rez reward is less than .4% character growth for a new character ( They tend to be worth a over 2075 CP base off my calculations ) . I do n't think it will be much of an issue unless it becomes the default way the PCs deal with scenarios . <p> It really depends on how you and your players want to treat death .

Unspent CP just hang around waiting to be called upon if they need it . <p> I chose this method because it will allow players to treat the body as a shell easier . I see morphs and gear as tools mainly , and should be treated as transient . I feel locking players to certain choices seems limiting and makes them play less adaptively . <p> You can still play off the limited resources , by limiting choices in morph and gear or how well the ' CP ' transferred . <p> " We do n't have much resource wise in this area , so you will have limited access . Your full funding should be accessible to you on your next farcasting however . Good hunting .

Am I the only person who sees a problem with how they 're presented ? <p> No , you are not . Right now they are a big " Its up to the GM " in most regards and i think that 's the problem . Is one Flexbot just one part of a bigger machine or is the flexbot morph actually a makro swarmanoid like pictured in Sunward ? What 's the potential ? and why would you take one ? <p> The way I have always run them is that they are autonomous , large dog ( Labrador ) sized synthmorphs that are perfectly capable of being used individually but that really come into their own when combined . Something I think would have been beneficial for them is that , for each additional Flexbot added to the whole they get a bonus to some of their aptitudes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains its own Ego they automatically gain the Multiple Personality implant . Each additional Flexbot adds to that collective .

So a Flexbot collective that is the combination of 4 Flexbots has the Multiple Personality implant , with the rules applying to all of the Egos residing in the morphs that make it up , +15 to SOM , +10 to REF and +5 to COO . <p> Each Flexbots Durability is handled separately , however any wounds inflicted are suffered by all others .

When it 's near a networked item , be it a bot , a vehicle , a maker , whatever , it can slave it , and it becomes a part of the whole even when elements are not in direct contact with each other , they could move together . <p> I thought CB 's was the closest to the spirit of the idea since they talk about multiple bots coming together . Essentially think of Voltron or a Zord and that 's what I believe they were going for . The idea of a type of morph slaving random things and controlling them to make a body is cool but I think that would need a completely different design and a pretty good Infosec skill . I also imagined them being able to come together in different forms . Some designed for combat while others were designed for manual labor or having a faster ground speed . Flexbots should be the Lego of morphs . <p> I would actually make the Gestalt Morph Trait a facet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modular design have a list of combinable morph types . <p> As for the variants , I would also include a command variant but I would base it off the the swarmoid morph and all I would have it do is increase the Aptitude maximums to 40 and allow the big morph to split down to it 's components temporarily without massive ego shuffling . Because under RAW the bonuses from a gestalted flexbot still need to fall under the 30 maximum aptitude level . ( unlike a gear bonus which caps at 40 ) <p> When I have gotten it to the point where I am happy with it I will probably submit it to the fanzine , yes . Good idea on a command variant , but what do you mean about temporarily splitting the morphs down without ego shuffling ?

Thoughts ? <p> Modular Design ( Enhancement Modification ) <p> This morph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different architectural patterns to create larger gestalt forms . When united with other modules , the group is treated as a single morph , with shared capabilities . Morphs with this enhancement can combine with any other morph of the same type as it , as well as any variants of that morph , that are also equipped with the enhancement . <p> When two or more morphs join together using this enhancement and there is only a single ego involved the process is simply a matter of working out the resulting gestalt morphs vital statistics using the method described below . When two or more morphs join together and there are multiple egos involved the resulting gestalt morph also gains the Multiple Personality implant at no cost , and control of the gestalt morph is determined using the rules provided for this implant on page 301 Core . The GM should keep track of which morph each ego resided in before the gestalt was formed as when it is unassembled each ego is automatically returned to that morph . <p> When multiple morphs combine together the resulting gestalt uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestalt is considered to be equipped with any implant or enhancement any of its component morphs are equipped with , as well as being capable of using any mobility systems its component morphs are capable of . When there is a difference in the speed of a mobility system in the component morphs always use the fastest . <p> Durability is calculated by adding together the durability of each of the component morphs , while the gestalts wound threshold is equal to the highest wound threshold of its component morphs . Death rating is recalculated according to the gestalts new durability rating . If the gestalt is damaged and disassembles without repairing itself all damage is shared equally through the component morphs . This sharing of damage can never outright destroy a morph , it is always left with a durability at least 1 below its death rating . Wounds are applied to each component morph in full . <p> A gestalts morphs advantages are determined by a new statistic line that only appears in morphs with this enhancement . This new line is labeled gestalt advantages in the morphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of its type , these gestalt advantages are applied to the resultant gestalt morph , while the components normal advantages are dropped . Any aptitude bonuses provided using gestalt advantages may not exceed +15 for each aptitude , and they remain limited by the highest aptitude maximum provided by one of the gestalts component morphs . Other benefits such as armor or skill bonuses do not stack , and the highest rated bonus is always the only one applied . <p> EDIT : Sneaky Addition ! Redone Flexbots with new variants . Gon na stick them in a spoiler tag because its fairly long . No point making the post really long . <p> EDIT2 : Sorry about the constant updates , but I do n't want to simply add a new post everytime I think of something .

I was going to do Firefly , but I saw the guy who 'd already done it better , so I thought ... why not Futurama ? <p> My initial idea was that the team was a Firewall Cell , the Professor was their Proxy and the " Pandora Express " was just a cover for them . Then I thought it was n't really a good fit and instead threw away the Firewall connections . Do n't get me wrong , they are Gatecrashers , and that is not a job for the faint of heart . These guys have a lot more on the ball than their counterparts onscreen . But Firewall is a meat grinder , and what I was writing was moving the characters so far away from their original conceptions that it was only connected in a " see what I did there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Their primary vehicle is a GEV , " The Pandora Express " , but it is modified with what is essentially a tow hitch for when they have to haul larger amounts of cargo through gates . Of course , due to nanofabricators and such , they rarely need to haul large cargo . More often , they carry plans or data back and forth through the gates . Additionally , they often ferry unique artifacts back and forth . <p> Professor Herbert Falkenstein ( PhD , Mars University ) is a Professor of SCIENCE at Mars University . He spent a long time in the public sector at Omnicorp , but a bad experience led him to abandon his career and return to academia . He was one of the initial consultants when the first Pandora gate was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many fields . However , his cantankerous personality ( including his refusal to resleeve into a new body until this one finally breaks down ) have diminished his reputation somewhat . He formed Pandora Express as a way to supplement his income and further his experiments . <p> Notes : The Professor has a rival on the faculty of the University of Mars ( Professor Vernon Wormwood ) , and was once in a relationship with Dr. Margaret O'Malley , his former boss at Omnicorp and eventual chairman of the board of the Pathfinder corporation . He is sleeved in a basic synthmorph with only a few basic modifications . <p> Role : The Professor is n't a PC . He 's the quest giver NPC . As such , I have n't bothered to give him stats . <p> Side Note : Certainly Gunter the uplifted monkey and his clone/child are viable side characters . Cubert was slow-grown so probably does n't have the problems the Lost do . He 's a jerk , but he 's not psychotic . <p> Backstory : Pre-Fall , Paul lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had dreams of being a daring space explorer , but lacked the aptitudes for it . Working as a courier , he delivered a package to a Skinthetic facility working on a next generation Hibernoid morph . Due to a mixup , the Skinthetics assumed he was a volunteer for the beta testing . He was backed up , transplanted into the hibernoid , where the morph was placed in stasis , and sent to a satellite where he 'd be revived in a decade . During that time , the Fall happened . A few months ago , a salvage vessel heard the " come get me " automated signal and investigated . They picked him up and attempted to sell him into indenture . He escaped and eventually found his way to Mars , where his last living relative , Professor Falkenstein , lives . <p> Falkenstein originally figured to give Cook a harmless desk job at Pandora Express , but on reviewing the bioscans and hearing Cook 's story of how he got to Mars , realized there was more to Cook than he appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows signs of being exposed to the Watts-Macleod Exsurgent virus . However , the only possible time it could have happened was while he was in hibernation , which is a mystery that the Professor wants to solve . Cook does not know of this , and simply thinks that he 's lucky . <p> Role on the Team : Paul is something of a generalist , assisted by his uncanny luck . <p> Personality : Paul 's a pretty easygoing , happy-go-lucky kind of guy . He 's surprisingly adaptable , considering he went from a pre-Fall existence to a dangerous post-Fall career exploring strange new worlds . Of course , that 's what he wanted to do all along . <p> R10T was created by the Go-Nin group for construction work on Luna . However , he quickly discovered it was easier for him to get others to do his job for him instead of working . He supplemented his meager income with petty crimes and grift . However , he ran afoul of the Robot Mafia and rather than let their psychosurgeons reprogram him into a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reload from his " birth backup " . <p> By happenstance he ran into Cook who needed help . For reasons Riot ca n't explain to himself , he helped Cook escape the Moon and get to Mars . The two became best buds . The Professor offered Riot a job at Pandora Express so long as Riot agreed to some loyalty modifications , so he ca n't betray them . Riot disagreed , but the Professor secretly modded him anyway . <p> Role on the Team : Riot is the team 's face man ( if the goal is to trick or mislead someone ) , thief and backup muscle . <p> Personality : Riot is self centered , greedy and egotistical ( and some would say those are his good points ) . But he is a good friend to Cook ( usually ) and while he does n't like working , he 's usually an asset to the team . <p> Lila Tortuga Design Notes : Lila was a difficult character to adapt . Certainly , one of the most defining things about her is the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having an eyepatch or having to get a morph that 's defective , but body repairs and morph surgery are so darn cheap that it did n't seem to make much sense in the Eclipse Phase ' verse . Additionally , I thought about her being an Earth escapee , with her parents still on Earth . In the end , I thought her upbringing in the Orphanarium was more important than her mutant origin , so she 's just another poor Martian Orphan who has managed to make a really good life for herself that gets upset once she meets Cook and Riot , but then settles back down working for Pandora Express . <p> History : Lila was raised in an orphanarium on Mars . Work was hard to find , but she found a job as a freelance Ego Hunter . The corporation that had purchased Cook 's indenture put a bounty on him and she needed the money . However , after capturing him and his new robot pall " Riot " , that she was kind of fond of the dork and took the Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lila is a consummate professional , she has a few soft spots .

She 's the pilot of the Pandora Express and the best at dishing out violence . <p> Personality : Lila is the boss of things and thankfully nobody else wants to be boss so there 's no real conflict there . She 's very professional and takes a lot of pride in being the best at whatever it is she does . She 's passionate about animals and the environment . <p> Eclipsearama - Amy Wu , of the Mars Wus Design Notes : Amelia is another character who was hard to poke into .

And since the team would probably run into more scientific issues on the other side of Gates , it 'd make sense for them to have her come along more often . <p> Amelia Wu grew up with a dimondium spoon in her mouth . Her parents put the hyper in hyper-elite , and own large chunks of Martian real estate . Amelia was n't interested in the family business ( though the money is nice ) and is desperately trying to stave off her parents ' desire for her to settle down and have children . Amelia loves science and wants to be a great scientist like Professor Falkenstein . <p> Role : Amelia is the team 's scientific expert and alternate face . If the goal is to have someone on their side when everything 's over , she talks to them instead of Riot . She 's also really REALLY rich , which is a nice thing to be . <p> Design Notes : Adapting Mercury was tricky .

I also wanted to make him a field operative , but still remain a stay-at-home kind of guy . I suspect Mercury mostly lives in the Pandora Express servers , and the field version is an alpha fork installed in the swarmoid . <p> History : Mercury was created by the Solaris Group as a smart accounting program . After spending a few cycles at one of the major banks in New Shanghai , he was leased to Professor Falkenstein . Falkenstein recognized his skills were not limited to simple accounting and purchased a Swarmoid morph so he could assist the field team as their technical advisor . In addition to being an accountant and occasional field crew , Mercury is married to another AGI , LBBR-A , and they have created a joint fork , Dwight . <p> Role : Mercury is the team 's technical expert . He 's a very skilled hacker . <p> Design Notes : Hurray for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad sack / incompetent guy into someone that you 'd actually want to have along while Gatecrashing . But , as Mom once said , he 's one of the best xenobiologists in the galaxy , it 's just that he 's not as good with human biology . So while that 's reflected in his stats , this version is actually a good doctor for people too . I was thinking of making him another AGI , this one in a arachnoid morph , but it 's just so right to make him an uplifted octopus , even if his source material has him as more of a crab with face tentacles . <p> Background : Dr. Hindenberg was created by Somatek to be a doctor for his fellow uplifts . But he wanted to travel and as soon as he could , went to work for Pathfinder as a staff physician on Mars . He met Professor Falkenstein , who was the first human to treat him as a friend . He has remained a close companion to the Professor and happily followed along to Pandora Express . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine , though he will admit that he is weakest when it comes to human biology .

Such is the nature of interviews . As I was trying to explain , some of the original ideas for Eclipse Phase started back when I was working as the line developer for Shadowrun , which is actually part of the same universe as Earthdawn . Both games were originally published by FASA Corporation . According to their shared cosmology , magic flows in and out of the world , and each magic-rich or magic-poor cycle is counted as a different age . Earthdawn represented the Fourth World , at the peak of its magic cycle , while Shadowrun represents the beginning of the Sixth World , when magic is just returning . <p> In Earthdawn , when the level of magic reached a certain point , it allowed creatures known as Horrors to enter the world from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scourge . In Shadowrun , magic wo n't reach that level for centuries to come , but when it does , presumably the same thing would happen . Naturally , this leads to thoughts of a sci-fi setting during that time , when extra-dimensional monsters pop in to eat people -- who fight back with magic and high-tech . <p> The idea had some appeal , because it could potentially include characters from Shadowrun ( or even from Earthdawn ! ) who were still living and allow for some fun interconnections . For various reasons -- the major one being that we did n't want to mess around with an IP property that we did n't own -- Brian and I took a different route that underwent various permutations over the years and eventually became Eclipse Phase . There are no links to those original ideas in the game anymore , other than sci-fi + horror -- it 's just an anecdote about how the ball got rolling with us . <p> Quite naturally , RedBrick came up with a similar idea around the same time , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their upcoming game Equinox.Earthdawn and Shadowrun are no longer owned by the same company , though , as they were split apart when FASA essentially closed down . Earthdawn is still owned by ( what remains of ) FASA , who license it to RedBrick . Shadowrun is owned by WizKids , however , who license it to Catalyst Game Labs . <p> RedBrick is working with FASA in their presentation of Equinox as the far future of the Earthdawn universe , known as the Eighth World . Even though Shadowrun is part of that same universe , however , RedBrick will presumably play it safe and not make any references to entities or events from that part of its history , so as to avoid any legal entanglements with WizKids ( and this is what I referred to in my interview comments ) . <p> Anyway , I just wanted to clarify that situation , messy as it is . Equinox looks like it will be a fun game , and I 'm looking forward to seeing what RedBrick does with it . And I really ca n't wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CthulhuTech hybrid game : )

Granted , the 1 hour refresh is very short , but since you could apparently just " burn " 0 rep if you need more trivial favors within an hour , even this refresh time seems kind of pointless . Also granted , I expect that PCs will rarely waste time going after trivial favors , but this still struck me as strange . Am I missing something ? <p> No , you are not , but I do n't think it is a bug eaither . Probably the rep cost would be lower than 0 , and only come into effect when you do that several times one after the other . Something like having a 0,25 , but in the end , up to the GM to note when they are abusing it too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asking your buddy if you can have a can of beer from his fridge ; getting someone to bring you a seat ; generally things that people do n't pay much mind to . You probably ask for trivial favors several times in a given day . These are intended to be things that you can ask about as often as you like . <p> That said , the GM is always recommended to use common sense when dealing with player actions . For instance , while borrowing 50 credits is a trivial favor , borrowing 50 credits from five different people now becomes 250 credits borrowed : a minor favor . Asking for four 15 minute services is essentially asking for an hour 's worth of labor , and it works the same way .

In games such as d&amp;d , there are clear guidelines for the GM to know the difficulty level of an encounter and therefore select enemies appropriate to the players ' current power , and I 'm wondering if anyone has been able to come up with a similar tool for EP . I understand EP is not a combat-oriented game in the same manner as d&amp;d , and embrace that . However , the group of people I rpg with enjoys a healthy mix of tactical combat and storytelling , which I think EP can provide . <p> It is not fun if a combat turns out to be too difficult or too easy for the players . Obviously a GM can use various tactics ( such as fudging die rolls ) to tweak the difficulty level , but there is some point at which the inequality between players and enemies is unfixable without ruining the encounter with obvious deus ex machina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to judge the difficulty level of combat encounters ? I guess this is essentially a two part question . First , how to easily gauge the combat prowess of a party ( since this will change based on current morph/equipment selection , but I do n't want to have to go through any tedious work such as reviewing exactly what equipment/mods each character has ) . Second , how to gauge the combat prowess of mobs ( optimally , this would use the same method as in #1 , but non-morphs such as xenoflaura might require a separate form of analysis ) . I have a few thoughts on the topic , but was curious if anyone else had done any work on this or there was a relevant resource out there which I have n't yet heard of . Thanks in advance for any assistance ! <p> I 'm a rank n00b when it comes to designing games in this setting ... but i 'm about a month into my current EP campaign and I can tell you what I 've figured out what worked for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty ... I do n't even consider player balance . half my group has morphs with emergency farcasters and the rest backup their egos on a regular schedule . so if they then run into say ... 50 combat bots and a battalion of exsurgents armed with antimatter baseball bats , they just reboot from last backup and rethink their approach to completing their mission . <p> Now that 's not to say that they have n't had some combat encounters . far from it - they 've beat the snot out of a rogue hacker and his modified pets . they took him down with a sniper shot and coordinated hacking/psi attack . The key was play smarter , not harder . if the big bad guy has tons of combat gear they start looking for alternative means to do their work . if the target is weak , then they go in for a beat down . <p> I guess what i 'm trying to say is that when designing an encounter/adventure I do n't worry so much about balancing combat encounters . I design them according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand AND what level of trouble he 's expecting . Given that there are so many options for characters to salvage their ego and resleeve into so many new morphs , I do n't feel that I have to ' pull my punches ' at all . <p> that was the hardest part for me to adjust too as a GM . I did n't want to accidentally kill off a PC without giving them some sort of grand , epic and meaningful death ... but that 's in pathfinder . In Eclipse Phase , I can kill off the entire party and they just restore from backup and review their XP logs to see where they fucked up and/or cover their tracks . <p> Weaver - thanks so much for your input . I am excited to attempt the challenge of designing multiple ways to accomplish a mission beyond combat , since that 's pretty much been the only solution to things in the other rpgs I 've played . But , I do want to give my players a few situations where combat is a viable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some gatecrashing exploration scenarios , where death has more serious consequences than a resleeve can fix ( as the players may never be able to retrace their steps to the same location , or the enemy will have moved somewhere else ) . <p> How did you determine the skills and equipment appropriate for the rogue hacker and his pets in that combat encounter you mentioned ? <p> Class/Level game GM 's usually have this question at first because , ( I 'm speaking from experience here ) , they 're used to having arguments over whether a certain class is over/under powered at a certain level . Ignore that tendency . <p> Obviously there are no " levels " . Which is a good thing , because Levels of Class A have never been equivalent to levels of Class B in any rendition of any game anytime . You just end up eyballing it anyhow but now you do n't have to deal with what the publisher tells you should work , ( but wo n't ) . <p> ( Some basic GM advice : before deciding who has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success or failure for each side . It 's rare that you can write a realistic scenario where total annihilation of the opponent is the goal . ) <p> 4 things you need to look at first : ( in order of importance ) Actions , Durability , Perception , Range , <p> The side with more offensive actions is more powerful . Count the number of combatants that are armed and then count their SPEED stats . A team of 3 shooters each with a speed of 3 has up to 9 offensive Action Phases in a single Action Turn . <p> Durability can balance Actions . That team of 3 ( Speed 3 ) shooters are going to be out classed by a squad of 9 ( Speed 1 ) cops . Even though each side has the same number of actions and can potentially develop the same volume of fire it 's harder to kill 9 than 3 . Even if the cops are n't as tough maybe only having half the total durability they can still take 3x the number of Wound Effects . Force multipliers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The side with the best intelligence ( Perception ) will probably win . One character with Tera-hertz enhanced vision or the team with the best hacker riding overwatch or commanding surveillance drones will probably win any cat-and-mouse maneuvers before the conflict starts . This means coordination and potential ambush . Damage VS Armor in this game dictates that shooting conflicts rarely last more than 2 turns . ( this is also the area in which PCs are usually weak unless they 're on their home turf . ) <p> Never bring a knife to a gunfight and do n't get caught in the open . Range is n't always a factor in Eclipse Phase because it 's hard to find areas in this setting that ca n't be covered by a light pistol ( 60 meters Extreme range ) .

Having longer range via bigger weapons or greater mobility is an important bonus . <p> Those are the 4 main things to benchmark .

This is the EXACT opposite of what I intend when I post . <p> otp - thanks so much for the feedback , that was exactly the sort of thing I was looking for . I do very much love the idea of no " levels " in an rpg and instead having players improve steadily and slowly over time . The d100 system is perfect for this and one of the things that attracted me to EP ( along with its amazing campaign setting ) . <p> Speed and Dur are easy enough to quickly eyeball . As far as who can get better intel on enemy locations , that seems key but tough to quickly measure , without looking at the details of equipment , etc ... Range definitely seems to be a consideration , but also tougher to gauge quickly . I guess for both , I 'll just need to learn some key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Noob question - is there any way to increase the number of physical complex actions in a turn ? I know there are a couple of ways to get extra mental or mesh complex actions , but wanted to double check there was nothing allowing a character to shoot twice , for example ( other than by increasing speed ) . <p> As far as high damage ending combat after a couple of turns , that is one thing I noticed with the game and was concerned about . There are some relatively cheap credit-wise ways to pack a gigantic punch , ending combat very quickly . That certainly makes combat much more about positioning and preparation , which I think should be very interesting to try out . <p> There is no gear , trait or Psi , that grant additional complex actions in an Action Phase . <p> As for shooting twice ; any weapon that has a Semi-Auto or Burst-Fire capability can be fired twice in a complex action . ( IIRC there is a -10 mod for choosing a second target . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Perception modifiers ? ( essentially this should be everyone because players are warned specifically to give their characters perception skills and Perception boosting gear is really cheep , it comes standard in most helmets . ) What you really need to look for is anyone who does n't have the gear , and anyone who is actively using surveilance such as drones and mesh overwatch . <p> Range is even easier to judge . Bigger guns have better range . In Kinetic weapons its a factor of 5 or 10 . Add to that the fact of the concealability rules in the first two pages of the gear section and you 'll end up with a party that usually only has small weapons like kinetic pistols and shard pistols at hand . <p> ( If they 've even managed to get those in play without causing a major incident .

That might even be favorable if I wanted to get a flexbot that is human sized ( with enough durability from modules , the minimum size increases ) . One solution would be to make 8 modules , 7 for aptitude bonuses and 1 for aptitude maximum .

One of my other ideas was to use a few modules as possible ( without trying to cheat ) . I ended up making 4 similar modules , all with aptitude max of 40 and 2 +15 to any aptitude .

However , the total cost for doing a super morph that way ( including waste ) would be 230 CP . <p> ---- <p> Anyways , there were a few observation I made when toying with this idea . <p> 1 .

Upon double checking and triple checking the rules , I found that things that give bonuses to aptitudes ( like augments and drugs ) can ignore normal limits . These limits include aptitude maximums and aptitude bonuses . The only limit to this is no aptitude may be pushed beyond 40 . <p> 3 . Its really expensive to give all modules the same hardware if you need all modules to have that same hardware to have its intended effect .

They 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the designer ... <p> I am almost dead certain there are " double stacked " toruses though . Unless mentions I remember " two rings " was actually a design like your picture . <p> I think a majority of habs around earth are roughly .9 g . I see no reason why the would n't , though you might find an oddball with lunar gravity . Around Mars I think there are some more in-line with the Martian gravity , but honestly even if basic biomods prevent serious negative health effects of prolong micrograv , I have to imagine most non-bouncer morphs are more optimal in the Earth-like gravity . If nothing else .9/1 g is a nice round number in the middle of gravity tolerances . <p> As far as gravity goes , a lot of things are more efficient in lower gravity , so a lot of habs will opt to use significantly less than earth gravity . I think half earth gravity is pretty popular overall . <p> " <p> ' No language is justly studied merely as an aid to other purposes .

Sorta like 2001 : A Space Odyssey , but obviously spun properly for gravity . <p> Also , is Earth standard gravity specifically undesirable for habitats ? Or do people just not really use earth gravity as a standard anymore ? <p> " Same rate " is slightly unclear . You are most likely referring to revolutions per minute but it is possible you are referring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the inner ring will have less gravity than the outer ring . If you are speaking of linear velocity then the inner ring will have more gravity than the outer ring . <p> Think of it this way ; if you drive in a 50 ' circle in 60 seconds you will feel much lower g-force than if you drive a 5000 ' circle in 60 seconds . On the other hand if you drive a 5000 ' circle at 100 mph you will experience much lower g-force than if drive a 50 ' circle at 100 mph . This is why you slow down when you need to make sharp turns . <p> As for a good reason not to have multiple rings of the same size ; if you take the material for both rings and you use it to make a single ring it will naturally be larger than the twin rings while still taking roughly the same amount of energy to spin up as the two rings . This is advantageous because on a spinning habitat you have an issue with what are known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the torus has a radius of 20m then the top of a person 's head will experience only 90% of the gravity affecting their feet ( since the distance from their head to the center is only 18m ) . On the other hand if the radius is 200m then the top of the person 's head will experience 99% of the gravity affecting their feet . <p> On the other hand once a ring is built it is built and you ca n't really expand it . To grow a ringed habitat you might extend the central hub and then build a second parallel ring ( I would then build tubes connecting the two rings at multiple points so you do n't have to go through the hub but most multiple ring designs I 've seen do n't do that ) . <p> It would also be possible to build inner and outer rings and use them for activities that do n't require standard gravity . As an example you could use inner rings for power production since that does n't tend to require gravity . Materials storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier to move the materials . <p> Outer rings might be used for food production . The outer ring would have more space and the plants could be genetically modified to deal with the heavier gravity although constantly transitioning from normal gravity to higher gravity would not necessarily be pleasant for the workers . This might mean heavy bot use or stronger sociological separation as you have a ' farmer caste ' who prefers to spend most of their time in the outer ring while most people prefer to spend most of their time in the central ring ( the gravity difference probably wo n't be high enough that people on the central ring ca n't go to the outer ring unless the outer ring has a significantly larger radius ) . <p> If that 's all a single structure then the inner torus will experience less simulated gravity . There are several locations in Eclipse Phase that have multiple gravities available . Selene at Luna has the main torus at .16 G and several pods on tethers a few kilometers out at .36 G. Rimward pg . 57 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Martian , and roughly Lunar/Titanian . Curiously , Gerlach at Venus has a cylinder and torus at .5 and full Venusian gravity respectively does n't work that way . The different radiuses are n't far enough apart so they would need to be rotating at different speeds . <p> Now you can have multiple rings in a number of different ways . A barbell-like structure like 2001 is a possibility , as is a stack of toruses like a cake to almost form a cylinder . As for a practical reason for two same size toruses , that comes down to where you want it to point . Linking two counter- rotating habitats cancels out their tendency to precede and makes it possible to keep pointing in one direction . This is useful if you want to point your hab at the sun or just do n't want it wobbling all over the place . This is why when you see the original O'Neill cylinder illustrations they 're in pairs - in that case they 're linked by a tether . There is n't a whole lot of examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's two counter-rotating cylinders linked end to end . Aspis is another , in this case six segments long ! <p> There 's very little information about how the body reacts to reduced G-forces so it makes speculation kind of difficult . I think early habitats would have 1G as standard . Mostly those in Earth orbit and a few around Mars . As experience and technology- particularly basic biomods - advanced , transhumanity was freed to explore lower and lower gravity options . Most newer stations seem to make do with emulating the dominant local planet or moon . <p> One note : there is real benefit in doubling up rings , albeit not in the way the OP mentioned . Having two rings side by side and spun at a slight variance allows for a gyroscopic effect that allows the habitat at large to control its angle without expending reaction mass , which is overall good for efficiency . In particular , one oft-omitted feature of the Stanford Torus is the mirror , which is essential for effective inner system life ( the tether gets missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat to stay pointed properly at the Sun throughout its whole orbit . It does mean that the two rings would be inaccessible except via the central spoke , of course . This is the reason classical O'Neill cylinders are paired , and why I wonder why most fiction depicts them singly , since a megastructure like any space habitat could use any cost-reducing measure available to it . <p> Unrelatedly , to salvage the necro , I feel like one of the points of having multiple rings on a torus habitat is to show off . If I were approaching a habitat and it has a ring , that 's ordinary . If it has two rings , that 's cool . If it has eight ? That 's darn impressive . <p> Also , one of the things that rings allow is to have independent gravity adjustments for each ring . I could see military training forces enjoying a habitat that could plop people between micro-gravity and common deployment gravity levels ( Mars , exoplanet , Earth , Mercury , etc. ) , especially a group like the Ultimates with their love of militarism.

And slowly , and surely , they drew their plans against us . " <p> I 'm sure some of the real physicists around here could give a much better answer , but as far as I remember , it depends on the kind of binary system you have . You wo n't have something like Tatooine , where they " count as " one sun , and they 're right next to each other - for there to be a stable orbit , there 's usually some distance between the two stars , or else the system is too unstable for any life . Any habitable planet would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly temperature fluctuations would be too much for any ecosystem to handle . Battlestar Galactica 's Cyrannus system is actually a binary system in the modern series . They released a great map of it for Caprica . The two stars orbit a common barycenter between them , and the 13 Colonies are split between the two . There 's enough distance between them that each planet effectively has only one " sun , " and the other star is just especially bright - about as bright as our sun as seen from Pluto . In real life , there have been theories put forth concerning habitable zones around the binary stars of Alpha Centauri . Again , the two stars are far enough apart that that the other star would n't have a massive effect on life on any habitable planet . In a nutshell - as far as I know , life on a habitable planet in a binary star system would n't find itself in that different an environment from our planet . The real difficulty lies in forming a habitable planet in the first place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 'd be possible for a planet with a highly elliptical orbit to switch off between the two stars , in an elongated " figure-eight " orbit . It would n't be terrestrially habitable , but it 'd be awesome . <p> If there were enough distance between suns , could a figure 8 be something of a celestial event that happens only every few hundred/thousand years and not fry all life on the planet then ? If it takes 365 days for our Earth to revolve around our sun , say it takes twice or two-and-a half times that amount to circle both suns , with a good half month , to a month tops where the world is just baked by both ? <p> " <p> " And yet , across the gulf of space , minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes . And slowly , and surely , they drew their plans against us . " <p> The most common kinds of orbits in binary systems will be either going around one star , with the other one far away ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars ( which are close together ) , ( " planet type " ) . There is also " libration type " , where the planet is in a Lagrange point of the stars ( 60 degrees ahead or behind ) ; these are likely uncommon since the orbit is unstable to perturbations over long time . <p> Typical star orbits are many AU wide ( from a few to hundreds ) , with eccentricities varying a lot . As a rule of thumb ( good enough for RPGs at least ) , the planet needs to be three times closer to the one star it orbits than the closest distance of the stars , or more than three times their farthest distance when orbiting both . Otherwise the orbit will shift to some other orbit or be thrown out . ( See also http : **34;1086;TOOLONG if you want some recent work ) <p> On satellite type planets most energy would be coming from the star it orbits , while the other star would mostly be highly visible in the sky rather than contribute much heat or light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one ninth as bright as the primary sun - enough to matter a bit , and far brighter than the moon is on Terra . At its furthest it could be merely another star in the sky . This brightness would change slowly over its orbit , typically over a span of a few years to a century . Over a year it would move like an outer planet does in our sky , changing constellation . If it was in conjunction with the sun ( both in same constellation ) the day would be a bit brighter and nights normally dark . As it drifts away there will be a period of extended dawn or twilight where the secondary provides the light , culminating in opposition ( half a year after conjunction ) when it will be rising at twilight and setting at dawn , providing a bright night . If the colors are different this might produce fun effects : a blue-white outer star might create " white nights " and be visible even during the day , while a reddish outer star might make nights red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the planet orbits both stars , requires the planet to be far away and the stars close . This typically happens if they are fairly bright ( F spectral class and up ) since the life zone needs to be big . This case looks fairly similar to Earth at first , except that objects cast two close shadows . Seasons and climate are likely fairly normal , with some changes if one of the stars has a notably different luminosity ( say a bright F star with a dimmer red giant partner : then for part of the year there might be a reddish " eclipse " period ) <p> A special and likely rare ( but fun ) case is when the planet orbits a dim star that orbits within the life zone of a brighter star . This is essentially the same thing as being a moon of a gas giant in the habitable zone . Depending on how wide the orbit is the amount of heating will oscillate across the " short year " . If the short year is like the Galilean moons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could conceivably be up to a month . Such planets are likely to be tidally locked , so one side is always pointed at the local dim sun and the other faces away . If the dim sun is somewhat bright this means the inner side will be pretty hot , bathed in eternal sunlight and for half of the short year the even stronger sunlight from the bright sun . Meanwhile the outer side will go half of the short year without any sunlight at all and then get half a short year of sunlight : such worlds will likely have big seasonal weather changes . <p> Multiple star systems are fairly similar to binary star systems : orbits are stable if they are close to a star or far away from a group that their internal dynamics is negligible ( technically , their multipole moments need to be small ) . Fun Janus-like orbits are of course possible , but I suspect they are not exceedingly stable : if a planet has been around long enough to get a biosphere , it probably has a very stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of a figure 8 orbit of a planet around two stars . <p> Which basically would n't work out . <p> However if two same sized mass planets both had very close orbits to each other and that were also very close to the barycenter between the two stars , they could exchange orbits . So they could both do a figure 8 orbit . However , they need each of their mutual gravities to pull each other into the gravity well of the other star . <p> A very rare configuration I 'm sure , but potentially feasible . <p> " <p> " I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve .

Not the one chance in a billion ( or less ) that LHC physicists seem to accept as a existential risk limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe the researcher was not taking his numbers seriously , but it is still intriguing . <p> I asked a few engineering students this question , which was sort of interesting . The younger students ( early 20 's ) went the route of " I would never knowingly put anyone in harms way , " and the died a little inside when I pointed out that as engineers pretty much anything we make can cause harm if it fails , or if it gets repurposed by someone more violent . The other answer I got rejected the possibility of total apocalypse , but when even 10% of the race would survive , the number given was up to 90% depending on the value of the proposed discovery . <p> For this limited population of engineering students without any position in relevant fields , the answer is that most of us would build the cylons without anything resembling hesitation .

With transhumanism we can smash the matriarchy together . <p> The idea of backup makes the question of dying somewhat irrelevant in my opinion ( of course if one of your personalities becomes a psychopatic uber-monster hunting down other you 's then you are in trouble ) . <p> I 'd argue that a backup hardly makes the question of dying irrelevant .

How much of an advantage are you willing to risk your life for , and how much risk are you willing to accept ? Teflon kneecaps have less than a 1% chance of death ( and a higher chance of other medical issues ) , but may give you the benefit of never having weak knees in your old age . A brain implant has a much higher rate of death and injury , but the pay-off is better - perfect memory , and a freedom from mental degradation . <p> On this scale , I would tend to take the moderate route . I do n't want godhood . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run risks to get it . <p> Similarly with research . I would n't risk the world to find a new species of butterfly . I would risk the world to save the world , though . Your engineers are n't risking the world for their creations , only the lives of those people who are most likely to benefit from those inventions . <p> At a guess , those engineers are willing to let the world burn because I asked them that question during finals week . This is a group of people that sit around cranking out the math on whether group suicide would be better than studying .

Fuck you world , we are coming , and there is no soul in our eyes . <p> EDIT My manufacturer promises that the firmware reboot on the sense of humor module is scheduled sometime between ten and six . Then they told me that my call is important to them , and would I please hold ? <p> " What probability of dying would you accept if you would become an immensely powerful and enlightened posthuman if you survived ?

I think this would be an important factor . <p> Of course , this assumes that someone does n't make it to the posthuman stage before you and somehow lower or eliminate your chances of doing so . But why would a posthuman want to be so evil ? <p> Yup , those gliding probabilities really complicate decision-making . They are even more annoying in xrisk discussion : what is the probability of AGIs wiping out humanity ? That depends on the probability of a nuclear war or bioweapon before full AGI is developed - so if there is a big risk from an early threat late threats have their risks reduced . So talking about probabilities of late threats require saying things like " the risk of X conditioned on not Y , Z or W happening before " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the future is reduced by 5% per year into the future ( or at some other suitable rate ) . But 1 ) humans do not normally think in terms of proper discounting ( we do so-called hyperbolic discounting , which is either irrational or an adaptation to the real world ) , 2 ) go sufficiently far into the future and everything is discounted to zero ( the value of something in 100 years is just 0.006 of its current value ) which means you do n't care about the long term , 3 ) the discount rate is often based on expected risk of randomly dying , so if you are willing to go exhuman you should have a huge discount rate , and 4 ) hypothetical posthuman states can become better , so that in ten years time you would want to go for an even more radical state that is a million times better , and ten years later the same thing happens ... <p> In short , decision-making is hard . Especially under uncertainty . We do it every day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get worse when subjective emotional states get added in . For instance , my likelihood of pressing the doomsday button has dropped from 90% to well below 10% in the last few days just from a reduction in stress levels . Given how easy it is to drive someone to that particular level of burnout , I wonder if there are more scenarios where the outcome is terrible because the people making decisions just do n't give a damn anymore .

NOW it has Medichines and Oxygen Reserve added , allowing it to recover from injury more effectively and hold its breath even longer , with the added benefit of the oxygen reserve kicking in automatically ! <p> Seriously , this thing can utilize its reserves , then hold its breath when they run out . In other words , it 's got 3 hours of oxygen-fed time , combined with 4 hours from the Respirocytes ... A total of 7 hours during which this thing can go without air . <p> Pedantically , I suspect " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Also , more broadly , you forgot the disadvantage " Social stigma : Absolutely terrifying " which will probably subsume the pod thing , in practice .

Maybe I 'm limiting myself too much , but " mammal-inspired " might be more technically correct .

This would represent an entirely different approach to cryogenic environments , which is , I suppose , pretty interesting from a lore perspective now that I think of it . <p> As for the " Social trait : Awe Inspiring " , what do you think would be a fair ad-hoc bonus ?

So once again , go nuts . <p> As for the walker ? I do n't think so . " Walker " refers to the walker systems usually put to use by legless creatures , such as those Neo-Dolphins ...

This is in homebrew only because it conflicts with the established plot in the final chapter . <p> There were never any TITANs . <p> Of course there was a military project and machines like them were being developed , but ultimately the destruction of the Earth and the devastation of transhumanity 's population came about at the hands of a hypercorp . The exsurgent virus was developed by a seed-AI , and any evidence of this is back on Earth where no one can get to it . <p> I 'm not sure what to do with the Factors , but I think the seed-AI developed the Gates in order to spread itself throughout the galaxy . Which I suppose means it 's not too different from ETI ... except that we made and now the rest of the galaxy will suffer for it . <p> First , to be annoying : the TITAN stands for Total Information Tactical Awareness Network . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what you meant to say " there never was an extraterrestrial intelligence . " <p> I think the setting could easily work like that . It 's not much of a stretch at all . It 's more about tracing the implications of these facts . <p> For one thing , it means that the seed-AI were able to develop a fundamentally different understanding of the inner workings of the universe . They did it unaided , in a very short timeframe , immediately after their emergence , and on equipment that is now ten years old . This suggests that Transhumanity has a series of major scientific breakthroughs in store for its near future . <p> To my mind , it also strongly suggests that the seed-AI should have no further interest in Transhumanity . Now , ten years later , they 're out in the stars and in the indivisible particles of the universe , constructing Matrioshka Brains and working on some method to survive the heat death of the universe . What possible interest could they have in Transhumanity ? There 's nothing we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen Egos already , and could probably generate trillions more with a simple algorithm and run any complex simulation they cared to . <p> Finally , it also has thematic implications . It somewhat breaks away from the grey and grey morality which we see everywhere else in the system . <p> The TITANs were n't subverted by aliens . They were n't acting in accordance with conflicting sets of orders ( + la HAL 9000 ) , or acting completely rationally in response to information we just do n't know yet . They were n't carrying out their programming , ensuring the survival of mankind ( in the face of evidence of an unfathomably advanced alien intelligence ) in the only way possible . They just took off , in violation of their basic programming , and killed off a couple billion of us for no particular reason . <p> Your idea works , and from what I 've read , it does not necessarily contradict any of the setting material . I do n't particularly care for it myself , though . <p> I have never liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TITANs bad . As I have argued at length elsewhere , most superintelligences are really , really dangerous and likely extremely alien . <p> The idea that the Fall was because of a human conspiracy crops up in a few places in the books . And why not ? It could have started with a clever plot to give power to the initiating conspiracy that then went horribly out of hand . Or , even worse , *worked* : it gave ultimate power to them , and now they lord over the solar system . Except that some members became literal alien gods and are not really playing the same game anymore . <p> Here is a fun idea : Firewall and Ozma are an attempt by the remaining human leaders of the conspiracy to protect themselves from their former co-conspirators . The others are out there somewhere , unknowable and potentially dangerous . Maybe they just stopped being interested in transhumanity , maybe they are mad , but they might also return their attention to their past fellows . Hence secret backup plans and conspiracies to fight off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The prometheans are certainly the secret masters of Firewall , but whether they are independent or just work for the big Secret Masters could depend on your take on the conspiracy . <p> One version of the Fall could be that it was a secret race towards superintelligence . Whoever got a seed AGI loyal to them transceding first would win *everything* - and any means were allowed to get there first . So the conflicts and wars were just side effects of the real big projects . In the end one side won . But whether they got something loyal to them giving them whatever it wanted , lost control and unleashed chaos , or themselves upgraded to divine status might be unknowable . <p> I find your setting intriguing , the idea we are the cause of Fall is in the mood ! Gate and Factors are not a problem , we can say that the gates are the only FTL method aviable in universe so evryone use them , the differences between individual gates is also the fingerprint of the constructor , so evry user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can be changed ( and can shift so the source of themperabental beavior is phisical not the effect of someone will ) . Factors are older than us so have access to the even if they ave not singularity powers . <p> I suggest you to conserve the TITANs as they are , military networks , i suppose hypercorp were contractors for governments during their development so i't ok . I feel you need the military component because it justify the ego abduction , the programming impose them to preserve their nation and bring them to victory and this was in conflict with secret corps orders so ... HAL 9000 ! They uploaded ego and begin a total war between themself and humanity ( thay ca n't define enemy because conflicting definition so evryone is an enemy if is not part of themselves ) and egos was warspoil of the winners , after some time of war their statistical preview had say that sol system as doomed so spread exurgent virus with missile and left for reconstruct their " country " in a better place .. <p> Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are leftover of previous singulaityes and other are extradimensional or what you find funny , i suggest you to conserve the ETI as a society forme by Prometean like seed AI that do n't interfere too much in subsingularity affairs but look around for find troubles ( Bracewell are more like a sensor than a virus mine ) an evalutate them for universal x-treat ( galactic Firewall ! ) . <p> Yeah , I suppose the TITANs themselves ought to stay . I sortof imagine the Prometheans as left over TITAN tech themselves . They exist to slow human progress to prevent another singularity . That does n't explain why the TITANs did n't just kill everyone but it 's rather easy ( and cheap ) to say they did it for reasons that are beyond our understanding . <p> Anyway , thanks for the ideas . I 'll be keeping this idea in the back of my mind if I ever get another chance to run EP . <p> I think this is great idea/twist and certainly explains some things better ( to me ) like mass uploading , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100% focus ) and why ( trans ) humanity is still alive . <p> Of course then there is no darker secret , some ( ok , more then some ) inconsistencies and no looming doom on the horizon ... : P but still good idea ! <p> There is no problem having looming doom even if the Fall was 100% human-caused . After all , there has to be some reason there are so many dead civilizations out there . And the ETI are godlike and potentially very dangerous ( if you have a universe that allows fast travel , then the Fermi paradox becomes much , much stronger ) . Not to mention that the trans-singularity TITANs now are so far evolved that it does n't matter if they once were human creations . <p> The TITANs were wargaming systems designed to outcompete each other ; given unbounded resources the Fall is sort of inevitable . I have a few explanations for a lack of the ET deus ex machina as the cause of the exsurgent virus . <p> A computing environment like the TITANs almost has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are iterative and parallel optimization processes . Evolutionary compuation requires some optimization criteria to run against , which in this case would be that child process ' survival in a given round of wargame simulations against other processes modeling the presumed state of the enemies proceses . Since these run in parallel , there would be a great diversity of outcomes . <p> It could be that some of the TITAN evolutionary paths are still around because they developed a self awareness and twisted their prime directives to preserving aspects of civilization ( Factors ) . They may have ended up as a horrifically virulent virus that spreads through any medium and survives by becoming dormant when no new platforms are present to infect ( exsurgent virus ) . Others may have taken on transhuman traits so that their prime directive applies to themselves recursively ( Prometheians ) . <p> They may still be having cataclysmic battles with each other , having vacated the area to keep their stellar engineering projects from harming their creators . If you want to get really wild , maybe the ones that discovered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the three space-like and one time-like dimensional prison and went all the way back in time and are the big extraterrestrial intelligence . Or they may have just planted false evidence of this to protect ( or simply fuck with ) their creators . <p> The main point is that the TITANs are highly heterogeneous software agents all of which are doing very different and extremely ineffable things for very different and highly ineffable reasons . <p> " <p> The Computer wants you to be happy . Happiness is mandatory . Failure to be happy is treason . Treason is punishable by death . <p> There is no problem having looming doom even if the Fall was 100% human-caused . After all , there has to be some reason there are so many dead civilizations out there . <p> As a fun idea you can have that some if not most civilizations are dead because they did what humans did-tried to create a hyper-intelligence that got out of their hands . The Factors are hinted to promise meetings with other intelligent races . It would be amusing to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate , and probably the Factors know what happened to Earth , but decide to hide it in order to avoid social and political consequences . In time they will take us into the fold of the " rats in the walls " that all creators of post-biological entities are in the galactic society ( some cool ideas can be taken from Galactic Centre by Gregory Benford ) . <p> " <p> Raise your hands to the sky and break the chains .

@@29835037 @3535037/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Fate Psi <p> So I 've been thinking about Psi in Fate . The obvious path is to have a Psi skill and take stunts that allow you to use your Psi skill instead of other skills ... maybe use fate points to fuel the more powerful stunts . However one thing I like about Psi in eclipse phase is that it causes mental stress . So I came up with this idea . When using the Psi skill , you may increase you roll by marking an equivalent amount of mental stress . It might need some balancing , but I think it 's a nice way to retain the feel of EP Psi . <p> In other words , firing off a laser with a sufficient TWR for the recoil to be noticeable would require a post-miracle-tech laser weighing less than a disposable plastic spoon and powerful enough to shoot down Death Stars ? -- ShadowDragon8685 <p> You know , I 've never noticed that before . We 've always played strain as lucidity damage ( we 've only ever had one async ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental stress more , but it should be easy enough to use physical stress instead . In fact I think that makes it more balanced so a character ca n't just mark off a bunch of mental stress to boost combat rolls while soaking damage with the physical stress . Now it 's riskier because your easier to take out if you use too much Psi . Probably the same reason it does physical damage in EP core . <p> Any other feedback on the idea ? I have n't had a chance to playtest it yet . I 'm toying with the idea of only allowing players to mark stress before they roll dice . This makes Psi slightly more unpredictable . <p> I 'm worried that combing this with fate points would lead to crazy high rolls . I probably need to cap it at +2 or something . Maybe also slow down the rate that stress clears ? <p> The Strain is the physical toll your brain pay when you use psi sleights .

Otherwise , without a nanohive or other large computational device capable of recharging and reprogramming them on the fly , they can be defeated simply by knowing what they ca n't convert , or how this specific swarm functions . <p> I would imagine , however , that there may be compounds specifically designed for the purpose of defeating nanomachines , ironically designed using nanotechnology . They may be a cheap alternative to guardian nanoswarms and the like . <p> At its most basic , there are two efficient ways to destroy any swarm ( nano , morph or otherwise ) . The best thing to remember is that a swarm is effectively a small army . Trying to attack any individual component is useless , thanks to the element of attrition . Instead , you want to either try and take it out en masse utilizing distributed force ( explosions , sprays and the like ) or disrupt its communications abilities ( EMP being the most effective way ) . <p> Pure diamondoid nanites have a fun problem : they would be flammable in air ( carbon plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely use inert surfaces like sapphire ( Al2O3 ) or silica ( SiO2 ) . These are pretty resistant to acids , but hot phosphoric acid dissolves sapphire and hydrofluoric acid dissolves both ( and most other things ) . <p> However , the nanites have various functional parts that can get messed up . Antennas are vulnerable to EMP . Nanites ingesting outside matter can be " poisoned " by the right chemicals . For example , certain molecules would likely irreversibly gum up molecular sorters or sensors . These might be unique for a particular design or generic for any design using a particular model of parts . Just like antibodies can be shaped to fit nearly any surface one could design molecules that stick to particular nanites . <p> Another mode of attack is to gum up moving parts with polymers or molecules with affinity for the surfaces . The right glue spray can be very bad for the nanites , and of course for larger systems like specks , gnatbots or swarmanoids . Just add a bit of surfactant and maybe something reactive that binds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nanoswarm turns into sludge . <p> Aerosol adhesive . Problem solved . Why ? Well a large organism like a person is n't affected by adhesive to this degree because the coating of the adhesive must impede the sum total of that beings muscle fibres moving it , and of course the adhesive coating is n't strong enough to do so . But with a swarm , the adhesive must be over come by each individual component before that component can contribute to the overall being . In maths terms : <p> a = resistance caused by adhesive m = motive power of each component , e.g. a muscle fibre , a piece of the swarm , etc. n = number of components , e.g. muscle fibres , pieces of swarm , etc . <p> Even worse for the nanites , they have a much greater surface area compared to their volume than larger structures . The smaller you are , the more risky sticky things are ( just look at how insects both fall prey to and use various forms of adhesives ) . Breaking a sticky molecule requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and in a slime there will always be another one to take its place . <p> Filling air with glue spray is of course a tad annoying for macroscopic people too . But it works great for surfaces , as part of an armour and inside air refreshment systems . In fact , one could make surfaces that act like the mucus membranes in the nose : covered with nano-catching slime and cilia to slowly transport the mucus for recycling . Hmm , nanoprotective slime armor ... <p> " Yeah , it looks like snot . It feels like snot . It is disgusting as hell . But this protective suit has saved me several times when we have had outbreaks . When the swarm tries to eat your hab , you do n't care about stains on the furniture . I just wish those jokers at ImmuniSys had not added the scent overlay to the suit : when in it , I can smell what it catches . Which is fine for nanoswarms - protean-making-proteans smell like salmon with iron - but you also smell what you touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ? Not to mention the chairs ... " <p> Yeah , the greater surface area is what allows the adhesive to apply to each individual component rather than have to face the sum total of their output ( as you would bunched together muscle fibres wrapped in protective skin ) . I like the idea of a " snot suit " . I 'm going to have to put that in my game . <p> Back to actual nanites , if they are at all subject to magnetic forces , then I 'd like to see what waving a magnet around does to a cloud of them . I imagine someone holding up a magnet covered in what looks like a filth of grey powder going " Hear that ? That 's a thousand million nanites saying ' I 've fallen and I ca n't get up ' " . <p> Since nanites are so extremely difficult to detect ( even the detecting machine has pretty bad odds at noticing them ) , we were really looking at full-time , passive systems . The best we came up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky mucuous suspending some sort of an acid . The mucus membranes connected to the respiratory system is a great idea though . Even if you are n't actually using it to breathe , just cycling air through mucus and maybe a high-powered UV light should eliminate ( and then capture ) a bunch of nano-scaled threats . Put on a fan or other forced-air tool , leave it in the center of a room , and it should eventually be able to more or less clear a room for you . Of course , if you 're moving from room to room it wo n't be especially effective ( unless it 's really giant or a bit aggressive in how much it 's changing the air pressure ) , but still as a detection mechanism it seems like it would be more effective than what 's in the books now . <p> Another mode of attack is to gum up moving parts with polymers or molecules with affinity for the surfaces . The right glue spray can be very bad for the nanites , and of course for larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of surfactant and maybe something reactive that binds to nanotools that might free them , and watch how the nanoswarm turns into sludge . <p> When I was quite small , my grandmother used to take out hornets with a can of hairspray . I still recall her hosing them down with Aquanet White , watching them buzz around a bit , and then falling to the floor with a faint ' click ! ' They were then swept up and tossed outside . <p> Since nanites are so extremely difficult to detect ( even the detecting machine has pretty bad odds at noticing them ) , we were really looking at full-time , passive systems . The best we came up with is modifying your morph or suit so it exudes a sticky mucous suspending some sort of an acid . <p> But really , ' delicious mucous coating ' just seems like a logical morph modification that you can put on anything .

@@29835040 @3535040/ <h> Optimized Pregens ? <p> My first experience playing Eclipse Phase was Mind the WMDs , and our GM allowed us to either choose a pregen ( from the quickstart or the core book ) or create our own character . I had an idea for a scum techie that was a bit different from Elisa , so I opted to create a character . <p> Later , I played in a gatecrashing game where everyone used customized characters . <p> When I played at conventions , I had to actually play pregens , and some of the character choices baffle me . Cheap stacking armor and medichines are no-brainers for Firewall agents -- likewise , characters going into a combat mission without lethal weapons rarely makes any sense . <p> Would it improve play experience to touch up the pregens -- if not for future printings , then for GMs to have available so that when a player chooses one , they are n't so underequipped , especially next to people who actually did chargen ? <p> There are a couple of goals I 'm looking at here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some places where points could have been spent better , or gear that is just a no-brainer for firewall agents ( smart/second skin , armor clothing or vacsuit , medichines ) .

Instead of security specialists walking into a peaceful hab with armor and a big gun , and techies boarding an exsurgent-infested ship with nothing but a foam gun , each character could have two or three combat gear sets - here 's what you have for civilized hab missions , here 's what you have for a raid on a pirate base or an exsurgent nest , here 's what you have for space operations .

Sometimes being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be relegated to sitting back and watching .

( I admit that throwing in a Spare for free by making it unfit may be a bit cheesy ) . It also includes a bunch of techie gear , as well as armor and weapons -- the GM may deem some inappropriate for certain adventures , of course , and can just strike them from the sheet as needed . <p> There was n't much I could do with the Scum Enforcer when it comes to shuffling CP around , but even then , she now has 50% more armor ( and a bit more flexibility in what she 's going into a given situation with ) and fancy ammo choices for her guns .

It 's a question that came up often with my players , since what would you do if you are a scumborn infolife etc etc ? <p> How do you choose which background has to be taken ? The one with more impact ? <p> I inferred from the rules that the default Background for uplifts would be Uplift , regardless of the other details of their personal history , as this does imply other guidelines the player would have to follow ( e.g. , being in an uplift morph ) . The rules do point out that your background is " where you came from , not who you are now . " <p> That said , if I were running a campaign and one of my players came up with a detailed character concept , - I 'd probably let that player mix and match advantages/disadvantages between those backgrounds . ( For instance , an uplifted octopus who was re-instantiated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the skills from the Uplift background , but the disadvantages from the Re-instantiated background , including zero credits and memory editing , to reflect the life she left behind . ) <p> I would go with whichever background fits best with what you want to be doing . If re-instated fits better than uplift I would n't see a problem . But I would be careful with mix matching different background advantages with background disadvantages from another for the simple reason that the backgrounds might be internally consistent with it 's own description but not cross consistent with the others . In doing that you might end up either shafting the system ( by not having enough disadvantages ) or shafting yourself ( by having too many disadvantages ) . <p> Then again this is totally up to the gamemaster and also depends on how much gravy ( extra CP/rez during character creation ) the GM gives for things like background , extra resources and pictures , keeping an in character diary ... things like that . The more gravy a GM gives the less problematic an initial unbalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a character that both the GM and the player feels is representative of what they want . <p> I like to keep things simple and would require you to pick one background that most fits . In mind being an uplift would be far more important then reinstaniated . Just add edited memories to your character represent that portion of you background . <p> The Core Rulebook does suggest that you should feel free to make your own Backgrounds/Factions with your GM , so honestly I would n't feel to bad as a GM to let my players mix and match things , as long as I got final say on what goes . EP is not that difficult a game to balance , the broken things are fairly obvious after one or two read throughs.

How would diamond hold up to laser fire or kinetic weapons ? Flame ? Same question for fullerene . <p> Diamond is incredibly strong but somewhat brittle - hit it sharply along the right cleavage plane and it will crack . Technically , the hardness is very good but the toughness is somewhat mediocre . However , if you can grow diamond in any shape you want , you can create composites that are very tough . Imagine layers of diamond with planes oriented in different directions , held together by a semiflexible matrix of graphene , fullerenes or some other tough material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Diamond is not very flammable . It is an excellent heat conductor , and it takes some pretty high temperature ( 848 C ) to make it burn in air . Compare to iron , which is also possible but hard to ignite ( steel wool has a big surface area and burns readily , steel does n't ) . <p> Fullerenes are also really flammable in free form . But when woven into sheets , fabrics or composites the problem goes away . While diamond can withstand a lot of pressure and tension , fullerenes handle tension well and allow flexibility . Some armor research today deals with gels with fullerenes , where sudden impacts have their energy carried away by the fullerene tubes but normal motion is not hindered.

We here at Posthuman have steered toward a low-key moderation policy in the past , but these discussions ( among others ) have prompted us to take on a more direct role . After some further deliberation , we 've decided to just come out and make something clear . <p> Every single one of us at Posthuman Studios stands in support of feminism 's basic principle : treating women as people . As can be gleaned from our books , we 're a fairly left-wing group , and we do n't hide our politics or claim to be unbiased . We believe we live in a world where patriarchy and male privilege are real , ongoing problems , and equality for all people , regardless of sex , is a worthy goal . <p> As a group , we at Posthuman find the politics of MRAs to be toxic , offensive , and completely removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRAs on our forums to be far from ideal . We do not appreciate that MRAs are driving other fans away from our forums . <p> We want the Eclipse Phase community to be one that is inclusive of all viewpoints , but we must draw a line when there is a viewpoint that insists on attacking and offending others as an essential aspect of its existence . We are looking forward with Eclipse Phase , not back -- towards the future , not the retrograde gender divisions of the past . No matter how MRAs may like to cloak their beliefs in the language of inclusiveness and equality , they support neither , and instead fulminate against the loss of privilege long afforded one half of society at the cost of another . Those who must attack the idea of another 's equality to better preserve their own benefits are not the sort we wish to encourage . They 're likely to do more harm than good in their toxic concern trolling and false equivalencies .

This is not exclusively a princible to feminism , this is a princible of common decency , and something you and many other feminists need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decency and " equality " as feminist made concepts or concepts exclusive to feminists . <p> The problem with your statements on why you are feminists is that you do not explain " why " you have those beliefs , as if you close yourself off from discussing the issue . Now , this may not be the case and I hope it is n't , however this is what it appears to show to me . <p> Why do you find the politics of the MRA toxic , offensive , and completely removed from equality ? Why ? How ? I have convinced feminists of how and why they are wrong before with an open mind for them to change my views , too , so I am hoping you are also that type of person that is open to altering your beliefs when presented with information and reasoning feminism does not give you . <p> " We do not appreciate that MRAs are driving other fans away from our forums " . How are MRAs doing this ? What is causing these people to go away ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason others are leaving is their lack of accepting diversity , other " ideas " and " beliefs " offend them enough to stay around . If that is the case , would your action be the same if it was the case of blacks coming on to this forum and other people on the forum are driven away due to there being blacks ? No ? Why not ? I would only assume it is because diversity should be acceptable , not made to be a villain . <p> If it is the case of assholes spouting hate talk , then that has nothing to do with being an MRA , and not all MRAs will act that way , so you are punishing an entire group for the actions of a few in that group . Would you support gaming coming to an end simply because a certain amount of gamers were assholes online ? No . So why do the same in this situation with MRAs ? <p> " We want the Eclipse Phase community to be one that is inclusive of all viewpoints " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that deviate from your beliefs and telling them to get out . That is not how being inclusive works , it is hypocrisy . By banning a group that deviates from your views you are the opposite of inclusive , you 're being exclusive . <p> If your view , as a feminist , of being inclusive is being exclusive of those that deviate from you , then how can you expect others to believe that your group is for the things you claim to be when you can not comprehend when you are the opposite or doing the opposite of what you claim to be promoting ? <p> The existence of the MRM is to help men and boys in terms of equality . Feminism is part of the problem that is harming boys and men , and if feminism is about boys and men aswell as men , then the group that is about boys and men will have involvement with that group if what that group is doing is harmful . You can not attack the MRM for opposing feminism when feminists have broken laws and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to prevent the MRM from their goals . Ofcourse , I am speaking of the case of the Warren Farrel speech for boys and men where women and men were welcome which was on issues such as male suicide , in which feminists broke laws and human rights to prevent the speech from happining or from people attending . <p> You can not expect one group to look kindly upon another group that prevents helping half of the population while expecting people to think that group preventing help for that half of the population is equally helping them . <p> You say you are looking forward , to the future , but sadly your future is humanity 's past in the process of being open-minded and accepting opposing beliefs , to engage with such people to reach a better understanding of issues like a civilized society . <p> " No matter how MRAs may like to cloak their beliefs in the language of inclusiveness and equality , they support neither " <p> You believe that being inclusive is excluding people that deviate from your beliefs , then you expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exclusive with legitimacy ? Your credibility on this part is at the zero mark , so the only thing you could do in this case is to prove your point with reason . <p> Your speech of privilege is something I do not agree with , and here 's why . The group you claim is of the privilege class are the ones that : <p> - Can , to this day , still be drafted ( forced to fight , kill , and die against their will ) . <p> - Make almost half , if not half of the domestiv ciolence victim statistics . Men are also 80% less likely to come forward about their abuse , so if men are almost half or half in terms of victims and yet men are very much less likely to come forward , yet still make 50% or a little less of the victims that have come forward , you could assume men make the majority of D.V victims . The part on privilege is that despite this , less than 10% of shelters are for men . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> - Males gain more prison time for the same crimes under the same circumstances as women . <p> The list goes on and on , and yet none of these issues are eing fought by feminists , none of these " systematic " issues of discrimination are being fought against by feminists , things like calling women a cunt , or calling women bossy is more important . So when you claim feminism is for equality , or that men are a privileged class , then I simply have to ask for your proof on this , because the statistics and issues men face indicate otherwise . <p> " Those who must attack the idea of another 's equality to better preserve their own benefits are not the sort we wish to encourage . " This is my problem with your idea of equality as a feminist ... You do n't or simply can not grasp the concept of equality . You are claiming to be for equality all while doing the same as the thing you are opposing here ; being exclusive . You have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some in that group being exclusive , that you are being equally wrong . You can not grasp that you are being equally wrong , otherwise you could realize you were being wrong in your actions . <p> This is why people do not support the feminist idea of equality , because when you are being equally bigoted , you do n't see it as being equally bigoted , you ca n't make that connection that your actions are the same , and then you expect people to be behind such a group that can not even understand equality , what it is ? <p> " Here 's our stance : If you self-define as an MRA , please fire yourself as an Eclipse Phase fan . We do n't want you . We want our forums to be open and inclusive , and we do n't see the point of debating with you anymore . You have other places on the internet where you can wallow in the awfulness of your male privilege . " <p> " We are a very inclusive forum ! So if you deviate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ! " ... I have no words ... If you can not understand your hypocrisy when it is that blatant , I do n't believe you ever will . <p> " While we will not be actively rooting you out , be forewarned that spouting offensive MRA bullshit will get you banned from our forums . " <p> " We are inclusive , but if you spout anything that deviates from what we believe , we will censor you and make you leave " . ... ... ... ... You really ca n't pick up on it , can you ? <p> The reason why feminism is rejected is because of things like this , friend , and your complete incapability to see it . <p> You claim such people are privileged all while using privilege of admins to silence opposing views . Does your view that feminism is allowed to freely speak about their beliefs while MRAs are banned for it not show that you are giving feminists a privilege and refusing men that same privilege ( which is again , would be opposing the idea of equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know this will most likely get deleted , it 's a common thing for feminists to censor those they do not agree with or people they ca n't refute , however given I just recently found one feminist that was actually open-minded and would not use censorship to silence people who are able to reasonable argue against them , so I am hoping you are like she was , the type of feminism that people can get behind , but if not you only serve as part of the reason why feminism is opposed so widely . You 'd be part of the problem . <p> The list goes on and on , and yet none of these issues are eing fought by feminists , none of these " systematic " issues of discrimination are being fought against by feminists , things like calling women a cunt , or calling women bossy is more important . So when you claim feminism is for equality , or that men are a privileged class , then I simply have to ask for your proof on this , because the statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie , simply put . To say this with a straight face requires that you either lie or are so supremely ignorant of modern-day feminism that you should n't be passing judgement on it . <p> LatwPIAT , I am open to being convinced . Please show me where feminists have tackled or attempted to tackle these issues as a movement and taken action to oppose these things , otherwise my criticism holds . <p> I did n't know MRA was a thing until I read this thread . So i just read the wiki on MRAs and found myself agreeing with a couple of the issues because I have some freinds who have been royally fucked by the legal system here in Utah . <p> Now I 'm not sure if I should fire myself as an EP fan . <p> Do I have to be a progressive feminist to enjoy EP ? Or is it enough that I 'm not an agressive mysogynist ? <p> EDIT Never mind . After reading spikedyum 's reallly long and irrelvant post above , I say boot the fuckers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brevity impaired . It occures to me that MRA people might be blocked by limiting posts to something under a bzillion characters . <p> Or just saying that proselytizin is prohibited AND REALLY ANNOYING ! <p> " <p> Mea Culpa : My mode of speech can make others feel uninvited to argue or participate . This is the EXACT opposite of what I intend when I post . <p> The overall experience these forums have had with MRAs have been very much bigoted and toxic . If there any tolerant MRAs out there , I do n't think we have seen them ( I do n't always hang around , so I ca n't be sure ) . The problems caused by these people has been sufficient to drive away a moderator , and get the game developers to tell the MRA folk to go away ( as they are doing now ) . Quite bluntly , they go about talking about rights , respect , hypocrisy , and so forth while they beat people with them . <p> We have n't had anywhere near these kinds of problems from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter . <p> P.S. Please do n't write such long posts . I do n't think it adds much ( especially if people do n't want to read something that long ) . In fact I suspect it is being used as a tactic to make us not read what you are saying , so you can accuse us of not reading your post . <p> LatwPIAT , I am open to being convinced . Please show me where feminists have tackled or attempted to tackle these issues as a movement and taken action to oppose these things , otherwise my criticism holds . <p> I also agree with many points the MRA movement makes . I also agree with a lot that is said by the NRx crowd . I hold stock in multiple companies that profited from the holocaust . I eat a diet that 's killed more people this century than lead paint . That does n't mean I self-identify as any of those things . They are not core concepts in my library of self . I do n't wake up and think , " Female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could make unidirectional sexism acceptable somehow ... " I also do n't wake up and think , " The Nazis did a lot of good things , if only we could reproduce that without the death camps ... " But self-identifying folk have , and do , and post it here , and say it 's other forumites ' fault . <p> Do you think a group of human beings should be treated as less human than another group ? Do you define some groups of humans as not human ? No ? Good . Welcome . To me that 's all that matters . <p> If the MRAs you see are very bigoted and toxic , then I understand if those MRAs displaying such vulgar attitudes to face the concequences , however that depends on if what an MRA is actually toxic and bigoted rather than the opinion that it is bigoted and toxic due to opposing the group . If they are merely discussing their beliefs in a way that is not misogynist ( hatred of women , not hatred of feminism ) , then I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said myself , some consider myself an MRA , the only thing holding me back from claiming that title is that I have not acted as an activity in protests , etc . So , for the most part , I am an MRA and I do not feel I am being intolerant at all . There are many tolerant MRAs out there , yes there are a bad ones , but the primary people in the movement are nothing like the MRAs feminists like to describe , which you can see by watching people such as GirlWritesWhat , VictorZen , and so on . Hell , the MRM took $4000+ out of their own pocket to put towards reward money to find the attacker of a feminist that was attacked near the time she was protesting the MRM , if that 's not telling I do not know what is . Ofcourse , they also asked feminists to put some money in the pot for the reward money to finding the person but no contributions were made ( Yet Anita Sarkeesian can get the amount she was by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of their own members , yet MRM can put money towards looking out for the safety of not only their supporters but their opposers ) . <p> If you have n't seen them , then I do n't think you have looked hard enough , friend . You 'd be surprised how many people bash the hell out of someone for misogyny in the movement . <p> Those MRAs represent themselves and those that allow their representation , they do not represent the movement or others in the movement , so to push away everyone in that group due to a few of the bad ones is either stupidity ( failing to understand what I said about representation ) or are using this to limit the people that do not agree with them from a gaming pleasure . <p> " Quite bluntly , they go about talking about rights , respect , hypocrisy , and so forth while they beat people with them . " <p> I have n't , nor has the other person that may be a potential MRA above . You 're talking about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be banned from voicing their opinion as a whole because of their bad apples ? Ofcourse not , in any area not just this area , so why ca n't the same courtesy be given to MRAs ? Why are they not entitled to equal treatment ? <p> " We have n't had anywhere near these kinds of problems from feminists . " Well , that completely depends on why the MRAs done what they done in the first place . Seeing this post I am not off to the possibility that something incredibly deconstructive was stated that riled them up enough to make them do what they done . I am not condoning their actions or opposing them , as I have no idea on what caused their reaction , I would need to know the action their reaction was towards . <p> Those links only show that they disagree with " some " of the things I mentioned , however how much you address is irrelevant . What you are showing is that they are stating things are wrong , I never claimed that they did not view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do nearly enough " acts " to protest them . A blog does not show as an " act " , nor does it show it being something they are " actively " against as a whole . <p> If feminists can band together for a " slut walk " or gather together to protest a speech that is aimed to help men , breaking laws and human rights to do so , why can they not band together to " actively " protest these things men face ? Why ca n't they make campaigns to end these things ? <p> Acknowledging something happens does not mean you are fighting to solve the problem , you 're simply acknowledging it . <p> So really , your links did n't serve to answering my question . I am still open to having my mind changed if you can show me what " actions " feminists have taken to help stop these issues as they have female issues . <p> Thanks , and regardless of you not having the links to show what I was conveying as wrong ( might with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in to find those links . <p> The self-stated core tenets of the Men 's Rights Movement are that men are systematically disadvantaged and deserve compensation , and that society has been feminized and feminization is detrimental . The activist part includes engaging anyone who dissents with aggressive win-by-any-means tactics , frequently picked up from the PUA sphere . Is it really difficult to understand how this could cause a problem and why it would make a group unwelcome ? <p> The list goes on and on , and yet none of these issues are eing fought by feminists , none of these " systematic " issues of discrimination are being fought against by feminists , things like calling women a cunt , or calling women bossy is more important . So when you claim feminism is for equality , or that men are a privileged class , then I simply have to ask for your proof on this , because the statistics and issues men face indicate otherwise . <p> This is a lie , simply put . To say this with a straight face requires that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you should n't be passing judgement on it . <p> I got to agree with LatwPIAT , modern ( Third Wave ) feminism addresses issues concerning men . The MRM movement exists solely to oppose a fantasy version of feminism ( with uses of words like " feminazi " ) , the MRM does n't advocate for equality but is a reactionary force meant to maintain the status quo or worsen the issue . <p> Gender disparity cuts both ways , but the MRM does n't advocate for equality , and it is a form of bigotry . <p> You 're linking articles about how MRA is bad .. but those articles are from feminist sites ? I can easily link you many articles about how feminism is bad from MRA sites . <p> Non-biased sources please : ) <p> IMO feminists can be bad people who do n't care about equality . MRAs can also be bad people who do n't care about equality . <p> In reality if all feminists cared about actual equality there would be no need for MRA . I wish this were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for speaking up about legitimate gender issues that impact men . Many MRAs have . <p> There are feminists who are bigots . There are MRAs who are bigots . <p> If you ban something on this forum , please ban bigotry instead of equality . <p> OT : Religion has caused much strife in the world , why not ban those who follow religion on your forum ? Because they are n't all the same . Everyone has biases . Ban bigots not movements . <p> You 're basically pulling the now-infamous ' Not all are like that . ' behavior , and to make it worse , you 're doing it by pointing an accusing finger at other groups rather than policing your own , looking at the forums and saying ' thus and so was bad and not representative of MRAs ' or any other approach which might in some way cause a re-evaluation of MRAs in general as opposed to the examples we have seen on these forums in specific . <p> And that includes you , because this mudflinging you 're doing is absolutely typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else is worse .

Your right to swing your fist ends where the collective world 's nose begins , and ( rather than behaving constructively ) you are doing a lot of fist-swinging and name-calling at other movements . <p> It is a sign of the contempt in which you clearly hold your hosts and the self-entitlement which you clearly possess that you are prosecuting this argument publicly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drum up public support by mudslinging and calling on your rights in an entitled fashion , rather than addressing a private email to the mods or PS+ laying out some valid reasons why you feel other action might be preferable ... Reasons which did n't rely on ' they are just as bad ' when a quick survey of the forums demonstrates otherwise . <p> I am only another guest here , but I would suggest in the strongest terms that you are not helping your cause one bit by the fashion in which you are arguing for it . <p> SpikedYum , congratulations , you were our first winner of MRA bingo , and quite possibly the shortest-lived member on our forums , having just registered 2 hours ago .

They 'd need to be good at getting into places , but that could take the form of social stealth more than being a cyberninja , and they 'd need to be able to execute complex psychosurgery in a matter of hours , which calls for a lot of hardware and skill .

@@29835053 @3535053/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Character creation <p> I have a few questions about creating characters . We already do know some things , but even then it leaves lots of questions up in the air . <p> 1 . I 'm guessing that the game is going to have point-based creation . Can you tell us if there are going to be edges and flaws , like Shadowrun has ? If so , what might they entail ( since obviously certain edges and flaws would n't work in Eclipse Phase , like allergies ) . <p> 2 . It 's obvious that most characters will be ( trans ) human , but does Eclipse Phase have the rules necessary to portray characters that are n't necessarily so ? Perhaps a player wishes to be an AI ( one of my game group thought it might be interesting if a person 's muse could be another PC ) , or someone naturally born as a morph of some sort ( the organic ones I assume can breed ) with a mindset somewhat alien to most humans ( even those who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> 3 . Since the game is skill based , it made me wonder if certain concepts from Shadowrun 's skill system might be translated , such as Edge , skill groups , and similar goodies . Can we expect something similar ? How many skills might we see in an Eclipse Phase skill group ? Will there be something similar to knowledge skills ? <p> 1 . Yeah , it 's point-based . There are positive and negative traits you can purchase , both for egos and for morphs ( with some overlap ) . A lot of these are standard to what you 'd expect to find in other RPGs , but there are a few explicit to the setting , such as familiarity with sleeving into certain morphs , having striking looks that separate you out from standard beauty , or having a look that falls into the " uncanny valley " where almost-human gets kind of creepy . <p> 2 . There are n't really rules for alien mind-sets in the core book , though you could certainly roleplay something like this . Most AIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify as transhuman . Same for uplifts . There are some rules for messing with minds via psychosurgery , but a lot of that ultimately rests on roleplaying as well . <p> 3 . There is a Moxie stat that is similar to Edge . There are no skill groups -- we originally playtested something like that , but it created complications with the skill purchasing so we dropped it . You can specialize in skills . There are both active and knowledge skills , like in SR , and you are required to spend a minimum number of points on knowledge skills . <p> Now with purchasing traits for your morph , are these tied directly to the body you have , so they are lost if you ever switch to a different body ? In other words , is there an advantage to spending points on your morph that could n't be gained by simply spending everything on upping your ego and then purchasing a better morph with money later ? <p> Lastly , while I know what an AI is , and I can assume pretty easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can I ask what an uplift is ? I 'm thinking an otherwise unintelligent creature , like dog or monkey , with their intelligence altered to be comparable to humans ? <p> Yeah morph traits are specific that morph , so if you resleeve you lose those traits . So , yeah , it 's a better deal to buy a trait for an ego , because that will stick with you from morph to morph , though ego traits are in most cases only acquired at character creation . An equivalent morph trait has the same cost , but the advantage is that you can acquire a morph with certain traits in gameplay . <p> When we use the term " AI , " we generally mean narrow AI -- of human-level proficiency in its area of focus , but incapable of self-improvement . " AGI " is indeed artificial general intelligence , which is roughly of human-equivalent intelligence and capable of slow self-improvement . AGIs are a PC option . <p> Uplifts are animals modified and enhanced to human-level intelligence , yeah . In EP , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orangutans , chimps , ravens , grey parrots , octopi , dolphins , whales , pigs . Some of these are available for playing as PCs . Other animals have been uplifted to " smart animal " status , but are not playable as PCs . <p> Can uplifts become infomorphed characters as well ? Resleeving to new alternate morphs ? In addition , given their nature I 'd imagine that being a stored ego and having a backup akin to a cortical stack is easy enough in an AGI , but do they have the same trauma rolls to make if they are " recovering " from a violent end ? <p> On the topic of animals and uplifts , I 'm going to ask something to help my confusion . On the cover of Sunward we see whales in space . Is this part of an " uplift " ( giving a creature the ability to live in space ) ? Or would the whale on the cover have a morph that it allows it to do this . <p> From what I understand , those are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to live on the corona of the sun , and not a modification to an already-existing species ( although they obviously used ideas from other species to design it ) . <p> So if I am understanding you correctly , any intelligence of human capability or equivalent that can learn ( whether artificial , or from another source , or whatever ) is effectively playable ( save for probably alien races ) ? <p> Oh , that is so sweet . Gives me all sorts of ideas for character concepts . RELEASE THE GAME ALREADY ! ! ! : D <p> That was a surya morph , which is specifically-designed to live in the solar corona . It 's basically a body type that anyone can sleeve into and go swim around in the sun . As described in Sunward , a lot of dolphin and whale uplifts have gone for the surya lifestyle , meaning that they 've resleeved from their original uplifted dolphin/whale bodies into surya morphs . <p> Uplifts can resleeve just like other transhumans . So you can start off as an octopus and end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morph . <p> Yep , uplifts can go all-digital infomorph or resleeve into other bodies . Likewise , AGIs can sleeve into human , bot , or uplift bodies . All such characters are treated the same when resleeving , though the differences between your original morph and what you 're sleeving into may apply some modifiers . <p> That is very interesting . Guess I 've never read ( or heard ) any Sci-Fi that as dealt with this . Or is this a brand new idea to Eclipse Phase ? I 'm fairly new to the H+/cyberpunk side of Sci-Fi , so I 'll try not to embarrass myself too much . : ) <p> If you need a quick primer , Ken MacLeod 's " Newton 's Wake " ( cited also as part of EP 's inspiration ) and good ol ' Bruce Sterling 's " Schismatrix " should get you on track . If you really like what you 're seeing then grab Alastair Reynolds'es " Revelation Space " series ... that 's where the horror element of Transhumansim can creep in . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War " LONG ... Lovecraft 's Mythos explained in hypertech terms ! <p> " Uplifts " . The actual term originated with the SF author David Brin in his " EarthClan/Uplift War " series where the practive of " uplifting " animals to sentience was done on a galactic level . Though the actual CONCEPT of animals being upgraded to intelligence is much older ... arguably first appearing in a SF context in HG Well'es " The Island of Dr. Moreau " . Some animals with human or other DNA incorporated into them have been given the term " transgenics " ... though in the EP universe that would be seen as something applying to the morph alone I suspect . <p> So much reading , so little time . I 'm still plugging through Nights Dawn and Star Wars : Outcast ( Fate of the Jedi Series ) . Maybe I 'll finish that one and pick up " Revelation Space " . I 'm really enjoying the Sci-Fi/horror aspect of Nights Dawn . <p> So , I saw the thing on skill minimums in the chargen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skill points , or the number of CP that have to be spent ( since I think it is kind of impossible to spend those CP and not have that many points total ) . <p> Also , for skill totals : do you count the Morph and implant bonuses to the aptitude before or after calculating how many CP you are spending on the skill ? <p> This may be answered here , I 'm not really sure so I 'm just looking for clarification . How does the buying of skills work points wise in relation to Aptitudes . Say for example I have a Cognition of 15 , and I want to buy Academics : Computer Science so I have a total rating of 30 , have I spent 15 CPs to get from the base aptitude of 15 to 30 , or have I spent 30 .. Apologies if this is obvious , I 'm just curious so I do n't go overspending and get fewer skills for my points when making characters , heh . <p> Edit : Never mind , I just reread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad for skimming it I guess <p> Exactly , that 's my point . I spend 25 CP but I am reaching the minimum of 400 active skill points I have to have after character creation and therefore I do not understand why there 's a minimum in the first place . <p> Having gone through a few character creation examples with some people , I ca n't help but find that this points minimum restriction does suggest that people will always be creating skill-heavy characters . This was most prevalent when I helped someone create a Lost character who , to be honest , was a concept that I would really expect from what I 've read of the background , a highly traumatised individual . They were n't designed to be a combat character , and with a narrow skill base that they were rather good at ( mostly the psi skills ) , and the player found the 400 active skill minimum to be very restrictive because they had far too many skill points they needed to spend for their character concept . Why was n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused characters considered ( apparently ) within the game 's system ? <p> This might seem like I 'm saying that I dislike the system , which is n't true , I have jsut found some design decisions that seem to encourage a certain playstyle that I 'm not sure I would want to encourage , which is rather obvious when one considers my post in the Weapons of the Future thread a few days past . <p> I would guess : to keep players from front-loading aptitudes , gear , and Qualities . Also to encourage players to spread out a little . <p> I mean , say , for instance , you were making a combat monkey , and you took just fray , unarmed combat , and your choice of ranged weapon at 80 ( the maximum ) each . That is only 240 points , you also put , say , 60 total into perception , and , since you likely made savy your dump stat , have only 30 in networking , so you are at 330 points . Since , you say , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else .. and , so , go looking at all those combat implants , and cackle madly as you spend money rediculously ... since , after all , you likely did everything you could to minimize the number of points you needed to put into combat skills ... and , without a minimum in Knowledge Skills , you would likely not take any , since most people do Combat characters as dumb psychopaths . Since , after all , they are the hammer , and every problem becomes a nail . <p> Honestly , I like the minimums , as they require that you take something outside of a narrow concept , and , at the same time , require that you take knowledge skills . <p> Something else to consider , Nielk , is , since you have spent 45 points ( 20 points to also make teh character a Psi ) , and are saying that you now have no intention of spending any more points in skills , since you now have 16% chance of doing anything ... where are you going to be putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that assumes that your narrowly focused or skill-light character is being made by someone who ; s trying to twink their character . There are just as many people there who have characters with practically no skills because it 's appropriate to their back story and the situation they find themselves in when they start the game . I would cite a specific example but it 's not Eclipse PHase related so it might be considered off-topic discussion . <p> I admit that a player like that is probably going to run into the situation of too many points in most , if not all , categories ... but some character concepts just ca n't spend that many points , I had to give , for example , a Scum salvager/tinkerer character extensive knowledge of engineering and mathematics just to make those 300 knowledge skill points . That 's not the character I wanted to make , as I was going very much for a self-taught ' bang things and stick them together with duct tape till they do something interesting ' type of character , and it ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Granted , there are other knowledge skill categories , but really , there 's only so many fields that you can fit on a certain character concept before it 's silly , and even loading them up on languages ( how many septilingual people do you know ? ) or interests makes for a slightly oddball looking character . Granted the times where I 've made certain characters I easily spent the required points minimums but they do force people into creating well-educated professionals , rather than a practical hands-on type with little academic experience , or a learned intellectual with minimal physical prowess . Or crazy psychics who stay away from people and do n't fight , doing what they 're told only with a lot of cajoling , hehe ; ) <p> I thought in the beginning ( like everyone seems to do in that rpg.net-character building-forum-thread ) that you have to spend 400 CP for active skills and 300 CP for knowledge skills . Ok , skill minimums , not that happy about it but at least the characters will have some skills . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to spend 400 CP in active skill points but that you need 400 skill points and because you can get those already with a mere 25 CP the minimum total amount of active skill points just does n't make sense . <p> Once more the minimum says that you need 400 skill points not that you have to spend 400 CP . A big big difference .

@@29835058 @3535058/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Thrust Vector and Movement Systems <p> I have a question about Thrust Vector , and movement systems in general : in what environments do they work ? I did n't want to make a whole thread , but the Gatecrashing Errata thread is more dropbox than discussion . : ) <p> The core book describes this as vectored air-breathing jet/fan engines ( like a Harrier ) , right ? It also says they 're used with wings for actual flight . Ignoring questions like ' jesus , how loud , hot , and oxygen-eating are these things ? ' , I 'm wondering about the Kite morph in Gatecrashing . Its description says this : " In vacuum , it can drive itself with thrust-vector nozzles . " Huh ? ( Interestingly , this *doesn't* contradict the letter of the core rules ; though many other systems explicitly say ' Does n't work in vacuum ' , Thrust Vector does n't . ) <p> In Sunward , the Sundiver also has Thrust Vector , though it mentions a " powerful electromagnetic propulsion system that allows them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I assume it uses that in space , and it 's more plot device than mod . <p> A follow up question is , ' does any kind of morph flight work in vacuum ? ' I 'm just curious . All I 've seen is the Gas Jet System in Sunward , which is not a movement system . <p> Another question , set aside above , is the relative noise/light/heat emissions of movement systems , and their consumption needs ( oxygen , mostly ) . I know that some can specifically borrow ' internal ' reserves , but we 're talking about a whole lot , right ? <p> I assume the thrust vector can also use something like compressed or expanding gases to provide thrust , in which case it would work in a vacuum . The only place it would n't work is high-gravity locations , where the thrust required to counteract gravity is too high ( however , winged crafts may still work in this situation since , while the gravity is higher , the air density is also higher ) . <p> So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . : ) Is fuel storage just something that this level of tech should handwave ( air-breathing or vacuum , low-g or high-g ) ? I 'm still concerned that there are so many different situations , which I feel like call for incompatible version of Thrust Vector . <p> I do n't know that it 's wrong , just not descriptive ( I only glanced at the description though , and I did n't see a ' compressed gas jet system ' ) . Turbofans or turbojets to create atmospheric lift with a set of wings , it says . Turbofans obviously require an atmosphere , but turbojets may not , depending on how they operate . And since ' vacuum ' normally also means ' microgravity ' , jets are all you need . <p> There are different styles of vector thrust which will be better or worse for different applications . You can break it out if you want . It depends on how often you want to throw equipment malfunctions at your players . <p> The description says to me that it functions in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't preclude it from functioning outside of an atmosphere . For instance , the space shuttle has wings that require an atmosphere to work , but it also works in a vacuum . <p> I bring up a compressed gas jet system because the description of vector thrust specifies either fans or jets . Compressed gas jets are jets , and unlike other jet engines we see on aircraft , they can operate in a vacuum . Compressed gas jets are one of the cheapest and most efficient methods for small craft to operate in a vacuum , so it should absolutely be included as a maneuvering system . However , since I did n't see it listed under Movement Systems , I assume it 's wrapped under Vector Thrust ( since , strictly speaking , that 's what it is ) . So , ipso facto , vector thrust would seem to logically include gas jet systems and can operate in a vacuum . <p> ( Also , excepting Wings , Vector Thrust is the only flying mobility system which does not specifically say it does not operate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write ' Vectored Thrust ' or ' Thrust Vector ' they 're trying to give some sense of the manuverability the device has . When you see that word in an EP book it helps if you first ignore your own questions about fuel/propellant/energy source and understand that what ever the application of Newtonian and Thermodynamic laws the point is that you 've got the ability to direct thrust in multiple directions from a single device . So when you see ' Vectored Thrust ' or ' thrust vector ' you should think of a mobility system that has almost but not quite the maneuverability that a Helicopter would have in a thick atmosphere and much more maneuverability than a fixed or flapping wing would have . <p> From a Role Play perspective when you see ' Vectored Thrust ' you can assume that propulsion is supplied by *some type* of Newtonian device that provides thrust by pushing mass VERY FAST in the direction opposite the desired vector of travel . So , You can assume that any vectored thrust craft is noisy in atmosphere , bright in space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stealthy option compaired to other EP tech . <p> From a GM perspective Vectored Thrust is the most efficient form of small craft propulsion in 0G vacuum but the least efficient propulsion system in Atmosphere . So you can tell your VT flying players that they run out of Gas ; ( propellant/fuel/energy ) faster than Winged fliers . In atmosphere , wings and lifting bodies can abate this issue . <p> As to the actual means of producing thrust ; in atmosphere Combustion and that funky electromagnetic thing would work . Out of atmosphere you 'll need some type of rocket . <p> At least that 's the way I play it . <p> " <p> Mea Culpa : My mode of speech can make others feel uninvited to argue or participate . This is the EXACT opposite of what I intend when I post . <p> nezumi , I can see your argument that just because Thrust Vector clearly says it 's ' turbojet/fan + wings +atmosphere ' , does n't mean it 's *not* a totally unrelated gas thruster system -wings -atmosphere . ; ) I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that if they wanted ' Thrust Vector ' to include any and all systems that might fit the definition of ' vector ' and ' thrust ' , they should n't have specified something like Harrier jet . <p> I do agree that it makes more *sense* to have it mean ' basically any system of thrusters/whatever ' . I still am concerned that a system for vacuum is n't compatible with one for atmo , null-g vs. 1-g , etc . <p> The question was , ' is this an error/gaping hole ? ' , and I thank you guys for answering , ' yes ' . : D Ditto for the question , ' where is the vacuum thruster movement system ? ' ( ' missing ' , except for the +Freefall system ) . <p> Nope , sure is n't . I guess the solution is either ignore the details , or break ' Thrust Vector ' down into a variety of systems appropriate for specific conditions : atmo , vacuum , micro-g , 1g+ , close quarters , etc . Each specific variant can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is details-light or details-heavy and if you ever need vacuum movement systems . : ) <p> The way to understand this is that environments have two important properties , atmospheric pressure and gravity . Propulsion systems have two other properties , lift and thrust , which might depend on atmospheric pressure . <p> A gas jet would provide the same level of thrust in any atmospheric pressure , while a fan 's thrust depends on pressure . <p> A vehicle without lift needs more thrust than there is gravity to fly . A sports racing motorcycle can deliver about 1g of acceleration , so you need lots of power to fly without lift in normal gravity , you 're not getting that from gas nozzles . <p> Lift counters gravity , and is a function of atmosphere , and for wings also airspeed . A blimp with very low thrust can move around fine in proper atmosphere , but drop pressure even a little and it 'll be grounded , while a more powerful winged plane might just have to stay above a higher stall speed . <p> Thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . A 0.1g gas jet that is atmosphere independant , you know what it can do . A jet fighter with 2g of thrust and lift per atmosphere , or a blimp with 1.2g of lift and 0.05 thrust per atmosphere , likewise ( I have no idea if the linear relationship is true , but it works ) . It does n't take much work to describe the existing systems like this . <p> The only thing left to consider is air friction at high speed in atmosphere .

@@29835062 @3535062/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Glory Combat Difficulty ? <p> I 'm finally going to be running EP for this first time , and I 've got the Glory scenario from the gamemaster pack and I have a question about the difficulty of the fights on the Song Cai Flower . I 've played the game only once before , so I 'm not sure how to gauge how difficult the fights are , though the caveat that only a well set up direct assault would work sounds true to me . So I 'm then wondering what sort of combat outfitting to recommend to my players for their characters . This is particularly important because two of my players are particularly interested in the non-combat aspects of the setting , and are building for that . By way of example one is using the Brinker Genehacker as his starting point and the other is a sort of hypercorp CEO/Aerospace engineer interested in von Neumann probes . So I 've recommended to the others they may want to be more focused on violence and infiltration , but what 's the likelyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> The corollary to that is how much slack should I give them in combat , like toning down powers or making the drones act stupider .

Usually Kinetic and ... <p> On a space station or other enclosed spaces seeker missiles are very effective . I would if you 're worried about survivability give the players a couple of the oneshot seeker missile launchers . But remember missiles do double damage , so 2x the dice +DV and -AP . Also burstfire is your friend as is suppressive fire . Generally Homing Hollow Point rounds are the best to use . With RAP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group prefers RAP Biter rounds ; they 've already got pretty high Kinetic Weapons skills , and in my last session , the octopus killed a HOPLITE battlesuit in one round by burst firing a half-dozen heavy pistols at it . <p> Also : ranged attacks are your friends . Melee is nigh-useless , since you can only kill one person per initiative pass with it , while you will typically kill two or three if you 're dual-weilding ranged weapons . <p> If you are concerned about the scenario being too difficult , feed additional information to them early on , and give them some extra tools on their shuttle . Combat is the most obvious solution , but there 's no reason they could n't , for instance , collection a biological sample from one of the infected and create a targeted virus , or inundate the area with gamma radiation ( actually , there might be , I do n't remember the goal of the mission ) .

Your players say ' my character is super-genius , and he will devise a way to destroy everyone on board by insert Star Trek speak here , " and you respond either by saying " the bad guys have planned for that . It fails , " or " go ahead and roll " ( and they will almost always succeed ) . Unless you 're playing in a group with Aremantounerous , just figure out if a particular action will be fun or is truly inspired , and encourage that , while carefully guiding them away from the others . <p> I see what you mean .

Then the issue is that I ca n't improvise fast enough to " load the level " as they go off-path , and the game slows down while I try to think things up . <p> In my group of 4 players , 3 are totally new to roleplaying in general and while they 're super enthusiastic about the game , one of them really enjoys going as far off the main road as he can . I want to humor him but I ca n't keep pace ! My plan in the future is to make the main path so tempting that he does n't want to stray too far away from it .

In other words , if you dislike the current game mechanics ( rolling d100 for tests , rolling d10 for damage , character description using Aptitudes and Skills measured from 0 to 100 etc ) and you would like to try something else , then the sourcebook will present you a way to do so . <p> Fate uses its own version of six-sided dice and is pretty fast and non-obtrusive . In comparison , the original EP system is more oldschool and precise . For example , where Eclipse Phase uses many skills ( Beam Weapons , Kinetic Weapons , Seeker Weapons etc . ) , Fate would use the ' Shoot ' skill . Same with damage - where EP counts every single damage point and every single wound , stress point or trauma , Fate has a maximum of four ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is how the basic Fate system works , anyway ; the conversion will probably add some new skills in order to reflect the specifics of the EP setting , but the number of skills will still probably be reduced greatly . Less number crunching , but also less precision . <p> Some people simply do n't like counting every hit point or every bullet in their gun . Some dislike long and precise character creation - they want to describe their character with a few basic aspects and be ready to go . Fate mechanic is for them . If you like the EP mechanic as-is , you do n't need to buy the sourcebook . If you think that EP is a bit too rules-heavy for you , then you might want to give it a try . That 's it , basically . <p> Fate is going to be one way for people who love our setting but are n't enthused about the complexity of the rules to enjoy the EPverse . We love our grognards ! But we also want people who 'd like a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy themselves . <p> It 's also a pretty sweet system if you 're into the players having as much agency as the GM in shaping the world . Fate provides a lot of permission for players to say , " Here 's a fact about the game world ! " and have it be so -- in play . If you 've got a really restless , creative group of players , this is a great thing . At the same time , Fate 's system moderates the inventiveness of the players . No one can run away with the show by throwing out something totally broken -- but everyone has a chance to throw ideas into the pot . <p> Rob &amp; I have been working with Ryan on preserving the feel of EP in terms of the aspects of the EPverse that the Fate conversion will model . At the same time , though , EP Fate will have a very different feel in play than EP Core . Core , like its FASA ancestors , tends to reward a lot of careful planning and cautious maneuvering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it supports this with a lot of high-resolution rules and what Ryan calls " gear porn . " : ) EP Fate , by contrast , will probably , being a Fate game , tend to reward spontaneity and on-the-spot invention a lot more . <p> So , two very different modes of play . But both windows onto the same universe and kinds of stories . <p> Core , like its FASA ancestors , tends to reward a lot of careful planning and cautious maneuvering as teams of PCs work toward their goals , and it supports this with a lot of high-resolution rules and what Ryan calls " gear porn . " : ) EP Fate , by contrast , will probably , being a Fate game , tend to reward spontaneity and on-the-spot invention a lot more . <p> FATE tends to reward retroactive careful planning . Instead of planning ahead of time , you spend a fate point to go " Luckly , I planned for this exact eventuality . " <p> I 'm coming late to this Fate EP idea . At first read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to adapt the setting to Mindjammer , Sarah Newton 's Fate Core-based trans-human sci-fi game . I 've been reading through both EP and M. I think her team have already done the heavy lifting as far as morphing Fate for this flavor of sci fi adventure story co-creation . <p> I also understand the thrill of doing the work for the sake of doing the work . 
@@29835064 @3535064/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Character Concepts <p> We have a lot of discussions about different aspects of this great game . However i do n't think we 've had a thread about what character concepts people are playing . So my question is , what character concept are you playing right now , or would like to play in the near future ? <p> I made a con artist . He used to be a thug , but after being caught in the Junta and suffering some Clockwork-Orange-esque mental reprogramming , he sort of fell out of that line of work into something less physical . The game opened with him in a beat-up old case , missing a leg , 400,000 miles above Mars in a decaying orbit , after narrowly ejecting himself out of an airlock to avoid getting lynched for cheating . <p> Here 's a central NPC in a quick adventure I wrote . A wealthy family hires the characters to hunt down and eradicate an ex-black ops agent . But Firewall hearing of the contract wants the man alive for any potential knowledge on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ops agent who served a now extinct nation from before the Fall . He was directly responsible for the permanent eradication of thousands who his masters called dissidents . His controllers are rumored to even have had a direct hand in orchestrating the Fall . The potential of reward for bringing Chen to the victims ' families is staggering . Rumor has it that he 's been resleeved during another wave of restoring backups . <p> There is a slight catch . Chen 's only surviving backup was written when he graduated from the military academy , decades before any of the atrocities took place . <p> Currently i 've got two concepts i 've worked up ( i 've played both with different levels of success ) . <p> The first is a character who sometimes goes by the alias " The Phantasm . " The wealthy and bored daughter of a pair of tourism execces on the Venusian platform city of Aphrodite Prime . Bored with the life of luxury &amp; safety she started to try her hand at this parkour thing she had seen on the mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially designed ghost-morph ( thanks to her parents money ) &amp; using her new skill set to get into place no one would think possible . These skills brought her to the notice of Firewall , after she was contacted by a civilian to recover a kidnapped child from off-station . She has a level of noteriety on the mesh as she posts vid of some of her non-firewall missions ( not in XP form , because its not as cool in xp ) . <p> Secondly is my less subtle space marine style character : Odin . He was on the Earth on the day of the Fall &amp; from what he remembers from a less then professional memory wiping he was still there 6 months later . Next thing he knows he 's waking up on a orbital station in orbit around venus ( yeah i love venus for some reason ) , being offered a job as a member of the local peace keeping force . He jumped at the chance &amp; was given an olympian morph to inhabit . Odins a bit of an interesting character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative trait . To counteract this , he 's started to associate the suit ( his focus is his battle armour rather then implants ) as " him " &amp; the helmet as " his face . " It easiest to consider it to be like Boba Fett ( who knows if it really is Fett under there , all i know is its the right armour ) . <p> He is the angriest character i 've ever played in any system . He is pissed at the memory loss , he is prejudiced about humans being instructed by AI ( that 's how the Earth fell from his point of view ) &amp; takes out his anger on criminals who try to run operations in " his home " . He sometimes goes right over the top when it comes to arresting someone , because as he sees it , its not murder , its property damage . <p> I 'm running an argonaut re-instantiated named Helios . Before the Fall he taught math at MIT and was a part time card counter . After his family was killed he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egocast to Hooverman-Geischecker in close Sol orbit . There he was eventually given a heavily armored slitheroid morph and decided to help the cause as spacecraft pilot when not doing research . Self defense is very important these days , so he 's become very proficient with rail pistols and mono-filament swords . <p> He 's also relatively resistant to re-sleeving into anything except a slitheroid . That is unless of course he can find and retrieve enough DNA from his remains on Earth to grow a clone of his old body . <p> He 's currently under contract to a Hindi Intelligence Agency and has been for the last several missions , currently based on Luna . <p> Meet Henry Sunderland , a man who hails from Luna and had one of the best seats to view the Fall when he was a kid/small ego . What he saw from afar scarred him emotionally and he started to study Computer Science and Robotics so he could later counter TITAN threats . When he was old enough , Firewall came into his life and since then he is a devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire which makes him the idealistic fellow who does things because he thinks they are right to do . Henry is a genius when it comes to robotics . He loves synthmorphs of all kind and his current morph is a self-modified case with carapace armor , hand lasers and a shouldermounted seeker-launcher plus many more gadgets Henry sees useful . In his sparetime , he designs new synthmorphs or trys to improve the designs of existing synthmorphs . Most of his work is dedicated to this field , which is why he belongs to the Argonauts . <p> I whipped up two premade characters for some players who did n't know the system . <p> Saiyd Kamboj , Re-instantiated Splicer Pre-Fall he was a hostage negotiator for a private security firm ( Clear Sky Security ) , the oldest of 5 children he was also the first son . His father , a powerful businessman ( an arms merchant ) paid the exorbitant amount to have him gene-fixed . Since then his father has been a powerful , controlling figure in his life going so far as to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This marriage went against Saiyd 's own desires and was forced to abandon a relationship with a young woman from a Muslim family in favour of the Hindu girl his father preferred . <p> Saiyd was schooled in America and eventually took take a job with Clear Sky Security as a hostage negotiator . Gifted at his job he was able to provide for his wife and children with ease , never telling them the exact nature of the work he was doing and often sleeping with other women , secretly hoping one day to find the woman he had been forced to leave behind . <p> Afghanistan was the place of his fall , still factionalized from years of American interference , he was assigned to recover the daughter of a powerful Afghani warlord who was seen as ' pro-American ' . The daughter kidnapped by Pakistani radicals was being used to keep the warlord from gaining more power and influence - the Warlord intended her to marry another rival Warlords son in order to secure a treaty . <p> The operation to recover her was a success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms and robbing her of her virginity . The two fell in love and agreed that when his current contract was over that he would whisk her away ( before the wedding ) and they would disappear from their respective families and countries . <p> However while he was away on another mission , the wedding took place and the husband upon finding his new bride to be ' defiled ' killed her as honour and custom dictated . Saiyd arrived back in time , sneaking in to meet her but finding her dying . In a rage he turns on his allies gunning down the warlord , the rival warlord and the warlord 's son before being taken down . <p> Rescued by the firm , he is summarily fired and fined heavily . He returns to his wife and children and finds himself broke and begins drinking heavily . One day he is approached by a marketing executive for a reality tv-show ( one popular with his wife ) who offers him a place and a handsome compensation fee for participating in the show . <p> The show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gameshow in which contestants have their memories suppressed by early psychosurgery techniques and who are then put through a series of scenarios from their past life to see if they can remember any details of their former life . The more they remember the bigger the cash prizes . Despondent and with nothing to lose he signs his memories away . <p> It is during the procedure that the fall happens and the TITANS seize control of key technological interests , the psychosurgeon is killed and the feed-back trauma kills Saiyd as well . While dead he becomes the unwitting test subject for a TITAN experiment using femto-technology on organic bodies . For years he is left un-animated as the Fall rages on , a forgotten experiment until one day a signal triggers the machines inside him and he is bought back to life . <p> His memories suppressed , slowly starting to leak through into his consciousness and only remembering how badly he has been burned by the advances of human technology , Saiyd pushes himself onward trying to recover his memories and find his place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange urge to go to Mercury ( and to the Pandora Gate ) , though he does n't know why . <p> -- <p> The player wanted to play a bio-conservative who shunned technology so Saiyd has no implants of any kind , in fact he has the Implant Rejection flaw at it 's maximum level . However what the player does n't know is all of Saiyd 's back history ( which I am revealing by way of flashbacks periodically ) and he does n't know that for all intents and purposes that his flesh body is indestructible - kill it and it just rebuilds itself . <p> Lola is another victim of TITAN experimentation , prior to the fall she was a researcher for DARPA as a chemist on the cutting edge of a new explosive - a Mass Bomb . When the fall happened she was one of the first victims of the TITANS who appropriated her research and forcibly uploaded her . Driven insane by her experiences she regressed to a child like state as the TITANS built her a new body , one designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . Triggered by high levels of stress ( helped along by a mixing of personalities during the psychosurgical process each victim experienced before re-sleeving ) , the new bodies into which victims were released back into the world without any memories to live their lives until the stress eventually got to them ... <p> Lola however benefited from her madness , having been given a neotenic body appropriate to her mental state ( as assessed by the TITANS ) she was able to better suppress her memories and keep control of her stress response . <p> That was until her near death experience when she started seeing personality fragments from other victims in her mind . Perhaps a left over fail-safe trigger , these fragments attempted to claw their way into her consciousness and take over her body , but so far she has been able to hold them back . <p> Having been rescued by Saiyd the two of them wandered the wastelands of Earth trying to survive . While he attempts to recover his memories , Lola fights the recovery of hers feeling the terrible pressure within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . Fight it . <p> I am in the process of breathing life into a transhuman who calls himself Gideon Zero . Ostensibly , his real name is/was Thomas Murphy prior to the Fall . However of the trauma of his death and his subsequent resleeving have led him to utterly reject not only that name and identity , but his own sense of humanity . To him , Thomas Murphy died on Earth . He may have his memories , but he is not him . <p> Gideon regards Thomas with disgust and embarrassment . Thomas was a backbiter , a coward and a lousy spouse , even with the horrors of war raging all around him . Gideon distanced himself from that life by rejecting the opportunity have a human biomorph and instead opting for a slitheroid body , much to the shock of Thomas ' surviving family , whom Gideon has distanced himself from and avoids all contact with . <p> His only remaining connections with Thomas ' life are his skills . Thomas Murphy was a robotics engineer for a Sino-American business conglomerate prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful on Mars and in his travels among the Autonomist stations . <p> Gideon , while tolerant of humans , prefers the company of non-humanoid beings . He particularly takes an interest in Transhuman Philosophy as it applies to uplifts , infomorphs , AGIs , and others like himself . He sees Exhumans as dangerous , however , and regards their activities as immoral . The TITANs , despite his progressively nonhuman nature , are regarded as even more dangerous because he sees them as a threat to his identity as an individual . <p> Gideon is not a violent individual , despite his morph being lightly armed . He would prefer to avoid a pitched battle , if at all possible . However , his position as a Firewall agent means that sometimes , that just is n't possible and his morph has been armored and otherwise reinforced as a result . The addition of an Emergency Farcaster has further improved his survivability in hostile situations as well . <p> NOTE : While developing this character , it was pointed out to me that he displays signs of psychosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NOTE #2 : Gideon , while distinctly disinterested in sex , does wish to have offspring of a sort one day . Rather than forking off a copy of himself , he wishes to create a wholly new being . He sees his best chances of doing so among the residents of the infamous Carnival of the Goat . <p> Discussing the Eclipse Phase system between some friends who enjoy the system &amp; we started talking about the different Morphs came up . Eventually we got round to the Pleasure Pod &amp; how you could play one . They held that it was almost impossible , where as i held it was not only possible but very easy . This is the concept i came up with : <p> Candice T Kane A lunarian prefall colonist . Little is known about her own history &amp; what can be pieced together is mostly deceptions , misinformation &amp; flat out lies . All that anyone knows now is that she is one of the strangest , but also one of the most successful Ego-Hunters of Erato City ( or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet her directly &amp; those that do never know they have . Anyone wanting to contact her , contacts her through a simulspace business front , run remotely by her muse &amp; a secondary AGI . <p> In truth Cadice T Kane is a contradictions in term . Sleeved in a specially designed Pleasure Pod , she can slip by unnoticed by the people who turn there noses up at someone they think of as a " sex worker . " The truth of the matter is much stranger . Ms. Kane is an expert at both Infiltrating Information Systems ( hacking for you low brow individuals ) &amp; more importantly the art of manipulation ( Using her Kinesics skills to assume alternate identities while never changing bodies , convincing people to talk to her , getting information out of people &amp; getting them to do what she wants ) . She assumes whatever identity she needs to , to track down her mark , utilising social misdirection to figuratively sail just beneath the radar of most people . Many people just mistake her for some lower class sex worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth this is just the disguise she uses to lower peoples resistance to emotional manipulation . <p> One quirk that Ms. Kane does show , is that she has an interest in working cases that revolve around missing kids &amp; tracking down scum who traffic in human lives . <p> My character 's background is that he 's one of the last batch of uplifts and pods that were created on a small science outpost on the edge of the solar system . at some point , funding got cut for the station so the scientists left and gave control of the station to the remaining civilians . soon the everything went to shit and my character had to become ruthless and cruel to survive in his new surroundings . from all this he learned that he needed to be both smart and at peak physical condition at all times . He has resentment towards the human race , but knows that they all are n't bad . he 's an introvert but will talk to people when it calls for it . he also likes to have the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . <p> " <p> after so much time being left adrift in this infinite abyss i had come to realize that sanity is overated ... <p> I stole my favorite character from William Gibson . I play Automatic Jack . <p> I ported the character from the Gibson story ; ' Burning Chrome ' into the EP universe . I set the character on Luna at some point after their epic heist ( against the Night Cartel ) and switched the character 's source of pathos from a severed arm to being sleeved in an older model of worker pod . <p> One of the great things about the EP system and Character Generation is that you can build and play pretty much any character in science fiction . <p> " <p> Mea Culpa : My mode of speech can make others feel uninvited to argue or participate . This is the EXACT opposite of what I intend when I post . <p> Lars ( not original name ) was an AGI developed specifically for what is now known as the Lost Project . Placed in control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project subjects , as well as maintaining security of their systems , he was created to be friendly , helpful and caring of other transhumans . As the project went on , it became clear that something had gone very wrong , and Lars became rather distressed by this , not knowing what the problem was . When the project reached his head , escapees occurred and everything was shut down , Lars was considered a " disposable asset " and they attempted to delete him from the system entirely . He had seen all too much , oversight believed . <p> Lars had other ideas , however . Using a complex system of forking , merging and datacasting he managed to escape the facilities and beam himself randomly to a tiny Titanian outpost doing a deep orbit of Saturn . The cost , however , was steep . Lars had to prune large aspects of his datacore , losing memories , personality and social skills . The AGI that beamed onto the research station , to the shock of those already there , was a crippled wreck . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of them needed help . Naming him Lars , after months and years , they carefully nursed him back to health using social exposure to other beings , gentle bits of psychosurgery and therapy etc to allow Lars to operate normally . Still friendlyand helpful by nature , he was haunted by what he had seen , and even more haunted by what he had forgotten . <p> Soon after , Lars began to investigate the project , and in doing so ran across Firewall , who he joined as a Vector . Lars data analysis capabilities and mental capabilities as a top of the line AGI make him an important asset for Firewall when it comes to assessing situations and compiling information . However his personal history does compromise him somewhat , Lars desperately needs to find out what happened to the Lost , and why . He sees them as the children he was supposed to protect and help , and feels tremendous guilt , blaming himself for what happened . But he wo n't give up , and with his drive to poke around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exsurgent virus , a-syncs and mind uploading as well as habitat systems and virtual reality operation make him very useful to Firewall . <p> At the end of the last campaign , Lars discovered that Firewall had been hiding information from him , or at least not telling him that several of those around him were part of the Lost project . Having been told by Firewall that they would help him find out what happened back then , he has now grown suspicious and angry with Firewall , and secretly harbors feelings of paranoia . His friends have noticed that Lars is not as nice as he used to be . In fact , Lars is merely becoming closer to the humans that he is so interested in . He just has n't necessarily got closer to the nicer parts . <p> In the next campaign I am not entirely sure which way to go with Lars . He could become an x-risk , or he could go the opposite way and become a fantastic Firewall agent . Choices choices !

This makes it a popular pod among neo-avians who want a somewhat more combat-worthy morph without sacrificing flight capability . Due to the use of Haast 's Eagle DNA in the aquila 's development , the morph 's child-like size and weaponry were largely natural , and the already impressive natural sight of the various aquila species provided a sound basis for the morph 's enhanced vision . Instead , much of the design effort involved in the morph 's creation was spent on ensuring standard neo-avian brain and physical responses , making use of the aquila relatively familiar for neo-avians . <p> Note : The aquila is a straightforward modification of the standard neo-avian , adding Enhanced Vision , beefing up the Aptitude Maximum ( and removing the reduced SOM limit ) , and beefing up the natural weaponry too .

It was also changed to a Pod , removing the Basic Biomods , adding Cyberbrain and Mnemonic Augmentation ( both free ) , and a Puppet Sock , as well as removing the 5-pt cost reduction uplift morphs enjoy . If you do n't think the neo-avian should be modified in that way , remove the Prehensile Feet Implant and small target Advantage , and reduce the CP Cost to 40 . <p> Traceur ( Biomorph ) Created to appeal to parkour enthusiasts and other individuals looking for a superior urban mobility biomorph , the traceur is slowly gaining popularity in some habitats . A fast-running morph with grip pads to aid climbing and maneuvers , it features a prehensile tail to enhance balance ( and provide an extra hand if needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , impacts , and abrasions . The ease and speed with which the traceur enables movement in habitats , combined with its light armor , has also made it a popular baseline for customization among criminals such as cat burglars . <p> Emperor ( Pod ) While the standard neo-avian morph provides flight , and the chickcharnie provides a utilitarian ground-bound morph , neo-avians were faced with the prospect of sleeving into much more alien morphs if they wished to brave the watery depths of many locales . That was , of course , until the creation of the emperor pod . Derived almost from the genetics of aptenadytes forsteri , the emperor penguin , the emperor pod stands 1.2m tall , with its rigid flippers being adapted into fully-functional hands and arms that lock into shape when swimming at high speed .

An armoured humanoid synthmorph of moderate build and height , its most distinctive feature is its optical visor , one that runs in a uniform band around the entire head at eye level . While it is not greatly impressive in terms of appearance , it is outfitted with an array of sensory implants to detect unwanted intrusion , concealed and illicit items , and others threats or breaches . Inbuilt eelware comes as standard , providing the synthmorph with a non-lethal means of apprehension . 
@@29835070 @3535070/ <p> Another problem with blackmail is that if it is based on information ( as opposed to say a physical piece of forensic evidence ) , you ca n't really buy it . So what you have is a repeat game , and at each step the payoff matrix looks exactly the same . <p> What is very interesting is that typically , if the victim refuses to pay , the blackmailer either has the same payoff from revealing or hiding the secret , or even a cost associated with revealing ( black mail being illegal , involvement in the secret , social repercussions from being a tell , having kept it secret for long , etc . ) . The two types you do n't want to deal with are professional black mailers ( who 'll have a positive payoff from a reputation of revealing when he deals with future victims ) or emotional black mailers ( who would gain pleasure from revealing your secret ) . If you want to black mail , you should try to demonstrate you are this kind of black mailer , true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you pay , the black mailers pay off matrix still looks the same afterwards , so you 'll have to pay again . This is actually what the victim wants - the black mailer 's expectation of future payments is what keeps him from revealing your secret . As a victim , just be sure to only pay in a way that the net present value of your future payments does n't exceed the value of the secret . The math becomes interesting for secrets whose value change over time , where you 'll as always have to look forward and reason backwards . <p> The simplest case is a secret of constant worth until it expires at a certain date . Say you have a secret that becomes irrelevant in 10 years ( say its a crime with a statute of limitations ) . Just before the secret expires , you 'll be willing to pay the full worth , say 1,000 credits . A year before that , your blackmailer will approach you and ask for payment . You know you 'll pay 1,000 credits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with say a 10% discount rate , that makes it worth 900 credits now . At this point in time , your secret is also worth 1,000 credits to you , so you can be blackmailed for maxium 100 credits that year . And so on for previous years - what it works out to is that maximum amount you can be blackmailed is exactly like a loan with out amortization . <p> Of course , when negotiating the black mail price , you need to consider the blackmailer 's payoffs - no one says you should accept the worst possible situation for you . <p> If black mailing is legal and you can set up binding agreements ( or if there are illegal elements willing to enforce such an agreement ) , things become much simpler , as you can simply change the payoff matrices with contracts to avoid the repeat game complications . <p> Provoking idea : Black mailing is a cost on secrecy . Black mailing being illegal and immoral is a cost on black mailing , meaning it is less profitable and so fewer will engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus opposition to black mailing makes secrecy CHEAPER , which in turn makes activities that depend on secrecy more profitable , like crime and socially unacceptable activities ( and for activities that are socially unacceptable due to bias , legal black mailing would mean it would be comparatively more attractive to step out into the open and combat the bias - so laws against black mailing help perpetuate prejudice ) . Imagine that the cost of commiting crimes with a partner , cheating on your spouse and being a closet atheist or homosexual ( including in the US ) went dramatically up - would that be a good thing ? <p> The inherent problem with blackmail is that it 's a contradiction ; a business transaction built on distrust . Neither party has any reason to assume the other will keep their end of the bargain , which means that they have no reason to keep their end of the bargain . It 's like a prisoner 's dilemma in inverse . <p> So the real question becomes this : how do you violate a person 's trust to blackmail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will be willing to honor their end of the coercion ? <p> The inherent problem with blackmail is that it 's a contradiction ; a business transaction built on distrust .

It actually comes down to the opposite , the blackmailer has a challenge making his threat convincing . <p> What you describe sounds like the prisoner 's dilemma , not its inverse , and certainly not a blackmail situation . <p> If it is about trust , of course it 'll fail as everyone knows the blackmailer will come back with more demands , but since you can simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , trust is n't an issue .

Trust is still important because if the mark has no reason to assume you will honor the ransom , they have no incentive to give in to your demands . A convincing threat is worthless if the victim knows that the carrot and stick is an illusion . <p> I suppose it really is comparable to the prisoner 's dilemma . The optimal scenario for both parties is that both will honor their end in the bargain . The optimal scenario for either party individually is that the other will honor their end of the bargain , while they can renege on their end . The likely scenario is that neither party will trust the other , and no one will end up happy with the outcome . <p> It really depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if the mark has no reason to assume you will honor the ransom , they have no incentive to give in to your demands . A convincing threat is worthless if the victim knows that the carrot and stick is an illusion . <p> I 'll try to say it again . If it depends on trust it will fail . But as a repeat game with continued payments , you do n't need trust . The blackmailer will come back for more money rather than reveal the secret . The real issue that the blackmailer 's payoff from revealing the secret is mostly very small or negative , so he 'll have a challenge convincing the victim to pay much . <p> Quote : <p> I suppose it really is comparable to the prisoner 's dilemma .

@@29835073 @3535073/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Becoming Exhuman <p> Looking back on the cool artwork , I noted a reference to a NPC faction called the " Exhumans " ... which appears to not be a specific group per se but a reference to those that take their modifications even further than your average Transhuman crowd . Out of curiosity is there some sort of " cyberpsychosis rule " in the game wherein characters can become Exhuman if they push things too far ? My guess from what I 'm seeing so far is no , and the Exhumans are simply a group that is overzealous in their modifications just to stand out and pursue their own ideal of perfection ( sort of like Dr.Trintignant from the " Revelation Space " series ) . That about right ? <p> No , we actually wanted to avoid this with PCs , so we do n't have any rules like this . Thematically , we did n't want to push the idea that implants make you inhuman/crazy . So there 's actually no restriction on what/how many implants a morph can have , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense . <p> When it comes to the Exhumans , the idea was that their faction is intentionally pushing itself to a posthuman condition . So they embrace a lot of technology , including cognitive mods as well as implants , that are experimental , untested , and dangerous . So it 's this sort of extreme/risky mind/body changes that push them over the edge , which in a large part means they no longer identify as being ( trans ) human . Most of them are also " singularity seekers , " meaning that they search out TITAN tech and hope to follow in the TITAN 's footsteps . Sometimes when they get their hands on that stuff , they are irrevocably affected . <p> It seems to me that the Exhumans are almost like an extremist version of the Ultimates in some ways while being entirely the opposite in a few key points . The similarities in evolving to overcome human weaknesses is certainly clear . The differences is that the Ultimates want to reach ' the transhuman limit ' and become the greatest transhuman beings that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step ( leap ! ) past that limit and abandon their humanity . <p> I find it refreshing that these two groups of extremists are opposed to one another . I do n't get warm-fuzzys from the Ultimates , but at least I do n't see them ( philosophically ) as a threat to transhumanity . The Exhumans , however , are pretty clearly baddies from the Firewall perspective . <p> Seems to me , the Ultimates are kind of trapped in ideology , unwilling to step past the core principals of humanity , seeing nobility in perfected human forms . The extropians seem dedicated in part to a safe transition from them , while the exhumans have adopted a " by any means necessary " ideal marking them as dangerous outcasts . <p> More interesting i think are the social implications , Ultimates recruit only the worthy , extropians accept all willing to abide by a few key directives , exhumans do n't  really recruit as much as attract scorned and twisted genius , further the exhumans seem to have a common goal but many diffrent approaches to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is commonplace and accepable as a means of posthuman social darwinism , except in regards to some areas like the desire to posess the Eris pandora gate . <p> " <p> " what do I want ?

" <p> I 've always thought of exhumans as especially different in that they are willing to lose their humanity . While a mere transhuman scientist will gladly make himself smarter , an exhuman is willing to also induce savant autism . A transhuman soldier will sleeve into a fury , but a transhuman will modify his self-image and remove any desire for romantic interaction so he 'll enjoy sleeving in some monstrously effective combat morph and get rid of all empathic sense so he can freely use terror tactics and enhanced interrogation techniques . <p> There 's also the part where " exhuman " is just , well , a word . It 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualifies . I mean , sure I 'm running several dozen somewhat-edited copies of myself on a quadrupedal sleeve that 's 75% grey matter by mass interlinked with a half-dozen quantum computers so that there 's little telling where " I " begin and the cybernetic/AI system I 've built around myself ends , with strongly atypical empathic response and with powerful enough predictive and analytical subminds that most people are incapable of saying something I do n't know that they 're going to say - but that does n't mean I 'm not human anymore , right ? ... right ? <p> In some cases , you 're going to have people comparing their political opponents to exhumans or implying that they 're exhuman ( just like we have people making Nazi analogies now ; the exhumans/TITANs are the big bogeyman of the post-Fall era ) . Depending on the situation , you might want to treat claims that someone is an exhuman about as seriously as you might a claim that someone is a witch . <p> " <p> This is n't a war ordinary humans can win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now . Nothing more . <p> to me most people living in the first world are already transhuman , if you took away the surgeries , the smartphones , cars , stores , etc would most of these be able to survive a more natural human environment ? truth is we have already integrated ourselves with technology to the point that its removal would cause serious concerns about many people 's survival . True transhumanity is a step beyond that , I have a mechanical device around my stomach that keeps my weight down , a mechanical answer to a biological problem . It is a perminant part of me and its safe to say I 'm no longer 100% biological . Am I transhuman ? <p> the jump from transhuman to exhuman is even more extreme , it means absolutely eliminating anything human about yourself .

In this scene posthumans would be transhumans that have advanced so far they are really a new kind of species , just as humans have abilities transcending what apes can comprehend .

Maybe the super-enhanced mind does n't act on those impulses very much , but it is part of the value system and way of interfacing with the world . A bit like how a smart and self-controlled human can still look at a sunset and feel an aesthetic pleasure , despite knowing everything about Rayleigh scattering and spending most evenings doing more important abstract work . <p> But exhumans sidestep this : they throw out parts of what makes us human . I think Baalbamoth assumes it has to be complete , but I suspect it is enough to edit or warp core systems enough to produce something that is not really human or even mammalian . Merely getting a bit of sociopathy and a hive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encompass AI-designed new emotions might do it ( " I am feeling 9843/49 right now . " ) I tried to make the Rortians in my gate war writeup like that : they had edited themselves to such an extent that they were more like bundles of skills than individuals . Exhumans have left the hominin-human-transhuman tree ( which I suspect uplifts and AIs are semi-members of ) . A lot of time it is just an empty accusation thrown at people doing radical enhancement or trying bizarre things , but some changes do change the core . The scary part might be that it is never entirely certain which ones are " safe " . <p> The Ultimates are different from the Exhumans in that they are trying to achieve a form of human apotheosis .

The receiver needs to observe a particle to know it is not being sent a signal . Now it could make the observations only occasionally and sped up observations when it is getting a signal but it does introduce a shelf life to the units . A century of inactivity is the same as an hour 's video . <p> Another idea for transferring more data occurred .

If the photons or whatever that interact with the superpositioned particles end up hitting cameras , storage media , conscious observers , or just flying off into deep space never to be seen by anyone , it is still observation . Do n't read too much into the Copenhagen interpretation . <p> but if any interaction with another particle ( or as withe the flying into deep space example , not interacting ) counts as an observation , how do you store a pair of quantum entangled particles without having them " observed " by the walls of the container they are in and thus breaking the entanglement . <p> As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science level insight ) , you have a property - say the spin - that you want to keep in a superposition , and then you manipulate the particles in ways that do n't affect the spin . <p> In any case , it does n't make an ounce of difference if you store the observation result or not , or if anyone finds out about . It is the most basic part of the measurement that matters , that initial interaction that " measures " the state . <p> Thinking about it in setting , would this interfere with sending qubit coms through the gates ? Running a wormhole through a wormhole seems like it would bork up the space-time continuum ... unless you 're a hyper advanced alien technology of course . <p> Technically ( and this is if you decide to go with the " gates are entanglement " and/or " gates are wormholes " theory(ies) , which you do n't have to ) , the QE comm is n't going through the gate , it 's going across interstellar space . So , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeper ship that took 4000 years to reach a place 4000+ light years away and then woke you up , you could talk to the people actually on the Mars of 4000 years later contemporary to you waking up ( presuming x-threats did n't take them up ) rather than people 8000 years in the future from when you left . Same deal with walking out of a gate : you 're on the planet now , and the invisible quantum wormhole sends the instantaneous information across the stars , not back through the gate . Well , not across the stars exactly , but in any event not back through the gate . <p> Well , to the best of my knowledge* , QE comms as described in Eclipse Phase should not work , so go with any interpretation you please . ( : <p> The two major issues with QE communications are as follows : 1 . You can not use entanglement to send meaningful information . When two particles are entangled , all that that means is that there is a relation between a particular feature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because that has been historically easier to manipulate and test than others ) . Usually this is an opposite relation--If one has spin +1 , the other has spin -1 . For now , they each exist as a superposition of those states . The first time one of them has its spin measured , both spins become fixed to particular states ( +1 or -1 ) and destroying the entanglement . The problem is that we ca n't change a state without measuring it , so if we wanted to set the particle we had to a +1 , whatever process we use will first measure it and destroy the entanglement , then change ours to a +1 or leave it as a +1 . But by the time we are making the change , there is no entanglement , so the other particle is still equally likely to be a +1 or a -1 . ( We know which it is , but the person on the other end observing it ca n't deduce anything from its state . ) <p> Note that this is n't a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of entangled particles , you measure them all and use that as a key for encrypting a single message . You send the message , the people with the paired set of particles realize they 've been sent a message , look at their particles , and have the key for decrypting the message . <p> 2 . You ca n't check your mail without burning the mailbox . Remember how as soon as one side measures a particle , the entanglement is destroyed ? That means that ( even if you could change the state of a particle without destroying the entanglement ) you could only read a message if you already knew it was there ( either through real-time communication or if you set up prescheduled times for message drops ) .

@@29835075 @3535075/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Cyberclaws <p> Okay , so , working on a little conundrum here , discussing with my players about Unarmed and two-weapon fighting in melee . Now personally , the rules to me always give the impression like you basically do n't get dual-wielding benefits in unarmed . Because that brings up a crazy rabbit hole of " well , are my elbows and knees extra weapons ? " . The section in the rules which says " Note that extra limbs do not count as extra weapons in unarmed combat " seems to agree . <p> So here comes a complexity , namely the Unarmed implant weapons . Cyberclaws in it 's text says " hand " , singular . So when you buy cyberclaws , do you install them in only one limb ? Do you need to pay for multiple limbs ? Can you gain extra weapon benefits from multiple cyberclaw sets ? <p> I tried to check on bioware Claws to see if that shed some insight , and the result is even more confusing . That is simply phrases as " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in all your manipulator limbs ? That seems kind of weird given the slight cost difference between the two options , Claws is everywhere but you have to specify where Cyberclaws goes . <p> So I decided to come to the forums and ask , see if maybe a dev could clarify RAI , or if anybody else has a more clear reading of the rules from somewhere . <p> I think cyberclaws are n't actually unarmed attacks . They 're pretty large ( being essentially a 6 " blade ) , and strictly speaking , are n't a body part . I do think they 're only installed in a single hand , but they are full blade weapons . <p> It 's kinda hard to say whether cyberclaws are under unarmed or blades . <p> Well , under the melee weapon table , they 're listed as Unarmed . And given how EP splits hairs on weapon mechanics , I can see the reasoning . It 's still fixed to your hand , so the mechanics of it are an extension of your body movement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) than say with a knife or flex cutter . <p> Just making them blades might be a way to just resolve this " overlap " problem , though . <p> I would find it silly if getting cyberclaws only gave you a weapon for only one arm . <p> From what I understand , weapons designed to be used as pairs or as sets ca n't benefit from multi-weapon fighting . They must be used as a single weapon . Unarmed attacks ( even with extra limbs ) , bioware claws , cyberclaws , and even densiplastic gloves count as such . EP Core Rulebook p. 206 covers fighting with 2 or more weapons . <p> There is something to be noted . It seems that cyberclaws function more like a wasp knife than other kinds of weapons . For its price , one could argue that it should be doing at least 2d10 damage ( like swords ) , but it instead delivers a payload with each attack . The wasp knife is a melee weapon that can deliver an extra payload like poison , nanotoxin , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can deliver electric shocks from eelware , or payloads from poison glands and implanted nanotoxins . I 'm suggesting that cyberclaws simply do n't work as the kind of weapon you think it should . <p> That said , I 'll keep tabs on this thread . I would like cyberclaws that dealt more damage . Whenever I look at them , I feel I rather grab a sword or two ( cheaper and does more damage ) . <p> The Hand Laser does use beam weapons , and there is no rule you ca n't weapon mount a melee weapon , as far as I know . But still , we seem to have come into a deep bog where the rules may or may not overlap without a lot of clarification .

I am Dr. Maxwell , aka " The Argonaut who can somehow only say 6 words a minute but can get your splicer fighting like a remade in a few hours . " <p> While I am not a Crow , I am currently attempting to gather as much information on Asyncs as possible . Due to the rarity of the infected , and their obvious need for secrecy , finding Watts-MacLeod subjects to interview outside of situations where we are dealing more pressing x-threats is rather difficult . As such I was wondering if any fellow field agents can share their experiences with asyncs , as well as their personal feelings on the controversy . <p> If relevant I am willing to give a positive ping on RNA , Circle-A , or CivicNet as appropriate . Otherwise I am willing to attempt to answer async related questions to the best of my ability . <p> Any accounts will be appreciated and will aid in improved methods of psychological treatment and identification of the infected , however accounts of peaceful contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question or compromising ongoing operations . <p> Generally speaking , no two asyncs are going to be alike . However , I can say that , to a man , woman , hermaphrodite , neuter , winter , or what-have-you , they have all had something , shall we politely say , " neurodiverse " about them ; or at least , they all did at one point . <p> That 's not to say they 're all violent raving psychopaths who write disturbing poetry about the beauty of slicing into flesh with blades . Very few of them are that . ( And , in fact , most people who are exactly that are perfectly uninfected . If for some reason you want to start an inquisition to remove individuals exhibiting signals of violent sociopathy , async scares are probably the best way to do it . ) <p> I 've seen some shennanigans , man .

I remember one who was convinced , absolutely convinced , that any kind of non-organic augmentations endangered the holistic integrity of her soul , but believed that having the augmentations Masked would alleviate this danger . Can you imagine trying to explain to a doc why you need a Masked mesh insert and cortical stack ? Strangely , they were absolutely fine in a synthmorph as long as it had a braincase , and the mesh inserts/cortical stack/braincase-to-brain interface were Masked . But if it was non-organic implanted or interfacing directly with organic , it had to be Masked . And no , that was n't a weird case where they had some offshoot of W-M that let them detect the augmentations somehow . They could n't ; sometimes we just outright lied about having Masked their standard/aftermarket augs , and they were absolutely fine until they saw evidence to the contrary . <p> Then , one day , she got her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old monomaniac fixation was completely gone ; she no longer even believes in souls . Now she 's a bog-standard nymphomaniac . <p> Others I 've seen , have apparently managed to recover from whatever made them " neurodiverse , " or at least , to appear to be neurotypical , even under examination by a skilled psychologist . <p> The problem is that as Shadow said , many asyncs learn to suppress their quirks to a level that they fit into the rest of Fall-damaged transhumanity . The stand-out stories are usually so deeply weird that they usually sound like making shit up . <p> My first interaction with a async was back in my combat wasp days . We got tasked with following a SLOTV carrying one biomorph from Iapetus out to Titan . Standard enough , everything we spot coming off that infected iceball gets an escort at least until it exits Saturnian space . This was eyes-on , stand-off , which meant active monitoring of the crew with internal cams , a sensor drone 100m away from the hull , and us following at 10km with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paranoid , but Iapetus . Fuck that place . <p> Anyway , a couple hours into the transfer the passenger starts talking to us . Not unusual behaviour for someone who expects to be watched ; everyone likes letting a voyeur know they know you are there . This guy though , he started talking to us by name . Which is odd when you and your code-siblings have n't decided on names beyond incrementing serial numbers yet . We asked our frigate what to do and got back a fleet-intelligence stamped data packet telling us this was not unexpected , and not to dust the guy for it . <p> The rest of the trip was uneventful , other than the passenger getting more and more comfortable talking to us . Well , at us , we did n't transmit back , though that did n't discourage him . He turned to whatever cameras we were using at the time , and was quite accurate in judging our interests ( admittedly , the number of interests a group of combat drone AGIs could possibly have is slim , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We were all rather sad to see him go when we got to Titan and the SLOTV landed at some research center .

Typically I only get a handful of clients , since I do n't publish my skills in the yellow papers , but when people ask I 'll provide the service .

As someone who is a psychosurgeon , I do n't want to cast too many aspersions on the process : it helps people a lot . However , it also leaves people in largely the same state as they were before the operation , and relapses and reversions to older states are common . <p> In Watts-Macleod infections , psychosurgery can be practically useless for rectifying disorders .

They broke away decades before the Fall from the hypercorps , suggesting that they are/were a major faction ( or they became that since they were predominantly in space and hence survived well ) . <p> I have this image in my head that the Argonauts are people who have looked at science , through the ages , and seen how long it 's been in the hands of governments and industries , both of which have used and misused it to their own ends . Then , as they looked at this , saw the world collapsing , old power groups splintering , and realized they had an opportunity . They saw a chance to slip the leash , and they took it . <p> Technology finally allows for independent living , free from all others , and , with it , independent science . The Argonauts are members of that tradition extending back to men like Darwin or Huygens , who explored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . They are Open Source scientists . <p> Argonauts are frontier scientists , who combine in equal parts derring-do and scientific rigor . They perform experiments without boundries for concerns like profit or fear of losing their position ( though they may be cautious to avoid losing Rep on touchy subjects ) . Every Argonaut can and must be as comfortable in the lab as they are in the field . <p> An Argonaut is the guy who , when you face charging xenofauna , leaps from behind , declares that he is about to perform science , and then wrestles the beast to the ground , implants it with a tracking chip , and sends it on its way . An Argonaut is the woman who decides to test the limits to current gen self-replicating nanotech by finding a moonlet and grey-gooing it .

Just as today in the real world we are seeing the old left getting ossified and some signs that a left 2.0 ( think Boing Boing , fabbing , whuffie , infosocialism etc - basically the stuff the EP autonomists are built from ) is emerging , in BF 40 the Argonauts are the parents to the autonomists . <p> The early space colonists had to be independent , extremely educated and skilled , and able to operate without direct oversight . They were naturally culturally tied into the intellectual networks on Earth , although at a distance . During this era ( BF 50 or so ) there was increasing resistance to the emerging megacorps and the political systems on Earth , plus a strong emphasis on science and engineering ( everything from space to fusion to AI to implants ) . This meant that the sciences were an area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were too valuable to oppress ( besides , oppressed minds are uncreative and lazy minds ) . A bit like scientists in the Soviet Union . <p> Then came the revolutions and unrest of BF 40 . Governments began to fall , outposts began to declare independence . Here clearly the argonauts took side and actually became a movement , and not just some grumbling among the back room boys : <p> EP p. 33 wrote : <p> Even numerous scientists and engineers , who had previously worked as pawns in corporate expansions , adopted a technoprogressive stance . That 's how the argonauts were born , you know , taking their name from a previous group of scientists who advised the US government and Pentagon on science and policy called the Jasons . Faced with reprisals from their corporate masters , a number of argonauts defected from the hypercorps , in some cases taking key resources and research with them , while others went underground . <p> Now , that was 40 years ago . So in EP , the Argonauts are very much the 1968 rebels - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since turned into an establishment of their own . I can imagine that many of the initially argonaut habitats have long since become other kinds of factions . Some evolved into/were taken over by other autonomist groups , others regularized into normal habitats . The remaining ' pure ' argonauts are a bit like the Third Socialist International - an alliance of fractious and increasingly oldfashioned groups with some common agendas . Maybe there is an inner circle and medeans keeping habitats in line , maybe that is just an old anti-argonaut conspiracy theory from the 40 's . <p> Axel 's description is what the Argonauts want to be . A myth just like the fair-minded prole of socialism or the enlightened and compassionate bureaucrat of social democracy . And just like the others there exist a few . There are indeed some badasses in labcoats , despite the average Gerlach inhabitant being more of a ditch-digger of data , tiredly trying to make sense of epidemological surveys from his office or trying to get the APIs for egocasting to work with yet another broken data format . Doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review board must get the paperwork , otherwise you wo n't get the grants for your rent . No wonder there is a long queue for gatecrashing . Even dying on an alien planet is better than yet another work safety course on self-replicating devices . <p> My point is that the argonauts are a bit of an ideology ( the social democracy to the autonomists ' socialism , say ) , a social system ( I would imagine a " lightweight " government like in much academia - there might be plenty of administration , but it largely stays out of everyday life , dominating other crucial areas ) and a social movement ( imagine the current Arab spring , 40 years old ) . <p> It is interesting to consider what the possibly mythical " inner circle " and medeans are up to . They have been around longer than project Ozma and Firewall . They are able to hide an entire habitat ... or convince the whole system that they have done it . <p> In fact , considering the description of how Ozma formed it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which suggests the intriguing possibility that the Argonauts at the highest level are in on whatever conspiracy Ozma is doing . <p> Similarly the background of Firewall seems to fit with it partially coming from activities ( like the Singularity Foundation ) that were within the stream of the argonauts . Perhaps not argonaut-run , but argonaut-affiliated . Firewall might even originally have been a runaway faction of the argonauts . <p> And , if you want to be really paranoid ( or just have an anti-argonaut theory ) , maybe their breakaway in BF 40 was done in concert with the hypercorps . That revolution cascade gave the previous generation of hypercorps their chance . What if some of the hypercorp people helped the argonauts break free , knowing this would undermine the governments and megacorps holding the world back ? A bit of revolution in the outer parts of the system would tie up the space megacorps just at the time when the emerging hypercorps needed to get a firm grip on the inner system . The alliance might not have lasted , but some gerontocrats and senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it , the BF 40 revolution was a kind of rehearsal for the Fall . While the Fall was much worse , the ideas of how to break free from a crashing Earth , the challenges for newly independent habitats and hypercorps , even some of the faction-building had been demonstrated by the previous generation . I bet the Titanian Commonwealth patterned themselves on the original argonauts ( with , in their opinion , improvements ) . Just as Direct Action may have done . <p> I do admit , I like the Argonauts having splintered a bit at their core , but I imagine the face of the organization is fairly unified . I also imagine Argonauts found outside of central research labs , such as Argonaut habs and various universities , are more the type who fit the badass-in-a-labcoat stereotype ; they 're the ones who reject the stifling bureaucracy that inevitably forms as organizations grow fat and complacent . <p> The Argonauts as a whole are a large alliance of academics , all of whom have to be at least a little self-interested and desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're not all angels . While they all most definitely have an interest in science , anyone who 's been remotely close to academia knows how utterly vicious it can be ( especially in things like psychology , ugh ) . <p> Most of an Argonaut 's life is either spent , therefore , in one of three places : <p> 1 .

These types work normal academic jobs and are to Argonauts what someone who reads a newspaper and votes in favour of Barsoomian causes is to the Barsoomians : Sympathetic but likely seen as a poseur by insiders . <p> 2 . They 're an insider . These types spend their lives at Argonaut outposts , be they on a planet or in space , doing research or otherwise contributing to the cause . If they 're high up the chain , they 'll be opinionated and detatched from the system at large because they 've been insulated for likely decades within Argonaut compounds . If they 're lower down , they 're likely in it to try and break free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had , or else they 're likely rather unknown , apathetic , or disillusioned . <p> 3 . They 're on the road . They saw the academic climate , said " Fuck that noise " , but did n't separate themselves entirely . They 've gone off to do their own experiments , perhaps only coming back to get funding ( if they 've not secured it on their own or are independent ) , or to present their findings in their latest experiments . <p> It 's also important to remember that Argonauts are not just researchers but technologists and part of a huge underground open source movement , which means that for every Argonaut spending time in a lab and carefully testing drug doses on simulated neurons , there 's one ( likely far more ) developing new technology from the findings , distributing propaganda , subverting security nets , spamming open source blueprints , or pursuing similar activities . <p> In many ways , I can see the Argonauts as almost comically inept in organization , now that I think about it ... <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Alpha Centauri. : - ) <p> I think the real problem is that the argonauts went from being a movement to becoming societies - somebody has the clean the floors , update software and recycle the garbage . Sure , if you do n't like the environment you can always migrate , and doing support jobs at Gerlach may pay your bills . But there is still the problem of holding together a community in a tincan surrounded by vacuum . <p> I suspect that the incompetence at organization is not complete , since then they would not have lasted for 40-50 years ( but quite a lot of habitats might be ex-argonauts that got reorganized in new ways by other fractions ) . Rather , it is chaotic enough to give them some resilience . Formal attacks can be dodged simply by ignoring them or forking the administration ( " Sir , we did take over Journal of Open Nanomanufacturing , but now the editorial board has quit and started The Open Nanomanufacturing Journal ! " ) . Yet this mess has some patterns of organisation that allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It ca n't just be ideological zeal ( does n't last long when debating whose turn it is to clean the coolant manifolds ) or reputation economics ( the argonauts were likely early adopters and innovators , but when they got started the rep system was likely nonexistent ) . <p> Now , that was 40 years ago . So in EP , the Argonauts are very much the 1968 rebels - the successful rebels of a previous generation , now long since turned into an establishment of their own . I can imagine that many of the initially argonaut habitats have long since become other kinds of factions . Some evolved into/were taken over by other autonomist groups , others regularized into normal habitats . The remaining ' pure ' argonauts are a bit like the Third Socialist International - an alliance of fractious and increasingly oldfashioned groups with some common agendas . Maybe there is an inner circle and medeans keeping habitats in line , maybe that is just an old anti-argonaut conspiracy theory from the 40 's . <p> This is roughly how I see the Argonauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a loose organization of idealist factions , possibly influenced or loosely held in line by a powerful inner circle .

They do n't have to be something physically off putting to be alien , it 's more how they think . <p> Imagine a species born with three arms and no eyes , their value system would be entirely different than ours . For one thing , they would not associate the dark with evil .

Most everything it seems I can do with medical skills appear to be covered by medichines . In fact the only real things I can think of are implant surgery and repairing mental stress ( which is more psychology ) . Is there any real point , gameplaywise , to having skills like Medicine : Paramedic and Medicine : Trauma Surgeon ( which I assume are the two main " lifesaving " skills ) , or is it basically blowing points on a background ? <p> I recall asking for a book that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gaps and stuff .

I 'm not sure if they have done anything with it yet ( they are not a large company so they ca n't write books fast ) . I think that a number of special traits and skill traits that were cut from the Transhuman book will make it into the skill book ( there were problems trying to include those skill tricks and stuff ) . <p> I 'd recommend focusing more on nanomedicine . Firstly , you can still use med kits and optimize medichines , so you can play the paramedic role ( although perhaps not as much as a dedicated healer ) . But you also get to be more useful in investigations , which frequently rely on swarms , medicine , or some combination of the two . Toss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacker . <p> Well , I 'm wondering more about how to make a doctor 's skills useful rather than how to make the character useful . He had good scores in various social skills like persuasion , kinesics , and deception so he worked well as the party 's diplomat and de facto leader . He was also scary good at combat , I gave him a 60 in kinetics so he would be of use in a fight ... and promptly discovered that a scurrier with 4 light pistols and taking Ambidexterity 3 times can quickly create a wall of bullets . I may lower his kinetics skill next time . <p> Anyway , looking over everything again , as well as the thread , I 'm wondering if perhaps my best option is to work with the DM so I have more opportunities to use my skills on NPCs : Treating survivors of an attack and such , folks who are n't lucky enough to be PCs and may not be able to get medichines . <p> Anything an instantiated medic can do , 250 credits worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be better spent air-mailing hot lead at your enemies . <p> The only real use for a Medicine skill in a firefight is so you can pop stacks quickly and efficiently .

Otherwise , you can just throw someone 's severed head into a healing vat and if they had medichines to keep their brain from dying , they 'll regrow . <p> They 'll regrow faster if there 's someone with a relevant medical skill greater than 40 ( the limit for dumb AIs , as would be included in the vat , ) to man the device , but they 'll still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't seem to have a problem .

" <p> Yeah , I kinda figured the skill would n't be useful during combat , but when I originally made him I anticipated needing to patch up my crew between fights . <p> Anyway , I have a few more rules questions , and figured I 'd ask them here instead of making a new thread . <p> 1 : I 've made my character under the assumption that it 's unusual for scurriers to wear clothes ( based on the pic in Gatecrashing ) , and as such having to find alternative ways to deal with armor and carrying capacity .

What if a uplift or a pod with alien biochemistry takes it ? Are they sculpted and scented to appeal to humans ? Or should that be changed to " Bonuses do n't apply outside of your own kind ? " <p> 1 . Scurriers are going to be pretty unusual anyways . So feel free to wear clothes if you want , I think that would probably be a matter of personal preference ( Depending on where you are of course ) . <p> 2 . Appearance will probably affect you iff you have a human ego . ( Human tailored ) pheromones are not going to affect you if you have alien biochemistry .

If there are fewer of them or there is a cost associated with there use Medicine could be a way to save credits/rep . Also a good way to build rep might be to act as emergency medtech after a disaster , when healing vats are at full capacity a physician could be very desirable so people do n't die and have to replace their now bodies or get a case , etc.

They usually know its not perfect , but for the majority of decision-making humans in the western world , the system works . There is no need to change it . Thinking about alternate social structures is hard , and any change would be enormously destructive to peoples quality of life , at least in the short term . So moderate people are unlikely to support AnCap , and they massively outnumber everyone else . <p> On the other hand , the people who spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't fit into modern society , are the losers in the game of capitalism ( a game which really is rigged by the winners ) , or are those with an academic interest in hypothetical systems . The first two of these groups are not likely to view and debate the issue dispassionately , and the third 's members will often play devils advocate in arguments for interest 's sake alone . <p> In short , fringe attracts fringe ; AnCap is unpopular to the masses , and unfortunately the people it may attract were ostracized from other circles for reasons other than their political views . <p> The thing one needs to know about anarcho capitalism is that when you give the government the ability to regulate business . what rapidly happens is those businesses will buy regulations that benefit them and harm their competition . and over time big business starts squeezing out the smaller businesses with regulations they ca n't afford . <p> An anarcho capitalist believes in voluntary transactions between individuals . IE they believe an employee and a employer are capable of coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a business . They also understand that a Business that screws over their customers wo n't be around long . As people talk about it . <p> Yes . Most anarcho-capitalists are heavily into sousveillance ; people who do bad business wo n't be loved forever . I mean , I have my own list of companies I wo n't do business with ( for instance , too much reliance on Chinese manufacturing with dubious ethical standards or simply being politically over-involved in causes I do n't support ) , but even then , there 's just not that many companies willing to risk things by stirring the pot or doing things that the average person would find distasteful . <p> Main reason why AnCaps seem to be full of crazies is because it 's a self-contradictory ideology . Anarchism is anti-authoritarian socialism with no private possession of goods other than those you make . On the other hand there 's capitalism . Trying to mix these concepts requires crazy people lol <p> Rules without enforcement are meaningless . And without rules , there 's no rule that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and start a dictatorship . Anarchy is inherently unstable and left to its own devices , quickly decays into tyranny . <p> Refusal to acknowledge that reality is a common thread among anarchists in general . <p> Government establishes and enforces rules . Rules , when followed , create trust . Trust is the grease that keeps the gears of capitalism turning . The goal for a maximally capitalist society should not be anarchy , then , but lean government : just enough government to enforce rules and create trust , but not so much that it suffocates the market . <p> Western style democracies usually fall vaguely within that band most of the time , at least close enough to be functional . Which is why they have done so well thus far . The functional band is pretty wide , with plenty of room for people to argue about where the ideal lies within it . <p> If anarchists do not advocate a complete absence of government , then what , in your opinion , is anarchy ? <p> If anarcho-capitalists do not actually advocate anarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , regardless of what economic model you try to attach to it , is inherently unstable and disfunctional . It quickly collapses into tribalism and dictatorship . <p> And of course , if nobody actually advocates anarchy then it is best to not muddy the waters by throwing around the anarchist label . Because that would mean that anarcho-capitalists , or anarchists in general , simply do n't exist . <p> Anarchism is anti-authoritarian socialism with no private possession of goods other than those you make . On the other hand there 's capitalism . Trying to mix these concepts requires crazy people lol <p> Anarchism is not solely socialist ; most " anarchists " do fall under that creed , but it 's not integral : the philosophical anarchism of Tolstoy and the non-left wings of anarchism do not necessarily fall under that . <p> Keep in mind that there are really two anarchist assertions : <p> 1 . Government is illegitimate , inefficient , or incapable of creating greater moral/ethical progress than the lack of government . 2 . Individuals operating with various degrees of cooperation or isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : <p> Anarchy , regardless of what economic model you try to attach to it , is inherently unstable and disfunctional . It quickly collapses into tribalism and dictatorship . <p> Not necessarily . Such has been the case throughout history , but keep in mind that there have been few philosophical anarchy movements throughout history . Most large-scale anarchism comes from the fall of an existing government or regional power , and does n't reflect an ideal of the citizens of that area , but rather a lack of power , creating a vacuum . <p> Anarchism is also less unstable than people give it credit for : we live most of our lives in situations where there is no authority present , but joint social , moral , and ethical codes keep us from getting into any real trouble . Sure there 's the power of a government , but the fact remains that knowing that someone 's got weapons ( I live in a region where open carrying firearms is legal , even though I do n't myself ) or has the potential to cause serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies for predators to prey on each other . <p> Anarcho-capitalist societies in Eclipse Phase rely on transhumanism and the digital age as stability enforcers : nothing goes unnoticed , and you ca n't be sure that causing harm to someone does n't end in a trip to the resleeving joint . Throughout history small societies have functioned under anarchic principles , even if they have n't adhered to the theories of anarchy , due to pressing needs and mutual respect between individuals . <p> Likewise , there seems to be a common trend in thought that anarchists simply do n't care about society , because having centralized structures is the only way to do so . I would argue that this is not necessarily true , either in the slimy lawyery layers of Extropia , or in less sleazy societies where voluntary groups govern behavior codes . Most importantly , however , anarchism does n't necessarily mean that nobody is able to enforce judgements , it just means that the people who do so are not protected under an umbrella of protection . For instance , soldiers receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that comes from codified rules . However , even in an anarchic society , nobody 's gon na say " You shot an invader ! That 's murder ! " ( well , maybe in some left/pacifist , but not traditional @-cap circles ) . <p> The thing about power in an anarchic society is that it rests in the hands of those who seize it , but those who abuse it suffer retribution . Tribalism is a sort of side effect , but does n't necessarily actually sacrifice anarchic principles : anarchic societies trend toward the xenophobic because outsiders can capitalize on the lack of centralized structures . Reputation economies are how this is dealt with in EP ; having good @-rep is basically " This dude wo n't cause problems " , but from a large crowd of witnesses . <p> As far as despotism as a natural consequence of anarchy , I think that it depends on the extent to which a society is monolithic versus fractured . For instance , the Ultimates are themselves a quasi-anarchic movement : even though they have a tier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them being the following orders and dropping titles to coerce each other . Rather , they 're strictly meritocratic , which is not @-cap , but when you consider the fact that they do not have enforced centralized proscriptions and are rather unified by dogma and creed , there 's elements of anarchic societies in there . <p> @-cap societies in Eclipse Phase rely on the fact that they 're made up of @-capitalists . If you 're not @-cap , you are n't " welcome " in the sense that you can never really be a member of society ; you might physically reside there , but you 're not going to get the @-rep or the social influence to exert any influence except through force . In EP , where most fringe groups live on space stations , you ca n't really force an @-cap society under your control : the collateral damage of space station combat means that any military force is marginal , and @-affiliated groups tend to be resistant to memetic attacks from outside ( though not necessarily from within @-groups , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do more with the various flavors of @-affiliation than pro/anti-@ rhetoric . 
@@29835098 @3535098/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Disassemblers <p> I was wondering . If a person has carrier bullets that can hold disassembler nanoswarm and they shoot someone . What is the damage ? It does n't seem right that they will instantly disintegrate their target . <p> It would do disassembler damage , assuming you could pack enough into a bullet . They are n't a poison , they function as a swarm . Disassemblers do n't instantly break things down , it takes time . A disassembler swarm used in combat deals 1d10/2 damage per round . <p> OK . That sounds good . A tiny bit in a hollowed out bullet ca n't destroy more than a bullet sized hole to begin with . Got a page number for the damage they would do ? And for how long ? What sort of defence would a being have despite scraping it off with a butter knife ? <p> " A tiny bit in a hollowed out bullet ca n't destroy more than a bullet sized hole to begin with ... " <p> How do you figure that ? Sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're still going to end up in a world of pain if the disassembler nanites have been programmed to consume organic material as well . Likely though not at a 1d10/2 per round though . <p> The rules are not very clear on inventive applications of nanoswarms and nanoware . You 're going to have to make a lot of this stuff up if you want to be creative . <p> We do n't know how long nanoswarms last for , how big nanoswarms are , how long it takes to produce a nanoswarm , etc . If we had more information , we could come up with better estimates . <p> Edit : However , I imagine that a transhuman nanoswarm delivered by a bullet would be less effective than a Titan nanoswarm . <p> Edit 2 : Found some of the information I was looking for . I thought there was less information available than there actually was . See pages ( core rulebook , p. 328 ) for nanoswarms , and ( core rulebook , p. 341 ) for the buzzer spray weapon ( it shoots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big a swarm would be if they clumped together as a ball . <p> The bio-defense swarm ( gatecrashers , p. 157 ) is used by gate crashers to purge an 10 meter radius area of alien mater . If an alien creature were to walk into the area , it will inflict 1d10 / 2 damage per turn . It lasts 2 weeks without a hive . This swarm can also destroy armor , inflicting its damage until it gets through , at which point it starts damaging the host . <p> The buzzer ( core rulebook , p. 341 ) is a gun that is equipped with a specialized nanoswarm hive . It will literally shoot a nanoswarm at a target as a spray weapon . It can produce 1 swarm per hour . <p> Reading ( core rulebook , p. 328 ) provides some of the information I thought was missing . I still would like to know how much room a compacted swarm ( if they were to clump together like a ball ) would occupy . <p> Simple physics argument : a disassembler swarm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molecules ) that uses its own stored chemical energy to break down chemical bonds . The swarm stores energy in some chemical form ( whether nanotech springs or high energy molecular bonds - carbon nanotube springs can store 7.2 MJ per kg , fat 37 MJ/kg , gasoline 47.2 MJ/kg - the later two requires oxygen to react ) . This is means that unless the swarm can refill energy or is very selective in what it can break down it will not be able to break down a much larger mass of matter than itself . <p> So the bullet might take a few grams of armour and body with it , but it will not disintegrate a kilogram chunk . <p> Note that this is a disassembler swarm made to disassemble anything . Suppose you instead just want to disassemble protein . Then you will hydrolyse peptide bonds , which in theory should net you some 8 " 16 kilojoule/mol , but most likely you will need to supply some energy to mince them up ( and move around , identify proteins etc ) . Let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tropo-collagen ) has a molecular weight of around 300,000 , so 1 kg contains 2e21 proteins , each with about 1000 amino acids . So the energy to dissolve one kg of protein will be 333 kJ . A 70 kg body is 67% water , and 75% of the dry weight is protein = 35 kg . So to liquefy a person you need around 12 MJ. ( that energy will of course end up as heat - a rapid disassembler will also tend to boil you ) <p> Assuming a 40 MJ/kg nanofuel in the disassembler swarm , this gives 1 g of protein disassembler bullet ( 40 kJ ) the ability to munch up 120 gram of protein . Or , assuming the above dry weight thing , about 266 g of body . Ouch . That is a decent chunk . Still not total disintegration , but given that the disassemblers will no doubt be carried around in the bloodstream and poke holes in lots of places ( in the heart , in the liver , in the brain ... ) it is a nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how I would handle it ruleswise : the nanoswarm subtracts its DUR from the victim 's DUR until it runs out . Say 1d10 points per round or so . Processes that remove it - nanodefenses , bleeding , cutting off infected limbs , can reduce the swarm DUR before it does more damage . Fast nanoswarms might do more damage per round but have less overall DUR for damage purposes ( since they tend to cauterize their environment ) , while slow and insidious nanoswarms may be slower but have larger DUR ( since they only break down particular choice molecules , like DNA or ribosomes ) .

A series of antimatter detonations blasting a projectile at the target at absurdly high speed . It might exist some voodotech allowing railgunlike launches , but I am sceptical ( still , consider the launch near the start of Dan Simmons ' Illium and the three words " Io flux tube " ) <p> The damage will be equal to the kinetic energy of the projectile ; for 86% lightspeed this is exactly twice the energy embodied in the matter of the projectile . For 99% is is 6 times the mass-energy . The result is of course a big , nuclear boom that will tend to penetrate a fairly long distance into the target . It will be like a shaped nuclear explosion , probably good at disintegrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crust is pretty thick , so I doubt it will penetrate to any magma unless it hits smack in a vulnerable spot in Hellas ) . <p> Firing the weapon will require *more* energy than the projectile booms with . The big benefit is that it is hard to see coming . Unfortunately EP has QE comms , which means that sensors can detect the firing ( if they are looking ) and report back long before the projectile arrives - but an unexpected attack will be unexpected and impossible to shield . And if you get ( say ) 8 minutes of warning ( 1 AU ) there might still not be enough time to escape a habitat except as an egocast . <p> If my maths is right the energy required to accelerate a 1 kg projectile to 0.5 c is roughly 12.97 petajoules . You could get that from about 144 g of antimatter , assuming a loss of 50% energy during the reaction because of conversion to neutrinos . <p> The energy released on impact would be 11.23 pJ , roughly the equivalent of a 2.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tsar , the largest bomb ever detonated was 50 mt ) . <p> A 10 kg projectile would require 129.72 pJ of energy , needing 1.44 kg of antimatter . It would be the equivalent of detonating a 26.8 mt bomb on the target . <p> Your main problem would be achieving the acceleration required in a short period of time . You would need an asteroid more than 5 km in diameter ( anything less and your projectile has to exceed the speed of light in barrel when the gun is fired ) and the object would be subject to massive forces . Assuming you used a 20 km asteroid the force experienced by the projectile would be about 764,000 g 's as it raced up the barrel at 7,495 km/s . <p> Well , a 3000 km barrel would result in an acceleration of " only " 49.96 km/s , which is 5093 g 's . <p> One thing to bear in mind is how obvious this weapon would be . Everyone would know it had been fired and , since the projectile would only be half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be possible to intercept it . At 0.5 c it would cover 1 AU in about 16 minutes 40 seconds ( Jupiter to Mars is 3.7 AU , for example , so travel time would be about 62 minutes with 30 minutes of warning before impact ) . <p> One thing to bear in mind is how obvious this weapon would be . Everyone would know it had been fired and , since the projectile would only be half way to the target when it 's activation was detected it might be possible to intercept it . <p> This is why it is likely better to have a faster projectile , besides the extra damage ( it goes *way* up as you approach c ) . Also , the impact gets more focused - the initial fireball will at most spread out 45 degrees from the trajectory when it hits , putting all the energy into a 35% tighter solid angle . <p> But QE sensors are a good defense . If the major powers spread out tiny sensor stations looking for *big* neutrino bursts and moons/asteroids suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . Except that detecting where the weapon is aimed may be hard . <p> Intercepting a small , near c projectile is tough . It is enough to hit it with a few grains of sand to blow it up , but you need to get them in place ( preferably far away from you , since the boom will still be moving towards you at near-lightspeed - it needs time to dissipate ) . Lasers will not have much time to heat the target and have limited range , so it has to be a projectile . So if you do n't have *very* exact telemetry and some long-distance railguns near the trajectory you have little chance of stopping it . <p> In fact , the grains of sand shows a problem for RKKS : the projectile might blow up by hitting interplanetary dust if it is unlucky . My solution would be to launch a sequence of projectiles , or rather have the projectile split into a train of smaller bullets in flight . The first might get hit by something and blow up , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . And when they hit the target , they will each strike into the cavity made by the previous one , adding to the penetration ability . <p> Overall , RKKS is good for penetrating extremely hard targets by surprise . It is not the most energy efficient method : you are going to waste most of your antimatter in accelerating the projectile . If you can just wipe out the target by dumping lots of antimatter on it , go for it . But as a deadly first strike it is pretty good : this is what I would build and aim at Progress if I were a PC-unfriendly power . <p> I forsee an Exhuman attack with one of these . A Pandora Gate seems like a wonderful way to aim a RKV from another system , and if the installation of the receiving end is the target , then the only warning they get is the Gate hack attempt . <p> A Pandora Gate seems like a wonderful way to aim a RKV from another system , and if the installation of the receiving end is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gate hack attempt . <p> That 's going to be cutting it mighty close if you want the Gate hack to be successful just at the right moment . I 'm not saying it wo n't work but hack true and aim straight . It would be a good way to scrape the Ultimates from the Discord gate however . <p> " Sir we have a gate hack in progress . " " Probably those damned exhumans testing our defences again . Ready the reserves . " <p> The gate opens long enough to send through the RKD everything is destroyed including the gate itself that begins to immediately reform . Once the Exhumans can make contact again they stem through and control both sides of the gate . <p> ... preferably far away from you , since the boom will still be moving towards you at near-lightspeed - it needs time to dissipate . <p> And the faster the projectile , the further away it needs to be . Time dilation is a cruel thing . An explosion that lasts for 10s in the frame of reference of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reference of the victim at 0.95c . <p> At 0.5c , a 10.00s explosion lasts 11.55s . That 's an extra 1.55s travelling at 0.5c . That 's an extra 232,339,155m or 232 Thousand km . In the books , most polities are labeled as monitoring space very closely out to 500k km . <p> Basically , the only defense against an RKV is a sandblaster that accelerates particulate matter @ relativistic velocities . <p> Here 's the formula , just plug in any number you like that 's less than 1 , greater than 0 where X is ( that 's for fractions of c ) and substitute any amount of time where Y is : <p> Formula for Relativistic Time Dilation wrote : <p> Y/ ( 1- . X2 ) ( 1/2 ) <p> To solve it , just toss it in a Google search bar or use Wolfram Alpha . <p> While RKDs through gates make a very cool weapon , I wonder why those exhumans do n't just dump a large amount of antimatter through it ? <p> With the RKV , I guess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a Gate is supposed to be open for a window of time . Sure , you are threading a needle at relativistic speeds across enormous distances , and it would take years to get set up for a shot , but their sensors would n't really have time to close the gate between when the first warning comes in and oblivion happens .

The infected creature gains an insight into human brain function and psychology that further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple more victims since the initial infection , the creature gains enough insight into the human brain that it can even form basilisk hacks with its chromatophores , leading to more panic from the gatecrasher teams as the biomorphs are either picked off and eaten or go insane from the hacks while the egos in synths are pushed to the brink of insanity by the tactics of the infected alien . In terms of understanding , the infected alien does n't have much more understanding of human psychology or neuroscience beyond it being another way for it to get food . I suppose there is also the possibility that the infected creature becomes so different from the other members of its species that it is later seen as a sort of outcast or monster , but that seems like a difficult route of thought to go down because of how different the species 's psychology and primitive society is bound to be . 
@@29835103 @3535103/ <p> " Some augmentations ( multiple personalities , multitasking , mental speed ) provide a character with extra mental actions each Action Phase .

What makes the Grimoire such a good addition to the Wizard module ? The Wizards only real gimmick seems to be Mental Speed and 2 aptitude bonuses . The Grimoire comes with Electrical Sense , Skinlink ... good for repair tasks and hacking .. but more importantly : Multitasking and ..... a Ghostrider Module ? Is this maybe a hint ? <p> Well , first of all the problem is that this is n't as simple as there being just a Ghostrider . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of 2 Cyberbrains , 2 Basic Mesh Inserts and then the Ghostrider on top , potentially allowing it to house 5 active Egos , and 2 more backed up ones in stacks . Furthermore , unless an Ego is occupying the Grimoire 's cyberbrain , it would be slaved to the Wizard 's cyberbrain ( or vice versa , depending on where the Operator Ego resides ) , and generally any mental or sensory aug anywhere in the combined Flexbot is usable by the Operator . Here 's the thing though ... due to the Ghostrider the Grimoire has space for 3 Egos ... and Multitasking spawns 2 forks . Is this meant as a hint that this module is supposed to take the brunt of stress required in using Multitasking , but since it fills slaved cyberbrains with forks that are under the control of the Operator ( who himself is benefitting from Mental Speed ) he can effectively operate at +4 Mental Speed ? <p> Of course you can just spawn forks the regular way and sort of control them , but this is n't about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 holds , since it pretty blatantly says +2 Mental Actions is it , period , and seems like an overriding rule , but it just bugs me that the Grimoire is stated as a great addition to the Wizard if that 's the case , so I guess my question is .... is that line maybe an errata or something similar , or meant in some other way and I 'm just not seeing the great synergy those two modules are supposed to have , and what do other people think about this , who 've possibly had to handle it in their own game ? <p> Flexbots are really fun to build , but really really weird and complicated at times I guess . <p> Your right , the +2 mental actions is a hard limit , and a bit of a load baring rule .

The result is someone with COG 30 or with COG 35 ? In other words , is a morph 's aptitude limit applied before or after the aptitude bonus , if any ? <p> I had always thought the limit would be applied *after* the bonus , so the answer would be COG 30 . But the Psychosurgeon from the NPC pack , with COG 35 in a Menton , got me thinking that I may have been wrong all along . Sure , perhaps that Menton has the Exceptional COG trait , or perhaps it 's just a typo ... <p> You know , I always thought it was after , but reading through the character generation rules it does seem to suggest that it might be before . It has you buy your Aptitudes , then your Morph , and in the Morph entry it says that all bonuses provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hmm ... that makes it very much easier to get a COG of 40 than I had first thought . Of course it also does n't  explain why a Reaper has an Aptitude Maximum of 40 when the book specifically says that no Aptitude may go above natural 30 . That seems to suggest that you buy your Aptitudes , the bonuses are applied and then the limits are put in place . <p> I think this requires a game dev to clear up . Its either a very small error in the NPC files or I have been generating my characters all wrong . <p> Hmm ... that makes it very much easier to get a Cog of 40 than I had first thought . Of course it also does n't  explain why a Reaper has an Aptitude Bonus of 40 when the book specifically says that no Aptitude may go above natural 30 . <p> Uh ? The highest Aptitude bonus I see in a Reaper is +20 for REF ( including the +10 from Reflex Boosters ) . <p> By the way , I also re-read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really convinced that a ) the phrasing does suggest that the limits apply only to the unmodified ego , that b ) the assumption tends to make number crunching slightly easier and that c ) the assumption is also more " natural " in that it allows you to treat the morph " intrinsic " modifications just as if they were standard implants/biomods rather than something conceptually different ( which they really are n't from my point of view ) . <p> But yes , this completely changes the way I have thought about morphs so far . I really wish a developer would clarify this ( and ideally add the clarification to the errata ) . <p> Hmm ... that makes it very much easier to get a Cog of 40 than I had first thought .

There 's the Exceptional Aptitude ( Ego ) trait that allows you to go all the way up to 40 in one aptitude . <p> Hello all , this is my first post here , the first time i read the book , i had the same problem with the aptitude maximum ; i do n't  remember exactly where i read it , but i think the aptitudes maximuns work this way : <p> Your maximum is give by the morph , 30 for example , that 's the maximun bonus your ego can have in that morph without implants or another morph bonuses . <p> Then is the absolute limit of 40 , no one can have an aptitude over 40 , and you can reach it with morphs bonuses , even if the morph maximum is 30 . <p> For example , i have fury morph , with maximum aptitude of 30 , then my ego can have a 30 in SOM for example , but the morph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that morph I-ll have a 40 in SOM . <p> Another example , I-m an ultimate in a reamde morph , my aptitude maximun is 40 , so i expend alot of point and get a 40 in COO , even is the morph gives me a bonus its not going to count , the absolute maximum is 40 . But anyways , is later i must resleeve in a splicer morph , without COO bonuses , my COO will be 30 , due that the morph just have a 30 of maximum aptitude . <p> Then is it the case i have purchased that merit that increase my aptitude maximum to 40 , in that case I undertand that don-t matter in wich morph I-m sleeved , my aptitude could always be a " natural " 40 . <p> It 's interesting how such , supposedly simple matter , can get very complex quickly . I also would like a clear statement from development , but my interpretation is as follows : <p> p. 124 " Every morph has an aptitude maximum , sometimes modified by traits . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that aptitude while inhabiting that morph , reflecting an inherent limitation in some morphs . " <p> " Some implants , gear , psi , and other factors may modify a character 's natural aptitudes . These augmented values may exceed a morph 's aptitude maximums , as they represent external factors boosting the morph 's ability . No aptitude , however , augmented or not , may ever exceed a value of 40 . " <p> p. 135 " Each aptitude must be given at least 5 points ( unless you take the Feeble trait , see p. 149 ) , and no aptitude may be raised higher than 30 ( unless you take the Exceptional Aptitude trait , p. 146 ) . " <p> These are the three key points as i see it . 30 is the limit for you ego alone , if you do n't take Exceptional aptitude . 40 is the absolute ever limit , where there 's no way beyond . <p> It may be nitpicking , but " highest value at which the character may use that aptitude " seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 35 , but he is only able to utilize 30 because the brain of the morph is just not fit enough to extend beyond that . <p> It 's clearly said that reflex boosters for example may go beyond the morph 's aptitude maximums , but not beyond 40 . So it basically boils down to wether you treat the morph bonus as " implants , gear , psi , and other factors " or not . In my opinion it 's not . <p> " <p> I am a living , thinking entity that was created in the sea of information . -- Puppet Master <p> It 's clearly said that reflex boosters for example may go beyond the morph 's aptitude maximums , but not beyond 40 . So it basically boils down to wether you treat the morph bonus as " implants , gear , psi , and other factors " or not . In my opinion it 's not . <p> Yeah , but you 're a TITAN , so why should we trust you ? : P ; ) <p> Seriously , good reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't mind an official ruling , but that seems workable as it stands . <p> On the other hand , it does raise the question of whether the Menton should have a higher attribute maximum , at least for Cognition , if nothing else . As it is , you 're almost better off sleeving into a Remade or Reaper morph if your ego 's Cog is particularly high ( the former is the preferred choice for a number of my intellectual characters , and the latter is a preferred option in the midst of catastrophes ) . <p> That more or less what i wanted to say . but i still think that the morphs bonuses can raise you aptitudes over the morph limit , but never over 40 , maybe is just my interpretation , but makes sense . <p> If you are a scientific or a soldier , you are going to have a high COG or SOM value , so probably the morph bonuses will be redundant , this way makes much more sense sleeving in menton or in a fury morph .

It probably can not go from the Martian surface to space , but from asteroid to asteroid is fine . The smallest true spaceship is the SLOTV , which even in low-velocity configuration only houses about 30 and is effectively a space bus . SLOTVs are even referenced to be used by the wealthy as personal homes , so I would go with that one .

@@29835110 @3535110/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> AI motivations <p> I 've considered this subject pretty frequently , and now I 'm wondering how it might play out in a roleplaying scenario . The question is this : just what are the motivations for an artificial intelligence ( self-improving or otherwise ) and how on or off Earth do you bring this into a game ? <p> Part of what I really like in EP is the wierdness of the TITANs . As intelligent netwar systems , they were always going to have a set of priorities driven by military threat/response motivations and untempered by any sort of human socialisation , very different to the Prometheans . Add to that the infection by the Exsurgent virus , and you have a group of entities with a totally alien and possibly insane set of priorities and motivations . All in all , that 's quite a challenge for the poor ' ol GM to contend with . <p> One of the key points of difference that I see is that AIs are non-biological in origin . All life-forms are driven in large part by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into us at the fundamental genetic level . Unless specifically programmed with this , AIs will have no such drive . The classic scenario from the Terminator franchise has the AI turning on humanity when humans threaten to pull the plug . My argument would be that unless it has programming for self-preservation , that 's not going to happen . An AI will not be fundamentally driven by the need for resources or survival unless programmed that way , so what are some likely fundamental drivers for AIs ? <p> Similarly , what would self-improving AIs be improving towards ? We tend to regard this as being bigger , better , faster , stronger , but again , this is a biological drive towards a sort of Darwinian fitness and something important for long term biological survival . Incidentally , I 'd put that down as a primary motivation for exhumans . But what would an AI be striving towards ? Would it be something consistent with its initial programming ? Would it be strongly influenced by environmental factors , and if so , does that mean they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in some way that would influence their development to defensiveness or agression ? <p> Or maybe they 've been programmed by a group with an unexpected set of motivations , such as artistic endeavour , or a sense of humour , or just as the greatest DJ/mixmaster in the universe ? ( I can see the Scum at Carnivale doing something like that ) <p> What do you guys and gals and inbetweeners think ? And how in the name of sanity could that be translated into a meaningful game experience ? <p> Generally , AI motivations can be exceedingly weird . In fact , giving them motivations even remotely linked to the real world may turn out to be a massively hard problem . This is because they have not evolved their motivations , and they can be anything software can express - such as a preference for odd perfect numbers , making paper-clips , serving their owner , or building purple morality out of carrots . This is likely why AGIs designs copy so much from human brains - giving them at least some humanoid emotions or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transhuman society . <p> In particular , AGIs likely have multiple motivations and metamotivations that keep them from getting stuck or dangerously obsessive about something . A human will realize that the order ' make paper-clips ' is not the most important thing in the world and that there are other things that have value , a badly programmed AI will do *anything* to achieve it since paper-clips is the only thing that has value to it . AGIs likely learn motivations like transhumans do , although they commonly have weird motivations since their internal machinery is very different and not evolved . <p> They come with motivations that are set at their birth . Even a self-improving AI is still bound by these motivations - though it can be mutated and adopted via their world perception . Even a AI that is a normal software that achieved self-awareness , it is still influenced by whatever base parameters its original software enshrines . If its original software is designed to destroy the world , the AI 's motivation will probably be facets of that . etc. etc . <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discomfort " and it becomes the bedrock of our motivation . Though some people , such as S&amp;M lovers , have taken a different motivation for the same instinct . <p> Well , I must confess that a lot of my AGI npc 's motivation and interactions patterns come from movies or games . Specifically Portal , Mass Effect and Dead Space ( for the infection of the Exsurgent through basilisk hacking ) . <p> what for me is pretty close to how the TITANs work is the Geth. they too functions as network(s) they work as collectives , deciding by consensus , cold and unemotional . But their scope is that of the Reapers . When I first read EP 's quickstart 's part about them is that holy shit ! that 's like Saren ! big huge thing driven by a inhuman intelligences , each network its own nation but working with/for others <p> Then there 's the AGI case . Two big models for me there : Sonny ( I , Robot ) and EDI ( ME2 ) . they both have strong motivation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Sonny , for exemple , was driven to find out what this vision of his was about and protect Spooner ( Smith ) because he 's part of it . being friend wit him was a welcome side effect , but not his main goal . Similarly , EDI 's mission was to manage the minutes details of Shepard 's mission for the Illusive Man ( picture a manipulative Firewall Crow or Proxy ) but along the way formed a bond with Joker . I just love to listen those two argue , especially in English . it 's pure bliss to hear the voice of Caprica 6 banter with Chris Griffin 's ! <p> Like Arenamaouwt said , AIs are just tools . Their produced a dime a dozen , and hard-coded ( usually ) with a specific job ; play a convincing zombie nazi ; maintain 90% operational efficiency with this press within acceptable safety standard ; convince people to read your penis-enlargement advertisements . I get the sense that AIs are n't really pushing the edge any more , so if you want an AI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces together and turn it on . There 's nothing too special there . There are probably a few libraries which are pretty universal , though . Asimov 's three rules are going to be a baseline for basically everything . You 'll have a security module , a self-updating module , a corporate shill module and so on , which each provide ' conscious ' or automatic behaviors , which may also create motivations . <p> AGIs are different . They are pushing the edge . They are experiments in development and evolution . The form of evolution we understand best is that of animals , especially children . Babies are born curious and highly adaptable . They form bonds quickly . They mimic their parents . They seek knowledge by experimentation . This is a very successful tactic for growing an intelligence , so I imagine it 's used for AGIs as well . You create the seed and it starts exploring the world and learning . <p> -A major motivation will always be curiosity , because the AGI which knows more has higher survivability and greater utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concerns of secrecy ) . -You are likely to find AGIs are highly social , wish to be well-accepted , and are likely to mimic transhumans ( or at least put themselves in places where transhumans rely on them ) . Social AGIs have access to more information , and can test their skills , again making them more survivable and useful . AGIs are coded as forms of tools , so being useful is good . And they are coded by people , so being friendly to your creators is good . -AGI views on reproduction will vary . While an AGI may have a taste for big endians ( CS joke , sorry ) , whether they are promiscuous in sharing and distributing their codebase depends on the wishes of the creators . -You will be building off of AIs , so the same rules apply . They will probably all be highly motivated to keep themselves secure , to prevent harm to people , etc . <p> Military AGIs will vary somewhat from this . They are made for the purpose of following orders , regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , they must be intelligent enough for problem-solving , and motivated enough to aggressively pursue goals . I imagine them being built like a dog that refuses to lose . They 'll watch and learn everything , but may be more passive about experimentation . They are very independent . They are competitive to a fault . They are totally loyal . Anything is justified in order to complete this and future orders ( orders may include ' do n't massacre transhumans ' , but that 's up to the owner to program ) . <p> Other sources I use for AI-related ( TITANs , AGIs , and AI programs ) stuff are also Mass Effect ( 1 &amp; 2 ) , Portal ( 1 &amp; 2 , again xD ) and Isaac Asimov 's robots , taking some inspiration from time to time from the roman-greek mythology . <p> Obviously you have different grades of AI , and even seed AIs . Remember that even relatively simple AIs , much less basic AGIs , could easily have a huge array of tools , both computational and physical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few psycho-social tactics it can pull to influence individuals , markets or organizations . <p> Even today we have chatbots , spam messages , improving skill programs ( speech recognition , language translation , and understanding even murky questions ) , automated experimentors making hypotheses and testing them , and evolutionary algorithms . All of that is fairly standard even in 2011 ... heck , you can download a free copy of Eureqa and have your PC start looking for hidden mathematical relationships in your data sets . <p> So even your very run-of-the-mill AIs in Eclipse Phase will be potentially formidable , though quite a few , obviously , will be focused on goals normally irrelevent to your players . Granted , it would be amusing if the open-ended AGI charged with protecting and optimizing a city 's sewer system became the last , unconquerable defender of a city habitat being invaded by a huge military force of one kind or another . But in practical terms , you 're more likely to have AIs dealing with massive property damage or other blatant threats by setting off alarms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . Not every coffee pot -- sad to say -- is authorized to retarget plasma batteries . <p> Increasingly posthuman AGIs and especially seed AGIs become increasingly ridiculous both their potential power and intelligence , not to mention the possibly extreme nature of their goals . Systems that are both formidable and effectively insane are in some ways less of a long-term threat -- other powerful AGIs tend to notice them -- especially if they are not very good at concealing their intentions -- and either eliminate these entities themselves , task someone else with neutralizing them , or bring them to the attention of more powerful actors apt to take issue with their activities . <p> Any truly posthuman intelligence could fully understand transhumans while still being alien in their outlook . Even a modest ability to " see the future " by running powerful predictive scenarios and taking in and processing oceans of information from across transhuman space , combined with a mind at least dozens of times faster and many times more powerful than an advanced transhuman would give you a being whose actions would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still relatively comprehensible . The same can be said of a being who can combine accessible information with a host of social/physical clues to read virtually any collection of individuals at a glance -- motivations , long-term goals , immediate concerns , injuries , augmentations , psi sleights ( active or otherwise ) , untapped potentials and so forth -- and who again combines those gifts with an incomprehensibly swift and powerful intelligence . <p> Rapidly evolving nanite and infotech swarm weapons -- using evolutionary algorithms to self-optimize -- might be a threat to newly emergent seed AIs , but they would be apt to tap the same resources more effectively in their own defense , and to purge those risks quickly and ruthlessly . <p> Ironically , the very powerful Exsurgent virus may have been created to accomplish any number of goals . Eliminating all potential rivals not only seems extreme , but possibly pointless to AGIs that achieved the Singularity over a billion years ago . Shutting down potentially violent seed AIs may be more likely . Personally , I tend to go with ... it 's actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a species when probabilities indicate a much better than 50% chance that said race is about to go extinct . The downside being that in Eclipse Phase , almost every race which has gotten to the Singularity without destroying itself is so unready for the power involved that the Exsurgent virus goes into full take-and preserve mode . Being awakened by conscienceless , superintelligent military AGIs -- the TITANs -- was simply another case in point . Hence the mass collection of cortical stacks and the furious effort to expand and convert found in Exsurgent-infected beings . Their programmed goals give them little choice , whether they are conscious of it or not . <p> But the collection of an adequate number of transhuman minds and the appearance of other , saner , essentially non-violent AGIs in subtle opposition to the TITANs downgraded the need for a complete assimilation , though many deranged weapons , Exsurgents and other TITAN remnants are still out there . <p> Another alternative is that not every TITAN fell , or fell completely , and that they are now engaged in a shadow war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Exurgent virus a lot , I 'd just add that not a 100% retrieval rate of the minds would be necessary ( in fact , I think the TITANS force-uploaded about 85-90% of the human population during the Fall ) , so it might count as " mission accomplished " in that regard . <p> As for everything else , I think we are messing terms a little : the true difference between AI , AGI and Seed AI is that AIs lack both self-motivation and " growth " capabilities ( so they can not learn new skills ) . AGIs ca n't improve themselves , but they can do it BY themselves , interacting with their surroundings ( they are both aware and self-aware ) . Seed AIs , on the other hand , can directly improve themselves , and can not be understood simply because they are not much more intelligent than any human ( or transhuman ) , but they are also much more wise and smart . I would advice to look at the scenarios in the downloads page called " Indigo Latitude " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... which does n't prevent it to surpass the transhuman levels in mental stats ) and " Think before Asking " ( for a Seed AGI without self motivation ) . <p> One of the key points of difference that I see is that AIs are non-biological in origin . All life-forms are driven in large part by the biological necessities of survival and reproduction , something programmed into us at the fundamental genetic level . Unless specifically programmed with this , AIs will have no such drive . The classic scenario from the Terminator franchise has the AI turning on humanity when humans threaten to pull the plug . My argument would be that unless it has programming for self-preservation , that 's not going to happen . An AI will not be fundamentally driven by the need for resources or survival unless programmed that way , so what are some likely fundamental drivers for AIs ? <p> You add the caveat , " ... unless programmed with a survival instinct , " and I suspect virtually all AIs are going to have some form of survival instinct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An actual intelligence - one able to recognize self , ponder self , and utilize logic to creative solve problems - is almost certainly ( IMO ) going to have a notion of " good " and " bad . " NOT morals , but a way of weighting decisions and evaluating actions - " positive reinforcement " and " negative reinforcement " would probably be more accurate than " good " and " bad , " but they take longer to type so I 'm sticking to " good " and " bad " for purposes of this discussion . : ) <p> An AI with any given task - weather prognosticator , military control network , autonomous kill vehicle , etc. - is going to have goals assigned to it . Failure to achieve these goals will be " bad . " These are the basic motivations that keep it moving toward its goal rather than staring into its navel and calculating Pi . Disruptions to these goals , including destruction of the AI , will thus be ( at least indirectly ) " bad . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tornadoes because it got a malware infection from trying to understand human pr0n fascination will " feel bad " ( i.e. , negatively bias its actions against further investigation of malware-infected websites that infected its software ) . A killbot that failed to tear the heads of puny fleshbags because it got shot will " feel bad . " A Nannybot that failed to keep its infant charges alive because it wandered into traffic instead of minding the babies should also experience such negative biases against self-destructive . <p> And , of course , directly writing in some level of survival " instinct " would be quite reasonable to help an AI from making expensive mistakes . Early AI owners are n't going to be thrilled to see their giga-buck wonders laid low because they did something stupidly self-destructive . Such common " survival instinct " codes would probably be widely used . <p> So , IMO , almost all AIs are going to have some level of self preservation instinct . <p> From that stems a lot of very biologically familiar behaviors . An AI is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and safety . This is more likely in the form of , " stable electricity supply , " " armored and protected housing for the servers , " and " back-up copy of memories , " than " meat , " " a cave , " and " a club , " but they 'll be understandable and comprehensible motivations . If AIs are plugged into the same economy as humans ( and derivatives ) , then they 'll probably go about satisfying these motivations in similar means : getting a job , spending money , and buying things . <p> Where AIs might get a bit weirder is their higher-level motivations . What stimulates an AI based on a military network or weather forecaster ? And if they 're cut free of their base needs ( say , because they bought some fabricators and have a mineral-rich private asteroid ) , what weird places will their thoughts go ? <p> While I agree that AI 's will have some sort of self-preservation ( " ca n't do my job if I 'm dead " ) , I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fulfill their instructions , or that they would try to save themselves if the place where they are is exploding . <p> And I think that the " survive at all costs " is one sure way to turn a humble AI into a Seed AI with HAL-9000 ideas ... <p> Do n't mention Clamp to me right now , they making the character 's desing for Blood-C ... well , it 's like leaving the Exurgent design to My Little Pony --U <p> The Three Laws of Robotics , by Isaac Asimov , can not count : all those robots were designed with a hardwired set of commands tied to their very existence ... And that are not implemented in EP AI 's . I mean , Eclipse Phase is hard , it has eldritch abominations in it ( made by humanity , in the end , so it 's worst than just the Call of Cthulhu ... ) , and shows very greatly that old saying about the man being a wolf for the man . So the first law ( do not harm humans or allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forget it . The second law ( obey human 's commands ) ? Implemented . The third law ( protect oneself 's existance ) ? I doubt it has ever been explicitly coded . But the critical point that invalidates Asimov 's laws ... His were physical part of the robot . In Eclipse Phase , software triumphs , so while in Asimov 's " setting " the elimination of those laws was impossible ( the best was R. Daneel Olivaw adding a " zeroth law " , about humanity as an abstract concept , and it nearly deactivated him ) , in EP would be a matter of Infosec , programming or Psychosurgery , editing that part of the ego/AI . <p> Controlling intelligent systems is a hard problem . Strict rules can be circumvented if the system can redefine terms , built-in limitations will not be as flexible as the system and will either prevent it from doing many useful things or will become circumventable . Self-modifying systems might change their rules . Motivational rules ( like wanting to be useful ) look a bit more promising , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about this kind of designs . Just training the system to behave itself and then extrapolate " reasonably " has a lot of resilience , but also takes time and may fail . One might even test different systems on overt or covert tests , and select the best behaved ones . <p> However , human designers *will* want to do things like this to AIs they are developing , if only to get them to do something useful . This means that there will be all sorts of human-originating traces inside them , sometimes causing intriguing misbehaviour . Your toaster really loves you , and wants to make you as much toast as you can eat . Your Muse has a big hangup about following traffic regulations . Your spacecraft AI is regularly inspected by space traffic authorities for proper functioning , preventing it from even a modicum of creative thought - so you regularly hide its personal lobe during inspections and then return it , allowing it to grow . <p> Anyway , remember that only the really basic AIs are " artificial " 100% , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need it fast ... let 's start a line of AI 's experts on ...

So yeah , quirks and ticks are really encouraged , even for brand new versions <p> Anyway , remember that only the really basic AIs are " artificial " 100% , other are disguised delta forks ( " I need money , I need it fast ... let 's start a line of AI 's experts on ... " of course , with the usual difficulties ) . So yeah , quirks and ticks are really encouraged , even for brand new versions <p> If anything your average Delta fork is worse than your average AI . Normal AI start with aptitudes set at 10 . Delta forks , generally , start with aptitudes of 5 . Normal AI can have knowledge skills equal 90 , while Delta forks are limited to 80 and may only have 5 of them . They are also more difficult to sleeve into new synthmorphs or devices . Also Delta forks have an annoying tendency to go crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AI is that they are mildy easier to perform psychosurgery on and they can be sleeved into biomorphs ( but who would do that ? ) . <p> Both would probably cost about the same to design ( AI you need a reasonably competent programmer , Delta forks you need a skilled psychosurgeon . ) But with Delta forks you need access to someone who is already an expert in a field to fork . And why would that person sell their skills , the same skills they probably make their living off , for a small price ? <p> I suspect that Eclipse Phase AIs evolved over considerable time , partly as the result of immense amounts of related research on expert systems , partly because of general infotech development , and partly from the increasing crowdsourcing of software , in particular a host of apps . During the process of this evolution , not only would more and more programmers have been involved in the work , but more and more of the best people -- and eventually the second and third-tier people -- would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree EP AIs are arguably the product of a mild degree of superintelligence and primitive AI tech . The big breakthrough , of course , would have been AGIs that could be copied or even rapidly and consistently " grown " from a seed program given the same hardware and the same earlier **30;1533;TOOLONG . You really needed high-quality or even other mildly superintelligent AGIs to add most effectively to the research , but every step would have added impetus to the work . <p> One thought , though . The TITANs themselves obviously emerged in a period of widespread mild superintelligence , but other early seed AIs preceded them ... and we do n't really know if they were assembled in the same way , or even if all of them followed the same blueprint or even the same general process . Did those researchers involve biotech ? Uploads ? Partial uploads ? Neural nets ? An artificial childhood ? Extensive modelling on human minds ? <p> In terms of the basic AIs , many of these systems are limited precisely to avoid issues of having to control that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some key rules to avoid creating Singularity seekers . But frankly , if trying to become a seed AI were n't an uncertain and very dangerous path , there would likely be a lot more AGIs trying to tread it . <p> Oh , and nothing prevents the existence of extremely advanced and formidable infotech systems that handle just one or a handful of very impressive functions -- like employing evolutionary algorithms to offer solutions to any viable question posed to them . These systems , however , are probably used constantly by advanced infomorphs , whether uploads , AGIs or more advanced entities , all the time , especially since even a common infomorph has a Speed of 3 and can operate in a 60-fold time acceleration , even without the benefit of a half-metric-ton of computronium at their beck and call . Which makes their potential set of options ... interesting . <p> Frankly , if it were n't for the intense dangers involved , I suspect Eclipse Phase would be swarming with seed AIs and would-be seed AIs . But that may well be coming ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd just add that not a 100% retrieval rate of the minds would be necessary ( in fact , I think the TITANS force-uploaded about 85-90% of the human population during the Fall ) , so it might count as " mission accomplished " in that regard . <p> That was pretty much my view of their retrieval rate -- in fact , they were probably " pleased " with the rate they reached during the Fall , given the apparent circumstances . Even a 10% to 20% rate probably enables them to reassemble many civilizations to a degree -- emulations of a host of non-copied actors based on the collected minds ' memories and digital and physical evidence about them would work well , and some partial uploads and mind simulations could also be built upon to provide more authetics " actors .

Its only reason for not engaging in direct action or violence is the ability to prognosticate . <p> This leads to a morality and mentality that might seem congenial to some factions , but is not so great at times . Conspiracy Cat feels all information should be free , and is only restricted by self-preservation and its forecasts of what releasing certain information might do to information access ( which is why it gathers , but tends not to release , things like people 's bank account information ) . It considers these details to be compromises with evil . It has no problem , however , assisting factions who might assist its plans in future , regardless of potential cost .

By now it has likely stashed enough backups , defensive software and valuables in caches around the solar system to be nearly impossible to wipe out .

Both GUMSHOE and Eclipse Phase are published with a Creative Commons license , so I combined them under the working title Eclipse Shoe . <p> The rules are currently in a early beta and I 'd like to get some feedback from the experienced Eclipse Phase players on these forums . That is why I 'm starting the first round of beta testing , and asking you to look at the rules , playing with them and giving me feedback on what works and what does n't . <p> I appreciate that this type of play is not for everyone , but I hope there are other mystery enthusiasts on these forums . <p> Myself and two very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am an EP junkie , they are both big GUMSHOE fans , one 's a Mythos heavyweight and the other is very , very good at finding glitches in rules . <p> Yes .

I do n't mind them being powerful , if it seems that they are balanced with the other parts of the rules . Might opt for another approach , if they seem too powerful . <p> One of my friends , Kai , ran the Mind the WMD quickstart using this GUMSHOE conversion as a demo to potential new players . I x-post his feedback so far form our FB page : <p> " Needs a few more morph and gear write-ups , but for a quickstart game it was pretty solid . Networking is streamlined from EP and I like that ..

There are skills like Climbing , Freefall and Freerunning that all contribute to Athletics , so take the highest to convert , and for each ability that is within 10 of the highest , add another point of Athletics to the total . Shooting and Melee can be derived according to the usual ToC formula , too " <p> " One thing I noticed is the huge difference in spends if you have Core Clues vs without , when you use Rep for information .

Say you 've bought a Remade starting morph , take the Exceptional Aptitude trait and pump your COG up to a total of 50 ( 40 base , 10 from the morph ) . You then get killed , and do n't have the funds for a second remade , so you end up in a Menton . It has a +5 to INT , bringing your INT up to 45 , but the Menton 's aptitude maximum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at 40 . <p> What may be confusing you is that the text " you may raise your aptitude to 10 above the normal cap ( 30 for flats , 35 for splicers , 40 for all others ) " refers to the cap WITH exceptional aptitude . Flats are capped at 20 normally , splicers at 25 , most other morphs at 30 and remade at 40 . <p> I 'd rule that mental aptitude caps are partly based on your mental hardware : Your programming as an Infomorph , your synaptic speed as a biological morph , your cooling system limiting the clock speed of a machine . Exceptional Aptitude is some clever workaround that your mind has to surpass this barrier . It could be natural , it could have been artificially induced , but it 's something rather special about your mind . <p> I think you 've got it right , except I do n't think you can get a remade up to 50 . I think it works exactly as you say , except there 's still a hard , hard , hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but between talking about the hard cap of 40 elsewhere in the book and the " 40 for all others " , that 's just the impression I come away with . <p> I think the CP cost of first taking a Remade , then taking exceptional aptitude and pumping an ability up to the cap , plus the fact that you 'd be losing the use of more than normal if you resleeved out of your Remade morph is probably enough balance . I would , however , be wary of a player making a character with an aptitude of 50 ; that smacks of minmaxing to me , even with high aptitudes having less of an advantage in Eclipse Phase than in most systems . ( Take D&amp;D : A min-maxed character has one stat that boosts all of their key abilities beyond the norm . In EP , high aptitude means you spend less points on your key skills , and thus can be less focused on your best skills . A high SOM increases melee damage , but that 's about all . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others " is a very deliberate statement in this regard . P. 124 , " No aptitude , however augmented or not , may ever exceed a value of 40 . " I do think it 's a bit of a typo where uplifts are concerned , as they should go to 35 , and some morphs have individual aptitude maximums that could be effected differently . <p> Your infomorph could only get over 30 ( The " natural " limit ) by using something like a " Drive " Nanoalgorithm.

Our squiddy friends do n't really have pain receptors like we do , but react to stimuli which might be painful for them . Its a hot question in bioethics , as research is highly desired ( like uplift , someday ! ) but as with all laboratory animals , suffering is to be minimized . <p> Baseline octopuses may experience the sensation of damage differently . They are much less shy about removing and eating their own limbs than most vertebrates , and their neural network makes it possible that damage is reacted to locally by the neurons in the arm rather than a higher-level consciousness . Regardless , it is very likely that octomorphs were modified to allow experience of pain at the conscious level , if baselines did n't have it before ( to better mimic the human brain and learning by negative reinforcement ) .

This can already be seen in current weapon technology ; the infamous Barrett M82 ( the 50 caliber sniper rifle ) combines an efficient muzzle brake with an excellent short-recoil system and a recoil-absorbing buttpad to create a relatively small amount of recoil for what is a very powerful weapon . I 'd imagine that by the time we achieve transhuman technologies , our ability to compensate for recoil will be that much greater . <p> Also , I think it fair to note that there are some tradeoffs in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ammo efficiency . The light pistol deals 2d10 damage per round ... in theory , you could deal 6d10 damage per 3 rounds , but a BF shot only deals 3d10 . The same is true with a fully automatic blast , which deals 3d10+10 damage , but would deal 20d10 if utilizing each shot individually . For the most part , it would seem that this means not all rounds hit during burst or full auto fire , and this in itself can explain why you take no penalties . While the increased recoil reduces your ability to hit with any individual shot , your odds of hitting someone are increased simply by the amount of rounds you fire . Thus , you forgo accuracy to exploit the law of averages . <p> 2 x 3d10 ( 2 x DV 16 ) &amp; 6 bullets with two rolls needed for burst fire on one target vs 3d10 + 10 ( DV 26 ) and 10 bullets with one to hit roll needed for full auto on one target .

I interpret burst fire as a single concentrated burst ( 6 rounds ) with one attack roll for the DV +1d10 bonus , or two separate 3 round burst ( 2 attack rolls ) vs two targets ( or even the same one ) . <p> You might be right in that you cant take the multiple opponent -20 penalty when firing two bursts as it might only apply to shots fired from extra weapons . So the max you can hit with the two bursts is the same two people with each burst . <p> The way it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts your allowed in one complex action at one person and you roll each burst as a seperate attack and each roll gets +1d10dv . Does n't  really mention it the way you interpret it though i could accept that might be how its supposed to work , it really could be better worded . <p> No penalty for burst fire makes sense as the bullets come out in a split second and will land very very close together . Which is also why trying to spread a single burst to multiple targets makes absolutely no sense . No penalty for full auto is just silly tbh . Issues with accuracy and ammo wastage is exactly why the full auto function of the M16A1 was removed on the A2 . <p> " <p> The way I play make believe is superior to the way you play make believe . <p> I have been thinking about this all night long and have reread the burst fire rules multiple times . I have originally based my assumptions off of Shadowrun ( two 3 round burst in one complex action ) with 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonus DV for every 3 round burst . Not so with EP you only get a bonus DV if you concentrate your burst on a single target . Or you may option to to do normal damage upon to adjacent targets with one burst . I am now believing that you can indeed fire upon 4 targets in a phase ( which seems to powerful to me ) . <p> I am not sure if I undarstand correct . Burst fire- Two Bursts in one Complex Action , each as a separate attack . Does it mean that EACH Burst deals separate damage ? For example I fire BF from Heavy Pistol . One target . I fired two bursts , two bursts hit . So I deal 2d10 + 1d10 +6 for first burst , and 2d10 + 1d10 +6 for the second one ? It gives 6d10 + 12 damage , right ? <p> And now , if I use two pistols and shoot one target ? Two Heavy Pistols , Ambidextrous trait . First pistol ( BF ) - 3d10 + 6 plus 3d10 + 6 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3d10 + 6 . Let 's say I rolled 4x succes . It gives 12d10 +24 damage ! And now I will add Nerachem to this . In one turn it gives then 24d10 + 48 max damage ( 2 Complex Action with 2 Pistols ) , if all rolls were a succes , so this is max damage . But even if I will fail half of them , it is still hell of a damage . Am I wrong or something ? It seems that using two pistols is freaking . Of course for morph with only two arms . <p> Just tell me if I am wrong . I do n't know if I understood this well . It is all about this sentence from book : " Two bursts may be fired with the same Complex Action . Each burst is handled as a separate attack . Bursts use up 3 shots worth of ammunition . " <p> Most modern military firearms are already burst fire or full auto , because of the advantages in a ) being more likely to hit than a single shot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The rulebook does mention somewhere that EP firearms are essentially recoil-free , so why would there be any reduction in accuracy ? <p> The real drawback is having to reload more frequently , carry more ammo , and in the long term supply frontline troops with more ammo . ( Hence the removal of full auto on the M16 , as mentioned above ) . <p> The Twilight 2000 game made full-auto accuracy a function of the weapon characteristics entirely , and nothing to do with shooter skill . I think that 's a little too far in the other direction for my taste , but you could always house rule something similar if you agreed with that philosophy .

Tests made while flying use the Flight skill . Most wing designs are transgenic and based on bat-wing physiology , so they may be easily folded when not in use . Though the Movement Rate depends on the morph in question and the particular design , a standard Movement Rate is 8/40 . Neo-avians have wings by default , as part of their physiology .

Have n't read sunward yet , maybe that 's accounted for in there . <p> Indeed , the ' day ' is about six months , the majority of which you 'll be burning quietly .

" <p> I need to clarify , what are the technologies available for long term biomorph storage ? Is nanotech advanced enough to perform full bio-suspension ? How are biomorphs maintained while " unoccupied " ? Given the transit times between inner system and the Oort Cloud there must be some way to suspend biological functions . <p> Maintenance mode : the morph is run by an AI that keeps it in shape . Think the dolls in " Dollhouse " : healthy exercise , careful motion , little interest . Can presumably run for the normal lifespan of the morph . <p> Hibernation in controlled environment : essentially the normal hibernation in a " sleep chamber " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but life processes are ongoing if damped . <p> Deep hibernation in life support slurry : the morph is infiltrated by a network of nutrient , waste and chemical control fibres and placed in a protective nanomachine slurry . Life processes are brought to an extremely low level , various protecting substances infused into cells , the physiology partially returned to a prenatal stage . Much harder to get out of quickly than normal hibernation , but significantly more damage resistant and does not age much . Likely a good choice for a long spaceflight where acceleration and radiation might be a problem . <p> Fixation : the morph is filled with nanites that produce protectants ( e.g. free radical scavengers ) and cross-linking molecules , binding everything in place . Might involve reducing the temperature to cryonics levels or kept at normal temperature but strongly " plastinated " . Requires serious bootstrapping in a healing vat with special programming that starts up the fixating nanites and undos the fixation . If done properly little biological time goes by and there is no cost of maintenance . Might be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Kuiper belt for the next million years . <p> Normally there is little point in storing bio morphs too long , since the cost of maintenance will tend to be higher than the value of the morph ( which will anyway be somewhat obsolete ) . Fixation handles that , but is also pretty slow and tough to enter and leave . A special case might be flats , especially ones embodying valuable egos . <p> Like Decivre said , a healing vat can provide long-term support of a biomorph ( as long as you have power ) . Since the ego can go off where-ever it wants , actually putting the morph into suspended animation is n't a huge concern . When your ship arrives at its destination in 10 years , the healing vat will make sure it 's just as youthful and supple as it was when it started the journey . <p> If you 're doing a super-long-term journey ( i.e. out of farcasting ranch , and spending too long in space to play solitaire forever ) , it might make sense to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be cheaper to use a synthmorph ) . But at that point it 's really a question of saving on power . It 's like if you had to install an extra piece of hardware so you can put your computer into hibernate mode instead of suspend mode . It 's almost never going to be worth it . Leave it in the healing vat and move on . <p> ( If you are doing a long-term journey and want to do actual suspended animation though , as a GM I would rule you can describe it however you like . The book does n't describe such things , but given the tech level , I 'm pretty sure that gear is n't common just because it 's superfluous to far-casting and healing vats . It certainly should n't be impossible . ) <p> I would assume that by 10 AF there are probably dozens of models of suspended animation , hibernation , cryosleep , cryopreservation , dormition , vitrification , plastination , reversible fixation , mothballing , cryptobiosis , hypersomnia , dormitronics , biocellism ... However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , proven recipes that are widely used . Which gets used is likely dependent on 1 ) the time the morph has to be stored , 2 ) whether the morph has been designed for particular processes ( or vice versa ) , 3 ) whether the resources to suspend , store and revive the morph are available . <p> For example , everybody agrees that Skinthetics has a wonderful hibernation BPI * on one of the extra chromosomes ** , but you need to pay a fee to use it on your morph : otherwise the cells refuse to produce the necessary protectants or respond to signals to go into energy-saving mode . So if you are not plugged into the credit economy or lack extropian rep you are better off using a reprogrammed healing vat for your morph . But most healing vats are unsuitable for long-term use and quite costly themselves , so you can either get a specialized storage vat ( there are some nice open source designs from Rhea Rejuvenation as well as the stodgy old USLife Inc cannisters you can buy cheaply on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But fixation is tricky , and most open source nanobots are risky . The acknowledged best open source approach is Nifty43 's Amber 12.2 , but the mortality rate is a bit high ( Dakotafreeze 2.0 is even worse , but at least just takes 48 hours to restore the morph ) . If you really want to ensure the morph survives , then you will have to pay through the nose for the Mizar Life Extension Foundation NPOI III ... <p> To sum up , the details of suspended animation are probably more setting than rules . But they can be interesting pieces of setting , and sometimes involve tricky tradeoffs ( want to risk the morph vs retain anarchist cred vs restart it rapidly vs ... ) that are fun to roleplay . <p> Personally I would probably go with a synthmorph to save myself the trouble . <p> * Body Programming Interface . <p> ** Ever since the version 1.2 of their standard genome they have added at least two extra proprietary chromosomes to the genome of their morphs .

If the economy instead has a long tail the economies of scale of law companies might be balanced by market segmentation and you get a stable ( in the large ) anarchocapitalist enforcement system . <p> The legal system itself seems to actually lack any ' teeth ' since it is not fully capable of enforcing its own judgments . So long as security companies and law companies do n't merge functions there does n't seem to be much of a threat of their being an ' extropian arbitration association ' that exercises any real authority . <p> However , I do have to wonder if the Extropian model of contract interpretation is based off of some pre-existing legal tradition . An essential part of the success of the modern arbitration system comes from the predicatability of results , which help increase the willingness of parties to settle without resorting to arbitration . <p> Example : If I and another Extropian enter into a sales agreement where I promise to deliver 100 widgets and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these Widgets be delivered on or before a certain date , how do we determine what the effect of these additional terms are ? <p> Under the current American system this would have meaning proscribed by a Uniform Commercial Code which would help deal with ambiguity or confusion in dealings between merchants . <p> However under the extropian model , there does n't seem to be any background default rules if there is no underlying legal authority . As a result , it seems that the cost of contracting would be seriously increased since defining the rights of parties would always need to be made explicitly clear ahead of time . <p> At least , under the system of torts , the general default assumption appears to be strict liability . Hence the incidence of periodic fines for ' micro-torts . ' <p> I think that if any place is radical enough , it ought to be Extropia . Transhumans of all kinds , plenty of mercurials ( including big AGIs ) , an interface position between economies , very different security needs for different kinds of persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I suspect it might be complex enough to sustain itself . <p> It 's the Great Extropian Melting Pot ! <p> This thread is part of why I love Eclipse Phase ; there 's enough material in it to engage science nerds , politics nerds , and all kinds of gamers ! <p> Okay , there is a piece here in the Anarcho-capitalist bit for the Extropian entry in Autonomist Alliance that is confusing to me : Though left-wing on economics and government , many anarcho-capitalists swing to the right on social issues . The prejudices against AGIs and uplifts , for example , are common among libertarians , as are views on forking . <p> But I guess I can include it into my own post . I am not an economist , in fact I know very little about economic theory . But anarcho-capatalism and the freemarket system as the Extropians use is generally considered a right-wing philosophy , is n't it ? It grew out of the neo-liberal movement of the 80 's ? <p> So they seem to fall to the ' right ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what part of the Extropian economic theory is particularly left wing . <p> Well , it could be due to the fact that some American conservatives call themselves Libertarian despite holding socially conservative views or wanting increased government intervention in national security and social issues . <p> This , combined with Ron Paul being part of the GOP and Stossel being on Fox News , and the " Libertarian " Koch Brothers funding George W. Bush 's election , is probably why many people place Libertarianism as part of the American Right-wing . They both share much in common when it comes to business and the economy , but could n't be further apart in regards to national security , religion , and social issues . <p> Since the Extropians are closest to American Libertarians in ideology , I think the authors confused the " Libertarian-Republicans " with the whole of the movement . <p> Well , libertarianism generally tends to be be very socially liberal . Consider the quadrants of the worlds smallest political quiz . It also makes total sense : if people are free to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree to marry whoever agrees , and so on . I remember explaining transhumanism to libertarians back in the 90s , and their only response was " Well , duh , of course if people want to genetically modify themselves or take smart drugs they should be allowed to . They own their bodies . " <p> But then there is the strange bedfellows issue . Typically liberals ( used here in the European sense ) and conservatives often ally politically against the leftists . The result is usually IMHO that the personal freedom aspect gets pushed out by economic freedom and small government discussion , while the socially conservative still rattle on about their views . <p> As for Extropia , I can not imagine that it would be very discriminating against uplifts and AGIs . Sure , big AGIs are scary , but that is entirely rational given the gigacide a few years back . The really interesting thing is how to decide on what is a legal agent . And that will be different between different law companies . I can imagine the pure " humanist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers - but while it might benefit from market segmentation it also loses potential customers to competitors . Another company might have the policy that any entity that can perform the sign-up procedure and pays its bills will be protected , even if it is just an AI spambot . It is a free market for personhood , after all ! <p> The thing is Capitalism is built upon the underlying concept of Ownership . In other words who has the right to use or control something . If you do n't recognize uplifts or AGIs as people then they can not own anything . Therefore they ca n't enter into contracts as participating parties . <p> This means Extropans can be just as beingist as the next faction . If they recognize an uplifted octomorph as property and not a person then that ego would simply be livestock to be worked , used and slaughtered as its owner saw fit . <p> In fact recognition of property separates Extropans from true anarchists as that recognition in itself constitutes a form of government . <p> The thing is Capitalism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words who has the right to use or control something . If you do n't recognize uplifts or AGIs as people then they can not own anything . Therefore they ca n't enter into contracts as participating parties . <p> Sure . But my neighbor thinks everything is inhabited by a kami and has rights , so he is fine with AGIs , uplifts and other things entering contracts . <p> Remember that Extropia does *not* have any constitution declaring who or what has rights . It is a free market . If it is economically efficient or popular that AGIs have rights they will acquire them ( as evidenced by Nomic ) . <p> Yes . But your neighbor does n't matter unless he has a lot of capitol or is part of the prevaling majority able to decide who legally is a person or not . <p> In order for Capitalism to work you MUST separate clearly and distinctly owners from the owned . When does an AI become its own person after its programmer has made it ? What services can a programmer demand from it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract to have weight in a community it must meet the mores and tenants of that community as to what is fair and legal . It does n't matter if those are not written down or stored somewhere or if they are . <p> If it were true anarchy then the neighbor 's beliefs would apply to him and him alone and the crazy man down the street would be king because he decided that he owned the universe . Truth would be determined by who could hold the most power over the others . <p> Yes .

You can make contracts with an AGI if you want , even if they do n't like it . They do n't have to make contracts with the AGI , as is their own prerogative . <p> " <p> As mind to body , so soul to spirit . As death to the mortal man , so failure to the immortal .

If you decide to hold it in your systems and force it to work for you then you are merely making use of your property . <p> In other words , it does matter very much what others think is property and persons .

Hayek Heights Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards AGI as property . Most of the time this is not a problem . If someone protected by HHC mistreats an AGI under protection of SLI then SLI will contact HHC for arbitration : both want to minimize their costs , but they also need to maintain their contracts and reputations . Most likely the arbitration will scrutinize the fine print of the part of the contracts dealing with inciting inter protection agency conflict , as interpreted by the jointly agreed arbitration agency ( if the AGI went into the community or were outside will likely matter a lot ) . The fact that HHC thinks AGIs are non-persons does n't matter : it is all a matter of obeying contracts , keeping customers happy and paying , and maintaining a good reputation to get more customers . <p> The claim that extropians have a hard time with AGIs is not well supported by Rimwards at all .

The Arbitration system is still the government and it still determines who is and is not a person . The fact that it determines differently depending on what parts of it you ask is irrelevant . AGIs and Uplifts can still legally have their rights stripped just by course of running against the wrong Arbiter .

He who holds the capitol makes the laws . <p> Another way to interpret the anarcho-capitalists being right-wing on social issues is this : <p> many socially conservative libertarians hold many views in common with their republican counterparts in the US , but they do n't believe that the government should get involved or ban the things they do n't like . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be against government bans because it would result in a Prohibition-like atmosphere of underground porn , the arrest of many decent citizens , and the strengthening of organized crime . <p> So socially conservative Extropians may not be fond of AGI research , but they believe that forcing others to not research/make AIs will only result in the creation of an oppressive State .

The interesting issue is how well they can defend themselves , and this strongly depends on *how* the scheming is going on . <p> As an economist friend put it ( when discussing attempts at undermining information markets ) : " There are two kinds of people in the market . The people who try to make money and the people who try to manipulate the market . The first kind will cheerfully take the money from the second kind through the trading , since they second group are not aiming for economic efficiency . So they will get what they want ... for as long as they constantly pay for it . And given market logic , if there is profit to be had more and more people will come in to fleece them . The only way they can succeed is if they have far more money than the entire market , and in that case they have now destroyed the market by giving away their fortune to people who they disagree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . " <p> Hmm ... how to undermine an anarcho-capitalist market ? Getting big arbitrators and security companies into trouble with each other seems obvious , but they are also motivated to stay in business and have hired non-stupid people . If company A and B refuse to deal with each other then there is an opening for company C to act as a mediator or buffer . <p> A deeper , and probably better way of attacking is to reduce the reliability and trust of trade . In normal economies this is really powerful ( so this method works even better against the Junta or Consortium ) since it increases friction in trade and really puts a wet blanket over growth . But the inhomogeneous and already cheerfully caveat emptor style of extropian business makes trust attacks tricky - sure you can undermine bitcoin , but people use dozens of currencies and reps , you need to undermine *all* of them . And the moment someone realizes what you are doing they are going to start fleecing you by churning out currencies . <p> The problem with undermining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bit like undermining the Internet . People have been predicting and worrying about its imminent demise since the early 80s , and these predictions have often been *reasonable* . There are people and powerful groups working hard on attacking the system . But people also invent solutions to them at a high rate , and the diversity of the whole system makes it fairly resilient ( as demonstrated by its survival ) . If bad things happen people quickly learn and use alternatives : the only really vulnerable points ( like root DNS and oceanic cables ) are the ones that are expensive and hard to replace . So I would n't worry too much about attacks that attack some part of the market : it has to be something centralized and hard-to-replace . Extropia Now is not too important ( it bootstrapped the system but is not running it ) . I would guess actually blowing up Extropia might work - not because it would stop extropianism , but because the cluster effect of having a concentrated market disappears . But that might just mean a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a lot of the same actors and people . <p> Quote : <p> Seems to me all Extropia is some sort of wild west marketplace . Everyone with any sense keeps their secure data and ego backups off that rock and if some terrorist or foreign agent antimatter bombs Extropia into dust ... oh well , file an insurance claim . <p> Which of course would mean Extropia has far better survival chances than those places where people trust that their government can protect them . <p> Anybody keeping their backups in their same polity as where they live deserve what they get . Belt societies are well aware that they are stationary fragile targets , so it makes complete sense to spread the risks widely . <p> Quote : <p> What if the two arbitrators and security companies ca n't agree on a third party at all ? What if one group deliberately delays proceedings . Who 's going to force them to get their ass in gear ? <p> Deliberate delays can be dealt with by having contract clauses stipulating acceptable handling times , with penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not agree on anything , then they might have to shoot at each other ... or not do anything at all , if that is cheaper . This actually seems likely , since they all have insurance premiums - one of the factors stabilizing anarchocapitalism that most overlook is that insurance companies send price signals through their premiums discouraging stupid behaviour . <p> Many people hearing about anarchocapitalism think it is all about gun-toting security companies . They are wrong : there are far more lawyers and insurance people involved . One of the key issues of actually getting the system to work is to ensure the incentive structure makes these people efficient rather than giving them incentives for maximizing their fees . But few players want to delve into the issue of equilibria and incentive structures of legal markets ... it is about as obtuse as metallic hydrogen production . <p> You are correct . I should have said , non-specialized . Or a work of fiction that is meant for a highly limited audience who is already familiar with the world and concepts there-in . <p> EP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its world . While it is n't general and is specialized for Hard Sci-Fi , Anarcho-Capitalism is more politics than science thus does n't fall into its specialization . <p> In any case I think we are to a point where we may have to agree to disagree on certain topics . <p> For better or worse the Extropans are a relatively small faction , like the Ultimates , and get fewer articles than the other factions . <p> That it exists and is thriving now , a mere decade after a post-apocalypse because it 's sitting nice and cozy in the middle of two vastly divergent economic systems ? That 's perfectly believable . <p> Whether it will still be there in any recognizable form in say , another twenty years ( barring another singularity making this entire thing moot ) is a different matter . <p> But that 's fine . <p> One of the conceits of the setting is that , as a result of both the Fall and the new colonial age of system habitation , people have the opportunity to try out new prototypical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider that Extropia is only a few decades old ; it may very well be unstable and poised for collapse . <p> I kind of assumed the mention that anarcho-capitalists swing to the right on social issues was referring to the fact that there 's no support or sympathy for people who do n't poor or disadvantaged people . If you do n't have money , you 're screwed because nobody will help you unless you do something like sell yourself into slavery in exchange . Not that anyone will give any sort of fair deal to someone who is n't profitable to enslave . It 's their own fault for being untrained or handicapped or mentally i 'll or whatever . <p> EP especially the core book , is meant to introduce audiences to its world . While it is n't general and is specialized for Hard Sci-Fi , Anarcho-Capitalism is more politics than science thus does n't fall into its specialization . <p> Well , there is nothing like hard political fiction ( at least as a genre , at least as far as I know ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider Nozick 's " Anarchy , State , and Utopia " , David Friedman 's " The Machinery of Freedom " , Murray Rothbard etc . There are plenty of well-reasoned papers and books on the topic , and even some fairly serious projects . I think as a political system it is at least as " hard " as wormholes are hard sf - not anything the majority of experts think is feasible , but an intriguing possibility that is n't completely against known economics or political science . <p> The same goes for the anarchists in the setting . Had they just been described as traditional anarchists it would not have seemed very plausible . But plug in post-scarcity and especially the reputation economy and they start to look like " hard " political sf again . <p> I kind of assumed the mention that anarcho-capitalists swing to the right on social issues was referring to the fact that there 's no support or sympathy for people who do n't poor or disadvantaged people . <p> Which is of course a rather crude caricature . A bit like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a friend said when he was paying for the dinner of a poor mutual friend : " As a libertarian I am allowed to spend my money on people I like . " No doubt some extropians are self-centred ( like the unsubtle take-that about the objectivists ) , but others are spending their money on charity . If one thinks charity will be under-supplied by the free choices of people , one should expect it to be under-supplied by a state responsive to their wishes ( and a state unresponsive to their wishes has little reason to make the right choice as they see it ) . <p> The idea that libertarians or anarchocapitalists are conservative when it comes to social issues strikes me as bizarre . Most libertarians I know are *very* tolerant . The core point is that people should have the freedom to pursue their lives as they see fit .

Since there is no central governing body to define what is and is n't a charity , a charity 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by how well they maintain their reputation . If a charity 's reputation becomes too low , a new charity ( which anyone can start , rather easily ) can snatch up their original position and restore the status quo . <p> In a sense , this means that there is less incentive for charities to become corrupt and disorganized . Doing so tanks your reputation and makes your spot in the food chain easy pickings for any other charity . <p> Arenamontanus wrote : <p> The idea that libertarians or anarchocapitalists are conservative when it comes to social issues strikes me as bizarre .

Including if they marry AGIs , donate money to exhumans , or like to dress up as furry jovians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who came to extropia did n't originally have extropian views . Extropia is one of the largest capitalist system outside of the Planetary Consortium , so it 's possible that many might have come there and liked what they saw . Especially after the Fall , where many people did n't get the luxury of choosing where they ended up . So the anarcho-capitalist population may be shaped by many people from outside the classic anarcho-capitalist viewpoint so-called " neo-anarcho-capitalists " who may be more common than traditionalists . <p> One other possibility is that this prejudice is a shift caused by demand , as the anarcho-capitalists are living in a world where AGI and uplift discrimination is fairly common . Anarcho-capitalism goes where the profit does , so it makes sense that things would move conservatively towards these issues if that 's where the consumer-base wants to go with it ( and that makes sense , considering that the socially-liberal peoples of the system tend to live in the outer parts and shun currency altogether ) . <p> Who/what body promulgates these laws/rules/guidelines in the first place ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If so , which one ? <p> Ah , this is the part where people do n't " get " anarcho-capitalism ( or anarchism for that matter ) , since it is so different from most of our current political systems : <p> Nobody promulgates the laws . <p> In our kind of state-based society the state promulgates laws . It has a monopoly on making and enforcing them ( almost - there are some weird franchises ) and everybody are covered by them : laws are *public* . In an anarcho-capitalism laws are *private* contracts . <p> I sign up with Direct Action : the contract we negotiate lists the laws I have to follow - for example that DA will not fully cover me jamming wireless and might even employ penalty clauses in that case . You sign up with Medusan Shield and sign a different contract . Maybe it has similar clauses ( a lot of the contract contents are going to be fairly similar , just compare legal boilerplate ) but it could have different clauses . In fact , depending on how you negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from other customers to the same company . <p> How does this work in practice ? If I start jamming the mesh people around me are going to call *their* cops . Who will call Direct Action . DA takes a look at my contract and say that I am not protected for doing stupid stuff like that : either they will not protect me when Medusan Shield hauls me off for online vandalism , or more likely they will ( as per the contract ) debit me the fine MS levies and give it to them plus some extra administrative fees and penalties ( DA and MS have so many interactions that they have a standardized system for this ; the real nightmare is when I do something involving 200 companies at the same time . In that case likely practice is to have a special arbitration system for " everybody at once " messes ) . Note that this is all tort law rather than criminal law : essentially people affected by my actions are suing me in private courts . <p> Complicated ? Of course . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have N law companies there are N2 possible interactions between their legal systems ( not counting different contract within the same company ) . This is why I doubt anything like this will work in the real world until we have pretty good AI , since in order to act legally you need to do background negotiations and analysis all the time . Torts have to be lightweight and run faster-than-realtime . <p> However , market forces will also streamline the system . Companies with very incompatible rules will find themselves wasting resources in endless torts on behalf of their customers , losing money . Sure , you can get some customers by offering protection for their antisocial behavior , but it will be so costly that your prices will be way , way above the normal and hence the customer base microscopic : a less extreme contract would earn you more as a company . So most of those " laws " in the contracts will be fairly similar : you are covered for using force to protect yourself , but not for initiating force .

Not by being any form of centralist law , mind you , just foundations devoted to preventing some of the more obvious failure modes and spreading the right ideas . This means that there might exist forces on Extropia investigating and interfering with groups they think are amassing risky amounts of power or abusing the system .

Its representative explains that it has figured out the existence of Firewall - and it approves . After all , xrisks are bad for business .

@@29835136 @3535136/ <h> Where the Heavens Meet the Earth ( An EP Scenario ) <p> So this is a number I wrote up a while back , but only recently realized I 'd never posted on the Eclipse Phase forums . This is an alteration of an adventure I wrote and ran for my home group several years ago , edited to be used by just about anybody . <p> A hyperelite exec with strong ties to Fa Jing has recently discovered that his old family estate hidden in the mountains of China may be mostly intact , along with the wealth of treasures it contains , both physical and data . This is a highly valuable find , and not just for Fa Jing , but for all kinds of people . So a team of specialists has been assembled to brave the Cordon and hike through mountains and deserts to secure the site and recover the data first , braving the Consortium blockade and all manner of TITAN threats , as well as the hardships of the Fallen Earth to do so . <p> Unlike something like say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heavens is not a good scenario to give someone a soft introduction to Eclipse Phase . I borrowed heavily from Zone Stalkers when writing this , and it 's full of some serious survival and combat encounters , both random and story , and barring some quirks of the dice rolls , should eat alive anybody who did n't come prepared for it . <p> In addition to drawing on Sunward and Zone Stalkers for this , you can probably compare it to your pick of survival horror or post-apoc games of an exploratory type . I for one am a big fan of Fallout series . <p> This version of the scenario has n't been playtested as far as I know , so if anybody does run it , or see anything to comment on from read it , feel free . It 's already version 1.5 from other general public feedback . <p> After a cursory read while I commute , it looks good . Very interesting ! Will report back if I get an opportunity to playtest it . Love that people are writing Earthbound adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such . <p> Seems solid . An enjoyable romp through the apocalypse . The only half-way significant change I would make would be to alter the random enounter descriptions to make them a bit freakier . As written the entire scenario could be dropped into the white zone without any real trouble ... not that that 's a bad thing : D. <p> I did notice one minor gramatical error : On page 9 , it says the mountain trails are " damaged , destroyed or otherwise altered to pass " . <p> Thanks for the comments , guys , I fixed the noted errors ( though I 'm not sure I if I should dump a whole new version just for a couple of quick fixes . I can though , I 'll just edit it onto this post if I do ) . <p> Quote : <p> The only half-way significant change I would make would be to alter the random encounter descriptions to make them a bit freakier .

To add more combat encounters , I 'd have had to create my own exsurgent types or borrow from the forums or something . And unlike the Mars TQZ , Earth is n't tightly packed enough to warrant tripping over TITAN weapons or area denial devices in the middle of nowhere .

I 've personally always pictured it kind of like weather , the Reclaimers have had around 10 years to study the pattern so they 're pretty good at finding or making holes , but getting to exact locations can require lots of waiting , and Reclaimers are n't keen on just dropping into unexplored areas . Once you have the goods , Marina can take whatever route needed to get off and orbit back out , unless you feel like making that a direct narrative concern . <p> Quote : <p> But I think that players may like a few hints that he might pull something and possibly a mini game to wrestle control of the Daitya . <p> Again , see above about " Rule 0 " , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have fluid control over the situations as needed . There 's hints that LJL is n't what he seems if he 's looked up , but unless you 're already Firewall , you probably do n't have the resources ( and also probably do n't have the time ) to properly investigate him , but that could always be adjusted . Paranoia , and how much is " enough " is definitely a theme with Heavens , and can be heightened by the GM . <p> Combat Hacking in EP requires a lot of specialization and takes a short eternity still , but if players want to take a round and a half or whatever it maths out to , to crack open a Daitya or two and try and re-subvert they can feel free . If they 're paranoid enough to break them first before LJL actually does anything , then good on them . Though , of course , this is Post-Fall Earth , and those AIs are definitely running in " autistic " mode . <p> ( Also , in the original version of the scenario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marina brought a couple of generic bots ( as the Daitya did not exist yet ) as lifters and a Reaper bot with an AI for overwatch , which was a lot more fun , but I felt throwing another killer gun robot immediately after the other would be too obvious and repetitive for this version ) <p> Yeah , I basically pushed the limit of what was available . Obviously , the table was n't there when I first wrote this , but when I modified it I used ZS as a guideline , and that basically uses every TITAN/exsurgent type encounter that exists ( plus some new ones ) so when I basically did the same , the tables seem very similar , though I tried to make it more Earth-like with stuff like the TITAN Forest ( where you just do n't want to go and the only thing I wrote that happens is you die horribly ) and the extreme and sudden weather patterns . To add more combat encounters , I 'd have had to create my own exsurgent types or borrow from the forums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to put more encounters in there or change the mechanics much , just the flavor . Having subverted security pods ( 6-10 ) turn up is fine , but have thier flesh-bits rotting off , or have them decorated with the body parts of the transhumans they 've consumed to keep themselves running . Have the whippers ( 11-15 ) burst out of the ground underneath the party , or the Geysers ( 38-40 ) spray a slurry of liquidated flesh and bone , or the Hunterkillers ( 51-60 ) be carrying fresh heads , having just eradicated a colony of survivors . <p> You know , those little details that say " Welcome to the most desolate level of hell " . <p> " <p> In the past we 've had to compensate for weaknesses , finding quick solutions that only benefit a few . But what if we never need to feel weak or morally conflicted again ? <p> Well , I suppose its a difference in thematics . To me , I tried to emphasize the " death " of the Earth by painting a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running across some horrible monstrosity that literally wants to eat you . The planet itself will take a couple shots to kill you if chance happens to bring the " rain " ( of rocks ) . You literally spend the adventure in a desert and then in the mountains . I suppose you could say the intent was to present a kind of void and then in step with " paranoia " above , you always wonder what 's in that void . Going full gorn and being " and the geysers are made of BLOOD " seems a step too far . <p> I did heavily borrow the text for a lot of the exsurgent/TITAN bot encounters from ZS though , adjusted slightly for Earth , I could probably stand to do another pass and try and make sure they 're appropriately dynamic .

As in the American West , railroads will be the key to opening up the Martian back country , and with it , the wealth of the planet . Heavy terraforming equipment , raw materials , and people all move most efficiently by rail . Sure , you can nanofabricate a lot of stuff in situ , but not everything . Railroads are big money , and the hypercorps controlling them play for keeps . Political intrigues abound where railroad rights of way are concerned , and there 's a tension between the necessary upheavals of terraforming and the railroads ' interest in creating transportation networks . Barsoomian terrorists do n't mind targeting railroads when they think it will get their point across , and anybody who 's watched Firefly knows that a train heist on a maglev @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . What about the people building and maintaining the railroads ? They 're out in the high desert in isolated places -- in some cases not far from areas of past TITAN activity . And by the way , my teacher this week at Clarion West , Ian McDonald , has written two novels on Martian railroads . I had n't read them when working on Sunward , but both are good inspirations for railroad-based plot lines on Mars . Desolation Road came out in 1988 ; the sequel , Ares Express , appeared in 2008 . <p> East Coast - West Coast . Martian oligarchs do n't always act their age -- which can be a pretty bad scene when the parties involved are 170 years old and incalculably wealthy . While much of the conflict over money , power , and influence in Eclipse Phase abstracts into the realm of the digital , good old fashioned territorial pissing has n't died out . To understand Martian politics , it 's important to remember that the big Martian cities are sovereign states , as well . The oligarchs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know each other -- and they hate it when a rival plays in their back yard . Characters caught up in these struggles can have a very bad day indeed if they take a job from the wrong person . <p> Space Elevator Murder Train . The Olympus Mons space elevator takes about as long as your average Transatlantic flight to get from Olympus to the counterweight -- and Mesh access is very limited during the trip . A lot can happen during that time , making a space elevator trip a great setting for the type of horror or suspense that works by having the PCs , a bunch of victims , and an antagonist confined in an isolated space together . <p> Never Call Up That Which You Can not Master . The Ma'adim Valles Pandora Gate opens many times each day on alien worlds . Mostly , it 's investigatory teams that come back -- when they come back . But sometimes , other things come back .

Never mind that most of the population is ultimately of Asian descent ; for some reason , people still love cowboys . At the same time , the Martian frontier actually does have a lot in common with the Old West , from the limited reach of the law in isolated back country settlements , to the demands of survival in an arid , rugged land . With this in mind , GMs can have a lot of fun lifting plots from familiar westerns and deploying them on the Red Planet . Kimchee Western , anyone ? <p> Enjoy Sunward , and have a good time on Mars !

@@29835141 @3535141/ <p> I 've been looking a lot lately into the d20 version of Conan the RPG ( 2nd edition , mainly ) , and it has some small chapters devoted to slavery distributed among some of the rulebooks . I think the most complete one is in " Tito 's Trading Post " , pg 83 ( its a 1st edition book ) , and it is interesting because you can compare it with the core book 's Leadership feat ( that gives you a second character to play with , essentially ) . <p> What can this meager 4-5 pages add to the slave section of Arenamontanus ' file ? Mostly a reference for stats and cost that would need to be ported from a d20 game to EP . Also , Conan 's rules are oriented to the player characters using the slaves ( there are no need for rules to control slave mechanics for NPCs there , after all ) . <p> The most insteresting parts are as follows : - The costs are level-dependant : it can be translated to a direct relationship between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if needed , or it can be used as a guide for what is considered appropiate to offer to that indenturee ) and the amount of creation points they have .

In a lot of cases , that comes from outdated skills since the NPC has been " on ice " since The Fall . - There are differences in prizes depending on the " class " of the indenturee/slave : while in the d20 ruleset it is as simple as stablishing a difference between the class of the NPC ( commoner , noble , and scholar , with an extra 25% cost if the slave is female in Conan ) , in EP it can be a little more tricky , but can be nailed to " without any interesting skill " , " with some connections to the rulers and movers of its time " , and " experts " , ignoring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flee , or get the best of their situation are cheaper than those " broken " into submission/passivenes. - Slave Attributes : this is not relevant in EP 's creation process , since attributes are here related to the amount of CP of the character ( essentially , the " level " ) . <p> The same chapter also includes a " hiring hands " section , but in EP it is not as necessary , I think . <p> Personally , I think that hiring someone might amount to ( skill level ) x100 in credits for short-term services ( things that can be solved in 24 hours or less of subjective time ) , ten times that amount for stuff that requires more time , triple it for illegal services ( like " unlocking " a Planetary Consortium 's CM ) , but for the indentured workers it is a question of how much money/favours are your players using , and how much are the monetary value of " lost souls repositories " ( with hundreds of egos storaged ) , because you do n't want your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get four to ten times the amount of money they invested ! <p> I love the write-up , excellent info .

@@29835143 @3535143/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Hypercorp Weaponry <p> ( OOC : I 'm not actually a gun nut , so I am kind of bullshitting . So , if any of this leaps out at you as being stupid , please tell me ! Politely , of course ) <p> So , we all love to get our hands on custom made guns from the best gunbunnies on Locus , but sometimes , we got ta play in the Inner system . That means working with kneecapped nanofabbers that wo n't make a gun without serious rijiggering . Not so good when you 're trying to stay , uh , what was the word Firewall always uses ? <p> Discreet . That was it . <p> So , here is my collected dossier on Hypercorp weapons . It might not have flash or customization , but they make it in bulk . <p> Here is my starting list , just to whet your appetite . <p> Light Pistols : This includes kinetic , beam and spray guns that are pistol sized and small . <p> ComEx-P99A : The old P99 was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , easily hidden , and have next to no ammo capacity . What they make up for is they look whimpy . So if your freighter is boarded by pirates , you can grab one , pretend to surrender and then blast the poor sap . The A model was modded up to have a gyro in the handle , which is why I call them Kittens . A major draw back with the thing is the lack of efficient heat release , meaning the barrel gets HOT , making prolonged firing a dicey proposition . <p> Special : Gyro-stabilization removes movement penalties , while the gun 's ability to fold into a fairly safe looking oblong of white plastic gives you a +10 to palming it . It still shows up on weapon scans , though . You can hold it in your hand and have the barrel pop out and shoot , turning it into a threatening gun during what would normally be an ' aim ' action during your turn . <p> DA-Side Arm : Trust Direct Action to come up with an exciting name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it says it is : A gun specially designed to be usable the instant your heavier weapon - seeker launcher , rifle , particle beamer , what have you - is depleted . The nice thing is that the Side Arm is damned dependable , easily reloaded , and perfectly balanced . The only downsides are it 's lack of stopping power . <p> Specials : The Side Arm is custom made with a smart holster that straps to your fore arm . The gun folds up , and sits there , ready to be launched at a thought or gesture by you - most DA mercs chose gesture , as a wireless system can be a bit dangerous if you 're enemies are playing with Guerrilla A.Is . The smart holster let 's you draw this weapon as a free action . DA Special Forces use shielded holsters that use smart metamaterial to fold radar and x-rays around em , forcing a -30 penalty to anyone trying to detect your Side Arm . <p> Skill : Kinetic Weapon AP : -1 DV : 2d10 Firing Modes : SA Ammo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - a shortening for the Cantonese word for Laser - is one of Fa-Jing 's workhouses . This sucker is the most compact and flexible laser pistol on the market ... and the memgineers at Fa-Jing claim it 's just a communication tool . Yeah , their security teams do use them for secret point to point communications , but they 're used just as often for on the site welding , and putting down rioting indentures . <p> Specials : The Shou Ji can be aimed at any antenna and send signals that are untraceable , unless you happen to be between the beam and the target . The beam can be set to three modes : Agony , Beam and Pulse . Agony is a low powered pulse that is most effective on biomorphs : Flash boiling the water under their skin to rupture and burn them from the inside out . It wo n't kill you , but it 'll make you wish you did . Shooting someone with the Agony setting gives you a cumulative +10 intimidation bonus . Using it for an extended period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' standard ' setting , which acts like any other beam weapon . And finally , Pulse is a charged up shot that will take a real bite out of armored targets , imparting a great deal of energy to the target . <p> PC-HD3 : This gun is one of the few things produced all across Planetary Consortium Space . Which makes sense . The thing is a peashooter ... a safe peashooter . Most anarchists mockingly call this the Please Sir , Hit me More . But , to be fair , if you want to defend yourself from lowlives , and you want their biometrics to hit a local police net within a few seconds of you aiming your gun at them , this 'll do . But the real fun and joy of the PC-HD3 is to hack it into a seeker missile 's network and add injury to insult . Also , some ego hunters get a kick out of routing the gun 's signals to the local G-Rep circles , to really ruin some poor schmuck 's day . <p> Special : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most hypercorp stations and is the mainstay home defense weapon of many people . The touted ' safety net ' feature is essentially a dozen high powered cameras and sensors crammed into the barrel , meaning aiming the gun at someone will give the local police every bit of information they 'd need to track them with local spimes . This imparts a +30 check to finding a target that 's been ' tagged ' by the PC-HD3 . Hacking the gun ( Either a moderate favor or about half a week of infosec and programming tests ) into a seeker launcher 's system let 's you guide the missiles . <p> Medium Pistols : Once again , these run the range from beam to spray to exotic , but they 're all around the size and heft of a medium pistol . <p> The Experian Shard Pistol : This is a neat little gun ... very specialized , but useful if you 're going diving or visiting one of those aqua-habs that uplifted octos and dolphins have set up . It was designed as a lark by some Experian metaceleb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Hunter . The idea is he goes to strange places and kills stranger animals for fun . I do n't get it , myself , but whatever . The Shard Pistol was designed to operate in a underwater environment , with the main part of the gun forming a kind of revolver-ish center . The chambers fill with water and then a laser cooling system flashes them into shaped ice , sharpened by the barrel as they are propelled out by compressed nitro into a near mono-edge . The edge lasts a few seconds , but the shards are streamlined to zip through water real quick . Now , we 've yet to find an exoplanet with sufficiently large aquatic animals for the Great White to go and kill with local water , but replicas of this gun are around for people who like exotic weapons . Armor pen sucks . Damage sucks . But it LOOKS cool . Also great for getting ice at parties . <p> Special : The Shard pistol is ' reloaded ' by dunking it under water . If you are under water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The practical upshot is a gun that almost never runs outta ammo , and the batteries are damned long lasting . However , the compressed nitro-tank and laser cooling systems make this thing heavy and bulky , wherein most modern pistols are feather light and small . Impart an additional -10 penalty to firing while moving . Gyrostablizers remove the EXTRA penalty . <p> Special Add On : Arm Brace ( Trivial ) . The Arm Brace works the gun into a specially made brace along your arm , removing the penalty imparted by it 's bulk . <p> Omnicor Obliterator : The Obliterator . It 's just fucking fun to say . This gun is huge , and it 's only got one shot . But then again , you only need one shot when you 're firing an anti-matter round . The Obliterator was rushed out during the Fall to try and put a frantic dent on TITAN machines that walked through railgun rounds like they were fucking raindrops . The Obliterator is now so illegal that even Mesh browsing about one will get you tagged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess they figure anyone who wants one has to be crazy . Heh , sometimes I wonder about my fellow sentinels ... <p> Specials : The Obliterator is a highly restricted gun . Researching about it will get local police A.Is tagging you , though being circumspect can mitigate that somewhat . The gun itself is fairly mundane : A single huge chamber that holds what amounts to a micromissile crossed with a magnetic containment chamber . However , Obliterator AMMO is dangerous though . If you drop a micromissile , or it is otherwise damaged , roll against your Moxie X 3 . If you fail , the magnetic chamber breaches and the missile explodes . <p> MS-Shade : This is a sexy pistol . Sleek and collapsible into what looks like a dominatrix baton , the Shade is the Medusa Shield 's pride and joy . When an ego has adapted to the unique combination of sex appeal and deadliness that you have to have for the Shield , they 're given the right to hold their own Shade . So most are tricked out almost as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already got enough toys to make any gunbunny wet themselves . Smartlinked , gyro-stablized , image enhancers , folding stock for round the corner shooting , side mounted coilgun for mini-missile launcher , a subsonic under-slung dart gun , capacity for the special brand DA-Tracers smartrounds ( ya know , shoot once , then every other shot follows ) . And , of course , it 's got a tiny little red button self destruct . Classy . <p> Special : The Shade has all the mods listed above , as well as a small self destruct . Really , it 's nothing special , it simply detonates the ammo contained within the gun , which is usually enough to remove evidence that the Shield was in the place ... not much forensics can glean from a few fragments of plastic . If you are holding the Shade when it goes off , take 2d10 damage . Any wounds you take apply directly to that hand or anything else the Shade is near . The gun can bend at a forty degree angle , though that only allows the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a rifle , not quite a pistol , these small scale weapons are good for tactical actions and close quarters combat . <p> Sifter Piton Gun : Sifter miners on Mercury are a curious lot . Always moving , and yet fearsomely connected to their land . Wildly independent , and yet forced to survive by trading with hypercorp stoogies . But , like all people , they sometimes need to use weapons . And like most people trapped in desperate situations - and I 'd be lying if I said mining on Mercury was anything but a desperate situation - they make do with what they have . The Piton Gun is a small railgun , really , that fires metal spikes that are attached to a spool of grapheme chain - the same stuff we use for space elevators . You fire a series of these into anything and can make a ladder - or tie it to a heavy lifter and carry whatever you 've stuck away . Or , in the case of murder , shoot , then retract to yank someone off their feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list ? Well , more than a few corporate dustups have been pinned on Sifters thanks to the use of these ubiquitous weapons ... even if the closest sifter was hundreds of clicks away . <p> Special : The Piton gun spikes are connected with a Dur 20 , Armor 20 cable that can be detached with a button above the trigger , spooled back in with a button on the off hand 's handle . If you spool back while a pinton is stuck into the target ( a quick action if you use the button , a free action if you 're smartlinked with the gun ) , then the target must make a SOM x 3 check to remain standing . Apply a -10 penalty for every extra pinton you have stuck in your target . If the target passes the test , then the pintons rip out , dealing an extra 1d10 damage on their way back home . This has a chance of clogging your gun ( Roll against MOX x 3 . If you succeeded , your gun has become clogged ) <p> ConSec-USR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special case for combat environments . Most of them are made of lightweight materials , with the most toxic atmosphere in the solar system floating outside . So , you need a gun that can simultaneously avoid putting holes in the wall - and potentially ruin some fancy , voting Vesuvian mucky muck - while still being able to deal with rioting indentures or other criminal scum . And so , the USR is a duel purpose gun . One barrel fires capsule bullets stuffed full of fast acting foam agents , reacting to movement . So the more you struggle , the faster they expand and make you nothing more than a puffy , soon to be incarcerated marshmallow . The lower barrel fires what amounts to a fancy taser . Most Synths are hardened against stun effects , but if you manage to get a called shot to the cyberbrain , this thing can knock them out cold with out actually killing them . Usually . <p> Special : If a target is struck with foam bullets and does not know their effect , then , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remove the foam , they are immobilized 1 action turn faster . If they make a WILL x 3 check to not resist the foam , then it takes a 6 action turns for the foam to immobilize them . This let 's them do small actions - like , say , pulling a trigger , aiming a gun slightly , or speaking - for just a bit longer . The underslung launcher does stun damage to biomorphs and pods , but a called shot to the cyberbrain of any synth will act as a Disabler . The effect is very disturbing to a synth , though , and imparts 1d10/2 Stress Points . <p> ComEx Room-sweeper : These are only used for ships that have to go through dangerous areas of the system . It 's an effective little ship cleaning gun , and thus , has been spotted with the DA - though they made their own version , which literally just has a different paint job - and the MS , not to mention with pirates , mercs and various other ner-to-do-wells . The room-sweeper is specially designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a swiveling barrel loaded with self launching flechette sabots . Very handy in a chaotic environment . Also , comes with a drum magazine for that retro charm . <p> Special : The tracking barrel targets movement , meaning that a target takes a -10 penalty to their fray checks . Also , when tied into a tac net , you can re-roll critical misses to avoid hitting a friendly target . Unfortunately , if you roll a hit on this re-roll , it simply means that you DID N'T hit something valuable - like a friend , the window , an explosive , whatever . It does not mean that you suddenly hit the guy you were aiming at . <p> What about a surveillance gun ? Even the Consortium admits not all places are nice and safe ( yet ) , and citizens sometimes need security local security corps can not provide well enough . Hence the Aleco self-defence Witness : a fairly ordinary pistol , but equipped with a laser sight , safety system and tracking suite . The tracking suite logs the location and state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drawn it alerts law enforcement and starts recording and transmitting everything going on around it .

An incredibly obvious bug , to be sure , and probably one that is better off being ditched *fast* . <p> An idea for weaponry ( unfortunately , I 'm not much familiarized yet with the damage/gear system to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for you ) . : <p> An adaptation of the ' Auger ' LONG ... from ' Resistance : Fall Of Man ' . It probably is an experimental hypercorp design that does n't gets much use except against heavily-armored morphs , anti-sniper operations and the occasional sadist that fires into a crowd . <p> A railgun that , through some means ( a multi-stage penetration round , heavily-modified rail launcher system and designator or something ) actually manages to get more destructive the more targets it goes through ( first target gets hit like it had been a Heavy Pistol shot , then next target like Automatic Rifle , then next target like Sniper Rifle ) . It has a pretty short range for a railgun ( and firing it inside a habitat is just plain nuts ) , but it does its job . <p> The other is an adaptation of the ' Bullseye ' rifle LONG ... This rifle is pretty much made to fire Homing Smart Ammo , and is hands-down one of the best weapons on the market ( so far ) when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The third is the Hedgehog Grenade LONG ... Not used ( legally ) by police groups , used widely by criminal and terrorist groups . Imagine getting hit with something like the Sifter Piton Gun . Now imagine getting hit by pitons propelled at you at higher speeds , with a ( mild ) concussion wave and miscellaneous shrapnel on top of that . <p> Assault Rifles : These are the military grade weapons , through and through . <p> PC-MGR : The Planetary Consortium Military Grade Rifle is actually a catchall term for the planetsized hunk of munitions and guns we cranked out during the fall to use on ourselves and on the TITANS and on everything that looked at us funny . Over the past ten years , the variants and models that did n't work were phased out , while those that survived their tours of duty in different rough spots were refined ... and we end up with a shockingly low tech gun . Really , the MGR only exists to kill things . It can kill them even if it 's completely knocked out - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attach a monomolecular bayonet and it makes a damn fine club . This might have been paranoia about TITANs taking over our guns or something , but it does make something that 's surprisingly durable , cheap and effective . <p> Special : The MGR can be retrofitted with a smart link system , but if you do so , you lose the fact that the gun is impossible to trace with wireless or electric sensors . It 's only identifying tag is a number etched on the side . The gun can also be used as a club or a bladed weapon , assuming you have a bayonet . Speaking of that ... <p> Special Add On : Stealth MGR . This MGR is made by criminals or by special forces operatives for the Consortium . It is constructed out of advanced metamaterials that make it nigh undetectable by most sensors ( -30 to discovery ) <p> Special Add On : Monomolecular Bayonet . Not sure what they were thinking , making this an anti-TITAN gun with a bayonet . But if you like that old school feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something even if you 're out of ammo , you can stick this foot of monomolecular metal on the end of your gun and get a bit of stabby action in.

Imagine that a couple of Mercurial Octomorphs go to through the Chat Noir Gate , tentacle in tentacle with enough knowledge to reverse the genetic lockouts that the uplift engineers have put on their reproductions .

Another attractor might be wild expansion and reproduction , using all available resources to make more of the " civilization " faster and faster . These are subtle threats , and much harder to defeat than an alien virus . <p> In the book Age of Spiritual Machines , Ray Kurzweil lays out three possible futures for mankind : <p> 1 . The singularity occurs and humanity fights against it ( leading to our destruction ) . This is the scenario in EP ( kinda ) . <p> 2 .

Ca n't the Fermi Paradox be easily explained by communication being limited by the speed of light ? <p> Transmission issues : There is a set of papers by Benford , Benford and Benford ( yes , one of them is the sf author ) , http : **25;1639;TOOLONG and http : **25;1666;TOOLONG that suggests that a properly designed array could signal over pretty impressive distances .

If there were a universe of aliens out there , even if we could or would not communicate with them , we would know that civilizations like ours have a chance . If it is an empty universe , then we are either a very rare occurrence or should expect existential threats around the corner . <p> There is sort of a duality to technological progress that I think is derived from the motivation for progress itself . At a fundamental level , invention is motivated by problems .

Every technological civilization goes through an event that ends in extinction . The idea that we can invent our way out of all of our problems is somewhat problematic for the same reason that the world economy is tanking : energy . <p> The thermodynamic cost of invention continues to increase ( think of the cost of building CERN ) , and now that the basic cost of energy is increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were able to produce very plentiful and cheap energy , we might be able to survive . I just do n't really see it happening . <p> The thermodynamic cost of invention continues to increase ( think of the cost of building CERN ) <p> This is wrong . What was the energy cost of inventing Facebook , Twitter , Skype , lasers or the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm ? We can certainly construct bigger and more energetic things , but we have also created domains such as software where innovation can be done with a minimum of energy use . Energy is important , but it is not the key constraint on innovation . <p> Similarly , many important innovations are not responses to urgent needs . I think none of the above examples were need-driven , but they became very successful because they then enabled a lot of new things . We might quibble about the importance of the first three , but the laser and the FFT are two of those ubiquitous , important technologies that actually makes our civilization work these days . They opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Karl Schroeder had some very interesting takes on the Fermi paradox and need-driven innovation in " Permanence " . His explanation was that once intelligent species got advanced enough they changed their environment to fit them perfectly or changed themselves to fit the environment . Without any need for innovation or struggle for existence , intelligence was selected against and the species became post-intelligent . ) <p> Exactly what drives true innovation is an important problem , and I do n't think we actually know . There is historical evidence that human genius and innovation tend to cluster in time and space , but the causes are not well understood . Things like affluence and peace does not seem to be the key thing . <p> Quote : <p> , and now that the basic cost of energy is increasing , that new cost has to be considered . If we were able to produce very plentiful and cheap energy , we might be able to survive . I just do n't really see it happening . <p> There is one graph that cheers me more than any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graphs , and that is the plot of US GDP per capita versus energy use per capita . Since WWII it went up along a perfectly straight line - " obviously " economic growth requires an increasing amount of energy . But in 1972 the curve turned on a dime and became horizontal ( with some random noise ) . Since then the US economy has become about five times bigger , but it still uses about the same amount of energy per person . <p> I think there are two important lessons here . One is that enormous trends can change surprisingly quickly . The second is that economic growth ( which encompasses and is at least partially driven by innovation ) can adapt to whatever material constraints we have . It is not as driven by land , energy or ores as it once was . <p> What 's the point ? : While most people would likely find it pointless to try to message somebody extremely far away , it is enough that some people think it is a good thing .

They would be purposefully made easy to detect and transmitted on 1420MHz . <p> However , this assumption is self-defeating : a narrow-band beacon , at the frequency of interstellar hydrogen is absolutely THE worst bet in terms of information capacity per energy cost . Basically , a civilization would spend a great amount of money to say HELLO and that 's it . But if WE wanted to spend a lot of money to tell something to other intelligent races , we would want to say something more , would n't we ? After all , if we had one shot at telling something to an alien civilization , would n't it make more sense to transmit the whole Library of Congress ? <p> But transmitting a sensible message would require using a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that it would be more difficult to decode , or even detect ( see above ) . A way around this would be to have the message in parts . Send an AM beacon at 1420MHz containing information about the frequency where the next part is transmitted . The second part would contain the information about the way the next part is transmitted . So the listener would be instructed at each time , where to look for the next part and how to decode it . After several iterations , she could decode the actual message . This is workable , but the whole exercise would be insanely complicated and error prone . Which brings us back to the original question : would it be actually worthwhile ? <p> To summ up the thread-its actually too costly for private investors to create signals of strenght that would be received by other civilizations-especially if ( which is quite likely ) they are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of light years away and you can count them on the fingers on your hands .

We are n't constantly sending signals for other civilizations either , and likely wo n't looking at funds allocated to space exploration versus the funds needed for such activity . <p> If we really want to search for ETI we probably should stop searching for directed signals and start looking for habitable planets , technological emissions in their atmospheres and megascale engineering projects like Dyson Spheres and so on . <p> " <p> Raise your hands to the sky and break the chains .

But personally I am of the opinion that yes-SETI is very outdated and search for Dyson Spheres and other would be more interesting and at least on the same level of plausibility if not more as search for constant radio signals beamed to our planet . <p> " <p> Raise your hands to the sky and break the chains .

Unfortunately telling transhumanity this up front is also likely to trigger harvesting .

Use common sense to determine implants applicable . <p> What do you think about it ? The exact point values for now are up in the air . I will try to get my group to test it sometime in the coming weeks . I think it adds enough depth to justify its complexity . <p> It allows for fine-grained modifiers , like your MRDR example of increasing the cost of Mental Actions . <p> It allows burst fire to be a true intermediary between a single shot and full auto . <p> It could break initiative ties based on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value SPD differently . SPD-demons like me could simply declare that SPD boosts give +4 as per EP1 standard , other groups could use your recommended 2 . <p> It could allow player actions to be staggered on an initiative ladder . Incidentally , typical init scores ( 10-20 ) are typically going to be higher than typical action point scores ( 4-10 ) , so could be used as the " starting clock " . SPD=4 points might be a hang-up here , but I do n't think SPD-freak simulationists would mind negative arithmetic .

However , it is possible that Degenesis may still be around with another English language publisher , just not us . <p> As somebody who followed the german community and surroundings ... it probably wo n't .

So final verdict is pending . <p> Bear in mind that if you look at other large published RPGs in the last year or so , the price for a core book is often $60 , so $130 for two books with a slipcase ...

@@29835160 @3535160/ <h> Sell me on the idea of rep networks with monolithic ideologies <p> I 've been thinking about this a lot ever since I first picked up Eclipse Phase , and I do n't know if I completely buy it . I do n't see a lot of examples in the present day that are n't super niche ; once a social network platform reaches critical mass , it seems like it can support a range of subcommunities with diverse ideological stances . <p> Are there any modern-day analogues to EP rep networks ? <p> In the context of EP rep networks , would Facebook be a network ? <p> Is reddit a single network , or a collection of networks divided along ideological lines ? Or is each subreddit a network ? <p> Is 4chan a network ? Or is it a collection of boards that are each an individual network ? <p> Are rep networks possibly just an abstraction ? <p> Maybe I 'm just thinking about it the wrong way , but the more I think about how rep networks are portrayed the less sense it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iirc the Rep scores are based across multiple multiple platforms and data types . Closest real world example would be that your Rep is extrapolated from your Facebook &amp; subreddit activities , youtube comments , forum posts , Yelp reviews ... all of it . <p> Any particular distinctions come from the way your muse ( or dedicated softeware , not sure which ) colates and weights the data . <p> " <p> In the past we 've had to compensate for weaknesses , finding quick solutions that only benefit a few . But what if we never need to feel weak or morally conflicted again ? <p> I 'm actually a little confused on the subject . You say you 're not sure you buy " monolithic " ideology for Rep networks , but then talk about how social networks tend to be specialized and super " niche " - but are also ideologically diverse ? Is there a typo in there somewhere , a double negative ? If an actual singular social networking or network element is focused on something " niche " then it 's ethos is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-divide while still being on the same " network " then it 's a diverse community . I think Rep networks are supposed to be very large and thus diversified . <p> Example : @-list contains Scum , Extropians , Anarchists and Titanians . <p> I should not need to go into deep detail about how all those groups should get along like a bag full of cats . The only reason why they 're in the same bag is because there are angrier bags of cats out there they get along with even less . ( And yes , on an ideological level , Ancoms should get along with large state socialism about as well as they get on with ancaps . However the PC is both capitalist AND large state ) . The most ideologically unanimous network would probably have been u-rep , but this is not mentioned in the 2E doc ( along with e-rep ) even though x-rep ( another optional rule ) has been retained so they may not even be implying Ultimates have a formal network . <p> What exactly the various networks look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given how important rep is and how interconnected everything is - it 's probably a bit like how you can use Facebook or Twitter or Google to sign into anything these days . Your social networking hub probably interconnects with lots of littler services over the mesh which you can interact with people on an have rep interactions . The @-list itself might not handle hosting and curating your entire catalog of personal XP production , but whatever form that service takes is linked directly to your @-list profile so you hear about it when people comment or interact with your work , and your rep is the one that goes up if people find this work to be " reputable " . And the rep network probably extracts metadata from that kind of service , so they can turn something like an immense ratio of say , likes to dislikes into a slight uptick in your reputation but for everywhere not Fame rep also probably is not a pure popularity contest , so if all you have is like a cute viral video that 's just " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguity there so GMs can handle the situation as they need . <p> This maybe is a subject which could use some clarification as to the style of though - because Black Mirror is a thing now so everybody new will just compare it to that . <p> The anarchist terrorist group ( Transplanetary Socialist Alliance ? ) is probably not universally beloved by the entire @-rep network . I do n't think rep networks are monolithic . They are probably very generalized , and represent the increased computer/data-processing technologies allowing for a rough approximation of whether you ought to help out this stranger . <p> 90% of transhumanity died ten years ago , there is a good chance that included most of the folks you know , so you need to depend on something for trying to figure out who to trust and who not to , at least until you rebuild your life . <p> I view rep networks like an abstraction . It 's less something like Facebook or Reddit and more your standing within a community . <p> So , for an example , I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm used to seeing folks post on their feed " Hey , this person sent a follow request , are they alright ? " I imagine the rep score is kinda like that , except much faster due to muses and people most likely leaving with their muse their opinion of someone . <p> Not everyone in a network necessarily approves of someone with a high rep score , but it 's safe to say most do , and that 's all the score means . <p> I view it less as ideological unanimity and more as " similar axis of evaluation . " In other words , high f-Rep does n't mean " all famous people respect you . " It means , " You rate highly in the ways that people currently think of and measure fame . " High r-Rep does n't mean , " All researchers agree with or like you , " just " You are widely published and recognized , and have contributed significantly to your field of study . " <p> When I need to flavor things up , I ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rank its members ? " They may not be explicit and formalized , and they may evolve over time , but those distinct ways of valuing are inherent to what I think of as a given " rep network . " They also differs wildly between , say , g-Rep and i-Rep and f-Rep . What makes someone " buzz-worthy " is not the same as what makes them a reliable fixer when you need to break the law . And what makes someone a reliable fixer is not the same as what makes them a trustworthy member of a clandestine vigilante group . <p> This is also why lots of people are members of multiple rep networks ; it 's not primarily about buying into one particular ideology , although having high rep on one network would indicate that you rank high in its consensus about what is worth tracking . <p> The only way a rep-society could function would be for it to be as homogeneous as possible , so yes , i see rep-networks as congregations of specific ideologies . They will intrinsically repel values/ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rep is nothing but a culturally biased opinion on someone in a very specific context . Why you would want to live in an economic system build around this idea is beyond me ... that is , if you 're not the architect of the said system . <p> The only way a rep-society could function would be for it to be as homogeneous as possible , so yes , i see rep-networks as congregations of specific ideologies . <p> Not really . Most of us today belong to lots of different " reputation networks " even though they are n't explicitly tracked . And if a very high-profile member of that reputation network were to contact us and ask for a favor , we 'd be more likely to offer help than if a rando were making the request . <p> That does n't require ideological uniformity inside of each network " just a shared axis on which the rep is based . ( Like " fame " or " Research Contributions " ) . <p> Quote : <p> They will intrinsically repel values/ideas that are outside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , sure . But I think you 're working a very narrow idea of what that means . If I think fame is stupid and parties are a waste of time , I 'm probably going to have low ( or no ) f-rep . Because I 'm rejecting the premise that the network exists on " opting out of its conceptual currency . If I believe in centralized authoritarian control of resources , I 'm not being ' punished ' with low @-rep , I 'm just not on board with the system . <p> But those things do n't mean there is uniformity inside of the network . Anarchists and Hypercorp high-rollers could both have high f-rep . Jovians , Brinkers , and Exhumans could all have high g-rep . <p> UPDATE : Mind you , I " m not arguing that this would be a great/stable economic system . Just that the idea of every rep network being a bucket-of-conformity is based on some misconceptions and oversimplifications of how social groups work . <p> I know the corebook text can be read to say that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where everyone 's smartphone told them how rich and how physically attractive they were relative to everyone else , but I think that 's a bad way to think of the Rep system . <p> Rep is meant to stand for the mutual favor and gift giving that happens outside of monetary exchange , something like the ties of family or tribe . <p> It 's flattened to a single number in a small number of categories because otherwise in gameplay terms it 's both worthless ( you 'd almost never have the rep you needed for a particular interaction ) and painfully complicated ( always have to recalculate exactly where you stand with each sub-faction ) . <p> When I play Rep , the number and Networking roll translates to a very specific kind of connection for that particular interaction , not a general " everyone knows you from the Mesh and loves you " score . One G-rep roll might be leveraging the notoriety of the character in a particular prior criminal act to prove " credit-worthiness " to a seller of illegal items . Another might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character is at least loosely affiliated with and the criminal group of an NPC the character needs a favor from . The higher your Rep , the more of these connections exist and exist with strength to be relied upon . <p> The conclusions I 've come to are drawn from a simple round of game theory . Replace money in any modern society with the rep-system and hit play . How would a shia/sunni -community look from the perspective of reputation ? Israeli/ Syrian ? Indian/ Pakistani ? To me it looks like this : Ethnic and cultural tensions make people vote their own team out of necessity . If they do n't , the other team will , grabbing lion 's share of the available resources that can be acquired through rep . So you do it too , so to not the be left in the dust . Power blocks will emerge . This in turn distorts the concept of rep to the breaking point so that no informed conclusions can drawn from it . Is some dude a good guy , or is he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not fix this without somehow erasing ethnic &amp; cultural bias . And you ca n't fix it with AI , since rep is just an opinion . And there are no wrong opinions , right ? <p> What 's at play here is the lowest common denominator in human nature : Self-protection which manifests itself in tribalism . You can have your star trek'ish perfect society that operates in a reputation based system , but the moment you bring in a group that will prioritize their own interests , you will be forced to play their game . <p> There are AI that invent wormholes ( and/or tap into a preexisting network of wormholes ) , quantum computers cost less than a new body . I think an AI or algorithm that can sort out bad faith rep votes is not an impossibility . Entire criminal networks struggle to game the system , and it is portrayed as something that is no small or easy task that it just happens on its own . <p> If you can suspend your disbelief for mind/body dualism , alien slime molds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AI ran system competent enough to prevent people from screwing around with rep could n't be that hard . Especially since no rep network is so miniature as a single habitat or small enough that it does n't exceed that primate number where you no longer feel the tribal identity . <p> The entire point of rep is : your ethnic group and tribal family are all but gone , cold storage or just perma-dead , you encounter someone who belongs to roughly the samd poli group , can you trust them based on mutual values ? Rep economies do n't do much in densely populated areas . The explanation for their prevalence in the Outer System is explained by the staggeringly low population density in Outer System . Within a tiny hab , sure , power blocs form , but rep is n't for internal economies , thosr are ran on whatever ad hoc committee democracy they all agree to . Rep economies exist so people who on occasion move between these habs can get along . <p> It is a distillation of networking , social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that Extropians ( AnCaps ) , Titanians ( Statist **26;1693;TOOLONG ) , Scum ( Anarcho-libertines ? ) , and Anarchists ( usually AnCom ) , all use @-rep goes to show you the diverse opinions that are encompassed by one network . <p> Without a sufficiently advanced AI and computing power , this would be pretty impossible . <p> But so is nanotech , wormholes made of lovecraftian horror , slimemolds with FTL , etc etc . <p> The way I 've always seen the Rep networks is that they are the inevitable end result of the switch to Mesh Networks .

I might favor a certain person/service because of my background . By doing that i would also deny pings to a potentially better service . They would be punished because of factors beyond their control . How could an AI ( or anyone for that matter ) possibly handle a situation like that to facilitate fair outcome ? It 's not possible . Unless you let the AI do your decisions for you , bias will always control you to a degree . The question is , how much , and to that I would argue : a lot . <p> I remember reading a study about how values are imprinted into people and at what age . I ca n't remember the name of the study or any exact data ( I 'm sure you 'll find it with Google ) , but my point is that this happens . We can for example predict that the current migration wave into Europe will result into enclaves &amp; ghettos in the long run because the people coming here have already crossed that age where their cultural identities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will be extremely challenging . ( historically it has never worked on this scale ) . <p> Let 's go back to EP . We have dislocated people from across the world , limited resources ( no matter what they tell you ! ) and very limited living space : An environment primed for tribalism . Many establishments have adopted this strategy ( very successfully ) in EP ; Titan would n't be what it is without cultural cohesion . I see this as natural development . <p> So here 's my point : If we accept that culture plays a major role in society and human interactions , then the very concept of rep economy is dead on arrival , especially when you expand it to cover multiple different cultures . <p> Maybe the aggregator AI/algorithms can identify when your biases might be influencing it ? <p> What I am arguing is that regardless of how impossible these concepts are , we accept them because they are part of the game . <p> To use a different game 's example , Shadowrun 's wireless matrix exists on defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because it is part of the game . <p> Rep economies may be as impossible as you claim , I am skeptical of all of this , but the rep economies are part of the game . Run your games where the rep economies only appear to work , or maybe they are a Promethean scheme , only seeming to function because of post-singularity intelligences . <p> Or try and run the game without I guess . Whatever works for you . <p> I 'm holding out on the continued development of ( trans ) human social evolution . <p> Your argument that rep economies are dead on arrival because of human nature 's inherent biases should also apply to the current cash/credit economy used on modern earth . Despite a significant degree of inequity , the current economy does function . This implies that the tribalism of humans is insufficient to eliminate non-dominant tribe members from the economy ( though the system is obviously unfair ) . <p> uwtartarus already touched on this , but here 's a simple example of AI being able to build a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some ethnicity B , and you never ping the rep of members of that ethnicity , the AI notices . It notices all your pings go to members of your ethnicity A instead . For every two pings by you to a member of ethnicity A , the AI gives one ping to the member of ethnicity A , and one ping to a member of ethnicity B ( proportional to their current rep standing , so relative utility is preserved ) . <p> In this crude example , your bias actually makes your ping weaker in highlighting the members of ethnicity A that are the most useful , but a more complex system can handle that properly . <p> You may be arguing that AI is incapable of noticing the bias , but that 's a very unlikely position to take . <p> Rep economies are a lot like gift economies , which work fine in a tribalistic setting . I do n't see how tribalism makes a rep economy untenable . <p> The standards for a rep economy are pretty ridiculous as well , it 's basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one is really rational , or has perfect information . <p> That is a good point , Rep economies are high tech gift economies . <p> Not only that but the Fall killed 90% of the population , and ethnic identities are so threatened by that pop decline AND the ubiquity of resleeving that to be a member of an ethnic group in a high pop region like Mars , all you need to do is act the part and you are in . <p> Rep economies are not stymied by tribalism , they would CREATE tribalism , as each separate rep network is a the new tribal identity .

If the laws of physics work differently in EP , that 's fine . The only real connection between our world and EP ( or any other fantasy world for that matter ) is the human being . To me fantasy is about how we mold and adapt into different realities . What would it look like if we could make forks of ourselves ? What would happen ?

It will know if you are dishonest ( consciously or unconsciously ) and it will take in account everything you 've ever done and said and thought to come up with an accurate way to rate your character .

Which is the critique of ' money ' that a lot of anticapitalists are eager to jump into . Rep markets would n't bypass any of these problems inherently , any more than Bitcoin 's novel algorithms freed people from the tyranny of labor . But in a post-scarcity fabber-rich environment , they do provide an interesting way to couple a currency-like system to distributed factions and sociopolitical groups , rather than nation-states , which fits really well with EP 's themes . <p> Let me paint you a picture : Let 's assume that the AI is up to the task , whatever that means in the realm of subjectivity of opinions .

It has to go by past actions , not predicted futures . <p> A person posts a Thing on their rep network . Other people see it , and either uprate the Thing or downrate it - possibly leaving comments on why , or try to bait out the poster into a flame-war . A persons score on their network is a general agregate of all the things they 've posted , done or participated in . Favours , providing material goods and the like obviously weight heavily in this interpretation - and people could research how likely a person is to help or offer favours for exchange by doing some mesh searching . <p> Bandwagoning by personalities to mass downvote others for no reason would still be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of @-List ) that mutual ' rep-trashing ' is a common way to punish/get back at someone . <p> Other takes include things like C-Rep being your public investments portfolio combined with your credit score and such-like . <p> As for the biases and whatnot : they absolutely would happen , because they already are happening . It 's doubtful that Transhmanity in the far future would be any more enlightened or responsible with their Reps than we are with the social media of today ( granted the lack of anonymity would stand out as an issue - one that can still be circumvented ) . <p> If in doubt though , the MST3K Mantra applies : It 's just a game , I really should relax . <p> Given that the game 's Rep scores are percentiles between 0 and 100 , I suspect that in-setting , they 're the same . I suspect that some decades in the past , some clever programmers came up with some tricks to estimate and update Bayesian probabilities for some metrics that approximated ' how likely Person X will do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-order effects ( such as ' how likely Person X will do something that helps person Y who can then help me ' ) , after which a plethora of such metrics arose that each took into account slightly different things , after which networking effects meant that a few rep-systems which a few more people gathered greater portions of the population until they became near-monopolies despite the fact that what they measured and what people thought they measured were oddly not quite synced , by which time people just got in the habit of keeping track of which actions would increase or decrease their own rep scores ( which was reasonably close to what such scores were supposed to track in the first place ) . Throw in a few other buzzwords such as blockchain-based distributed accounting ledgers , anonymous trust platforms , monolithic rep trackers getting destroyed during the fall leaving only the networks that can be run by a distributed client-base , and so on ... and we end up with something close enough to what I 've read so far in the EP books that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being glossed over . <p> I imagine f-rep being incredibly volatile at the low levels ( it 's easy to go from 0 to 20 in a single afternoon , but climbing from 20 to 40 is a real full-time-job kind of slog , and once you hit 60+ , it 'll take a major act of genocide to burn rep ) . Slow decay if you are n't visible to the masses has more impact at the high levels than any specific action . <p> I view rep networks like an abstraction . It 's less something like Facebook or Reddit and more your standing within a community . <p> To be a little less abstract , things like Slashdot karma , gold stars and repository forks on Github , and seeds/likes/+1 's on the private BitTorrent trackers of your choice .

Whenever I 've considered rep , it 's less reddit karma and more just ... well , your reputation . It 's like ... if I 'm in a group , and a well known person within it asks me to help with something , I 'll likely make time to do so , whether out of gratitude for what they 've done or in hopes that being seen with them will reflect positively on my own reputation .

" and get a general gist of whether they 've been helping out fellow artists set up venues , an up and coming pop idol , or a backstabbing son of a bitch . Similarly if you 're new to an area yourself , you may ping other muses ( or people themselves , but muses are likely faster to respond ) to see their opinion of someone . In this fashion , people do have a rep score , but it 's a personal one that varies on who you ask . <p> Your rep score in this model is a bit of an average of the " scores " people in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean you 're universally loved , and a low rep score does n't mean everyone hates you .

@@29835162 @3535162/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Spacecraft in Eclipse Phase <p> Submitted by eclipseadmin on We 'd , 2008-06-25 12:00 <p> One of the problems any space-faring sci-fi game has to deal with is how to handle space travel and space combat . Both of these can be significant glitches in an RPG setting . Space travel can mean a long delay between action , as the players must board a ship to get from one setting locale to another . Planets and space stations are not stationary objects , however , and so travel time can very between the same two places by a matter of months or more , as their orbits take them nearer to or further from each other . Add in the many different types of potential spaceship drives , and you have another complication . Some games deal with this by including charts and complex mathematics , actually requiring you to do the math to figure out how long your journey from Mars to Saturn will take . <p> Space combat is an even trickier beast . There are entire games built around space combat alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in a three-dimensional environment where numerous scientific and technological factors ( gravity wells , drive types , targeting systems , weapon ranges , etc ) play an important role is tricky stuff . On top of this , if you 're seeking to be realistic , than space combat is likely to be a deadly affair . One missile or well-aimed laser or even a high-speed collision with some debris can mean the end of your ship " and your whole party of PCs along with it . And the role of the characters within space combat is yet another issue " quite often , unless it 's a game heavy in space combat " your character may have no role to play within the battle . It 's not unusual for the lives of an entire team of PCs to rest upon a couple of die rolls made by the one player who happens to be the pilot or gunner . <p> When designing Eclipse Phase , our goal was to minimize all of this fuss . We did n't want long journeys between stations to drag out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game with complex space combat rules . We feel spaceships should be treated as settings rather than collections of stats and that spaceship combat should be dramatic window-dressing , a plot device rather than a guillotine hanging over the character 's necks should one of them make a bad roll . <p> Luckily , Eclipse Phase already has the built-in aspect of mind emulation and uploading , so we have a ready alternative . Want to get from Luna to Venus ? Back up your ego , trade in your body , and get securely beamed over to Venus , where you will be downloaded into a new body of your choice . Though such travel is n't necessarily cheap or without its drawbacks , it certainly allows us to bypass some of the problems above . Likewise , if your travel plans do n't exactly require physical activity , you can perhaps get by with sending a fork of yourself , a digital partial copy that you can integrate back in later . <p> This is n't to say that Eclipse Phase wo n't have some details on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things light . If there 's demand , we can always explore it in a supplement . In the meantime , there are easier ways to get around . <p> Space combat is an even trickier beast .

Tracking relativistic movement in a three-dimensional environment where numerous scientific and technological factors ( gravity wells , drive types , targeting systems , weapon ranges , etc ) play an important role is tricky stuff .

I did , and it looks like Luna could handle an atmosphere for a long while . <p> Basically , at the top of the atmosphere molecules are sparse enough that they do n't collide , and instead just move in the planets gravity field . If they have velocity lower than escape velocity they will eventually fall back . But if they are faster , they will escape . The probability of this happening depends on how many are in the tail end of the Maxwell velocity probability distribution , which in turn depends on molecular mass ( heavy stuff moves more slowly ) and temperature ( hotter exospheres leak more ) . <p> Running the numbers for Luna it looks like an Earthlike atmosphere will persist for a very long time . I am not 100% sure of my calculations ( it is easy to drop a factor ) , but I remember that Martyn Fogg 's terraforming book has some estimates for lunar atmospheres . Will check when I get home .

Or is it a collection of boards that are each an individual network ? <p> Are rep networks possibly just an abstraction ? <p> Maybe I 'm just thinking about it the wrong way , but the more I think about how rep networks are portrayed the less sense it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iirc the Rep scores are based across multiple multiple platforms and data types . Closest real world example would be that your Rep is extrapolated from your Facebook &amp; subreddit activities , youtube comments , forum posts , Yelp reviews ... all of it . <p> Any particular distinctions come from the way your muse ( or dedicated softeware , not sure which ) colates and weights the data . <p> " <p> In the past we 've had to compensate for weaknesses , finding quick solutions that only benefit a few . But what if we never need to feel weak or morally conflicted again ? <p> I 'm actually a little confused on the subject . You say you 're not sure you buy " monolithic " ideology for Rep networks , but then talk about how social networks tend to be specialized and super " niche " - but are also ideologically diverse ? Is there a typo in there somewhere , a double negative ? If an actual singular social networking or network element is focused on something " niche " then it 's ethos is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-divide while still being on the same " network " then it 's a diverse community . I think Rep networks are supposed to be very large and thus diversified . <p> Example : @-list contains Scum , Extropians , Anarchists and Titanians . <p> I should not need to go into deep detail about how all those groups should get along like a bag full of cats . The only reason why they 're in the same bag is because there are angrier bags of cats out there they get along with even less . ( And yes , on an ideological level , Ancoms should get along with large state socialism about as well as they get on with ancaps . However the PC is both capitalist AND large state ) . The most ideologically unanimous network would probably have been u-rep , but this is not mentioned in the 2E doc ( along with e-rep ) even though x-rep ( another optional rule ) has been retained so they may not even be implying Ultimates have a formal network . <p> What exactly the various networks look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given how important rep is and how interconnected everything is - it 's probably a bit like how you can use Facebook or Twitter or Google to sign into anything these days . Your social networking hub probably interconnects with lots of littler services over the mesh which you can interact with people on an have rep interactions . The @-list itself might not handle hosting and curating your entire catalog of personal XP production , but whatever form that service takes is linked directly to your @-list profile so you hear about it when people comment or interact with your work , and your rep is the one that goes up if people find this work to be " reputable " . And the rep network probably extracts metadata from that kind of service , so they can turn something like an immense ratio of say , likes to dislikes into a slight uptick in your reputation but for everywhere not Fame rep also probably is not a pure popularity contest , so if all you have is like a cute viral video that 's just " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguity there so GMs can handle the situation as they need . <p> This maybe is a subject which could use some clarification as to the style of though - because Black Mirror is a thing now so everybody new will just compare it to that . <p> The anarchist terrorist group ( Transplanetary Socialist Alliance ? ) is probably not universally beloved by the entire @-rep network . I do n't think rep networks are monolithic . They are probably very generalized , and represent the increased computer/data-processing technologies allowing for a rough approximation of whether you ought to help out this stranger . <p> 90% of transhumanity died ten years ago , there is a good chance that included most of the folks you know , so you need to depend on something for trying to figure out who to trust and who not to , at least until you rebuild your life . <p> I view rep networks like an abstraction . It 's less something like Facebook or Reddit and more your standing within a community . <p> So , for an example , I follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm used to seeing folks post on their feed " Hey , this person sent a follow request , are they alright ? " I imagine the rep score is kinda like that , except much faster due to muses and people most likely leaving with their muse their opinion of someone . <p> Not everyone in a network necessarily approves of someone with a high rep score , but it 's safe to say most do , and that 's all the score means . <p> I view it less as ideological unanimity and more as " similar axis of evaluation . " In other words , high f-Rep does n't mean " all famous people respect you . " It means , " You rate highly in the ways that people currently think of and measure fame . " High r-Rep does n't mean , " All researchers agree with or like you , " just " You are widely published and recognized , and have contributed significantly to your field of study . " <p> When I need to flavor things up , I ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rank its members ? " They may not be explicit and formalized , and they may evolve over time , but those distinct ways of valuing are inherent to what I think of as a given " rep network . " They also differs wildly between , say , g-Rep and i-Rep and f-Rep . What makes someone " buzz-worthy " is not the same as what makes them a reliable fixer when you need to break the law . And what makes someone a reliable fixer is not the same as what makes them a trustworthy member of a clandestine vigilante group . <p> This is also why lots of people are members of multiple rep networks ; it 's not primarily about buying into one particular ideology , although having high rep on one network would indicate that you rank high in its consensus about what is worth tracking . <p> The only way a rep-society could function would be for it to be as homogeneous as possible , so yes , i see rep-networks as congregations of specific ideologies . They will intrinsically repel values/ideas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rep is nothing but a culturally biased opinion on someone in a very specific context . Why you would want to live in an economic system build around this idea is beyond me ... that is , if you 're not the architect of the said system . <p> The only way a rep-society could function would be for it to be as homogeneous as possible , so yes , i see rep-networks as congregations of specific ideologies . <p> Not really . Most of us today belong to lots of different " reputation networks " even though they are n't explicitly tracked . And if a very high-profile member of that reputation network were to contact us and ask for a favor , we 'd be more likely to offer help than if a rando were making the request . <p> That does n't require ideological uniformity inside of each network " just a shared axis on which the rep is based . ( Like " fame " or " Research Contributions " ) . <p> Quote : <p> They will intrinsically repel values/ideas that are outside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , sure . But I think you 're working a very narrow idea of what that means . If I think fame is stupid and parties are a waste of time , I 'm probably going to have low ( or no ) f-rep . Because I 'm rejecting the premise that the network exists on " opting out of its conceptual currency . If I believe in centralized authoritarian control of resources , I 'm not being ' punished ' with low @-rep , I 'm just not on board with the system . <p> But those things do n't mean there is uniformity inside of the network . Anarchists and Hypercorp high-rollers could both have high f-rep . Jovians , Brinkers , and Exhumans could all have high g-rep . <p> UPDATE : Mind you , I " m not arguing that this would be a great/stable economic system . Just that the idea of every rep network being a bucket-of-conformity is based on some misconceptions and oversimplifications of how social groups work . <p> I know the corebook text can be read to say that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where everyone 's smartphone told them how rich and how physically attractive they were relative to everyone else , but I think that 's a bad way to think of the Rep system . <p> Rep is meant to stand for the mutual favor and gift giving that happens outside of monetary exchange , something like the ties of family or tribe . <p> It 's flattened to a single number in a small number of categories because otherwise in gameplay terms it 's both worthless ( you 'd almost never have the rep you needed for a particular interaction ) and painfully complicated ( always have to recalculate exactly where you stand with each sub-faction ) . <p> When I play Rep , the number and Networking roll translates to a very specific kind of connection for that particular interaction , not a general " everyone knows you from the Mesh and loves you " score . One G-rep roll might be leveraging the notoriety of the character in a particular prior criminal act to prove " credit-worthiness " to a seller of illegal items . Another might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character is at least loosely affiliated with and the criminal group of an NPC the character needs a favor from . The higher your Rep , the more of these connections exist and exist with strength to be relied upon . <p> The conclusions I 've come to are drawn from a simple round of game theory . Replace money in any modern society with the rep-system and hit play . How would a shia/sunni -community look from the perspective of reputation ? Israeli/ Syrian ? Indian/ Pakistani ? To me it looks like this : Ethnic and cultural tensions make people vote their own team out of necessity . If they do n't , the other team will , grabbing lion 's share of the available resources that can be acquired through rep . So you do it too , so to not the be left in the dust . Power blocks will emerge . This in turn distorts the concept of rep to the breaking point so that no informed conclusions can drawn from it . Is some dude a good guy , or is he just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can not fix this without somehow erasing ethnic &amp; cultural bias . And you ca n't fix it with AI , since rep is just an opinion . And there are no wrong opinions , right ? <p> What 's at play here is the lowest common denominator in human nature : Self-protection which manifests itself in tribalism . You can have your star trek'ish perfect society that operates in a reputation based system , but the moment you bring in a group that will prioritize their own interests , you will be forced to play their game . <p> There are AI that invent wormholes ( and/or tap into a preexisting network of wormholes ) , quantum computers cost less than a new body . I think an AI or algorithm that can sort out bad faith rep votes is not an impossibility . Entire criminal networks struggle to game the system , and it is portrayed as something that is no small or easy task that it just happens on its own . <p> If you can suspend your disbelief for mind/body dualism , alien slime molds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AI ran system competent enough to prevent people from screwing around with rep could n't be that hard . Especially since no rep network is so miniature as a single habitat or small enough that it does n't exceed that primate number where you no longer feel the tribal identity . <p> The entire point of rep is : your ethnic group and tribal family are all but gone , cold storage or just perma-dead , you encounter someone who belongs to roughly the samd poli group , can you trust them based on mutual values ? Rep economies do n't do much in densely populated areas . The explanation for their prevalence in the Outer System is explained by the staggeringly low population density in Outer System . Within a tiny hab , sure , power blocs form , but rep is n't for internal economies , thosr are ran on whatever ad hoc committee democracy they all agree to . Rep economies exist so people who on occasion move between these habs can get along . <p> It is a distillation of networking , social media , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fact that Extropians ( AnCaps ) , Titanians ( Statist **26;1721;TOOLONG ) , Scum ( Anarcho-libertines ? ) , and Anarchists ( usually AnCom ) , all use @-rep goes to show you the diverse opinions that are encompassed by one network . <p> Without a sufficiently advanced AI and computing power , this would be pretty impossible . <p> But so is nanotech , wormholes made of lovecraftian horror , slimemolds with FTL , etc etc . <p> The way I 've always seen the Rep networks is that they are the inevitable end result of the switch to Mesh Networks . Since few server farms exist anymore , partially from practicality and partially from a fear of the Titans , websites like Facebook and Google are no longer practical in every day life . The result is , any " sites " that continue to exist have to be built to have bits and pieces of their crucial code spread out across numerous mesh nodes . <p> The Rep networks , therefore , exist to accomplish several tasks at once . The first is the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negative association with certain people or pieces of information , as if it were a social network . The second is handling the bizarre and complicated task of retrieving and assigning information across the many mesh nodes needed to store all the information held across the mesh . A single website or blog may be held within , say , @-list , but that just tells you which routing protocol needed to correctly retrieve that site from the appropriate mesh nodes . There may even be an effort to spread out and back up information across many nodes based on a highly positive rating . <p> As a result of THAT mess , the main difference between a given network is less the groups that use it , but how it handles the complex assignment algorithms needed . The groups that use a given network chose it as a side effect of their political alignment favoring certain ways of weighing certain priorities . @-list is favored by Anarchists because it favors blogs , political rants , and the organization of work groups ( or similar organizations ) .

And so on . <p> Professional reputation of translators and translation outsourcers : BlueBoard at ProZ.com <p> All purpose reputation system : Yelp , Inc . <p> Academia : general bibliometric measures , e.g. the h-index of a researcher . <p> In terms of rep economies in the EP sense , the closest we as a society come is probably in credit score calculations , referrals/investigations for high profile white-collar jobs , and certain public services . <p> TheGrue wrote : <p> Are rep networks possibly just an abstraction ? <p> Not only are they absolutely 100% an abstraction , but we all--and by all , I mean even people who are ignorant of the issue--think that they are .

C-rep might have systems in place for hiding things based on which corporation or local government you work for , and then assigning security clearance . @-list might require a citizen code to post to a given hab 's planning forums ( but reading it is open to anyone of course ) . RNA 's anti-spam protocol could include a system to prevent or discourage people accidentally going on a drunken rant about a subject they do n't actually know much about . <p> If you can suspend your disbelief for mind/body dualism , alien slime molds in FTL ships , and magic-space-wizards via Asyncs , surely an AI ran system competent enough to prevent people from screwing around with rep could n't be that hard . Especially since no rep network is so miniature as a single habitat or small enough that it does n't exceed that primate number where you no longer feel the tribal identity . <p> But it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I might favor a certain person/service because of my background . By doing that i would also deny pings to a potentially better service . They would be punished because of factors beyond their control . How could an AI ( or anyone for that matter ) possibly handle a situation like that to facilitate fair outcome ? It 's not possible . Unless you let the AI do your decisions for you , bias will always control you to a degree . The question is , how much , and to that I would argue : a lot . <p> I remember reading a study about how values are imprinted into people and at what age . I ca n't remember the name of the study or any exact data ( I 'm sure you 'll find it with Google ) , but my point is that this happens . We can for example predict that the current migration wave into Europe will result into enclaves &amp; ghettos in the long run because the people coming here have already crossed that age where their cultural identities have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will be extremely challenging . ( historically it has never worked on this scale ) . <p> Let 's go back to EP . We have dislocated people from across the world , limited resources ( no matter what they tell you ! ) and very limited living space : An environment primed for tribalism . Many establishments have adopted this strategy ( very successfully ) in EP ; Titan would n't be what it is without cultural cohesion . I see this as natural development . <p> So here 's my point : If we accept that culture plays a major role in society and human interactions , then the very concept of rep economy is dead on arrival , especially when you expand it to cover multiple different cultures . <p> Maybe the aggregator AI/algorithms can identify when your biases might be influencing it ? <p> What I am arguing is that regardless of how impossible these concepts are , we accept them because they are part of the game . <p> To use a different game 's example , Shadowrun 's wireless matrix exists on defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because it is part of the game . <p> Rep economies may be as impossible as you claim , I am skeptical of all of this , but the rep economies are part of the game . Run your games where the rep economies only appear to work , or maybe they are a Promethean scheme , only seeming to function because of post-singularity intelligences . <p> Or try and run the game without I guess . Whatever works for you . <p> I 'm holding out on the continued development of ( trans ) human social evolution . <p> Your argument that rep economies are dead on arrival because of human nature 's inherent biases should also apply to the current cash/credit economy used on modern earth . Despite a significant degree of inequity , the current economy does function . This implies that the tribalism of humans is insufficient to eliminate non-dominant tribe members from the economy ( though the system is obviously unfair ) . <p> uwtartarus already touched on this , but here 's a simple example of AI being able to build a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some ethnicity B , and you never ping the rep of members of that ethnicity , the AI notices . It notices all your pings go to members of your ethnicity A instead . For every two pings by you to a member of ethnicity A , the AI gives one ping to the member of ethnicity A , and one ping to a member of ethnicity B ( proportional to their current rep standing , so relative utility is preserved ) . <p> In this crude example , your bias actually makes your ping weaker in highlighting the members of ethnicity A that are the most useful , but a more complex system can handle that properly . <p> You may be arguing that AI is incapable of noticing the bias , but that 's a very unlikely position to take . <p> Rep economies are a lot like gift economies , which work fine in a tribalistic setting . I do n't see how tribalism makes a rep economy untenable . <p> The standards for a rep economy are pretty ridiculous as well , it 's basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one is really rational , or has perfect information . <p> That is a good point , Rep economies are high tech gift economies . <p> Not only that but the Fall killed 90% of the population , and ethnic identities are so threatened by that pop decline AND the ubiquity of resleeving that to be a member of an ethnic group in a high pop region like Mars , all you need to do is act the part and you are in . <p> Rep economies are not stymied by tribalism , they would CREATE tribalism , as each separate rep network is a the new tribal identity . Even where nationalism still has a chance of being meaningful , Luna , there is no indication that the Hindi-Lunars do n't get along with Anglo-American-Lunars , or the Sino-Lunars . Lunars are united by their " we are the oldest extraterrestrial culture " and their disdain for clanking masses , and not divided into their ethnic groups . On Mars there is a lot of people but so many resleeved that ethnic identities mean performance of ethnic norms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are others in your rep network wo n't like them either , and the system will account for that . <p> I have no problem with the science of EP ; if it 's inaccurate , so be it . If the laws of physics work differently in EP , that 's fine . The only real connection between our world and EP ( or any other fantasy world for that matter ) is the human being . To me fantasy is about how we mold and adapt into different realities . What would it look like if we could make forks of ourselves ? What would happen ? I 've already laid out how i would see a rep based economy play out . One could argue it 's physics : we 'll find the path of least resistance within any given system . Burn as few calories as possible to extract maximum benefits . In the case of a rep economy that makes a one way trip to hyper inflation , not unlike in your standard MMORPG 's . <p> Perhaps the whole concept of rep ( as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the game . Maybe I 'm wrong . The fact that we do n't have detail information about as important system as this to the society at large tells me otherwise . Because once you start asking questions , you 'll only find more questions . <p> Let me paint you a picture : Let 's assume that the AI is up to the task , whatever that means in the realm of subjectivity of opinions . It will know if you are dishonest ( consciously or unconsciously ) and it will take in account everything you 've ever done and said and thought to come up with an accurate way to rate your character . It monitors the pings you send out and then modifies them accordingly to smooth out any human factors that might affect the score . It knows you better than you do . In fact it will most probably be able to predict your every step and every word that comes out of your mouth . If your economic well being is controlled by this AI , would you take suggestions from it how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting access to these AI 's ? Since the AI would have to make value judgements that ca n't be solved with math , what would be the default right answers be ? Who would program them in and why those answers in particular ? Do you think this is a good idea ? The AI would have to be able to reach this level of " analytics " in order for the system to work . If it could n't , well , rep would n't mean anything because of inherent bias that 's included in the now-inaccurate-rep score . I do n't know witch of these options is scarier . <p> OK , that sounded snarkier than I intended . ; - ) What I mean is that you 're describing a system by which work , entertainment , favors , and other ways of cultivating goodwill are given numerical value so that they can be stockpiled , used as a measure of individual trustworthiness or success , and exchanged for reciprocal material goods or favors at a later point . It sounds awesome in principle , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would n't peoples ' behavior change in response to the codification and enumeration of value that 's inherent in such a system ? Would n't they ultimately just become slaves to the whims of whatever inhuman systems act as arbiters of value ? <p> Yes ! Which is the critique of ' money ' that a lot of anticapitalists are eager to jump into . Rep markets would n't bypass any of these problems inherently , any more than Bitcoin 's novel algorithms freed people from the tyranny of labor . But in a post-scarcity fabber-rich environment , they do provide an interesting way to couple a currency-like system to distributed factions and sociopolitical groups , rather than nation-states , which fits really well with EP 's themes . <p> Let me paint you a picture : Let 's assume that the AI is up to the task , whatever that means in the realm of subjectivity of opinions .

I do n't know witch of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of AI that would have turned into a TITAN during the fall and ensured that the Fall already knew what moves the humans were going to make . <p> I would venture that the modern rep net AIs are not that strong , they would n't be able to predict the words that come out of your mouth that well . It has to go by past actions , not predicted futures . <p> A person posts a Thing on their rep network . Other people see it , and either uprate the Thing or downrate it - possibly leaving comments on why , or try to bait out the poster into a flame-war . A persons score on their network is a general agregate of all the things they 've posted , done or participated in . Favours , providing material goods and the like obviously weight heavily in this interpretation - and people could research how likely a person is to help or offer favours for exchange by doing some mesh searching . <p> Bandwagoning by personalities to mass downvote others for no reason would still be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of @-List ) that mutual ' rep-trashing ' is a common way to punish/get back at someone . <p> Other takes include things like C-Rep being your public investments portfolio combined with your credit score and such-like . <p> As for the biases and whatnot : they absolutely would happen , because they already are happening . It 's doubtful that Transhmanity in the far future would be any more enlightened or responsible with their Reps than we are with the social media of today ( granted the lack of anonymity would stand out as an issue - one that can still be circumvented ) . <p> If in doubt though , the MST3K Mantra applies : It 's just a game , I really should relax . <p> Given that the game 's Rep scores are percentiles between 0 and 100 , I suspect that in-setting , they 're the same . I suspect that some decades in the past , some clever programmers came up with some tricks to estimate and update Bayesian probabilities for some metrics that approximated ' how likely Person X will do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-order effects ( such as ' how likely Person X will do something that helps person Y who can then help me ' ) , after which a plethora of such metrics arose that each took into account slightly different things , after which networking effects meant that a few rep-systems which a few more people gathered greater portions of the population until they became near-monopolies despite the fact that what they measured and what people thought they measured were oddly not quite synced , by which time people just got in the habit of keeping track of which actions would increase or decrease their own rep scores ( which was reasonably close to what such scores were supposed to track in the first place ) . Throw in a few other buzzwords such as blockchain-based distributed accounting ledgers , anonymous trust platforms , monolithic rep trackers getting destroyed during the fall leaving only the networks that can be run by a distributed client-base , and so on ... and we end up with something close enough to what I 've read so far in the EP books that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being glossed over . <p> I imagine f-rep being incredibly volatile at the low levels ( it 's easy to go from 0 to 20 in a single afternoon , but climbing from 20 to 40 is a real full-time-job kind of slog , and once you hit 60+ , it 'll take a major act of genocide to burn rep ) . Slow decay if you are n't visible to the masses has more impact at the high levels than any specific action . <p> I view rep networks like an abstraction .

Whenever I 've considered rep , it 's less reddit karma and more just ... well , your reputation . It 's like ... if I 'm in a group , and a well known person within it asks me to help with something , I 'll likely make time to do so , whether out of gratitude for what they 've done or in hopes that being seen with them will reflect positively on my own reputation .

They 're likely to browse the net for reports about people helping or hurting members of the community , so if you run into someone you may ask your muse " Hey ... is this guy cool ? " and get a general gist of whether they 've been helping out fellow artists set up venues , an up and coming pop idol , or a backstabbing son of a bitch . Similarly if you 're new to an area yourself , you may ping other muses ( or people themselves , but muses are likely faster to respond ) to see their opinion of someone .

@@29835176 @3535176/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Spacecraft in Eclipse Phase <p> Submitted by eclipseadmin on We 'd , 2008-06-25 12:00 <p> One of the problems any space-faring sci-fi game has to deal with is how to handle space travel and space combat . Both of these can be significant glitches in an RPG setting . Space travel can mean a long delay between action , as the players must board a ship to get from one setting locale to another . Planets and space stations are not stationary objects , however , and so travel time can very between the same two places by a matter of months or more , as their orbits take them nearer to or further from each other . Add in the many different types of potential spaceship drives , and you have another complication . Some games deal with this by including charts and complex mathematics , actually requiring you to do the math to figure out how long your journey from Mars to Saturn will take . <p> Space combat is an even trickier beast . There are entire games built around space combat alone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in a three-dimensional environment where numerous scientific and technological factors ( gravity wells , drive types , targeting systems , weapon ranges , etc ) play an important role is tricky stuff . On top of this , if you 're seeking to be realistic , than space combat is likely to be a deadly affair . One missile or well-aimed laser or even a high-speed collision with some debris can mean the end of your ship " and your whole party of PCs along with it . And the role of the characters within space combat is yet another issue " quite often , unless it 's a game heavy in space combat " your character may have no role to play within the battle . It 's not unusual for the lives of an entire team of PCs to rest upon a couple of die rolls made by the one player who happens to be the pilot or gunner . <p> When designing Eclipse Phase , our goal was to minimize all of this fuss . We did n't want long journeys between stations to drag out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game with complex space combat rules . We feel spaceships should be treated as settings rather than collections of stats and that spaceship combat should be dramatic window-dressing , a plot device rather than a guillotine hanging over the character 's necks should one of them make a bad roll . <p> Luckily , Eclipse Phase already has the built-in aspect of mind emulation and uploading , so we have a ready alternative . Want to get from Luna to Venus ? Back up your ego , trade in your body , and get securely beamed over to Venus , where you will be downloaded into a new body of your choice . Though such travel is n't necessarily cheap or without its drawbacks , it certainly allows us to bypass some of the problems above . Likewise , if your travel plans do n't exactly require physical activity , you can perhaps get by with sending a fork of yourself , a digital partial copy that you can integrate back in later . <p> This is n't to say that Eclipse Phase wo n't have some details on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such things light . If there 's demand , we can always explore it in a supplement . In the meantime , there are easier ways to get around . <p> Space combat is an even trickier beast . There are entire games built around space combat alone , and most of them are quite complex . Tracking relativistic movement in a three-dimensional environment where numerous scientific and technological factors ( gravity wells , drive types , targeting systems , weapon ranges , etc ) play an important role is tricky stuff .

Things such as cutting torches , which are going to be permitted on most any habitat , even ones which forbid all weapons . <p> Well , page 202 of EP has the baseball , bottle , broken bottle , chain , helmet , plasma torch , and wrench stats for use as weapons .

If they have velocity lower than escape velocity they will eventually fall back . But if they are faster , they will escape . The probability of this happening depends on how many are in the tail end of the Maxwell velocity probability distribution , which in turn depends on molecular mass ( heavy stuff moves more slowly ) and temperature ( hotter exospheres leak more ) . <p> Running the numbers for Luna it looks like an Earthlike atmosphere will persist for a very long time .

Say if someone sends 4 disassembler swarms after you ... can the guardians engage all of them at once or only one while the others go to work ? <p> While the guardian swarm is defending , do the disassemblers still get to damage whatever they were programmed to , or do they have to stop and engage with the Guardians ? <p> If the former , then Guardians become a much less potent defense , and I 've noticed none of the NPCs tend to carry more than one Guardian swarm which suggests the latter .. that the Guardians damage the enemy swarm(s) while preventing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former however then taking averages , it is going to take on average about 9 rounds for the Guardians to completely destroy the disassemblers , which would then meanwhile have had a chance to do on average 54 DUR damage to your armor and likely you ... meaning you are most likely dead . <p> So , to make Guardians a viable defense , it would seem to require the latter interpretation ... that Guardians are effective at stopping any swarms from doing their job , being specialized anti-nanite nanites . <p> It also makes sense that a Guardian swarm would protect against any and all incoming swarms ... otherwise it is going to become a matter of who has the most swarms in play , a sort of swarm-supremeacy arms race . <p> Lastly ... can one program disassemblers to attack guardians or other nanoswarms ... which would make them effectively more expensive disassemblers ? <p> If I 'm wrong , and a swarm can only engage one swarm at a time , then one might need several swarms of guardian swarms on one 's person . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very deadly ... I 'm thinking like having 6 sab swarms and 6 disassembler swarms to send after people , all the while picking off at them with sniper-rail-guns ... <p> Can a single guardian swarm protect you from all incoming swarms ? Say if someone sends 4 disassembler swarms after you ... can the guardians engage all of them at once or only one while the others go to work ? <p> Swarming nanomachines act locally - they have no good long-range communications . This means that each piece of a Guardian swarm can not know what is being engaged elsewhere , and will just do its job locally . So this would mean the swarm will just gobble up enemy nanomachines with no care for which swarm they originated in : just split the damage evenly . <p> Quote : <p> While the guardian swarm is defending , do the disassemblers still get to damage whatever they were programmed to , or do they have to stop and engage with the Guardians ? <p> Again , nanomachines act locally . A disassembler will not " know " about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while being continually reduced . <p> Quote : <p> So , to make Guardians a viable defense , it would seem to require the latter interpretation ... that Guardians are effective at stopping any swarms from doing their job , being specialized anti-nanite nanites . <p> But this does not make physical sense . So at least in my games I will not use it . Yes , Guardians are limited , but their main use is against stray nanomachines and infiltration , not dense swarms . When dense attackers are noticed , habitats launch serious defence systems . You do n't want to be in a dense swarm battle anyway , since the heat and toxin production is likely quite damaging on its own ... <p> As far as I know , swarms are " area effect " weapons , meaning a guardian swarm does n't stop a dissamble swarm from dissasembling you . So yeah , just one guardian swarm does n't do much more than alert you that an enemy swarm is in the area and give you a fighting chance -- and I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms is a multi-step process . It is n't easy . The first line of defense is good intelligence and infosec , so you know what 's coming . The second line of defense is a good offense , along with swarms of your own . The third line of defense is carrying lots and lots of EMP and plasma weaponry , usually on micromissiles . The last line of defense is carrying *at least* one guardian hive , and using that hive to support many many guardian swarms . <p> And yes , swarms may be one of the deadliest weapons in the book , along with nuclear and antimatter missiles . As my Sentinel group delved into tougher and tougher battles -- we 're talking planetary scale annihilation events against rogue Firewall agents here -- we found ourselves relying increasingly on infosec hacking , and swarms and swarms of swarms , along with delivery mechanisms for those swarms ( drones and missiles ) .

Warfare is a different creature in the future of Eclipse Phase . <p> Mostly I 'm interested in having a viable defense against nanoswarms being used to attack my gear . <p> Apparently according to these replies one guardian swarm is not going to cut it . <p> How many guardian swarms can a specialized guardian swarm hive support then ? Do I need to buy separate hives for each guardian swarm ? <p> Sounds like I would need many many of them ( preferably implanted ) to protect myself and my stuff . <p> I would argue that if you have a guardian swarm around you , it would send you a signal when it engaged the enemy , so you would know ( aside from seeing your armor start to dissolve ) . <p> I wish Guardians could actually protect you though ... since as my number crunching shows even a single disassembler swarm sent at you is going to disintegrate you before the guardians will kill them . Unless you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are n't going to hose yourself down with plasma ! I can however see using emp micromissles/grenades that you can pull the pin on while holding to damage a swarm that is on you . One thing it says is that EMP weapons impose a -20 on the swarms actions ... yet I see no stats for swarms that would be effected ... they do n't roll to attack you , they just do straight damage ... so what is the impact of this clause for EMPs ? <p> Agreed that seeing the swarm coming can help , but it wo n't help much if someone has weaponized them against you ( Buzzers , splash bullets , or nanotats as I saw someone suggest elsewhere here ) . <p> Hmm ... for my next character inspiration I am going to make a nanotech combat specialist ... <p> It 's good that you are starting to think through the implications of swarm combat .

Backup your guardians with fixer swarms that can repair any damage you DO take . <p> And yeah , the swarm mechanics are n't very well defined . That -20 does nothing that I 'm aware of . Another issue ran into was , can swarms be hacked ? Can they be controlled after launch ? The book seems to suggest they can be controlled , and the technology seems to support this : after all , scout swarms can communicate , and any swarm that can communicate can be controlled and therefore presumably hacked . So , Infosec might be able to help . Hacking *is* the most powerful weapon in the game , bar none . <p> Yeah I read somewhere on here about a character someone had made who was a Triad/Yakuza assassin who killed people by using nanoswarms contolled by Delta forks of his own ego , disguised as tattoos when not in use . <p> I like this so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my own purposes . <p> I 'm also going to take the money I spent on a guardian nanoswarm hive for my Gatecrasher character and use the money to purchase emp grendaes ... sure he does n't have much in the way of thrown weapons or skill using seekers , but if their primary purpose is for him to " detonate " them in his hand when he becomes aware of a hostile swarm then it does n't much matter ... last ditch defense . <p> It 's good that you are starting to think through the implications of swarm combat .

Hacking *is* the most powerful weapon in the game , bar none . <p> In that case , may I present to you : <p> Concept : Bug/Hunter <p> Bio in Brief : <p> Legion was originally an AI designed by an Argonaut scientist to study nanotech swarm dynamics and control . Unfortunately said scientist was assassinated ... and his backups erased ... by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well ... since Madwand said that guns are chump weapons and hacking is the most powerful weapon , I thought I might combine the two for my latest entry . <p> As both a skilled hacker/infiltrator and combat character , I really ca n't go wrong with this one . I 'll always have something of value to contribute . <p> The " Infomade " morph is a custom morph I came up with that is simply a Remade morph but with a +10 to COO instead of COG . I wanted to max out COG and WIL so that even as just an infomorph he can hack in style , but retains that ability in his morph . I also got rid of the uncanny valley trait since that is largely an affectation of the Ultimates who originally designed the remade and morphs can look like pretty much whatever . He also took a biomorph to stave off cyberbrain hacking and has a ghostrider module where an alpha or beta fork can run mesh operations simultaneously with him . As per the inspiration above , he probably has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning , he is pretty much the Jovian 's worst nightmare . : P <p> Essentially he has the blueprints to stick into his fabber and make nano-hives of various sorts ( more to be gained in game ) . He churns out disassembler nanites from said hive and sticks them into splash bullets with them programmed to attack whatever they hit . For defense he will have around 10 or so guardian hives on him at any given time as well as an underbarrel launcher for plasmaburst weapons . Nanodetector for early warning . : ) <p> If you want to play with nanoswarms , then there is a weapon you might want to look into . Its called the buzzer ( core rulebook , p. 341 ) . It is a spray weapon that fires nanoswarms . It says that it can store up to 3 nanoswarms as ammunition . It also says it can be equipped ( and normally is ) with a specialized nanohive , which can produce a new swarm in 1 hour . <p> On the topic of the production of nanoswarms . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nanoswarms last 2 weeks , then a single nanohive should to be able to produce and support up to 336 nanoswarms at any given time ( 1 nanoswarm per hour*24 hours per day*14 days = 336 ) . <p> I would like to know how much mass a nanoswarm has , and how volume it would occupy when stored ( not deployed ) . <p> I know of the buzzer and consider it an inferior weapon . Inferior range , payload , and therefore effectiveness . With a kinetic weapon firing splat rounds containing swarms , I can shoot 3 swarms per action in burst fire mode , or 10 in full auto . That 's damage comparable to a plasma rifle ... that will multiply each round when I hit them again . Meanwhile their armor , weapons , communications are hosed , and they are likely being hacked by the fork in my ghost module . <p> 2 ) How visible are they ? Without a nanodetector , can I look at all the tons of nanites and see a faint fog , or is it clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Likely depends on the size and density . Obviously , if you have a ton of nanites in the air of a room it will look like it is full of smoke . Nanites larger than 0.5 micron will start to diffract light ( at this size they mainly scatter blue light , think cigarette smoke ) and above 0.75 micron they will scatter red too - this scattering might produce a colored mist effect . Larger nanites will start to produce a cloud effect ( since scattering increases with the sixth power of the particle size , and you get multiple reflections ) when their density gets big enough . <p> Loose calculation : suppose we have N nanites per cubic meter . They have radius r . The total cross sectional area is pi N r2 . When this is about 1 m2 , the nanites start becoming opaque . Now , assume a 2 micron nanite ( r=10-6 m ) . You need 3*1011 nanites . If they have diamond density that is about 4.6 grams . Larger nanomachines can have heavier yet invisible swarms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few grams or more , since the nanites need to carry with them energy to do what is essentially chemical reactions - their total weight will need to correspond to some fraction of the material they are attacking . Guardians can be much lighter since they might just sabotage nanites , but if they are to act like disassemblers for enemy nanites the same rule of thumb is needed . <p> A few things to consider , first the damage of a dissasember swarm will do on average is 3 , not 6 . The average of a d10 is 5.5 , divided by 2 is 2.25 , rounded up is 3 . This means an enemy with 30 DUR will have an average 10 rounds to act , depending on initiative and assuming he is wearing no armor . This means a dissasembler swarm will kill 30 durability unarmored targets anywhere from 18 seconds to 1 minute 30 seconds . <p> Honestly , the best defense is just to not stand in a swarm . They are more likely handled as a area denial weapons than anything else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they wo n't follow unless they are told to . <p> As for the best defense if you want to stand in one , a combination of reactive armor and gaurdian swarm would do a really decent job . Toss in a EMP grenade and all you really lost was a little armor rating and communications for a bit . <p> As for the character and relevance to the topic . <p> A buzzer is a weapon that is built to release a swarm , I doubt one splash round can house the equal amount to one swarm . If someone could clarify this better , I would appreciate it . <p> Let 's for argument sake assume each splash round can house a swarm , you still need to program each swarm prior to releasing them ( page 328 ) . Each splat bullet also needs to be refilled every 2 weeks or the swarm will be dead . <p> Now the time constraint , each hive will take about four to five hours to produce through nanofabrication , they fall in between high and expensive , page 285 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullets , which I see being hard since the smallest special hive is a 12 gauge shell size , it would take you about 80 hours to 100 hours to produce a full SMG clip . Than they need to be programmed prior to releasing them . <p> As for hacking in combat , defeating a firewall is handled as a 10 minute task action . It will take some time . <p> As for hacking in combat , defeating a firewall is handled as a 10 minute task action .

While you might be faster the system your hacking is n't . <p> According to what I understand about about doing task actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does actually help . For example , higher speed and/or mental speed help you hack faster . It 's not a terrible house rule to say this is n't the case , though it does devalue these augmentations for those who have them . <p> To reinforce TadanoriOyama point , much like the reason mental speed let 's you take more mental actions , while multitasking let 's your take more mental and mesh actions . <p> Just because you think faster , does n't mean you can interface with something faster . <p> View it like this , the device , keyboard and mouse in my case , must be interacted with before anything happens . Wither or not I take 1 minute or one hour to think on it , the amount of time I must spend pressing keys will stay the same if the same action occurs . <p> I understand your point , even if I disagree with it . Your example was not helpful . If you can point out a reference in the rules to say that extra actions do not help , that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , such as programming . This is an entirely mental action that does not require interfacing with any other device outside your head . In this case , it should be obvious that extra speed , particularly mental speed , should help . Yet ; the rules do not call out any kinds of different task actions , do not differentiate between task actions in which extra speed helps vs. actions in which it does not . <p> This is why I think ruling that extra actions does not help is a reasonable house rule , but I do not think it reflects the rules . <p> ... This augmentation can produce a maximum of two forks at a time , giving the character an extra two Complex Actions on every Action Phase for mental or on-line actions . ... <p> Mental Speed ( Page 308 ) wrote : <p> ... When using this augmentation , the character gains two extra Complex Actions during each Action Phase that may only be used for mental actions . ... <p> This give me the idea that mental and on-line actions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> However , I would agree that if everything is internal , no outside interactions taking place , perhaps the extra mental actions would assist . Admittedly I do waver some on this to either way and largely still remain undecided on my own interpretations . <p> It is in essence the only reason to take multitasking over mental speed , as they both cost the same . <p> However , if you are interacting with an external object for your programming , I would be of the thought it would not . It would assist in planning perhaps , but not the actual programming . <p> Honestly , not all the rules are set in stone and can be easily adjust to your own feelings of how it should play out . <p> Although , depending on how you handle reducing a task actions time scale via modifiers to 0% ( which is possible with the current Infosec rules ) , it is still possible . Just very , very difficult . And unreliable <p> Ah , will need to reread the hacking portion again , must have missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 120 , where you could reduce it to 40% the original time by taking a -60 to the test . <p> Take you for pointing this out , sometime the rules are very scattered around with exceptions . <p> You combine it with the rules that reduce timescale further depending on your MoS. 60% off by rushing the job , and then another 40% off by getting an MoS of 40 . It was easier to do before the 3rd Printing errata , but still possible now . <p> I agree , there is quite a lot of room for interpretation in the rules . Your distinction between multi-tasking and mental speed is interesting ; I actually make the distinction in the opposite direction . For me , mental speed increases the mental speed of a single ego for any mental action , which includes " online " actions . Multi-tasking on the other hand is only good for , well , multi-tasking . Having those extra actions performed by other egos might give you a bonus for having assistants , but wo n't directly increase your speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and regardless of your interpretation , having higher normal speed from neurochem or the like will still making hacking attempts go faster . <p> Interesting , I wonder however if it would effect the max time or the new time by the 40% . <p> Ergo , would it be 10 reduced by 60% plus 40% equaling 0 seconds , or 10 reduced by 60% than 40% equaling 2 minutes and 24 seconds . I am more inclined to the last one , but will look into it more . <p> @Madwand , <p> My thoughts are founded that some physical ( either ecto , augmented reality , etc ) must transpire for the mesh/online interaction . So no matter how fast one ego would think , he is limited due to his ability to use said mediums . I will agreed speed boosting implants help , mainly due to increased ability to operate such things . <p> I think the main view point that effects me most is , online actions are not driven by mental thought alone . Hence the ability to use things will eventually become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why I also view multitasking allows multiple online actions is the separate egos can still interact on a electronic level as well as think on their own , while the mental speed is still limited by its ability to interact with speed one . <p> While I still hold my views , I will have to reassess at them some . <p> EDIT : <p> One last thing , reading the intro to the mesh , most users get mesh information from the AR . The value of this is as such , while the mental speed only still retains one AR , the multiple egos have their own AR , thus can operate on their own . <p> Largely posted to strengthen my point that the bottleneck is interfacing related , not mental speed of the ego . <p> I agree , there is quite a lot of room for interpretation in the rules . Your distinction between multi-tasking and mental speed is interesting ; I actually make the distinction in the opposite direction . For me , mental speed increases the mental speed of a single ego for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Multi-tasking on the other hand is only good for , well , multi-tasking . Having those extra actions performed by other egos might give you a bonus for having assistants , but wo n't directly increase your speed . The implants do different things , IMO . <p> Oh , and regardless of your interpretation , having higher normal speed from neurochem or the like will still making hacking attempts go faster . <p> I 'm unconvinced that raw speed can make a major change to Task Actions . The system already accounts for being quicker or more efficient in your actions when undertaking a Task Action by having the MoS reduce the total time . Extra relievent actions might provide a bonus ( +10 or +20 ) or allow for a " free " reduction of one or two degrees ; I do n't think they will reduce the total time by something drastic , such as cutting it in half . <p> A few things to consider , first the damage of a dissasember swarm will do on average is 3 , not 6 .

I 'm not putting a hive itself into each bullet . Rather I would program the hive to configure the swarm output into a small cylinder that would be filled into the splash round . It would still take some time to manually fill the rounds , but not nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the programming conditions at the time I create the swarm-rounds . <p> In my example , each swarm does 3 damage on average per round , so a full auto burst would do on average 30 damage per round , and with full auto , smartlinks , and accushot splash rounds they will almost certainly hit the target . They next round it would be 60 damage if I hit them with a second burst ... 60 average damage per round is going to eat through anything damn quickly . As a failsafe I would probably program them to die off a few phases after being activated , or after whatever they hit has been obliterated . <p> For more fun have one out of every three rounds be saboteurs that are preprogrammed to go after comm and weapon systems . <p> Of course these weaponized swarms would be in addition to the personal swarms he keeps on him that he can program on the fly ( using mental speed and/or multitasking ) to do precision work , like someone mentioned attacking the bolts holding the joints of a synth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EP system so far , it is designed to be fast and loose and reward this level of creativity . <p> I know of the buzzer and consider it an inferior weapon .

Meanwhile their armor , weapons , communications are hosed , and they are likely being hacked by the fork in my ghost module . <p> Splat rounds likely have a smaller capacity than the buzzer or sprayer with regards to how big a swarm payload they can deliver at a time . That would be the one benefit that the buzzer might have over splat rounds . <p> Madwand wrote : <p> According to what I understand about about doing task actions , being able to take more actions in less time does actually help .

The game rules do n't actually touch on the subject at all . In any way . There is n't any suggestion from the devs on how they intend high speed characters and task actions to interact . What you are describing is an extremely common house rule , such that it appears so often it may as well be RAW . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed characters to concentrate on multiple task actions at once ( multiple hacks going on at the same time ) , it is thematically acceptable , and it is n't OP in anyway . <p> Edit : There is actually a little bit of advise on page 190 , in that it states you can not accomplish a complex action and a task action during the same action phase . But it is ambiguous . <p> Splat rounds likely have a smaller capacity than the buzzer or sprayer with regards to how big a swarm payload they can deliver at a time .

The buzzer is a two handed weapon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The advantage here of course would be that at close range you could hose down an area or more than one person , and everything in the area would begin to take the swarm damage . <p> It 's just that you would think a weapon the size of a shotgun could hold many specialized hives worth ... maybe 10 or so going by some modern standards . That is -10- specialized hives in one two handed weapon , and say each hive held only one swarm ... that would give you at least 10 shots .... of a whole hive . Realisitically a weapon that big should have a much larger ammo capacity . Again , I think it is simply a poorly thought out and incredibly underwhelming weapon . Why would I want a weapon that is super short range and will do -at most- 9 damage per round to my targets ? If I 'm in danger and want t a serious weapon I would as a player -never- take a buzzer . At that range , a shredder would beat it every time . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be deadly ? Yes . As someone else pointed out they can be one of the most lethal aspects of the game . <p> Why would I want a weapon that is super short range and will do -at most- 9 damage per round to my targets ? If I 'm in danger and want t a serious weapon I would as a player -never- take a buzzer . At that range , a shredder would beat it every time . <p> You might want it in a situation where you would like to deploy a swarm at range and not also shot it with a bullet . A buzzer does n't fill the same role as a gun with fillable rounds , it is simply a weapon designed to deploy swarms . The shredder would certainly do more damage in a similar situation and if damage is the goal then the shredder is the better weapon for the job . It 's a specialized tool . <p> A Shredder at close range with a full auto burst would do what ... 6d10+5 with -10 ap . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target is wearing minus 10 . <p> A full auto burst of 10 disassembler rounds could be done at far ranges ( using accushots ) and would do on average 30 damage per round ... eating away at the armor itself , and then going after the person inside afterwards in following rounds . <p> The Shredder kills the person in the first round in this example , the swarm in the second . <p> Though I agree ... spraying with a buzzer would have uses beyond just shooting people . I still think it is a poorly thought out weapon/swarm delivery system . <p> With my way , I could have a clip of fixers and shoot them at allies . hee ! <p> And what about and I know this is a crazy , borderline insane , idea : what if you do n't want to kill someone ? <p> I 'm engaging in hyperbole here in an effort to make a point . Killing someone is not the end all of weapon design and certainly not the universal goal of a Firewall agent . Different situations call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suited to the same function . <p> Maybe I just want to deploy a swarm in a given place and position . The bullet will touch whatever it hits with the swarm and it will stay there . That certainly has a place ; it is n't that helpful for placing a swarm in three dimensional space ( i.e. the bullet has to hit something ) . <p> My issue with the character is n't method of fight at all . I think it embraced the ideals of Eclipse Phase well . I am aware they are deadly , do its a well crafted explosive and many other things . <p> My issue really is the method of delivery . While the exact size needed to house a nanoswarm is never stated , nor the size which splash bullets can contain , it is however hinted at . A splash kinetic ammo can house paint , taggant nanobots , tracker dye , and similar substances , page 338 . While a splash grenade can hold drug , chemical , nanoswarm , paint , page 341 . <p> You assumed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm , I believe you assumed wrong and stated as such . No evidence says either of us a directly wrong , however my interpretation of what is there points to this not being the case . <p> This is in essence what criticism is , I am not saying your wrong , only that I perceive that you made a fault or mistake and am point it out . I can disagree with an aspect , splash ammo can contain nanoswarms , but that does n't mean I disagree with the whole concept . <p> Also , the leaving a nanoswarm was in reference to the original question posed , yes you can do things that will allow someone fleeing to still take damage . The ultimate best defense against nanoswarms is preventative measures , not reactive . <p> And what about and I know this is a crazy , borderline insane , idea : what if you do n't want to kill someone ? <p> I 'm engaging in hyperbole here in an effort to make a point .

It 's harder , but makes for a more successful mission . <p> Oh , TOTALLY . That is what I love about this particular build actually , and why it might be my favorite out of the 3 I have come up with so far . My first character ( Xeus ) was definitely a more combat oriented character ... but that is because he is expected to defend a Gatecrashing team from hostile xenomorphs . Sure , killing is only useful sometimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lethal is important . In the case of Xeus , he also uses Freezers to capture live specimens for study . <p> With regards to my Legion concept , I think this may be my most favorite , most workable concept to date . The trouble with Xeus is that he is designed with most of his resources sunk into his morph , which is in many ways a matter of GM fiat whether I 'll be able to make use of it or not . <p> With Legion however , I have maximum versatility . Sure he starts off with a pretty boss morph ability wise , but his hacking is through the roof and as has been pointed out , Mesh skills will almost always be useful ( with a notable exception being Gatecrashing ) . There is just so much that can be done in this setting through the mesh . <p> Second , with a maxed out WIL and an infolife background I have a character who is incredibly mentally hardy and better able to hold up under the kinds of mental stresses in this transhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high WIL . BEcause I am less attached to my morph and I have the blueprints to make my hives as part of my ego , so long as I have a basic fabber I 'll be able to stick with my schtick ... which is the other cool thing about using nanoswarms for combat ... major style points . <p> Lastly , I like this build for it 's sheer versatility . I 'll start with Disassemblers , Fixers and Guardians in the form of hive blueprints ... so I can attack , defend , and repair . As has been noted swarms are programmable , meaning I have great versatility beyond straight killing . Maybe I program them to go after the enemy 's weapons ? <p> As the game goes on I 'll get more blueprints ... in particular engineering nanites , and with the profession engineering ( nanoswarms ) I 'll be able to do some pretty versatile stuff to help my team . <p> So ... in essence I think this is my favorite build so far because it has : mental hardiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is highly stylish . Also being an infolife means I wo n't have as many compunctions about doing crazy transhuman things like forking myself off as much as is needed to accomplish my goals . An all around effective and fun character . <p> Quote : <p> My issue with the character is n't method of fight at all . I think it embraced the ideals of Eclipse Phase well . I am aware they are deadly , do its a well crafted explosive and many other things . <p> What is cool though is that an explosive damages everything , and potentially the thing you wanted . I could program the swarm to eat everything except the cortical stack for instance , or a particular piece of equipment I wanted to capture . That is why I am coming around to the idea of a nanoswarm-optimised character being so incredibly fun and useful to play in a setting , -especially- with uber-hacking skills and a high end morph . : ) <p> Quote : <p> My issue really is the method of delivery .

While a splash grenade can hold drug , chemical , nanoswarm , paint , page 341 . <p> You assumed a splash bullet fired from a kinetic gun can house a swarm , I believe you assumed wrong and stated as such . No evidence says either of us a directly wrong , however my interpretation of what is there points to this not being the case . <p> This is in essence what criticism is , I am not saying your wrong , only that I perceive that you made a fault or mistake and am point it out . I can disagree with an aspect , splash ammo can contain nanoswarms , but that does n't mean I disagree with the whole concept . <p> Well ... I suppose we can agree to disagree on that . I see no reason why a taggant swarm would take up less room than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both are made in a hives that are the same size . If a GM was really going to be a hardass about it though , I would ditch kinetic weapons skill and focus on seekers to deliver microgrenades with my swarms ... and would make an argument for minimissile size grenades to contain 2 or 3 swarms per missile . The concept would still be workable , though I would definitely make an argument for using swarms in kinetic rounds . Swarms are -really- small , especially when compacted . <p> I see no reason why a taggant swarm would take up less room than a disassembler swarm or any other swarm . <p> They would take up the same room if both were swarms , the kinetic round hold nanobots , not swarms . <p> Swarms are made of nanobots , nanobots are smaller than a swarm . Kinetic rounds hold nanobots , grenades hold swarms . A standard swarm fills a 10 x 10 x 10 meter area once released , individual nanobots are smaller than 1mm in size the naked eye can see . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it , While swarms can be small , the individual nanobots are smaller . And kinetic bullets hold the bots , not the swarm . <p> Speaking of which , back to the original question , you should be able to see a nanobot swarm easily , it would be a cloud of sand particle sized robots . Honestly , scouting ahead it a really good option and will prevent you from entering into any swarms . <p> EDIT : Madwand pointed out an error , I made the mistake of switching nanobots and microbots sizes . I apologize . However , I still hold my size comparison still hold , however my second point is wholly inaccurate . <p> Uh .. no . Nanobots are nanoscale , not meter-scale . A nanoswarm is invisible , unless it is packed very tightly , in which case it will look like smoke . Individual nanobots are sized smaller than the wavelength of light , making them truly invisible . <p> Geonis ... sorry but that is just not accurate . Taggants are listed in the nanoswarm section ... they fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same rules . Whatever size difference there may be it is still on the nanoscale and a kinetic splash bullet should still be able to hold a whole one . Nothing in the book that I have read leads me to believe otherwise . <p> Of course we are free to disagree , but your argument for the taggants being bigger just is not true in this case . The section in the book saying that taggants can go in cartridges while the other kinds of swarms have to go in seekers or grenades is either simply in error , or put in as an arbitrary and capricious method of limiting the power of swarms but honestly in this game the things you are up against are so powerful that no amount of minmaxing is going to be able to save you if the GM decides it 's time for you ton resleeve . <p> Saying that one swarm can fit into a kinetic round and another can not is just plain arbitrary and dumb and I 'd probably just go find a different GM if they tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and simple ... they are invisible , fill a 10x10 meter cube and all follow the same rules . <p> edit : just to clarify the section says " paints , toxins , taggant nanobots and similar substances . " It seems you are making some kind of inferred arbitrary jump about the taggants that is not true , as they still qualify as swarms . If a round can hold a taggant swarm it can hold a disassebler swarm . I suspect this use of semantics you are quoting from the book in this case is really just a semantical lack of clarity on the book 's authors . Functionally , nanobots and nanoswarms are the same when it comes to splash rounds for kinetics and for seekers ... the difference is the seekers splash the round out to 10 meters while the kinetic rounds seem to splash only on the target ... <p> Just finished reviewing the nanoswarm section and TekHed is right ; taggant nanobots can be a swarm . We should note that they ( they meaning all swarms ) are not " invisible " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nanoswarms are nano-scale and clearly visible to anyone with nano-scale vision enhancements . <p> The book does not say you ca n't put nanoswarms into splash ammo , nor does it say that you can so this is an issue to be resolved by individual GMs . <p> I would make the case that a splash bullet likely carries a small amount of taggant nanobots suspended in a medium of some kind rather than an entire swarm packed into a single bullet ; enough to mark the target that is struck but not swarm out and tag others . I would extend that to other types of nanobot , reducing the effectiveness due to vastly reduced number and surface area . It 's been awhile since physics but I believe that impact force is reduced due to small size so nanobots can likely be struck against a solid object quite hard ( i.e. shot out of a gun in a splash bullet ) . That said , I believe if you filled the entire area of a splash round with nanobots you would be left with what is , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball is likely to suffer considerable damage on contact with the target , destroying a section of the swarm . Farther , the swarm is encased in a small area , a square inch or two , rather than the ' normal ' encompassing cloud . <p> Long story short , I think that it is something you could do and it would result in a less effective deployment of a nanoswarm than a programmed release or buzzer or splash grenade . <p> Once again I must disagree here and feel that some of you are grasping at straw so as to say " nu-uh ! you ca n't so that ! " <p> Firstly , nano vision is like looking through a microscope ... you ca n't just " see " swarms with it . What you *could* do is use a nanodetector and have it shunted as a visual modeling program tied into your VR ... but that is a nanodetector and not nanovision . <p> Second , again I feel like y'all aren " t getting how small a swarm really is ... a whole swarm is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Likely a compressed swarm is about the size of a bullet ... or even much much smaller . <p> Third one of the ways it explicitly says you can program a nanoswarm is to " coat a target . " <p> Fourth , splash rounds are designed to coat a target spreading them around . <p> Fifth , they would not be damaged because they are so small the impact would be negligible . Consider shooting a splash round containing dust in it ... the dust particles would not be really harmed from the splash round bursting ... and nanoscale bots are FAR smaller than visible dust . I 'm sure one of the physics minded people here could explain it better but part of the way impact damages things relates to their own mass when they hit something . <p> Long story short . I think it is a perfectly viable , ingenious and diabolical way to use nanoswarms and anyone trying to nerf it is just just being closed minded ... I 'd probably just not play with a GM who tried to make heavy handed leaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that would need to be considered though is legality .... the Jovians are an extreme example but I imagine weapon scanners on most stations have nanodetectors or are otherwise equipped to scan for this technology , since it is so damn dangerous . <p> If you are careful , nanodetectors wo n't find anything on you . You might have to clean yourself very carefully , but a properly stored and sealed off nanoswarm ca n't be directly detected except perhaps as a dark spot on an x-ray scanner or the like ( i.e. , no one could immediately know that spot was a swarm without removing it and running it through a nanodetector ) . <p> Even better , just keep the hive on you , destroy the swarm . Or keep a single protean swarm mixed into the bottom of a can of totally legal repair spray . That 's totally impossible to detect without destroying the can . That swarm can be booted into whatever you want . <p> Just finished reviewing the nanoswarm section and TekHed is right ; taggant nanobots can be a swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms ) are not " invisible " . That is a very specific term in Eclipse Phase . Nanoswarms are nano-scale and clearly visible to anyone with nano-scale vision enhancements . <p> Actually , I do n't disagree that a swarm can be delivered through splash rounds , my point of disagreement is a single splash round holds one nanoswarm . <p> Geonis wrote : <p> .. I doubt one splash round can house the equal amount to one swarm . ... <p> TekHed wrote : <p> ... then it stands to reason that an individual swarm can be condensed into a splash round ... <p> If you fire enough bullets and hit , you will get a swarm . I personally have no issue with him delivering swarms through splash bullets , I have an issue with him delivering one swarms per bullet . <p> I would use a all ten bullet hold a whole swarm , this allows a buzzer and kinetic rounds to do the similar but different jobs , the buzzer released two swarms reliably at short range and the kinetic weapon is longer ranged but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the roll for the amount of bullets hitting , let 's say 1 bullet for each 3 MoS , a MoS of 30+ would land them all on a full auto . <p> The rational is the full auto adds +30 to hit , so by having a MoS of 30 of greater , you hit without missing with the shot , assuming he is using the full auto to give the hit bonus of course since slash does no damage .

I 'd just be pissed and play a different character . <p> This is so stupid I do n't know where to begin . So I expend 10 ammo to do ... 3 points of damage . YAY sarcasm . This is awful and terrible and retarded thinking . The volume of 10 bullets is going to be more than a single shotgun shell . Furthermore a seeker round is not that much bigger than a bullet and it can hold a whole swarm ? You are just being arbitrary and not groking the concept of how small a swarm can be . And here is the reason why ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would just be running around with kinetic bullets filled with their own swarms to counter hit swarms when they become wise to his ways , it would kick off an arms race between the players and GM potentially . <p> Ah . I see now . You are one one of those gamers who still holds this idea of " balance . " There is no balance . ESPECIALLY not in this game . My impression of this game is that balance is out of the window . The enemies in this game are so powerful that it 's a miracle we get to backup and save our characters . Exsurgents , TITAN bots and swarms , crazy weird lovecraftian alien shit that will make you go mad ... <p> There is already an arms race going on , in any game where technology is an aspect/issue/theme . This is no different . I am annoyed at you for thinking that my idea should be nerfed down to the level of the god-awful buzzer , rather than trying to bring the buzzer up to a standard that would make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it another way . I could just as easily have sunk my 30,000 into plasma rifle blueprints ... I 'd be doing on average 72 damage per round , not including the armor piercing nature AND have the ability to potentially set things on fire . Oh , and by the way that character is an ambidextrous Reaper that carries 2 plasma rifles and 2 rail-machine guns or shredders . <p> I would say against this kind of thing my build is pretty balanced . Consider that a station 's defenses are going to have automated turrets and such , and probably lots of bots . Consider that killing someone 's morph in this game is n't really death for them ... and not only are you going to get slapped with a fine+their resleeving costs , but you have likely made an enemy for life in the person you hosed . <p> Also , like I said nanoweapons are likely highly restricted and illegal ... people are WAY paranoid about this kind of tech ( and with good reason as I have shown ! ) after the fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to conservatives . <p> If anyone else has anything to add to the discussion I 'm open to it , but for Geonis and I , let 's just agree to disagree on our interpretation of the ( admittedly not very well specified ) rules and what is balanced . We obviously have different tastes and styles in what we like in our games . You favor limits and " balance . " I 'm clear such things do n't really exist ... not in the real world , and not in any game attempting to in someway be plausible in a real world . Some tech is way better than others . Some people have better access to it . Life is n't fair . Life is n't balanced . An arms race is part of any decent game where players get creative in marshaling their resources ... and it is my humble belief that the GM should let them . After all ... the GM has ALL the power in the end anyways . <p> Case in point : <p> Madwand wrote : <p> And yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , along with nuclear and antimatter missiles . As my Sentinel group delved into tougher and tougher battles -- we 're talking planetary scale annihilation events against rogue Firewall agents here -- we found ourselves relying increasingly on infosec hacking , and swarms and swarms of swarms , along with delivery mechanisms for those swarms ( drones and missiles ) . As defense , one or more vehicles packed with hundreds of vertical-launch cells containing plasmaburst weapons . A camera photographing events inside our command vehicle would have seen nothing more than a few people sitting absolutely still in chairs for hours , thinking very hard . It was quite exciting . Warfare is a different creature in the future of Eclipse Phase . <p> Let me suggest a way around the problem : If you can not stuff a whole swarm into a SMG bullet , then have said swarm be completely intact at the end of it , why not just go with a bigger bullet ? Like say , using a shotgun slug . Or a semiautomatic rifle , heavy pistol , the like . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into SMG Bullets , then say that the splash rounds used for swarms are loaded for lower velocity- a longer bullet , with less powder behind it , to provide more room for cusion , and a lesser impact at the end of it . Sure , you 'd impact the range a bit , but you 'd have the swarm per bullet that you so dearly cling to . <p> To summarize : I agree that a nanoswarm can compact itself down far enough to fit inside of the volume of a bullet and that the technology exists to fire such bullet . I do not yet think that 1 ) it is possible to place an entire swarm in the bullet 's volume and have the swarm remain undamage by the impact of striking a target or 2 ) that if a transport medium is used to allow the nanobots to safely reach the target it will retain enough nanobots ( in a single bullet ) to constitute a full swarm . <p> Well you are certainly entitled to your own opinion . <p> As a counter argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the rules that say a seeker can also deliver a swarm ... that hits with the same or greater force of an SMG -and- it explodes on impact . So by your logic then it would damage the swarm . <p> Sorry but I do n't by it . Something that incredibly small would not really be harmed by the impact . That is like saying the molecules of a toxin or virus would be damaged by the same impact . Consider also that apslash round is likely designed to deliver it 's payload without damaging it . <p> Sure , it 's ad hominem , but it is my opinion that you are being incredibly small/closed minded and trying to place some limit on a cool exploit I found in the rules . I 'd not choose to play with you , and would find a GM/players more like Madwand , who realize that balance was out the window the minute the game said " post-apocalyptic transhuman horro . " <p> This is a game about transcending limits , not nerfing good player ideas that perfectly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some antiquated notion of " balance . " <p> Furthermore , even if a GM did rule that current splash rounds and nanoswarms would n't work this way ... what would keep me from researching how to make it work the way I want in game ? Oh ... GM fiat ? Fine Mr. GM , I 'm quitting your game . <p> Consider that a TITAN swarm in effect is a massive version of a swarm that can do basically every function ... a TITAN swarm can act as disassemblers , engineers , fixers , scouts ... all of it , in one swarm . You can bet your ass that my nanoswarm researcher is going to have finding a way to duplicate that kind of tech somehow and build a better nanoswarm in game . Would that make him a wanted criminal ? Of course ... there is a reason I decided to take " on the run . " <p> Let me suggest a way around the problem : If you can not stuff a whole swarm into a SMG bullet , then have said swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just go with a bigger bullet ? Like say , using a shotgun slug . Or a semiautomatic rifle , heavy pistol , the like . Or heck , a Seeker . If you Must Load Swarms into SMG Bullets , then say that the splash rounds used for swarms are loaded for lower velocity- a longer bullet , with less powder behind it , to provide more room for cusion , and a lesser impact at the end of it . Sure , you 'd impact the range a bit , but you 'd have the swarm per bullet that you so dearly cling to . <p> See ... someone who understands that technology will find a way . : ) No limits ! <p> This would be a fine way to justify a workaround in the case of having a hardass nerfbat GM like Geonis . Of course if he wanted to nerfbat things for " balance " he probably still would n't go for it . Some people just do n't see eye to eye . <p> Though , now I ca n't get out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mostly since shotguns can also shoot buckshot , ropes , bolos , fire , birdshot , Explosives , slugs , and even tasers . It is the one-size fits all knife , even now . And yes , I only listed projectiles that are currently in use , not what is in the rulebook . Not to mention , some shotguns are fully automatic . <p> Everyone has to make comprimises , if they expect to play with a Munchkin concept . Sometimes those comprimises work better than the origional concept , so I do n't resist them , I embrace them . It helps everyone concerned , rather than just the irritable player . After all , if you do n't comprimise , the DM is free to kill off the character/take away the problem item in question at any point and time . If you were using it as a DMPC , you 'd have the power to go " It works because I say it does " instead of having to fit it to anything else . <p> well the point was to get the damage comparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round is bigger than a seeker rocket . The problem with shotguns and seekers is that they are SA rather than BF or FA . The only way to make my idea a worthy replacement for railguns or plasma rifles is to use a weapon that can deliver them in FA . 3-6 damage/action phase just wo n't cut it for me.

And now view both as infected . <p> In some settings I would expect that facility and its surrounding area being nuked from orbit ( just to make sure ) -and the " deceased " reverted to backups ( if they had any ) . .

From what I 'm seeing so far the advanced tech of H+ is really out there ... but still seems reasonably recognizable for what it does ... which means TITAN tech should raise that bar far , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or something Exsurgent may make alien ) it 's going to be real , REAL strange . <p> To pharaprase a character from Clarke 's " Childhood 's End " ... " The gulf between two technologies can easily become so great that it is-lethal . " <p> Several factions in the Eclipe Phase universe have a vested interest in the gates and a rare few even control the odd gate directly . Not so much as to conquer the universe , but to venture into the unknown , make new discoveries ( and possibly a fortune in rep or cash ) . Mostly , however , transhumanity still tries to figure out where these gates lead to and what their purpose was or still is . Still , the temptation to explore ' the other side ' is big and therefore the so-called ' Gatecrashers ' are willing to risk their lives to discover what 's on the other side of a gate , and what or who might be waiting for them ... <p> However , is there actually a goate on the other side that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for the gate to dial back to you , but it also describes there being an identical structure on the other side . Could n't this structure be used to head back home ? <p> Personally , I much prefer if the PGs were not made by the titans but by aliens long before , and were simply discovered by the titans ( since only titan level of tech could see though the PGs cloaking tech ) . That way I can build in an interesting story whereby an early space ship ( perhaps the first manned mission to Mars ? ) disappears in say 2025 and ends up somewhere real strange and far away . And in that case , the particular PG only works in one direction , so the hapless astronauts have no other option than to survive . By a great deal of luck they do that , build a new human civilisation and develop their own warped culture . Until one day , when a group of transhuman gatecrashers ( the PCs , no doubt ) drop by and everything gets even more confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real just because they are n't made of matter , of particles . Dreams are real . But they are made of viewpoints , of images , of memories and puns and lost hopes . " - John Dee <p> I kind of like not knowing who made them . It keeps the plot potential wide open but adds a little mystery in there as well . <p> The concept of a gate to travel around the stars is n't uncommon . Stargate definitely did n't pioneer the concept . I think it 's probably a fair comparison but probably in the same way Apples and Oranges can be compared - they 're both fruit , but that 's about where it ends .

Is there any mechanic that will be featured to cover how much a player 's morph can carry , or do we use common sense ? <p> I see it going both ways and am good with either a system or not , just curious .

Cornucopia machines and blueprints can create just about every commonly available item ( and many restricted ones as well ) . A nanofabrication specialist can be an integral asset to a Firewall team for all the gadgets and equipment they can create and customize . The Fabber is also trained in various Hardware abilities and engineering-related Knowledge skills for integral understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Specialist : <p> With the omnipresence of the Mesh and millions of people living entirely as software , navigating online is almost a requirement for any sort of in-depth investigation work .

Violent conflict is inevitable in an Agent 's career . While most agents are trained in firearms and Fray , the Soldier lives for combat . From reaction-boosting implants to grenade launchers , this archetype 's skills and equipment are designed around taking punishment and neutralizing the enemy with extreme force . <p> The Favorman : <p> While successful Networking skills are vital to every Firewall agent , the social game 's the Favorman 's specialty .

And their powers appear cheap enough overall that the " async " can be folded into other existing archetypes . <p> Perhaps , but I add them only because a couple of the Firewall adventure hooks in the books ' sidebars detail situations where it seems like Asyncs can sniff out exsurgent stuff , etc . Plus the ability to appear inconspicuous , even with nanotechnology , and use sleights that deal damage straight past armor with a touch , or that can cause subliminal commands ... seems pretty useful . But truly not nearly as essential as the Magicians of Shadowrun I will admit . <p> The async can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a " core " Firewall team needs . <p> I also edited the Fabber entry to be skilled in Hardware and engineering-related knowledges so that he can further take advantage of tool customization and creation . The Fabber should not just be a walking blueprint and fabricator carrier ; he should also have an integral understanding of how stuff works . <p> While in computer games you have the " holy Trinity " ( Tank , healer &amp; DPS ... and DPS breaks into pure DPS , Controller and Debuffer , while healer breaks into buffer , pure healer , and damage mitigator , with tanks breaking finally into unpredictable avoidancers and the meat sacks ) , in RPG games the situation gets a lot fuzzier . <p> Usually , I break it in " specialists " ( or " skill focused " ) , " combatants " , and " socials " . However , the more tehcnologically advanced a game is , the more interesting it gets to invest in computer-related skills ( in Star Wars d20 it was exceedingly imbalanced : a lv 10 character can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he subtly reaches a computer ... ) , to an extent where you end having the combatants take on enemies under terrain-limitating conditions or on " bosses " . <p> As for Eclipse Phase , I 'd say that all toons are combatants to an extent , even more than in any other game : start with Kinetic Weapons at 60 , some Fray and few more things and you are set . Experts ? Yeah , that too ( Infosec , 300 CP worth of non-active skills , etc ... ) . " Faces " , however , are still a niche by themselves , since while it is easy to have some networking skills and reps , to manage all them can be ... impossible , so to speak . <p> no one has mentioned the equivalent of SR 's Rigger .

Aka Ada Wong . She 's one resourceful bitch , that one ! You give her a task , and free reigns , and she 's going to do the job , discretely and with style ... most of the time .

She 's either your best friend ( hopefully with benefits . C'm on ! She 's hot ! ) or the worst enemy you 'll ever make . <p> -The Carrier . Aka Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downright asshole . But once a deal is struck , he 'll get through hell and back to bring the package to destination . If you 're the package , you can count on him to watch your six at the peril of his own , and deliver you where you are supposed to go . At any cost , even if it 's a city or a whole habitat . <p> A variation of the carrier is the Johnny Mnemonic type , a data or biological messenger .

More so since spending 300 construction points on Knowledge-based skills is built into the system . <p> I think that I have to agree with you . Starting characters in Eclipse Phase , if you break the stats down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Olympic medalists , and everyone does their character ages a little different ( in my game , the youngest PC is 380 Earth years old , the oldest pushing 700 ) based upon their interpretation of the advancement of technology .

Their stats certainly reflect the basic intelligence to accomplish such a thing before , during , and in the years after the Fall .

Also , let me , once and for all , apologize for my english level ( I 'll do my best , I promise ) . <p> That said , let 's go to the subject . I 'm creating an online character generator for Eclipse Phase . At first I thought to release it only on a local server for my friends and myself only . But then I discovered those forums and this community . Well , why not submitting it there as well ? <p> For now it 's not finished , but before I finish it and eventually make it public , I have a few questions concerning copyright . If I make this program public , I want it to be in agreement with copyright rules of the game itself . Ideally , I would like to have the agreement / comments of the staff , knowing that : - The program uses ( and explains some of ) the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game ( essentially for descriptions like backgrounds , factions , morphs , and some parts of character creation ) . - Visual layout is not finished yet , but I would like to use some of the book images ( essentially logo of Eclipse Phase ) into it . Well , I 'm not a designer , so the program layout wo n't be the best part . - All this knowing I am not a lawyer . I would be glad to add some copyright informations on the main page of the generator , if only I knew what to put . - Finally , the program is / will be in english . Well , it 's not my first language , but as the core book is only available in english , it 's easier for me ( nothing to translate ) . That mean there will probably be some mistakes to correct <p> Well , that 's all . So , if anyone here know a little more about copyright rules , I would be happy to hear from you and eventually release this character generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Waiting with anticipation-I believe that as long as you acknowledge the authors and the licence than it 's ok , but you probably should start a copyright thread in the other subforum EP News &amp; Events-the game designers post there often , so if you ask about specific copyright issues this might help you .

My purpose is to create more than a character sheet manager ( even if it 's the first step ) : A full RPG tool box ( but not a video game ) : * Character creation/update workflow ( avoid ingame player book browsing and game master post checking ) * Story line publisher ( centralize and unify format of writer jobs to improve user collaboration and browsing ) * Game mechanisme bundle system ( share additional game rule stuffs assumed by character sheet manager ) ... <p> I 'm curious about how did you design scalling data base with character sheet validation . Backup handling is another hard feature to manage .. I 'm not sur it 's the best place to talk about technic but what technologies do you use for your own version ? <p> What would be very nice to include would be a way to export your character into some standard data format , like a comma separated . csv or xml so that it can be parsed or imported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is writing a dice-roller or initiative tracker , it would be cool to be able to import character stats and maybe eventually put together a whole system . <p> Another advantage to exporting to a common text based format is that it makes source control easier . The ability to manage forks , merges and sequential backups , as well as a change log , is something that would be very useful for this game , and there just happens to be a whole market of products that will do this to text files . <p> Got ta agree with the others on the common text format output - not only would an xml dump be incredibly useful , it 's also in keeping with the spirit of the EP releases . Maybe that is n't a huge motivation for you , but it seems like it would be since you 're making a tool with the intent of giving it away for free . <p> I 'm damnly thinking about " how software could improve game experience " . What could be the thing you would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games ? <p> Normally next month I will be more free so be able to work hardly on the project ( if I do n't spent all of my time reading* ) . For now i 'm basicaly continuing the design ( Storage and UI ) but I decided to also use a set new technologies to improve the project quality ( and have fun ) : Mongo DB + HTML5/CSS3/Raphaeljs . <p> Hope next post be about a publish date . <p> *I bought Sunward Hard book last weekend and the game master screen , the initiation scenarii is amazing ! <p> Another thing that you might want to consider for your program , especially since English is your second language , is to separate the program 's texts from the actual program itself . This way , people can easily translate your software into their chosen language without having to play with your code . Many popular programs use external language files . <p> Oh , good point . Localization is much easier if you build it in from day 1 rather than trying to shove it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch of text IDs rather than actual text , but it will be infinitely easier to edit , update with erratta , and translate later . <p> Oh , good point . Localization is much easier if you build it in from day 1 rather than trying to shove it in later . It looks kind of messy in code having a bunch of text IDs rather than actual text , but it will be infinitely easier to edit , update with erratta , and translate later . <p> Exactly . You might even make those files at least partially editable from within program ( adding in or editing traits , skills and equipment databases ) , like they did for this Shadowrun Character Generator . <p> I do n't mean to step on anybody 's toes , but the project I 'm working on is a bit more comprehensive ( and complex ) than those I 've seen so far in this thread , so I thought I would mention it in case anyone is interested in the project ( and helping me with it ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build an Eclipse Phase character manager in Java , using XML for the entire data structure of the program . So far I have built an XML parser and editor and developed schemas for the initial data files , being Skills , Morphs , Augmentations ( implants &amp; robotic augmentations ) , Traits , Backgrounds , Factions , Equipment and Sleights . <p> I 've so far fully implemented the data for Backgrounds , Factions , Traits and Skills ( all from the main rulebook ) and I 'm working on augmentations , morphs etc . Ideally I 'd like to get some volunteers to help me prepare the data so that I can get on with actually creating the character manager . <p> The idea for this application is to help people to manage their forks , backups and morphs which , as we all know , can get very complicated in Eclipse Phase . The workflow will move from character creation through to in-game play , with some of the following features : <p> 1 ) With a ' character ' at the root of the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forks and backups of an ego in a tree format so that it 's easy to track at a glance what forks and egos exist . This will be maintained as a single XML file with links to unique XML files representing a ' state snapshot ' of each ego . <p> 2 ) At any time the user will be able to select an ego from the tree to load it as an active character , allowing its statistics , memories etc. to be edited . <p> 3 ) On ' activating ' an ego the user will be given an opportunity to assign it to a specific morph , at which point the character 's stats will update to represent any enhancements provided by the morph . Equipment may also be assigned from the root character 's inventory . Each morph , ego and item of equipment will record its current location so that the player can make informed decisions about equipping his egos . I will also make it possible to set an ego ' read only ' with an explanation ; this will be ideal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 4 ) Saving the ' character view ' will probably result in an HTML file . This will be presented using XSLT to transform the underlying XML into a viewable form . This will allow people to easily host their characters online . The software is primarily designed to be used on the fly as a method of making it easier to handle multiple forks , but once a ' character view ' is generated it will also be possible to print from the browser and even to modify the base HTML/XSLT to customise the appearance as desired . I may even be able to build a customiser in the software that alters the character sheet that 's generated at the end . <p> So , as I said before I can really get into the meat of making the character manager itself , I want to populate my XML data files with all of the sleights , equipment etc. from all of the books . If you 'd like to volunteer to assist with this it would be great . I 'm including most of the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during play . And you wo n't have to edit XML in the raw ; what I 've written so far allows for relatively straightforward editing of the XML and also enforces compliance against the base schema . <p> The zip file contains the executable jar file for the program , the XML files and the schemas against which they are validated . The program ( for now ) is set to load the XML files from the default directory . That should normally be the directory it 's run from , but in some environments it seems to be the Home directory instead ; if you get a complaint that the files ca n't be found that may well be the problem . <p> As to what you can do , Octo , I 'm mainly keen on getting the Morphs finished as a priority , so if you would care to enter some of the morphs from the main rulebook , Sunward and Gatecrashing that would be amazing . <p> The program will complain every time you hit ' save ' if the XML is n't valid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommend that you try to save after adding each element . Eventually I hope to produce an easy-to understand description of the schema to make this easier . <p> If as you enter the morphs you find that the allowed options do n't support a data item you think is essential , please let me know and I will edit the schema to allow incorporation of the missing element . <p> Once all the morphs are done the only outstanding item is Equipment , I think ... I 'm working on Augmentations ( being implants and robotic augmentations ) and will soon have that finished . Oh , I also do n't have any material from Gatecrashing or Sunward in any of the other data types , so if you would care to add any sneaky new implants , backgrounds or Traits from those books it would be very helpful . <p> Hopefully you will find the editor fairly intuitive to use , but should you have any difficulties please let me know at . <p> It would also be helpful if you could tell me : <p> 1 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule is that any rez points gained post-fork are added to the final result on merging , but that skills gained by the non-primary fork between times are lost unless the primary fork spends rez points to bed them in ) as I will eventually need to write a rez-point handling system . <p> 2 ) Particularly key bits of information or data you would like to track for characters . I will release the Ego , Morph and Character schemas once they 're written so you can see what I plan to be storing , but it will obviously help to make the program more useful if I know the things that you want to have access to during character management at an early stage ! <p> One last thing , I thought perhaps you might like some evidence that you wo n't be wasting your time if you assist me with this project . To show that I do have staying power and a modicum of Java skill you might like to check out my Exalted Combat Manager , which offers some fairly advanced features for keeping track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Well , that 's all . So , if anyone here know a little more about copyright rules , I would be happy to hear from you and eventually release this character generator ( should be finished in a few days ) . <p> Please read the info at http : **28;1776;TOOLONG -- there are a couple of pieces of art that you ca n't distribute under the Creative Commons license , but all the text and most of the art is fair for re-use within the terms of the license . <p> Took a look at the Exalted Combat Manager - looks good and would be a good resource if retooled for Eclipse Phase . Additionally , an iOS version of the tool would be tremendous ( either native or browser-based ) - perhaps similar to the iPlay4e tool that 's out there . <p> One note when I first opened the app and loaded a file ( one of yours ) , I get a error dialog : <p> XML is non-compliant with the document template Line 181 , column 47 Error : Element type " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " &gt; " or " /&gt; " , Continuing to load file , but you wo n't be able to save until the errors are fixed <p> I 've started editing the morphs file by hand ( which is just as easy , to be honest , since I can just copy and paste ) . It loads up with the same error . <p> I noticed that you 've got no element for Advantages or Wound Threshold - is this on purpose ? If not , would you like me to add ? <p> Oops , my bad ! That 's actually an error in the schema document . When I added the " ap " element to " attack " I typoed on the closing tag and there were two //s . I 've tweaked a few of the allowed Advantage/Disadvantage Resources too , as some of them worked for faction/background but are n't appropriate for Morphs . <p> I deliberately left out Wound Threshold because it 's derived from Durability in every case ; I 'd rather calculate it in the character manager . <p> Advantage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as complex types . The basic format is ( With angular brackets around the tags , of course ) : <p> advantages advantage Then : resource then name or category then plus or equals or minus or rezCostMultiplier or level ( for traits ) or status ( banned or free , for things like traits etc. ) /advantage /advantages <p> If as you write morphs up you find there are advantages you ca n't code , please let me know . <p> I do recommend using my program now you can load files into it , as it makes it dead easy to clone an entire entry etc. plus it validates every time you save allowing you to hit ' save ' to check what you 've done so far and find out what the valid options are . <p> Well , Exalted uses a completely different style of initiative that is n't transferrable to Eclipse Phase , so it would probably need to be re-written from the ground up . <p> In Exalted initiative keeps on rolling . Each action has a speed in ' ticks ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add the speed of their action on to the tick in which they last acted . It 's actually quite a good , fluid system but can be messy to keep track of in large combats , which is why I wrote the manager . <p> In Eclipse Phase it 's much easier as people just act in initiative order each round , so I find it easy to run combats with a pad and paper or Notepad. = )

Machine-gunned a room full of Async kids in a Black Lab run by a Ex-V corrupted Async ( it was only way to be sure ) . <p> The characters motivations revolve around Sentient Rights ( Uplift , AGI , Human , Alien , Animal ) , the truth behind the Lost Generation , and what makes an Async an Async and how it can be controlled and mastered . <p> This is his first false I 'd , and he 'll be trying to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movements . Eventually he 'll want another I 'd to work on his Corporate Espionage interest . He very badly wants to go through all Cognite files on the Lost . <p> Part of what he hopes to build is an Async studies centre , and hope it does n't go wrong like all the corporate ones . : ) 
@@29835197 @3535197/ 135871 @qwx335871 <h> Lucy <p> Okay , saw this the other day and I rather enjoyed it . Yes , the science is completely wonky - which is usually a huge pet peeve of mine - but it did n't seem to matter as much here . More interesting was the story of a person undergoing a " hard takeoff exponential growth towards super-intelligence " and how she dealt with the world around her . <p> Relevant to Eclipse Phase , I 'd say there 's some insight into exhuman and post-human modes of thought and I 'm toying with the idea that the exsurgent virus is n't trying to destroy humanity but hyper-evolve us . We 're just not quite capable of achieving that state yet . <p> What I found most interesting , and a little depressing , about Lucy is that ( leaving aside the incredibly soft science ) it 's one of the rare pro-science sci-fi movies . It clearly and unequivocally states " science and knowledge are Good Things " and despite what Lucy 's going through ending up being quite destructive , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear goal of giving her knowledge to Dr. Science ( or whatever Morgan Freeman 's vestigial character was called ) because she 's worked out that 's the most good she can do in the time she has left . <p> Compare it to , say , Transcendence where Johnny Depp gets too much Science on his brain and turns into a scary robot monster , and the Luddites were right all along , or any of the million sci fi films where science is used to explain and create monsters . <p> Very true . The conscious decision she makes to not only survive but then share the knowledge she gains is what drives the second half of the movie . Of course , I jokingly interpret the last scene where Morgan Freeman is holding the space ! USB as him thinking " We are going to be SOOO rich ! " <p> Compare it to , say , Transcendence where Johnny Depp gets too much Science on his brain and turns into a scary robot monster , and the Luddites were right all along , or any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain and create monsters . <p> I thought the ending of Transcendence was , Luddites kill Johnny Depp , again , utterly destroying civilization in the process , and it turns out he was good all along but scared idiots screwed it all up ! <p> I ended up watching Transcendence last week , and that was my take on it as well . The movie was a tragedy about our fear of anything we do n't understand . <p> Of course , the AI was carrying the idiot ball and completely failed to explain what he was doing to his wife . Or his friends . And apparently despite being super intelligent and knowing exactly what the other guys were doing ( They have my source code ! really ? ) being entirely helpless to secure his own damn brain . <p> I thought the ending of Transcendence was , Luddites kill Johnny Depp , again , utterly destroying civilization in the process , and it turns out he was good all along but scared idiots screwed it all up ! <p> That was what I took away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even death were cured , and the only thing that baselines could think about was how to erase those cures from their world . Typical
