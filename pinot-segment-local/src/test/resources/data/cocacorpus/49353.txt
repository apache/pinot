Our multidisciplinary team , led by UW Physicians , collaborates closely to offer personalized treatment plans based on the type and stage of your cancer , as well as your genetics , life circumstances , and other factors unique to you . <p> Deciding on where to receive treatment is the most important decision a patient with cancer will make . Studies have shown that patients who begin their treatment at a top regional cancer center have better outcomes than those who start their treatment elsewhere . <h> Comprehensive Team <p> Many of our patients have cancers requiring coordination by multiple healthcare professionals . We focus on integrated , patient-centered care to maximize your quality of life and the opportunity for a cure . <p> Our multidisciplinary group has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as a team . Our medical oncology , surgical oncology and radiation oncology services are all offered in one location , enabling our specialists to collaborate to determine the best course of care for each individual patient . By sharing their broad expertise , our physicians can deliver comprehensive leading-edge treatment informed by the latest research and knowledge . In addition , we have a well-coordinated support team , including nurse practitioners , nutritionists and hormonal therapists for some patients with metastatic cancers . <p> As an academic health system , UW Medicine is also able to offer its patients the opportunity to participate in clinical trials that are n't available elsewhere in the region . Participation is optional , but patients who participate in these studies have the first chance to benefit from the latest and most innovative therapies . At UW Medicine , we offer a wide variety of clinical trials , including trials in immunotherapy , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , targeted agents and radium-223 . Having this breadth of options allows patients who do n't qualify for one particular trial to apply for another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could help them get better faster . <p> Also , our physicians and scientists are constantly performing research to remain abreast of new treatment options and better understand why certain cancers respond the way they do to specific medications . <h> Standard Treatment <p> Everyone 's cancer is different . That 's why our treatment plans always begin with a comprehensive diagnosis . Researchers at UW Medicine developed UW-OncoPlexG , a diagnostic test that identifies mutations in a set of about 200 genes . Many of the mutations found by this approach can determine how to choose an FDA-approved drug or a therapy already in clinical trials . The results from UW-OncoPlex testing may enable your doctor to choose the most effective treatment for your individual tumor . By attacking it with one or perhaps more of the effective agent(s) right away , there 's a better chance to contain the cancer and force it into remission . <p> Your doctor will recommend treatment based on the stage of your prostate cancer and other factors , such as your overall health , any potential side effects of treatment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and relieving your symptoms . <p> If your cancer is in the early stages and localized to the prostate , surgery is often the primary form of treatment . Our surgeons have expertise in both traditional open surgical methods and laparascopic and robotic options . Other treatments include brachytherapy , which involves implanting radioactive seeds directly into the prostate , external beam radiation therapy and highly targeted proton therapy . One of our physicians was instrumental in developing what is now known as GPS for the Body- , which allows your physician to better target the radiation therapy to your prostate . <p> If your cancer has spread to other parts of your body , your physician may recommend some form of hormonal therapy in conjunction with immunotherapy , radiation therapy , or investigational drugs from clinical studies . <p> Our patient-centered team also provides supportive care and pain management at every stage of the treatment process . Patients , families and caregivers can attend educational classes and group activities designed to instruct , enrich and support , as well as provide opportunities to connect with others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-term care plan once treatment is complete . <h> Where You Will Be Seen <p> Our physicians perform surgical procedures and brachytherapy at UWMC .

Read this handout to learn more about the procedures , how to prepare , what to expect during and after your procedure , and how to get your results . <h> What is an ultrasound-guided aspiration ? <p> An ultrasound exam uses sound waves to take pictures of your body 's organs and tissues . An aspiration is a procedure to remove extra fluid from a part of your body.If the fluid is : <p> In your belly , the procedure is called paracentesis <p> In your chest cavity , it is called thoracentesis <p> These procedures may be done to ease your symptoms or to remove some fluid so that it can be sent to the lab . A needle or catheter ( a thin , flexible tube ) is used to remove this fluid safely from your body . <p> Talk with your doctor if you have any questions about your procedure . <h> How does the procedure work ? <p> After gel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technologist ) presses a transducer against your skin . A transducer is a hand-held device that sends and receives sound waves . <p> As the sound waves bounce off your body 's tissues , images of your tissues show on a monitor . <p> Your radiologist will then use ultrasound to guide the insertion of a needle or catheter into your skin . <p> The insertion usually only takes a few seconds or minutes . The aspiration may take minutes or 1 hour or longer . The length depends on why you are having the procedure and how much fluid is being removed . <h> How should I prepare ? <h> Medicines <p> If you usually take aspirin or another anticoagulant medicine ( blood thinners ) , follow the instructions Imaging Services scheduling staff gave you . They have checked with our clinic doctors about whether you should stop taking the blood thinners before your aspiration . <h> Day of Your Procedure <p> If you will have a lot of fluid taken , you will not be able to drive yourself home after your exam . Your healthcare provider will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive you home . <p> If your doctor wants you to have an infusion of albumin for your procedure , we may ask you to arrive before your procedure time . Albumin is a protein that helps balance fluid levels in your body . It can help prevent side effects that can occur when large amounts of fluid are removed from your body . Imaging Services scheduling staff will give you instructions if you need albumin . <h> At the Hospital <p> We will ask you to change into a hospital gown for your procedure . All of your belongings will stay with you during your visit . <p> The radiologist who does your procedure , or an assistant , will explain your procedure . They will describe possible complications , and give you instructions and self-care tips for after your procedure . Be sure to ask all the questions you may have . <p> You will need to sign a consent form that says you understand what we talked about and that you agree to have this procedure . <h> How is the ultrasound-guided aspiration done ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . You will either lie down or sit , depending on where the fluid to be collected is and other factors . <p> The first few ultrasound images will show your doctor the area that will be aspirated and the safest place to insert the needle or catheter . <p> Once this location is confirmed : <p> The insertion site will be marked on your skin . <p> Your skin around the insertion site will be scrubbed and disinfected , and a sterile drape will be put over it . <p> A local anesthetic will be injected . This will numb the area so that you do not feel the incision . <p> The needle or catheter will be inserted through this incision . <p> We may ask you not to move or cough while the needle or catheter is being inserted . You may also need to hold still or hold your breath at times during the procedure . Holding still will help your doctor insert the needle safely into the right area . <p> Using the ultrasound image for guidance , your doctor will direct the needle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After enough fluid is taken , the needle or catheter will be removed . <p> After any bleeding at the insertion site has stopped , a bandage will be placed over the site . Bleeding will be minor and you will not need stitches . It is very rare to have bleeding that requires more treatment or a hospital stay . <p> If you have a lot of fluid to be removed , it can build up again . This means you may need to repeat the procedure in the near future . <p> If a thoracentesis is done , we may order a chest X-ray after your procedure to make sure you do not have any complications , such as pneumothorax ( collapse of the lung ) . This is a rare but serious complication . If you have pneumothorax , we may need to place a drain in your chest and monitor you for a while before you leave the hospital . <p> Most patients may leave the hospital after their procedure . <h> What will I feel during the procedure ? <p> When local anesthetic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needle . You may feel a burning sensation as the medicine is injected and takes effect . The area will quickly become numb . <p> You may feel pressure from your doctor 's hands or from the needle or catheter . You should not feel any pain . <p> If you are having thoracentesis and a larger amount of fluid is being removed from your chest cavity , you may start to cough . If this happens , we will pause or stop the procedure . <p> If you are having a paracentesis and larger amounts of fluid are being removed from your belly , you may feel some relief from the pressure and weight the fluid was causing . You may also feel a little dizzy after the procedure . To lessen these complications , you may receive an infusion of albumin to help balance your body fluids . <h> What should I expect after the procedure ? <p> Do not do any heavy lifting , a lot of stair climbing , or sports activities for 1 full day after your procedure . <p> You may return to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel up to it . <p> Talk with your radiologist if you plan to travel by air within 24 hours after your procedure . <p> Your needle site may be sore as the local anesthesia wears off . It should start to feel better 12 to 48 hours after your procedure . <h> When to Call for Help <p> Severe bleeding from an aspiration is rare . It occurs in less than 3% of patients ( less than 3 out of 100 ) . Symptoms of bleeding include : <p> Pain and swelling where the aspiration was done <p> Rapid pulse ( heart rate ) <p> Overall weakness <p> Pale skin <p> Chest pain or shortness of breath , especially after a thoracentesis <p> If you have any of these symptoms , go to the nearest emergency room or call 911 .

ALF can develop over the span of days or weeks but is life-threatening and warrants urgent medical care at a tertiary-care facility .

Other prescription and nonprescription drugs , as well as herbal remedies are more frequently involved in ALF . Rarely , poison mushrooms , hepatitis ( types A and B ) and other viruses , recreational drugs and metabolic diseases are factors . In about 15 percent of cases , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually present with a group of symptoms including confusion , fever , fatigue , abdomen pain and jaundice . Complicating factors can develop , such as encephalopathy ( brain dysfunction ) , cerebral edema ( brain swelling ) , blood-clotting inadequacy , infection and kidney failure . Kidney failure , a complicating factor of ALF , is challenging to treat . <p> Patients have the best chance of survival and recovery with treatment in an intensive care unit where a skilled , multidisciplinary team can converge to promptly diagnose ALF 's root cause and begin treatment therapies . Some causes respond better to medical intervention ; others are associated with a greater need for liver transplant . <h> Procedural Details <p> With individual patients , ALF 's origin can be difficult to discern . The ICU team must perform a battery of tests quickly to understand the relative health of the liver and other vital organs , especially the brain , which is highly vulnerable to toxins such as ammonia that a normally functioning liver would filter from blood . These tests also guide the care team 's decisions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of encephalopathy , which may coincide with , and be confused with , the symptoms of cerebral edema , or intracranial pressure . Encephalopathy may be reversible , but edema is more challenging .

@@21160819 @1160819/ 60955 @qwx260955 <h> WWAMI <h> WWAMI Regional Medical Education <p> In the early 1970s , the University of Washington took on a bold challenge to train and prepare physicians to care for patients and communities throughout the WAMI states , Washington , Alaska , Montana and Idaho ( Wyoming joined in 1996 ) . Today , this regional medical education program known as WWAMI ( an acronym representing the states it serves ) is heralded as one of the most innovative medical education and training programs in the country.The program has five primary goals : <p> The program has been recognized by the Association of American Medical Colleges with the Outstanding Community Service Award and has been identified as the nation 's top primary-care , family medicine and rural medicine training school by U.S. News &amp; World Report for the past 23 years . <p> A majority of the students training in the program choose to remain and practice medicine within the five-state region , and over half choose careers in primary care , helping to stem the shortage of primary care physicians , especially in rural areas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Northwest states lives in rural and largely underserved communities . <h> What Does Regional Medical Education Mean ? <p> Each state participating in WWAMI partners with the UW School of Medicine ( UWSOM ) to educate a fixed number of medical students from and for their state . For the first year of medical school , students study at their home state university ( University of Washington , University of Wyoming , University of Alaska-Anchorage , Montana State University , or University of Idaho ) . Second year students from home state universities then come to the UWSOM in Seattle or Spokane for their entire second year . During the third and fourth years of medical school , students complete clinical rotations in a variety of sites and environments within the five-state region to learn and experience very different facets of medicine . For example , one month might be spent in a remote community near Nome , Alaska , another in a migrant community near Yakima , WA and another in a Level I trauma center in Seattle . The goal is to provide a rich array of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community-based clinical faculty who volunteer their time to educate the physicians in training . <h> The Changing Face of Regional Medical Education <p> WWAMI is constantly growing and changing to meet the needs of the region . In 2008 , the University of Washington expanded its first-year medical education program in Spokane . In 2013 , the program expanded further with a two-year pilot program to offer the second year for up to 20 second year students . The expansion allows medical students to spend their entire first two years of medical school in Spokane . Subsequently , they can choose to complete some or most of their third and fourth years of clinical training in Spokane as well . <p> Growing its medical school class size in Spokane is a goal of the UW , to help alleviate the physician shortage in Eastern Washington . The UW will seek state funding during the next legislative session to double its medical school class size in Spokane . According to a report issued by the research firm Tripp Umbach , this is " clearly the most cost-effective option " to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state . " Growth is happening in other WWAMI states as well . Recognizing the need for more physicians , the Montana legislature recently approved 10 additional student positions at its first-year site at Montana State University for a total of 30 first-year students per year , and the Idaho legislature approved 5 additional student positions in each of the last two legislative sessions to make a total of 30 first-year students at the University of Idaho in Moscow . The UW School of Medicine is committed to meeting the workforce needs of each of its partners . <p> Beginning in the fall of 2015 the UW School of Medicine will adopt a new contemporary medical education curriculum , and will expand clinical training opportunities in underserved areas across Washington state , including Yakima , Tri-Cities , Wenatchee , Bellingham and Vancouver . <h> Serving the Community through Regional Medical Education <p> A variety of programs are available in communities throughout the five-state region that provide not only an educational experience for medical students , but also supports community efforts through volunteerism . These include : <p> WWAMI Rural Integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rural setting in which students complete clinical training working closely with community preceptors ( clinical instructors ) . <p> Rural/Underserved Opportunities Program ( R/UOP ) - 4-week preceptorships ( mentorships ) available with practicing physicians in rural and urban underserved communities held over the summer between a student 's first and second year . <p> Targeted Rural Underserved Track ( TRUST ) - Longitudinal experience with a single rural community over a student 's entire medical school career , including completing both WRITE and R/UOP and returning regularly to learn about and work in the community . <h> Regional Medical Education in the Community <p> The UW School of Medicine is central to a network of programs designed to alleviate the shortages of healthcare programs in rural and underserved urban areas .

This means that these organs developed differently than in most women , but still may be effective in the primary functions of the uterus , cervix , vagina , or hymen : menstruation , vaginal intercourse and carrying a pregnancy . Many girls and women do not realize that they have an anomaly of their reproductive organs unless they have symptoms or have imaging ( like an ultrasound ) or an examination where it is discovered . <p> The uterus and part of the vagina develop from two ridges of tissue on the left and right side of the body while a girl is still a fetus . These structures then fuse ( come together ) in the middle to form one structure . Most congenital anomalies happen because the two parts do not come together fully . <p> Different classes of congenital anomalies have been identified and are described by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen .

For example , there may be a uterus only on one side ( unicornuate ) , a double uterus in the middle ( didelphys ) , or a partially split uterus ( bicornuate , or arcuate ) . Many of these anomalies are also associated with differences in the formation of the kidneys . The most minor malformations are where there is extra tissue dividing the uterus ( septate uterus ) , or vagina ( a vaginal septum ) . Some women have extra tissue at their hymen , or entrance of their vagina . <h> Symptoms <p> Most women with uterine anomalies do not have symptoms and only realize that they have a uterine or vaginal anomaly during a routine exam or with an ultrasound when they are pregnant .

Your doctor may recommend a hysterosalpingogram to examine the cavity of the uterus , or a laparoscopy to examine the external surface . <h> Treatments <p> Many women with a congenital anomaly of the uterus will not require any treatment . However , if you were to experience severe pain with your periods or recurrent miscarriage , your doctor might recommend surgery .

For example , a cystocele is a weakness in the front wall of the vagina , near the bladder . A cystocele repair involves sewing the submucosal vaginal tissue back together where it has stretched . This repair is typically done through the vagina . A rectocele repair is done in a similar way except on the back or posterior wall of the vagina . <p> Women who have a vaginal vault prolapse , a drop in the top or roof of the vagina , require a different type of surgery . They may either have a vaginal or abdominal surgery . <h> Procedural Details <p> During the vaginal surgery , the surgeon reattaches the top of the vagina to supportive ligaments or structures in the pelvis , including the uterosacral ligaments , sacrospinous ligaments or ileococcygeous muscle . <p> The abdominal approach is called an abdominal sacrocolpopexy and is done through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incisions . The surgeon attaches a piece of synthetic mesh from the top of the vagina to the sacrum , which is the bony spine just above the tailbone . <p> If a woman is no longer sexually active , she might be offered a type of vaginal surgery for prolapse that renders the vagina functionally inadequate for intercourse . This surgery , called a colpocleisis , closes the vagina completely . The introitus , or outside of the vagina , appears normal , but the vaginal canal is closed . <p> Women with a prolapsing uterus will typically be offered a hysterectomy if they have completed childbearing because prolapse repairs last longer if the uterus is removed . If a woman who has uterine prolapse has not completed childbearing , a hysteropexy can be considered . A hysteropexy involves leaving the uterus in place and anchoring it to supportive ligaments in the pelvis or using synthetic material to reinforce the repair . <h> Considerations <p> Any woman with vaginal prolapse is a candidate for the procedures described above , however , women are generally encouraged to repair these problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Traditionally , the lifetime recurrence rate following prolapse surgery is 30% . However , the recurrence of vault prolapse after a sacrocolpopexy is less than 5% , and the recurrence of any prolapse after colpocleisis is also quite low . A woman 's best chance of having a repair that will last is at the first surgery . For unknown reasons subsequent surgeries are more likely to fail . <h> Risks of having surgical treatment of Vaginal Prolapse <p> Occasionally , adjacent organs can be injured during prolapse surgery , such as the bladder , rectum , or ureters . Bleeding and infections are very uncommon , less than 5% . <h> Risks of not having Surgical Treatment of Vaginal Prolapse <p> If vaginal prolapse is not treated , it can become larger , making treatment at that time more difficult .

Inguinal and femoral hernias are proximally located in the area of the groin crease , where the leg meets the pelvis . Both appear as a bulge under the skin , often initially without pain or other symptoms . It is possible to have both types of hernias simultaneously , so a hernia specialist should make the definitive diagnosis . <p> Most of these operations are elective in nature , and can be scheduled around the patient 's availability . Hernias that emerge with significant pain , nausea or fever may signify a lack of blood flow to the structure involved , and this could necessitate immediate emergency surgery . <p> Inguinal hernias are common among men ; one in four men develops an inguinal hernia during his lifetime , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inguinal canal , through which the spermatic cord , several nerves and vessels travel . These structures are slightly above the groin crease . The majority of inguinal hernia cases involve one side of the body only , although a hernia can be present on the other side without signs or symptoms . <p> Femoral hernias are significantly rarer and emerge relatively more frequently in women because of the different anatomy of the pelvis . They emerge at the femoral canal , through which the femoral vein , artery and nerve travel from the abdomen to the leg ; these structures lie slightly below the groin crease . Pain may be felt at the groin and upper thigh . With these hernias , the sac of small intestine is more often incarcerated " it can not be pushed back through the defect in the fascia " or strangulated , cutting off blood supply to the small intestine , although this is still rare . <h> Procedural Details <p> The patient 's other potential medical issues , such as upper respiratory infection and diabetes , should be managed optimally before surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that other such issues do not unduly heighten the risk of surgery . Both hernia types typically can be approached laparoscopically or via open surgery . Laparoscopy involves three or four small ( -+- to -+- inch ) incisions in the lower abdomen and pelvic region , one of which is a port for a miniature camera enabling the surgeon to see a highly magnified view of internal structures on a video monitor . Open-field surgery involves one large , shallow incision ( 3 to 5 inches ) in which all the internal structures are exposed . Either approach can be performed on an outpatient basis so the patient is not hospitalized overnight . <p> The patient is prepared for surgery . Depending on the hernia 's size and position , and the surgeon 's approach , some cases can be performed with spinal/epidural anesthesia only , but general anesthesia is typically used , as well as a preoperative antibiotic to guard against infection . The surgical site is marked , clipped/shaved , sterilized and anesthetized . The patient is placed on his back , facing upward , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , multiple techniques exist to repair the hernia . A surgeon 's choice of technique is guided by the hernia 's size and position , and the surgeon 's experience and preference . Surgery usually , but not always , involves the placement of synthetic mesh . Ask your surgeon about his/her planned approach and its underlying rationale . <p> The surgeon will attempt to push the hernia sac back into the peritoneal cavity , and may use sutures to reduce the sac 's volume . A piece of mesh " several types exist " generally is introduced over the known and likely hernia site(s) to stabilize the underlying structures and to guard against recurrence . The mesh , which is incorporated into the body 's fibrous tissue , may be fixed with absorbable or permanent sutures , tacks or glue " or it may not be attached at all , instead relying on abdominal pressure to keep the patch in place . The mesh 's edges must sufficiently overlap the defect . <p> The skin is closed with sutures or surgical staples . Uncomplicated repairs often take less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risk of excessive bleeding during the procedure , the patient must refrain from taking ibuprofen and other blood-thinning medications for several days before hand . The patient may be administered an antibiotic before surgery to reduce likelihood of infection . The surgeon may also prescribe medication to help manage the patient 's postoperative pain . <h> Considerations <p> Hernia repair is the most commonly performed operation . For inguinal hernia , in comparing laparoscopy against open surgery , outcomes data associates laparoscopy with a faster return to normal activities and less postoperative pain and numbness " but an slightly increased risk of serious injuries to the bladder , bowel and blood vessels . A patient with a large hernia may be eligible only for open repair . Outcomes associate use of mesh with lower rate of recurrence . <p> Laparoscopy requires more expertise , and should be considered in the context of the surgeon 's experience with that approach . <p> Patients should plan to rest a few days after the procedure , ideally with a friend or family member around to help .

Chronic pain is a complication that occurs in 5-10 percent of patients . Urinary retention is seen especially in patients with prior history of difficulty with voiding . <h> What are the risks of not having this treatment/procedure ? <p> In adults , these hernias typically grow with time , surgery is the only way to resolve them . With growth comes the increased likelihood of the hernia becoming symptomatic . Some data suggest that only 50 percent of patients are aware of hernias before the hernia becomes strangulated . <h> Urgency <p> If a hernia becomes strangulated , the patient may have only four to six hours before bowel is lost for lack of blood flow .

Some patients receive the contrast by mouth or as an enema ( injected into the rectum ) . <h> How should I prepare ? <p> It is OK to eat a light meal before your CT scan .

The parent will need to wear a lead apron to protect them from radiation exposure . <h> What can I expect during the scan ? <p> The CT technologist will help you get into position on the CT table .

In cases where bones are broken but the pieces remain aligned , the patient usually can be treated successfully with complete immobilization and rest . However , surgery is required for displaced fractures , in which two or more pieces of bone have separated and are no longer aligned with one another , and for other fractures in which force shatters bone into several small pieces . <p> Compared with open surgery , minimally invasive techniques to repair calcaneus fractures tend to have a lower risk of wound complications and require less time in the operating room . Wound healing also tends to occur faster because the foot 's soft tissue is handled less . <h> Procedural Details <p> The surgeon 's goal is to re-establish the correct size and shape of the heel bone . A skilled orthopaedic surgeon can fix a fractured calcaneus with a number of techniques , depending on the severity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anesthetized and receive an antibiotic to help prevent after-surgery infection . Minimally invasive procedures are performed through several small incisions , through which the surgeon manipulates instruments . A fluoroscope , an X-ray instrument that captures images of internal structures in real time , guides the surgeon 's movements . <p> Wires , pins and/or screws are precisely placed to stabilize the fracture . This surgical hardware is often inserted from the sides and back of the foot . <p> After surgery , the foot is elevated for up to 72 hours to reduce swelling . Ten to 12 days postoperatively , your physician may start you on simple range-of-motion exercises . Do not begin exercises until your doctor prescribes them . It may take as long as three months before you can put weight on your foot . <h> Medications <p> You may receive antibiotics prior to surgery to help lessen the chance of post-surgical infection . After surgery , pain medication usually is prescribed . <h> Considerations <p> A severely fractured calcaneus may require an open surgical procedure , which entails a long incision on the outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other structures . The surgeon refashions the heel bone and stabilizes it with a metal plate and several screws . <p> For patients who have suffered even more extensive damage , the heel joint must also be fused ( in addition to the plate insertion ) to pull bone fragments into alignment . Fusion is performed to decrease the chance of developing painful and debilitating arthritis . <p> Mild breaks may be treated by using a cast and keeping the foot immobile for several weeks . A severely fractured calcaneus may require an open surgical procedure , which entails a long incision on the outside of the heel that more fully reveals bones , ligaments and other structures . The surgeon refashions the heel bone and stabilizes it with a metal plate and several screws . <p> For patients who have suffered even more extensive damage , the heel joint must also be fused ( in addition to the plate insertion ) to pull bone fragments into alignment . Fusion is performed to decrease the chance of developing painful and debilitating arthritis . <p> People with poor circulation or diabetes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at higher risk of developing post-operative complications . Calcaneal surgical outcomes tend to be poorer among patients who smoke , studies suggest . <h> Effectiveness <p> Studies show that among correctly selected patients , the outcome of minimally invasive surgery to treat heel bone fractures is good to excellent . A 2006 study noted that 87 percent of patients treated with minimally invasive procedures experienced good to excellent results . Similarly , a 2007 study found favorable results for the minimally invasive approach to surgery , compared with the open-field approach . However , patients should note that severity of the injury is the greatest predictor of whether a minimally invasive technique is the best surgical option . <h> Risks involved with minimally invasive fixation of calcaneal fracture <p> All surgery carries risk , though some risks may be minor . Anesthesia may pose a risk , and superficial complications or deep wound infections may develop . Incision sites scar , sometimes more heavily than anticipated . In difficult fractures , additional surgeries may be needed , including joint fusion , to help alleviate pain . <h> Risks of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractures can result in long-term consequences , including : <p> arthritis and ongoing joint pain and stiffness <p> widening at the back of the heel resulting in difficulty in wearing shoes <p> tendon injuries creating pain on the outside of the heel and ankle <p> pain beneath the fleshy part of the heel ( the pad ) <p> nerve damage that feels like burning on the inside of the ankle <p> Quick diagnosis and proper treatment can help prevent long-term complications . But any heel fracture might also involve surrounding joints , tendons , ligaments , muscles and other tissues , which can cause pain to persist despite appropriate repair to the heel . Seeking treatment from an orthopaedist well-versed in foot care could lessen chances of such an outcome . <h> Urgency <p> Failing to treat a broken heel sets up the possibility of numerous long-term complications such as arthritis , severe pain and nerve damage . If surgery is needed , your doctor may need to wait a few days ; a calcaneus fracture usually causes the foot to swell significantly and surgery must be delayed until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that your heel is broken .

For some people , allowing time to recuperate is all that is needed . For others , medication and physical therapy may do the trick . But if the pain does not respond to one of these therapies , your doctor may recommend surgery . <p> The spinal column and vertebrae serve to protect the delicate nerves of the spinal column . To help illustrate the area being described , the four major areas of the spine include : cervical ( C1 " C7 ) or neck area , thoracic ( T1 " T12 ) or chest area , lumbar ( L1 " L5 ) or lower back , and the sacral ( S1 " S5 ) or area of the buttocks . The type and intensity of the pain patients feel depends in large part on the location of the vertebrae involved . <p> Herniated or slipped disks , spinal stenosis ( narrowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scoliosis and kyphotic deformities ( abnormal curvature or bending of the spine ) and spondylolisthesis ( slipping of the bones of the spine ) are common problems we hear about from patients . <p> Congenital defects are problems that result from abnormal growth or development of the spine and spinal cord , and include spina bifida ( incomplete closure of the spinal cord or myelomeningocele ) , scoliosis ( bending or twisting of bony spine ) , tethered spinal cord and diastematomyelia ( abnormal division of the spinal cord associated with a bony spur ) . <p> Trauma to the spinal and spinal cord result in approximately 10,000 new spinal cord injuries per year in the United States . Most injuries result from motor vehicle crashes , violent acts and falls . More than 80 percent of injuries occur in males . A spinal cord injury happens as a result of damage to the nerves in the spinal cord . For this to occur , usually the bones protecting the spinal cord have also been injured , either broken or dislocated . <p> Tumors of the spinal cord may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not metastatic lesions . Examples of spinal cord tumors are astrocytomas , ependymomas , meningiomas , schwannomas , and epidermoids . <p> Vascular lesions such as an arterio-venous malformation may also be found in the spinal cord . These lesions may cause symptoms that are similar to tumors and may even cause spinal cord strokes . Surgery may be warranted for removal or tumors , vascular lesions , and infection . In some cases , radiation and chemotherapy may be required . <h> Symptoms <p> Generally , symptoms related to spinal injuries and other disorders include : <p> Pain traveling down from the neck into arms and hands <p> Pain traveling from the back down the legs <p> Abnormal or loss of sensation in the arms , hands , legs , or feet <p> Weakness of the arms , hands , legs or feet <p> Difficulty passing stool or urinating <p> Balance problems <p> Change in walking style <p> Difficulty breathing <p> Abnormal posture <p> Surgery to correct these problems may be needed if the symptoms are directly related to structural problems . Alternatively , medications , change in lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ruptures are often referred to as pinched nerves or ruptured disks . The pain caused by a herniated or ruptured disk of the spinal column may lead to chronic pain and lifestyle limitations . In some cases , a ruptured disk may cause numbness or weakness . <p> Tumors of the spinal cord may cause symptoms such as weakness , loss of sensation and bowel and bladder problems . These symptoms result from tumors interrupting spinal cord function . <p> Cervical spine injury at this level may affect strength and feeling in arms , the trunk and legs . It may affect ability to breathe without support or cause difficulty in the ability to cough and take full , deep breaths . Control of urination and bowel movements may also be affected . Complete injury is called tetraplegia or quadriplegia . <p> Thoracic spine injury may affect movement and feeling in chest , abdomen and legs . Muscles in the chest and abdomen help to support coughing and breathing deeply , so a doctor will work with you on ways to avoid respiratory infections . Control of urination and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called paraplegia . <p> Lumbar spine injury may affect strength and feeling in the legs and control of urine and bowel function . Complete injury in the upper part of the lumbar spine may still be considered paraplegia . <p> The primary problem with sacral or coccygeal spine injuries may be function of bowel and bladder , although some movement of the feet and feeling in parts of the feet and legs may be affected . <h> Risk Factors <p> Spine and spinal cord injuries generally result in devastating loss of neurological function , although occasionally injuries affect only the bone and spare the spinal cord . <p> While surgery may be required to repair fractures , stabilize the bony spine , stop bleeding or repair torn membranes , it usually can not repair or restore function to the spinal cord itself . Thus , the goal of surgery is to prevent additional injury from occurring and maximize the opportunities for patients to participate in rehabilitation and physical therapy . <h> Diagnosis <p> Some congenital defects are recognized at or before birth and must be surgically treated within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obvious until a patient experiences a growth spurt or develops symptoms or signs related to that problem . <p> For the first few days after a spinal cord injury , it is usually hard to tell how much of the damage may be temporary and how much may be permanent .

Also , the spinal cord may go into shock right after the injury . <p> Injuries are described as complete or incomplete . Incomplete means the signals between the body and brain are partially interrupted . Complete means all signals between the body and brain are cut off at the level of the injury . <p> Spinal shock is a period of time when all of the functions of the spinal cord below the injury are stunned and do not work .

@@21161009 @1161009/ 60955 @qwx260955 <h> Foot Fractures 60965 @qwx260965 60964 @qwx260964 <h> Overview <p> Despite the fact that walking , running and jumping place great stress on our feet , their internal structures are surprisingly delicate . A fall from a height , a car accident , a jarring sports injury or even a fall that twists the top of your foot can significantly damage the structure . Any broken foot bone can result in long-term problems , and a broken heel bone or fractured bone at the midfoot can be especially serious . <p> Calcaneus fracture The calcaneus , or heel bone , is the foot 's largest bone . Because it absorbs so much force with each step , people might assume it 's one of the densest bones in your body . Not so . It 's hard on the outside but softer and spongy on the inside , similar to a hard-boiled egg . Because the interior bone is soft , when the heel bone fractures , it tends to fragment and collapse . Two of every 100 broken bones are calcaneus fractures . <p> Lisfranc fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( TMT ) joints come together . Lisfranc , a surgeon in Napoleon 's army , first identified injuries to this joint complex . The five long bones in the top of the foot , the metatarsals , join with several other , smaller bones . The area is interlaced with ligaments and tendons . As you walk , the midfoot helps take the energy you place on your heel and transfer it to the more supple and flexible forefoot to move you forward . An injury to this area can involve not only a fracture but also ligament damage . About one of every 100 people who break a bone experience a lisfranc fracture . <h> Symptoms <p> Calcaneus fracture Heel fractures usually are caused by a fall or other accident , such as a car collision . Traumatic heel fractures often result in bleeding and/or bones protruding from the open wound . In many cases , though , one or more bones break but there is no open wound . <p> Weakness in the foot and a loss of feeling can develop . Symptoms also can include pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the sole . The ankle might be bruised and tender , and moving the foot or putting weight on it might be difficult . <p> The heel also can develop stress fractures . Signs of a calcaneal stress fracture include heel pain that progresses over time , and swelling in the heel area . <p> Lisfranc fracture Because Lisfranc fractures often result from a twisting fall , or even stepping into a small hole while walking , they are often mistaken as a ligament sprain or strain of muscle or tendon . In an acute fracture , the top of the foot is swollen and painful . The foot can not bear weight and the top-of-the-foot joints are also painful . Pressing up on the foot and rotating it slightly causes significant pain . Symptoms of a partial or less acute fracture include pain , swelling and tenderness at the top of the foot . You may be able to put some weight on your foot , but it 's painful . <h> Causes <p> Calcaneus fracture Heavy force suddenly applied to the heel is the most common cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder , a vehicle accident in which the heel is slammed against the floor board , or landing badly on a foot during vigorous activities such as soccer , basketball , ice skating or ballet . In a small number of cases , the heel bone is fractured when the Achilles tendon " the fibrous tissue connecting the heel to the lower leg muscles " unexpectedly convulses and pulls off a small piece of bone . This is called an avulsion fracture . <p> The heel bone also can sustain a stress fracture , usually as a result of constant force being applied to the foot over a long span . Continual pounding of a runner 's heel , for example , is a long-term , low-energy force that can break the calcaneus . <p> Lisfranc fracture Lisfranc fractures happen because of high force suddenly applied to the top of the foot . A heavy object dropped on top of the foot can cause a Lisfranc fracture , as can a car accident or an industrial accident . Breaking a bone in this area can also occur if the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hole , someone tripping down the stairs or an athlete taking a hard hit on a foot that 's planted on the ground but flexed , such as a crouched football player ready to push off and run . Even a hurried step off the curb in which you twist your foot can cause damage . <h> Diagnosis <p> For fractures in both areas , physicians use a variety of imaging technology and techniques to help confirm a fracture , its specific location and severity . <p> X-ray : In almost all cases , the first step in diagnosing a possible foot fracture is an X-ray . The technician will take X-rays of the foot in several orientations . <p> Computed tomography ( CT ) : This specialized X-ray equipment creates multiple pictures of structures inside the body , which are then combined by a computer . Generally speaking , CT scans offer greater clarity than typical X-rays . CT scans of the foot and ankle yield especially detailed images of bones , muscles and blood vessels . You may receive a needle injection of a contrast material , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The contrast material helps the physician to see abnormalities more readily . <p> Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : For an even more refined view of the soft tissues in your foot , your physician may turn to magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . In this diagnostic test , a magnetic field and radio waves are combined via computer to produce exceptionally detailed images . <h> Complications <p> Calcaneus fracture Untreated heel fractures can result in long-term consequences , including the following : <p> Arthritis and ongoing joint pain and stiffness <p> Widening at the back of the heel , creating difficulty in wearing shoes <p> Tendon injuries creating pain on the outside of the heel and ankle <p> Pain beneath the fleshy part of the heel ( the pad ) <p> Nerve damage that feels like burning on the inside of the ankle <p> Quick diagnosis and proper treatment can help prevent long-term complications . But any foot fracture might also involve surrounding joints , tendons , ligaments , muscles and other tissues , which can cause pain to persist despite appropriate repair to the fracture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lessen chances of such an outcome . <p> Lisfranc fracture An untreated Lisfranc fracture can result in joint degeneration , arthritis , pain , instability of the ligaments and decreased foot function . A severe Lisfranc injury also might lead to compartment syndrome " in which a fracture , dislocation or crush injury creates rapid fluid accumulation in muscle in a confined area . The pressure can damage or permanently impair nerves and muscles . <h> Recovery <p> Calcaneus fracture A heel fracture should be addressed quickly and not ignored . Any sudden heel pain from fall or other accident warrants an immediate trip to the emergency room . Similarly , if you notice a dull aching pain that develops at the heel over a few days or weeks , see your doctor as quickly as possible . In such instances , avoid being on your feet as much as possible until your appointment . <p> Lisfranc fracture A Lisfranc fracture also can have long-term consequences .

@@21161014 @1161014/ 60955 @qwx260955 <h> Esophageal Diverticula 60965 @qwx260965 60964 @qwx260964 <h> Overview <p> An esophageal diverticulum is a pouch , or pocket , of stretched tissue that develops anywhere along the esophagus , pushing outward through its muscular wall . They are rare , and can be congenital or acquired . Typically a single pouch forms , most often near the top of the esophagus ; this is called Zenker 's diverticulum . In other cases , a pouch forms nearer to the bottom of the esophagus ( epiphrenic ) or , less frequently , in the middle . A single diverticulum ranges from 1 to 4 inches in diameter . Very rarely , tiny ( 5 mm ) diverticula emerge along the entire length of the esophagus , numbering from a few to a hundred or more . This condition , called intramural pseudodiverticulosis , is pathogenically different from the other pouches , but is associated with poor esophageal motility . <p> Non-congenital diverticula develop from a combination of uneven pressure and weak areas of muscle and tissue in the esophagus . Pressure can stem from structural disorders ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the esophagus ) , from poor coordination of the swallowing mechanism , poor movement of food through the esophagus , and from inflammation on the outside of the esophagus that pulls on its wall . <p> Diverticula do not always cause problems . Some collect food , which can lead to food regurgitation , dysphagia ( difficulty swallowing ) , chest pain , aspiration pneumonia , and feeling a need to clear one 's throat . As food collects in the pockets , it promotes bacteria in the esophagus , which commonly leads to halitosis ( bad breath ) . <p> Esophageal diverticula that are asymptomatic or only minimally annoying can go without treatment . Other cases might be treated with a change to a bland diet and increased water intake and/or antacids . Patients with more problematic diverticula , including those with underlying motility disorders , might require minimally invasive or open surgery , or other procedures such as repeated mechanical dilations of the esophagus . <h> Symptoms <p> Diverticula do not always cause problems . Food regurgitation might occur when standing , bending or lying down . Patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chest pain , heartburn and weight loss . In advanced cases , food can more easily be drawn into the lungs , causing aspiration pneumonia . As food collects in the pockets , it promotes bacteria in the esophagus , which also leads to halitosis ( bad breath ) . A patient 's voice also might change . <h> Causes <p> Esophageal diverticula can be congenital or acquired , usually developing later in life . Most of the acquired cases are associated with a motility disorder , such as achalasia , related to malfunctioning sphincter muscles at the upper ( Zenker 's ) or lower ( epiphrenic ) end of the esophagus , and/or along its length ( pulsion diverticula ) , and/or with swallowing dysfunction . Weak areas of tissue can develop as repeated obstructions build pressure inside the esophagus . <p> A Zenker 's diverticulum stems from increased pressure in the throat during swallowing against a closed upper esophageal sphincter . An epiphrenic diverticulum occurs from increased pressure against a closed lower esophageal sphincter as contractions move food along the esophagus . Inflammation of tissues outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the esophagus and other structures exist " can cause traction diverticula in the mid or lower esophagus . Rarely , diverticula can stem from an unrelated surgery to the esophagus and from Ehlers-Danlos syndrome ( weakness of collagen ) . <h> Risk Factors <p> Most esophageal diverticula occur in adults over 50 , especially those in their 70s and 80s . Very rarely , diverticula are present in infants and children . People who have a swallowing or esophageal-motility disorder , or esophagitis ( inflamed lining ) are more prone to develop diverticula . <h> Diagnosis <p> A physical exam could reveal a bulge in the neck , which might indicate a Zenker 's diverticulum . But more often , diagnostic tests help discern the presence of esophageal diverticula . A specialist can examine the patient 's esophagus with a thin , flexible tube called an endoscope , which is directed down the patient 's throat , into the esophagus . Its end has a light and miniature camera , enabling the physician to view the anatomy up-close on a video monitor . The camera also produces high-resolution images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another specialist . The procedure is typically performed with a topical anesthesia to numb the patient 's throat . <p> A patient might be asked to swallow an opaque barium solution that , when imaged with a CT scanner , will define the diverticulum 's structure and position , and might offer insight to an underlying motility problem . Chest X-rays and CT scans depict large esophageal diverticula as air- or fluid-filled balloons . Manometry measures the internal pressure of the esophagus at various points along its length , evaluating its ability to move food downward . <p> Each of these procedures is typically done on an outpatient basis in clinic . <p> Part of the lung often must be collapsed completely so the physician can clearly view the esophagus and diverticulum . However this is rarely necessary at UW Medical Center since most such procedures can be performed laparoscopically . <p> Leakage through sutures at the site where the diverticulum was removed <p> Injury to the vagus nerves might occur during dissection of the esophagus . <h> Recovery <p> A bland diet , increased water intake after meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement and the body 's position ( e.g. , lesser activity ; sitting or standing instead of lying down ) soon after eating might help a patient manage a less-disruptive diverticulum.

The condition usually affects the fifth lumbar vertebra in the lower back and , much less commonly , the fourth lumbar vertebra . If the stress fracture weakens the bone so much that it is unable to maintain its proper position , the vertebra can start to shift out of place . This condition , called spondylolisthesis may require surgery if too much slippage occurs and the bones press on the spinal nerves . <h> Symptoms <p> The symptoms of spondylolysis depend on the location of the injury . They range from mild to severe and may become chronic or disabling , depending on severity . Symptoms of spondylolysis affecting the cervical spine , or neck may cause : <p> Pain that comes and goes <p> Pain that spreads into your shoulders , arms , hands , or fingers <p> Morning neck or shoulder stiffness or a limited range of motion after getting out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tingling in your neck , shoulders , arms , hands , or fingers <p> Headache in the back of your head <p> Loss of balance <p> Difficulty swallowing ( This is rare , but it may occur if the spinal cord is compressed . ) <p> Symptoms of spondylolysis affecting the thoracic spine ( mid-back ) may include : <p> Pain in the upper and mid sections of the back <p> Bending and extending your body triggers pain <p> Morning mid-back stiffness after getting out of bed <p> Symptoms of spondylolysis affecting the lumbar spine , or lower back may include : <p> Pain that comes and goes <p> Morning low back stiffness after getting out of bed <p> Pain that decreases with rest or after exercise <p> Low back tenderness or numbness <p> Sciatica ( mild to intense leg pain ) <p> Weakness , numbness , or tingling in the low back , legs , or feet <p> Difficulty walking <p> Bowel or bladder problems ( This is rare , but it may occur if the spinal cord is compressed . ) <h> Causes <p> GeneticsThere may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thin vertebral bone and therefore may be vulnerable to this condition . Significant periods of rapid growth may encourage slippage . <p> OveruseSome sports , such as gymnastics , weight lifting , and football , put a great deal of stress on the bones in the lower back . They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch ( hyperextend ) the spine . In either case , the result is a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra . <p> In many people , spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis are present , but without any obvious symptoms . <p> Pain usually spreads across the lower back and may feel like a muscle strain . <p> Spondylolisthesis can cause spasms that stiffen the back and tighten the hamstring muscles , resulting in changes to posture and gait . If the slippage is significant , it may begin to compress the nerves and narrow the spinal canal . <h> Diagnosis <p> X-rays of the lower back ( lumbar ) spine will show the position of the vertebra . The pars interarticularis is a portion of the lumbar spine . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is normal in the vast majority of children . <p> If the pars " cracks " or fractures , the condition is called spondylolysis . The X-ray confirms the bony abnormality . <p> If the fracture gap at the pars widens and the vertebra shifts forward , then the condition is called spondylolisthesis . Usually , the fifth lumbar vertebra shifts forward on the part of the pelvic bone called the sacrum . The doctor measures standing lateral spine X-rays . This determines the amount of forward slippage . <p> If the vertebra is pressing on nerves , a CT scan or MRI may be needed before treatment begins to further assess the abnormality . <h> Complications <p> Aging and wear and tear on your spine are the major risk factors for cervical spondylosis . <p> You may be more likely to develop cervical spondylosis if you 've had a neck injury . <p> Spondylosis is also the most common cause of low back pain in adolescent athletes . <p> Cervical spondylosis is more common in people who have had neck injuries . <p> Such trauma might include work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic and acquired risk factors for cervical spondylosis have been identified by researchers : <p> The condition may run in families . <p> A congenitally narrow spinal canal increases the risk of developing cervical spondylosis with myelopathy . With a narrow spinal canal , the spinal cord -- a very sensitive structure that relays feelings to the brain and movement commands from the brain to the muscles -- has less space to fit inside the column of bone it occupies . Spinal canals also narrow as a result of the age-related changes of thickening of spinal ligaments and bone . This type of narrowing has the same effect as congenital narrowing . <p> Several varieties of excessive segmental motion such as atlantotaxial instability , often present in persons with Down syndrome , cerebral palsy and rheumatoid arthritis , are known risk factors . <p> Smoking contributes to degenerative disk disease , and is therefore a risk factor . <p> History of trauma ( hits and blows ) to the forehead predispose one to cervical spondylosis.

It occurs in 33 percent of Americans between ages 65 and 75 , and in 40 percent of those over 75 . The sources of presbycusis include physiological changes within the ear , the degradation of nerves connecting the ear to the brain , and a reduction in blood supply to the ear . These changes can be caused by a lifetime of exposure to loud noises or by heredity . To some degree , however , they result from a natural aging process . The most common treatment for presbycusis is the use of hearing aids and other sound-amplification or alerting equipment often called assistive listening devices ( ALDs ) . Examples include infrared television listening devices , personal frequency-modulated ( FM ) systems , and devices that flash a light when the door bell rings . <h> Symptoms <p> Age-related hearing loss usually occurs in the high-pitch range ( such as the high-pitched keys on the piano ) . Since the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inability to follow conversations is often the major symptom of presbycusis . The patient will be able to hear a person 's voice but will not always be able to understand what is being said . Many aging people also experience a reduced ability to separate voices from background noise . Because these changes occur gradually , the patient may not notice the hearing loss as it occurs . The hearing loss usually affects both ears equally . <h> Causes <p> The most common cause of presbycusis is damage to the cochlea ( inner ear ) , the organ that transforms sound waves into electrical signals . This damage occurs as a natural result of aging , but it is accelerated by a lifetime of exposure to loud noise . Other degenerations include a loss of blood-vessel volume around the cochlea and a loss of neurons in the auditory nerve , which carries electrical signals from the cochlea to the brain . Disorders affecting circulation , such as stroke and heart disease , can also cause hearing loss . <h> Risk Factors <p> Age is the most important risk factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( construction work and loud music , for example ) , and short-term exposure to very loud noise ( such as explosions ) are also risk factors . <h> Diagnosis <p> Hearing loss is usually first detected by a patient 's family , friends , or a family physician . A referral to an audiologist ( a non-physician hearing specialist ) may be recommended to obtain a formal evaluation . This evaluation will involve multiple diagnostic procedures , the most common of which is an audiogram . This test determines the degree of hearing loss and which frequencies ( pitches ) are affected . Tests of speech understanding will also be conducted to assess the effect of the hearing loss on communication . Depending on the results of these tests , an additional referral may be made to an otologist , a physician specializing in diseases of the ear . <h> Complications <p> The hearing loss may come to affect everyday communication . This may lead to feelings of frustration , isolation , and loneliness . Occasionally , hearing loss in an older person may be a symptom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud noises , control of blood pressure , and abstinence from smoking have all been shown to make presbycusis less likely and/or less severe .

Brain tissue that no longer receives its blood supply can die within a few hours unless something is done to stop the damage . <p> Ischemic stroke represents about 80 percent of all strokes in the United States . <p> The blockage of arteries can occur in large arteries in the neck or the base of the brain , or in small arteries inside the brain itself . A blood clot can form in the brain or it can form elsewhere and be carried to the brain by an artery . This type of stroke is called an embolic stroke . As many as 20 percent of victims die in the month after having an ischemic stroke , and the majority of survivors have some long-term disability . <h> Risk Factors <p> There are many conditions that increase a person 's risk of ischemic stroke . These include high blood pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unhealthy lifestyle . Treating these conditions can decrease stroke risk . <h> Diagnosis <p> The doctors will need to make sure that the symptoms you are experiencing are due to a stroke . In order to do this , the doctors will find out more about you by asking you and your family about your medical problems and about the symptoms you are experiencing . You will likely have an EKG to assess your heart rhythm and activity . The doctors will need todo a physical examand draw some blood to send to the laboratory . <p> Pictures of your brain will also be obtained in most circumstances . The pictures of your brain will help to determine if you are having an ischemic stroke ( blockage without bleeding ) or if you have bleeding in or around your brain ( hemorrhagic stroke ) . <p> Pictures of your brain may be obtained using any of the following : <p> Computed tomography ( CT scan ) : A CT scan may be normal if it is done soon after the onset of symptoms . A CT scan is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . In some hospitals , a CT angiogram ( CTA ) may be done to localize the blockage and a perfusion CT scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain . <p> Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI scan ) : A special MRI technique ( diffusion MRI ) may show evidence of an ischemicstroke within minutes of symptom onset . In some hospitals , an MR angiogram ( MRA ) may be done to localize the blockage and a perfusion MRI scan may be done to see where the blood is flowing and not flowing in your brain . <p> Angiogram : a test that looks at the blood vessels that feed the brain . An angiogram will show whether the blood vessel is blocked by a clot , the blood vessel is narrowed , or if there is an abnormality of a blood vessel known as an aneurysm . <p> Carotid duplex : A carotid duplex is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have atherosclerosis ( narrowing ) of the carotid arteries . These arteries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain . <p> Transcranial Doppler ( TCD ) : A TCD is an ultrasound study that assesses whether or not you have atherosclerosis ( narrowing ) of the blood vessels inside of your brain . A TCD can also be used to see if you have emboli ( blood clots ) in your blood vessels . <p> Echocardiogram : An echocardiogram is an ultrasound study of the heart . It can be done by placing the ultrasound probe on your chest ( a transthoracic echocardiogram ) or in your throat ( a transesophageal echocardiogram ) . The purpose of an echocardiogram is to see if there are blood clots in your heart that may have led to your stroke . <h> Complications <p> Common complications resulting from a stroke are : <p> Urinary tract infection <p> Bladder control <p> Pneumonia <p> Brain swelling <p> Seizures <p> Depression <p> Bedsores <p> Fatigue <p> Common conditions resulting from a stroke are : <p> Difficulty speaking or understanding speech ( aphasia ) <p> Difficulty with movement on one side of the body ( hemiparesis ) <p> Difficulty with sensation on one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or paying attention to the world around you <p> The team of health-care professionals caring for you in the hospital has many options available to treat these complications . <h> Recovery <p> Movement of the extremities is often impaired after a stroke , but the ability to move usually improves substantially during the first months after the stroke and can continue to improve for some time thereafter . Recovery takes longer when there is serious impairment of movement . Most patients will have some remaining impairment of motion following their stroke . <p> Speech ability also is often impaired after a stroke . Speech improves in most patients . Some patients continue to show improvement for months or years afterward . <p> Strokes can be very different for different people , and the effects will vary depending on what part of the brain is injured . Because of this , it is not easy to generalize about the extent of improvement that you can expect . In addition , the patient 's outcome will depend on his/her general health . A healthy , active , young person will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a person has only mild symptoms during the first few days after a stroke , they will generally be able to function better after recovery than a person who had severe symptoms after their stroke . Younger patients will have better recovery than elderly patients . The larger the area of damage to the brain , the less chance there is of getting full recovery . <p> When brain cells die as a result of a stroke , the body removes the dead cell debris . The brain function that has been impaired by the stroke can recover . <p> Undamaged brain areas near the area of the stroke may have impaired function as a result of the loss of normal communication with the damaged tissue . But after time , these regions resume their activity and some of the functions that were performed by the damaged area can be taken over by a neighboring healthy area of the brain and allow recovery to occur . <p> In the normal brain , an activity , such as pointing a finger , is the result of coordinated activity in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one part of this network of activity , the remaining parts of the brain increase their activity in an effort to recover the function . <p> In addition , there are two brain hemispheres and when an area in one hemisphere is damaged , many patients start to use both sides of the brain to perform a task . <p> Today , good medical care allows the brain to heal after a stroke . Physical , occupational and speech therapy all play an important role in patients that have disabilities from their stroke . Family and other caregivers are vital to support the patient 's efforts toward recovery . <p> The brain has mechanisms to repair itself , but scientists are just beginning to understand them . The results from some experimental studies show that some medicines that stimulate brain cell activity or cause brain cells to grow can increase recovery from stroke . In other studies , introducing cells into the brain can promote recovery . <p> There are many reasons to be optimistic about meaningful recovery after a stroke .

The main risk factors for type 2 diabetes are a diet high in calories , being overweight and an inactive lifestyle . If you have diabetes , you need to watch your intake of sugar and carbohydrate . A registered dietitian can help you to manage your blood sugar level . <h> Myth : All Fats are Bad <p> Truth : Everyone needs fat , and it aids in nutrient absorption , nerve transmission and maintenance of cell membranes . Fats are not created equal . Some fats promote good health while others increase the risk for heart disease . Try to replace the bad fats ( saturated and trans ) with the good fats ( polyunsaturated and monounsaturated ) .

No matter what types of food are eaten , if you decrease your caloric intake by 500 calories per day , you will lose one pound per week .

Sometimes it also reduces metastasis . The goal of this treatment is to keep the tumors under control for months and sometimes years . A group of experts on liver tumors has determined that TACE is the best treatment for you right now . This treatment will not cure your cancer by itself . You may also need surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy , or radiofrequency ablation ( using a heat probe to destroy the rest of the tumor ) . <h> How does TACE work on liver tumors ? <p> The liver is unique because it gets blood in 2 ways : from a large portal vein and from the hepatic artery . Healthy liver tissue : <p> Gets most of its blood supply from the portal vein <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery <p> But , a liver tumor : <p> Gets most of its blood supply from the hepatic artery <p> Gets almost no blood supply from the portal vein This means that if a chemotherapy drug is injected into the hepatic artery , most of the drug ends up in the tumor . Very little of the drug reaches healthy liver tissue . <h> How is TACE done ? <p> TACE is done by an interventional radiologist ( a doctor who specializes in procedures that are guided by X-ray images ) . <p> An anesthetic ( numbing medicine ) will be applied to your skin . It will sting for 5 to 10 seconds . Then the area will be numb and you will not feel pain . <p> Your doctor will make a very small incision ( less than -+ inch long ) in your groin . <p> Your doctor will then thread a catheter ( small plastic tube ) from an artery in your groin into the artery in your liver that carries blood to the tumor . X-ray images will help your doctor place the catheter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catheter into the tumor . <p> Then , tiny beads are injected into the artery . These beads travel toward the tumor and block its blood supply <h> How Do I Prepare ? <p> Before Your Procedure <p> A nurse coordinator will call you the afternoon before your procedure . If your procedure is on a Monday , the nurse will call you the Friday before . The nurse will give you final instructions and answer any questions you have . <p> If you do not understand English well enough to understand these instructions or the details of the procedure , tell us as soon as possible . We will arrange for a hospital interpreter to assist you . A family member or friend may not interpret for you . <p> You will have blood tests done when you arrive for your procedure . <p> If you have had an allergy or bad reaction to contrast ( X-ray dye ) in the past , please call our nurse coordinators at one of the numbers on the last page of this handout . You may need to take medicine for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not normal and we need to give you X-ray dye , we may prescribe a medicine for you to take before and after your procedure . This medicine will help protect your kidneys . <p> Drink plenty of fluids the day before your procedure . <p> If you take any blood-thinning medicines ( such as Coumadin , Lovenox , Fragmin , or Plavix ) , you may need to stop taking the medicine for 3 to 9 days before the procedure . You will receive instructions about this . <p> If you have diabetes and take insulin or metformin ( Glucophage ) , you will receive instructions about holding or adjusting your dose for the day of your TACE procedure . <p> If there are tumors in both lobes of your liver , TACE is done on the other lobe . <p> If the tumor was only in 1 lobe of your liver , you will have radiology exams ( MR imaging or a CT scan ) and blood tests . These tests will show how your liver is responding to TACE . Your doctors will decide if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If your cancer was very extensive , more TACE will be done to the most affected parts of your liver . <p> If you do not need more TACE , you will have radiology exams ( MR imaging or a CT scan ) to find out how your liver is responding . Your doctors will decide if you need more therapy based on the results of these tests . <h> What chemotherapy drugs are used ? <p> Many different chemotherapy drugs may be used in your treatment . Most people receive only doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) . <h> What are the side effects ? <p> We deliver the chemotherapy drugs in a way that they mostly stay in the liver . This means that your system will absorb the chemotherapy drugs very slowly . This lessens , but does not get rid of , the short-term side effects that people often have from chemotherapy . The most common side effects are nausea and fatigue . Nausea is more likely when a mixture of 3 drugs is used . Very rarely , a person receiving TACE will lose some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nurse will take you to the radiology suite . This nurse will be with you for the entire procedure . <p> If needed , an interpreter will be in the room or will be able to talk with you and hear you through an intercom . <p> You will lie on a flat X-ray table for the procedure . <p> Wires will be placed on your body to help us monitor your heart rate . <p> You will have a cuff around your arm . It will inflate from time to time to check your blood pressure . <p> A radiology technologist will clean your skin around your groin with a special soap . Tell this person if you have any allergies . The technologist may need to shave some hair from the area where the doctor will be working . <p> The entire medical team will ask you to confirm your name and will tell you what we plan to do . This is for your safety . <p> Then , your nurse will give you medicine to make you feel drowsy and relaxed before we begin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given a sedative medicine ( similar to Valium and morphine ) through your IV . This medicine will make you sleepy , help you relax , and lessen your discomfort . You will stay awake . This is called conscious sedation . You will still be sleepy for a while after the procedure . <p> For some people , using conscious sedation is not safe . If this is true for you , you will need anesthesia ( medicine to make you sleep during the procedure ) . <p> Can not lie flat for about 1 hour because of back or breathing problems <p> Have a hard time lying still during medical procedures <p> Weigh more than 300 pounds ( 136 kilograms ) <h> Risks/Complications <p> All medical procedures involve some risk . But , the potential benefits of TACE far outweigh the risks . In large doses , doxorubicin can damage the heart . It is recommended that a person receive no more than about 500 mg of doxorubicin over their lifetime . Each round of TACE uses 50 mg of doxorubicin . The most common complications are : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your groin <p> Liver function gets worse <p> The risk of a serious complication is about 5% ( 5 out of 100 people ) . One of your doctors will talk with you about your risks before you start TACE . Please be sure to ask all of your questions and talk about any concerns you have . <h> After Your Procedure <p> You will stay overnight in the hospital after your procedure so that we can monitor you . <p> You will need to rest in bed for 2 to 6 hours . You must keep the leg below where the catheter was inserted very still for that time . This will help lower the risk of bleeding . After that you can move around and use the restroom . <p> You will most likely be able to eat and drink , and your family may visit you . <p> Some people have a computed tomography ( CT ) scan the day after their TACE . This scan will show how well the chemotherapy drug has spread through the tumor ( or tumors ) . <p> Most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are rare . If they occur , we may need to keep you in the hospital longer so that we can keep watching you or treat you . <h> When You Get Home <p> Side Effects Most people have some side effects after chemoembolization . This is called post-embolization syndrome . These side effects include : <p> Fatigue <p> Pain <p> Nausea <p> Slight fever or chills that can last about a week <p> Pain is a common side effect . It occurs because the blood supply to the tumor is blocked . This pain can usually be treated with pain medicines . <p> Activity <p> You may shower or bathe as soon as you wish after your procedure . <p> For about 2 to 3 days , avoid strenuous activity and do not lift anything that weighs more than 20 pounds . <p> You will most likely have fatigue and a loss of appetite for 2 weeks or longer . These are normal after TACE . <p> Most people can return to their normal activities within 1 week . <h> When to Call <p> You will leave the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor right away if you have : <p> Pain that suddenly gets worse or changes in any other way <p> A fever higher than 101-F ( 38.3-C ) or chills <p> Bleeding or swelling at the groin puncture site <p> Severe abdominal pain <p> Any other changes that concern you <h> Who to Call <p> Interventional Radiology nurse coordinator : 206.598.6897 Procedure Scheduling : 206.598.6209 After hours ( between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m. ) , and on weekends and holidays Ask for the Interventional Radiology Fellow on call : 206.598.6190 If You Have an EmergencyGo directly to the nearest Emergency Room or call 9-1-1 .
