Legislative leaders told Gov . Deval Patrick in 2012 that they would revisit criminal justice and sentencing reforms in the 2013-2014 session , but they did n't  . <p> The 2015-2016 session was also a wipeout for activists , who watched as policymakers and Gov . Charlie Baker punted the issues to outsiders to see if they could come up with a plan . Heading into 2017 , administration officials and lawmakers are waiting to see what a special commission recommends after working with outside consultants from the Council of State Governments Justice Center . Activists pressing major reforms fear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation will be narrow in scope , with a focus on probation , parole and other post-release services . <p> Frustrated after years of being told to wait for broad reforms , advocates are gearing up to fight for other measures including bail changes , repeals of mandatory minimum sentencing and greater use of diversion programs . Some initiatives that cleared the Senate in 2016 , including expungement of juvenile misdemeanor records and raising the cash value at which larceny becomes a felony offense , are expected to resurface in the new session . <p> A new House chair of the Judiciary committee , to be appointed in January or February by Speaker Robert DeLeo , will play a role in determining how far those and other criminal justice issues make it through the legislative process . <h> HEALTH CARE <p> Total health care expenditures have outpaced the states economic growth rate for two straight years , a significant portion of the states population remains uninsured despite a mandatory health insurance law , and rising premiums and access to care , including oral care , are issues for many patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staggering 2 million of its residents enrolled in Medicaid , the taxpayer-funded health insurance program for those who are income eligible and individuals with disabilities .

At the same time , there 's talk in the Trump administration about converting Medicaid to a block grant program in an attempt to limit the flow of federal funds to the state . And a special commission looking at variations in prices charged by hospitals is closing in on possible recommendations . <p> If it sounds like a lot , it is . Per usual , the health care policy arena in Massachusetts is active , with plenty of uncertainty . <h> ENERGY <p> Diversification , costs and reliability remain the legs of the states three-legged energy policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his administration are implementing a major renewable energy law to procure large-scale hydropower and develop offshore wind farms that will eventually help power homes and businesses around the state . <p> A big hitch is that the fruits of that labor are several years from ripening .

As the administration works to finalize a new tariff-based solar renewable energy credit program , solar advocates are pressing the Department of Energy Resources to come up with a plan to bridge the gap between January and the summer , when the new program takes effect , to keep the subsidies flowing to the industry . <p> Caps on solar net metering are also being bumped up against in most utility territories , meaning that debate will perk up for another round early in the year . And while hydropower might eventually address some of the demand and reliability concerns in the grid , a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigation of the ongoing maintenance issues at the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Station will continue to fire up Pilgrim opponents who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled refueling in 2017 designed to keep the plant running until 2019 . Any adjustments to the states energy mix including new gas pipeline capacity must all be balanced against greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements and targets . <p> Lawmakers like Rep. Jay Kaufman and Sen. Michael Barrett will undoubtedly continue to make the case for a carbon tax , but more likely is a more aggressive effort by the Baker administration to promote the purchase of electric vehicles . A boost in zero-emission vehicle sales would dovetail nicely with the aims of the new court-ordered emission regulations from the Department of Environmental Protection that are up for hearings in February . The Supreme Judicial Court ordered the state to spread its emission reduction efforts across all sectors , including transportation , but some critics would like to see stricter caps on power plants . <h> INSTITUTIONAL RIVALRIES <p> The battles in the 2015-2016 session were largely between the House and the Senate , both controlled by Democrats , rather than between the Legislature and the new Republican governor .

But many other Democrats are hoping a strong candidate will step forward to challenge the governor . <p> Another session featuring divided Democrats in the Legislature would bode well for Baker , who like his mentor Bill Weld has made bipartisanship one of his main political selling points .

A 13-member task force led by the chairs of the House and Senate Ethics committees and the co-chairs of the Committee on State Administration and Regulatory Oversight has a deadline of March 15 to produce a report reviewing conflict of interest , financial disclosure laws , and the regulations of the State Ethics Commission , which enforces state ethics laws . <p> In February after publicizing the idea of the review of ethics laws , House Speaker Robert DeLeo said it was intended " with the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at for a period of time , some may have to be updated , again , because they have n't been looked at in a period of time , and some have to be clarified actually .

Short-term room rentals , marijuana sales and seven-figure incomes have all emerged as likely candidates for new or increased taxes . <p> Gov . Charlie Baker will not be able to wield his veto pen against a proposed constitutional amendment adding a 4 percent surtax to incomes over $1 million . In a 2016 joint session the House and Senate advanced the measure , which would need one more vote by the branches in constitutional convention scheduled to begin meeting no later than Wednesday , May 10 under the current joint rules before potentially advancing to the 2018 ballot . The Democrats who control the flow of business in the House and Senate have raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have refused to rule out tax hikes in 2017 . <p> Lawmakers are already making time in the first part of the two-year session to grapple with changes to the legalized marijuana sales law passed by voters , with some suggesting the 10 percent combined state sales and excise tax on pot is not high enough . Generally ill-disposed toward tax hikes , Baker initially supported a Senate move last summer to subject vacation rentals to the hotel room tax a move also backed by Airbnb , the highest-profile online repository of private room rentals . The governor then reversed course arguing the legislation would " impose burdensome taxes and government bureaucracy on folks who utilize short term vacation rentals . " A tax bill , which would need to originate in the House , could open the door to a variety of revenue-raising proposals . <h> EDUCATION FUNDING/REFORM <p> Lawmakers have identified education funding reform as a priority for the upcoming session , but a combination of overspending ( versus budget ) and slow revenue growth leaves the question hanging of where any new funding would come from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report found the current systems starting point underestimates the cost of educating students by at least $1 billion . There 's considerable overlap between backers of a funding formula overhaul and the opposition campaign that shut down a 2016 ballot question that would have allowed the up to 12 new charter schools each year . <p> While teachers unions , public school parents , local school committees and others who pushed against the ballot question are n't  likely to back down , expansion proponents are rallying supporters for Round 2 . " Although we took a punch , were back at it , " KIPP Boston parent Dawn Foye wrote in Dec. 21 email from Great Schools Massachusetts campaign , continuing , " Well come at it in a different way . " <p> A signature issue of Gov . Charlie Bakers in 2016 , charter expansion was defeated on two fronts with the loss at the ballot coming after the House and Senate failed to agree on an expansion bill . Baker called for a lift of the charter cap in his State of the State address last year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new plan to ensure there are no gaps in education adequacy or to send a message to forces looking for major new investments . <p> A Senate-backed plan to tie a modest charter cap lift to an big infusion of money across all public schools did n't  pique interest in the House , but the distaste voters showed in November for the broader expansion favored by many representatives could change their minds . <p> Baker has also pledged to boost education aid by the projected growth in state revenues , a promise that will be sized up when he releases his fiscal 2018 budget on Jan. 25 . <h> ONLINE GAMING , LOTTERY WOES <p> Its been five years since lawmakers came around to embrace the idea of casino gambling as a panacea for its transportation , local aid and economic development spending desires .

Michal Klau-Stevens , from TheBirthLady.com is here with all the information you need know to choose and use a home pregnancy test . <p> Pregnancy TestsBuying and using a pregnancy test for the first time can be confusing with so many choices available . Michal Klau-Stevens , from TheBirthLady.com is here with all the information you need know to choose and use a home pregnancy test . <p> How do pregnancy tests work ? They read levels of hCG , the hormone the body generates when it is pregnant . Levels of hCG can be picked up by pregnancy tests by the time you miss a period , and sometimes before . It depends on how much hCG your body creates early in pregnancy and how sensitive the test is . <p> What are the different levels of sensitivity ? Pregnancy tests read hCG levels in units called milli-International Units per liter . The lowest the manufacturers advertise they can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 50 or 100 mIU . The lower the number , the more sensitive the test and the earlier it can give a reliable result . <p> What are the differences between the tests that are available ? <p> Line tests Show either two lines or a plus sign for a positive test and one line or a minus sign for negative test Sensitivity depends on the brand Hold it in the urine stream Costs between $5 and $10 per test , often sold in packs of two or three Some people feel blue line tests are harder to read than pink line tests <p> Digital tests Digital read-out says " Pregnant " or " Not Pregnant , " or has smiley face or empty circle Sensitivity depends on brand , but tend to be less sensitive than some line tests Hold it in the urine stream Costs $10-$12 per test , sold in individual packs or packs of two Some people like to use the digital as a second test to confirm the results of a first test , and one brand sells a combo pack of a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-line tests without all the plastic around them .

The best time to test is the first time you use the bathroom in the morning . That 's when the hCG levels are most concentrated . Lay the test down flat and read it within the time it says to on the instructions . Testing usually takes between three and ten minutes . Do not read the test after the allotted time . It can give a false positive . Another thing that can happen after the allotted time is an evaporation line can appear . That 's a line that does n't  have color to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaporate , but sometimes it can be confused with a positive test . If you are not sure what you are seeing , test again . If you are testing early , like several days before you even expect your period , the test might not be accurate if the hCG levels are n't  high enough yet . Test again closer to the day you would expect your period , and if you miss your period even after a negative test , test again . If you get a positive test , go to your doctor or midwife to confirm and get started taking care of yourself for a healthy start to pregnancy . <p> Early testing can pick up chemical pregnancies . What is that ? A chemical pregnancy is when the egg gets fertilized , but it does n't  implant in the uterus , so its not a viable pregnancy . Only about 1 in 4 eggs that get fertilized implant , so chemical pregnancies are a common thing , but most women do n't  even know they are happening .

One way to avoid the emotional rollercoaster that causes is to wait to test until you miss your period . Women who have fertility issues might want to know if they are experiencing chemical pregnancies so they can tell their doctor . <p> Is it possible to be pregnant and not have it show up on the test ? Yes . Home pregnancy tests are n't  foolproof . There are some things , like PCOS or certain medications that can cause false negatives or false positives . If you feel like you might be pregnant , but the test keeps reading negative , go see your doctor or midwife .

After all , the most important part of embellishing clothing is finding the right FIXATIVE ! If you do n't  have the right glue , your washing machine and all your hard work will look like a bad Jackson Pollack painting . <p> here 's a list of the best glues to use : <p> #1 E6000 Fabric Fuse <p> For gluing fabric to fabric , rhinestones to fabric , ribbon to fabric , etc. , I found E-6000 Fabric Fuse to be the best . Its super sticky and it dries clear . It also holds decorations like lace firm on the denim so you do n't  need pins . <p> #2 GemTac Permanent Glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , this glue works great . It wont work on huge projects like the back panel of the SUPERHERO jacket I 'll be showing you . <p> #3 Aleenes Jewel It Glue &amp; Ok to Wash it Glue <p> Both of these glues work well and do n't  wash out . They are not as tacky as the E-6000 Fabric Fuse however . These glues work wonders on stretchable fabric like dance costumes . I also use this glue when I 'm out of paint and need to sprinkle glitter over the glue line to fake a decoration . ( All these techniques will be shown on the show . ) <p> One product I have found that works great for mending is Ultrahold Iron-On adhesive . It is a paper backed sheet of solid heat activated adhesive . It uses a low temperature &amp; short pressing time so it allows for a wider range of materials that can be bonded . Use with fabric , foil , lame , denim , felt , suede , leather , wood and cardboard . Machine washable . There is no steam or pressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing . Its no-sew bond is three times stronger than Stitch Witchery fusible web . Be careful not to get your iron too hot as it will melt the adhesive and it wont stick to your t-shirt or denim item . <p> WASHING TIPS : <p> Wash your one of a kind creation carefully ! Turn the jacket inside out and wash on delicate in cold water . Do not dry in the dryer as the paint and glue will melt ! ! ! I 've found DRYEL Home Dry Cleaning Kit to be a life saver for items like this but you must dry on NO HEAT . Please be aware these fabric paints and glues WILL ruin your clothes if they get on you . I 've had a few bits of paint on my shirt and NOTHING would get it off . The glitter came off but the paint did not so please cover up any nice clothes while crafting . <p> Ok , now for the fun part ! <p> You will need the following items : <p> A small size denim jacket ( I got mine from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabric $3 <p> Metallic , Glitter or Puffy Fabric Paint $1-3 <p> Rhinestones $2.50 and up <p> E-6000 Fabric Fuse Glue $5-7 <p> Modge Podge 4 Fabric $5 and up <p> Total cost $25 + or depending on your choices <p> You can go all out with this project and buy fabric permanent markers , Jacquard fabric paint , Iron On ink jet fabric sheets , Iron On Printable sheets , etc. , but you CAN make something cute with very little money . Often times you can find ribbon , coloring books , rhinestones , etc at the dollar store . The first thing we want to do is to map out the lines on the jacket . Denim jackets usually have a center back panel that is perfect for art work or a focus panel . Take a piece of gift tissue paper and trace around the raised hems for a pattern . Once the pattern is perfect , lay the tissue pattern over the novelty fabric and cut around the pattern . <p> Paint a layer of Modge Podge 4 Fabric adhesive on the back side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the front side so there are no air bubble or raised edges . You can also use this same technique with fabric glue . Once the fabric applique is dry , you will want to paint over it again with the glue . If you do n't  want to get your hands dirty , I suggest using the Ultrahold Iron-On adhesive . I do n't  think Ultrahold works as well , but I 'm putting a LOT of layers on to show how creative you can be . <p> After you have your fabric panels glued or ironed in , you can start embellishing . I started with the two front pockets and traced around the stitching with a black metallic fabric glue . If you are careful you do n't  even need a brush , you can squeeze it out in a line and it will dry nicely . Be aware the fabric paints in the squeeze tubes dry HARD ! If you want a soft touch you will need to buy Jacquard fabric paints and use a brush . <p> This jacket was very simple because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more instructions because its a girls jacket , and we all know how us girls love sparkly things ! <p> Disney Princess or Wonder Woman Jackets <p> Start by measuring your panels as shown above . If you want to make appliques , its the same method but faster . Once the appliques are dry and you have two layers of either Modge Podge Fabric or E-6000 Fabric Fuse painted over the top , you can start painting over them . ( PLEASE allow the fabric to dry over night before painting or adding rhinestones , etc . ) <p> When gluing on rhinestones or buttons , be sure to put enough glue down that it covers the outside rim of the stone . Once all the stones are glued , I chose to add MORE glue in between the stones . Then I sprinkled some dollar store glitter around the area . This way , if the glue dries in lumps , it will look better . TIP : Kids love GLOW IN THE DARK glue and paint . For girls clothes I usually squeeze out the paint in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Next we are going to glue some ribbon down the seams . Again , the more glue the better . Measure the ribbon so you have half an inch extra at the end . Glue a line down the seam and push the ribbon down into the glue . Pinning works but you will have to pry the pin out of the glue . I prefer using more glue and pushing it down with the end of a pen . Less injuries that way ! <p> Now we are going to cut the sleeves . You can measure the sleeves on your child or take a similar jacket of theirs and see how long the sleeves are . Cut off the extra length from the adult jacket . We can use the cut sleeve for a headband later . Now you are going to want to add either ribbon or lace . For adhering heavy lace onto an edge , you will want to use the E-6000 Fabric Fuse , not the Jewel It glue . Glue the lace on the under side of the sleeve , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it hides the raw edge . <p> For the Disney Princess jacket , I had my daughter draw some princesses on the back . If you are n't  a free hand artist , you can get a fabric tracing pencil and trace a coloring book page and then iron it on the back if your little one wants to paint it . This craft is far more fun when you and your kids do it together . They ALWAYS have their own style . I always consult my daughter before making her something , as her style is often not what I assumed . = <p> You can get really good at this craft very fast . I 've seen these jackets being sold on etsy for high dollar . Of course , the $300 ones are probably sewn not glued . My point is , up-cycled denim is very in style right now . Once the jackets were nearly done , I asked my 22 year old daughter if she would wear any of them . She loved the Wonder Woman jacket and she is not a girly girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so that tells you this craft will be well received by kids of all ages !

( AP Photo/CX Matiash , File ) <p> NEW YORK ( AP ) " Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $110 million to settle a class-action lawsuit over up to 2 million accounts its employees opened for customers without getting their permission , the bank announced Tuesday . <p> Its the first private settlement that Wells has reached since the company paid $185 million to federal and California authorities late last year . Authorities said bank employees , driven by high-pressure sales tactics , opened the bank and credit card accounts without customer authorization . <p> Wells also disclosed Tuesday that a federal regulator had downgraded its rating under a law designed to help monitor and promote banking practices to low-income and minority communities . The Office of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reason for the downgrade . The move means restrictions on Wells business , including opening more branches or making acquisitions . <p> The settlement will include customers who had accounts opened without their permission , or were signed up for a product they did not agree to , going back to Jan. 1 , 2009 . Wells Fargo says it believes this settlement , which is subject to court approval , will resolve the 11 other pending class-action lawsuits filed against it over the accounts . <p> Notably , Wells said it is waiving its right to take customers into what 's known as third-party arbitration , which let 's the bank take complaints to a private mediator instead of a court of law . The practice has been a source of controversy for the bank , and customer advocates and politicians had been pressuring Wells to give up its right to use arbitration . Until Tuesday , Wells had been invoking its right to arbitration in this particular case . <p> " We believe this is an outstanding result obtained for the benefit of a proposed nationwide class , notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitration clause , " said Derek Loeser , a partner with Keller Rohrback , one of the firms that filed a class-action suit against the bank . <p> After paying attorneys fees , the $110 million will first go to cover any customers out-of-pocket losses or fees that they may have incurred due to the unauthorized accounts . All remaining money will be split among the all impacted customers . <p> San Francisco-based Wells Fargo has seen sharp declines in new account openings and bank traffic , and has been working to restore customers trust since the practices came to light . The biggest scandal in the banks history led to the abrupt retirement of its CEO , John Stumpf . In response to the scandal , Wells has changed its sales practices , ousted other executives and called tens of millions of customers to check on whether they truly opened the accounts in question . <p> " This agreement is another step in our journey to make things right with customers , " Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan said in a prepared statement .

Banks can be fined or sanctioned under the law when evidence show patterns of discriminatory behavior . <p> In its report , which covers 2009-2012 , the regulator cited the sales practices scandal as a sign of unfair or deceptive behavior . It also cited previous settlements from that period , including one the bank reached in 2012 in which Wells was accused of selling subprime and more costly mortgages to black and other minority borrowers . <p> " These findings reflect an extensive and pervasive pattern and practice of discriminatory and illegal credit practices across multiple lines of business within the bank , resulting in significant harm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sloan said the bank was " disappointed " with the decision but is " committed to addressing the OCCs concerns .

If its compromised at any one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One simple way to avoid this problem is to start with a base password you can remember , and then add on letters and numbers that reference where you 're using it . If your base password is " greatsurfer2017 " ( which is n't particularly secure ; more on that in a moment ) , you could make " greatsurfer2017Y " your Yahoo password , and " greatsurfer2017G " your Google password . <p> If you ca n't be bothered to do more , this is a base level of security that can help shield you from the most obvious threats . But its still only a baby step . <p> PICK A STRONGER PASSWORD <p> You can make things harder for attackers by making your base password stronger . The more complicated and lengthy a password is , the harder it will be for hackers to guess . <p> The downside : Tougher passwords are also harder to remember . But there are some ways around that . <p> Do n't  include your kids names , birthdays or references to any other personal details . Hackers routinely troll Facebook and Twitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passwords such as " Password123 " are also bad , as are words commonly found in dictionaries , as these are used in programs hackers have to automate guesses . <p> You can make your own strong passwords with randomly capitalized nonsense words interspersed with numbers and characters like , say , " giLLy31 ! florp .

Its now commonplace for many email and social media accounts . That way , even if hackers manage to get your password they still need your phone with the texted code . <p> " Having another way for that account to say Hey , is that really you ? , and give veto authority is really important , " Winterton said . <p> KEYWORDS MATTER <p> According to the indictment , the Russian hackers searched email accounts for keywords like " passwords " to find peoples passwords for other accounts .

( State House News Service ) The governor and his budget chief on Thursday morning pitched investors on their proposal to change the way the state stashes away money in its rainy day fund , an account that rating agencies give serous weight to when assessing the states creditworthiness . <p> On a conference call with investors and potential investors , Gov .

This is a pre-budget transfer rather than waiting until the distribution of excess capital gains tax revenues at the end of the fiscal year , " Administration and Finance Secretary Kristen Lepore said during the investor call Thursday . " Second , at the end of the fiscal year we will mandate a deposit of 50 percent of all tax revenue above projection , regardless of the revenue source . " <p> Lepore said the proposal would guarantee a deposit of at least $51.1 million in fiscal 2018 , though the administration expects the total deposit to be $98 million . <p> As of Jan. 31 , the stabilization fund had a balance of $1.298 billion , according to the comptrollers office , a balance that has seen increases throughout the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $2 billion before the 2008 recession . There have been no disbursements from the fund this fiscal year . <p> The Legislature in recent years has not been shy about spending reserves to plug budget holes , and the MTF report found lawmakers transferred or diverted a " staggering " $2.2 billion from the stabilization fund to pay operating expenses between the 2013 and 2015 fiscal years , years of economic growth . <p> The current process for depositing funds into the rainy day fund has two shortcomings , MTF said . <p> " First , capital gains revenues that have been far different from initial projections has caused budget problems , " MTF wrote in its assessment of Bakers fiscal 2018 proposal . " Second , the deposit is n't made until the end of the fiscal year and it has proven tempting for budget-makers to suspend the deposit from ever occurring if budget challenges arise .

Under the current system , $103 million would be held aside until the end of the fiscal year as expected capital gains revenue above the agreed-to threshold , though no amount would be deposited until the end of the fiscal year . <p> But under Bakers proposed system , half of that $51.5 million would be deposited via a pre-budget transfer while the other half could be put into use on the operating side of the budget . <p> The Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center , the more liberal-minded state budget watchdog , said it is not clear whether Bakers proposal would make the process of building up state reserves any better . The proposal reduces the amount of revenue technically required to be deposited to the fund , but might increase the likelihood that such deposits actually would be made , MassBudget said . <p> " The new rule normally would mean a reduction in the amount contributed to the Rainy Day Fund relative to the amount that would be contributed under the current rule . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current rules has n't  actually been made , " MassBudget wrote in its analysis of Bakers fiscal 2018 budget plan .

If the dog is happily running into the crate , introduce a verbal cue such as " kennel up " or " in your den " before you toss the treat in the crate.After many repetitions , say your verbal cue and wait to see if the dog will run in the crate on his own before you toss the treat . Be patient ! When he does , lots of praise and jackpot him by tossing 3 or 4 treats to him in a row . No treats for coming out .

Do not let him out if he is making a fuss . Wait for quiet first . <p> Maintenance : Continue with varied training sessions . Sometimes its the in and out game , sometimes a surprise treat already in there when the dog did n't  expect it.Start multi-tasking work on crate training while you are doing real life things such as folding the laundry , making dinner etc .

If he does n't  give the item up immediately it is ok for you to put a treat right on his nose to remind him . <p> Do n't  be stingy : Your dog is naturally driven to grab and chew on things in the environment .

@@1233264 <p> Testifying before the Senate Committee on Global Warming and Climate Change , Suuberg said that developing rules and strategies will take time but state environmental officials " recognize the need for action " and intend to comply with the courts ruling . <p> " We recognize that if this is going to have an impact on 2020 , we need a constructive , expeditious schedule , " Suuberg said . <p> In a unanimous May 17 decision , the courts justices found that current DEP regulations do not fulfill the specific requirements of the Global Warming Solutions Act . The ruling requires the department to promulgate regulations " that address multiple sources of categories of sources of greenhouse gas emissions , impose a limit on emissions that may be released , limit the aggregate emissions released from each group of regulated sources or categories of sources , set emission limits for each year , and set limits that decline on an annual basis . " <p> Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Matthew Beaton told the News Service last week that he expected " a long process to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee that the state " is still at the early innings " of developing new regulations , Suuberg said the departments legal and technical staffs have been reviewing the courts decision . <p> Beaton plans to convene a meeting of the Global Warming Solutions Act implementation advisory committee to discuss " areas to focus on to achieve the reductions , " Suuberg said . Chaired by Undersecretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs Ned Bartlett , the 15-member committee includes representatives from business , energy , environmental , transportation and academic communities . <p> " We expect to make substantial progress in 2016 and 2017 , " Suuberg said . " In the next few weeks , we will be developing a more detailed schedule of actions to be taken and relevant milestones . " Suuberg said the Department of Environmental Protection will look at all sectors and possible strategies for reducing greenhouse gas . Suuberg said he expected a " significant amount " of stakeholder input along the way . <p> During the hearing , committee members and activists recommended approaches the department could take to comply with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Acadia Center , said a mix of policies would be required and the state would " need the electric sector to lead the way . " The clean power sector could " serve as a backbone " for other emissions reduction efforts , Shattuck said . <p> Conservation Law Foundation staff attorney David Ismay offered a series of suggestions , including raising requirements for renewable energy standards , further driving down the number of vehicle miles traveled annually , ramping up energy efficiency efforts and repairing gas distribution leaks . <p> " We think the DEP should be looking toward things it already has control of , systems it already has in place , that are capable of being adjusted to get those bigger gains , " Ismay said . <p> Fixing the leaks in seven " super emitters " in the gas distribution system could account for nearly half of the required emissions reductions by 2020 , Ismay said . <p> In response , Sen. Michael Barrett called for a focus not just on meeting one years goals , but for a strategy that builds up annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You plug em once , and you 've got the superest of the emitters , and you do n't  realize the same savings the next iteration of gas system work , " Barrett said . <p> Barrett , a Lexington Democrat , described carbon pricing as " the most potentially promising strategy we have " in emissions reductions . <p> Barrett and committee chairman Sen. Marc Pacheco , a Taunton Democrat , have both filed carbon pricing legislation this session . Under extensions , the Joint Committee on Telecommunications , Utilities and Energy has until July 1 to report out both bills ( S 1747 , S 1786 ) . <p> The Massachusetts Campaign for a Clean Energy Future , a coalition of carbon-pricing supporters , issued a statement after the hearing saying that the state would not be able to meet its emissions reductions requirements " without stronger reforms .
