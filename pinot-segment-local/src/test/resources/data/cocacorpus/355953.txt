@@101401549 @5601549/ <p> Thursday , Dec. 17 , 2015 Toronto , ON " Ontario 's doctors welcome the government 's discussion paper on reforms to the province 's health-care system . The discussion paper contains many of the guiding principles doctors have long advocated for , including ensuring access to a family doctor for all Ontarians , equitable access to inter-professional care , effective integration of patient care , and timely and appropriate access . <p> Many of the proposed reforms promise to help improve Ontario 's health-care system . However , strengthening patient-focused care , which the government has indicated is a key priority of these reforms , can not be achieved while the government continues to cut funding for physician services . Since February 2015 , the government has cut by almost seven per cent the funding for the necessary care Ontario 's doctors provide to patients . <p> Furthermore , long-term system transformation necessitates a long-term , stable funding mechanism . That is why Ontario 's doctors have asked for a binding dispute resolution mechanism , which would provide a permanent and stable framework in which Ontario 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the future of the health-care system . The government has so far refused this request , which is why in October 2015 Ontario 's doctors launched a Charter challenge against the Government of Ontario . <p> Given the magnitude of the changes being considered and the lack of details provided , Ontario 's doctors have concerns with the timeline laid out for discussion . Any reform to Ontario 's health-care system must draw on the expertise and ideas of doctors , who are on the front lines providing care to patients every day . <p> At its Board of Directors meeting this week , the Ontario Medical Association endorsed the creation of a Primary Health Care Advisory Group . Ontario 's doctors and the government have worked as partners in the past to improve the province 's health-care system . We remain willing to return to working together .
