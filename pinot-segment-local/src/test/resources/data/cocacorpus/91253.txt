The scammers do n't need the physical card to redeem the value and instead get victims to read out the serial code on the back over the phone .

When they return the call they are told that a warrant is out in their name and they risk being arrested if they do n't pay up . <p> Text messages these contain a number , and the victim is told to call back .

The malicious claims put forth by these various polls and surveys do not do Dover justice and serve to further damage our delicate reputation . <p> So here are eleven reasons I Live Here ( and other anonymous surveyors who have probably never been to Dover ) are wrong : <h> 1 . The White Cliffs <p> There is no doubt that the White Cliffs of Dover are one of this country 's most magnificent natural features .

It has hosted royal visits from Henry VIII , Elizabeth I and Charles I 's queen , Henrietta Maria . <p> From the 1740s onwards the medieval banks and ditches were reshaped and the castle was adapted for artillery warfare , before more additions were made to the castle 's defences in the 18 th century when England faced invasion from Napoleonic France . <p> To house the huge numbers of troops needed to man them , a network of tunnels was dug in from the cliff face for use as barracks . <p> The Napoleonic tunnels were then brought back into service in the Second World War , when they housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Visitors today can step inside the Great Tower and be transported to a world of courtly intrigue and royal ambition to meet the royal court of King Henry II <p> You can also explore the underground hospital , to see the living conditions in the tunnels and hear about the difficulties of treating injuries in close proximity to falling bombs . <p> Dover 's secret wartime tunnels also allow you to see , hear and feel the danger as the events and people from the Dunkirk evacuation are made real . <h> Eynsford Castle <p> Eynsford Castle is an example of an early Normal enclosure castle . <p> The castle has been largely abandoned since the 14th century after it became the subject of a disputed inheritance and was subjected to vandalism .

@@1934118 <p> We have all wandered back to our car to be greeted with a familiar , yet irritating , yellow sticker on the windscreen . <p> The dreaded parking ticket- with accompanying excessive fine- is one of the many ways drivers can be caught out in the UK , with confusing signs and malfunctioning technology catching out even the most diligent of motorists . <p> According to the UK Citizen 's Advice Bureau , it 's free to make an informal appeal by contacting whoever gave you the parking ticket . <p> They also advise that you can not be taken to court while you 're informally appealing , so your credit rating wo n't be affected . <p> So before you yank out your wallet from your well-pressed chinos or Louis Vuitton handbag to pay the piper , here are eight valid reasons that mean you can cancel your parking ticket . <h> 1 . You were parked correctly <p> You can appeal a ticket if you think you were parked correctly . For example , if a parking attendant thinks you stayed too long when you were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Penalty Charge Notice ( PCN ) or Excess Charge Notice ( ECN ) from the council issued on public land , such as a high street must be cancelled if you did n't break the parking rules . You can check these rules on GOV.UK or on signs near where you parked . <p> When you park on private land , such as a supermarket car park , the parking rules ( the terms and conditions of using the car park ) should be made clear on nearby signs . If you 're given a Parking Charge Notice and can prove you stuck to these rules , your ticket should be cancelled . This is because the parking company ca n't argue that you did n't stick to their terms and conditions . <p> When you appeal , you should explain that you did n't break any parking rules and send evidence to prove this . <h> 3 . There was no way to pay <p> Your ticket should be cancelled if a parking meter or machine was broken and there was no other way to pay . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have used . <p> You 'll need to send evidence that the machine or meter was broken to whoever gave you the ticket . <p> Some car parks and bays have a sign saying not to park there if there 's no way to pay . If where you parked had this sign , your appeal is likely to be rejected . You can usually get a discount for paying your ticket early , so you might want to do this instead of appealing . <h> 4 . You were charged too much <p> If you get a Penalty Charge Notice ( PCN ) , the amount you 're charged will fall into a higher or lower band . You 'll be charged the higher band for a more serious offence , like parking on a double yellow line . The lower band is for something less serious , like parking for longer than your ticket allows . <p> You should appeal if you 've been charged too much for a PCN . For example if your offence should be in the lower band but you 've been charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a council charges for each band on their website . <p> If you 've been given a Parking Charge Notice , the BPA and IPC rules state you should n't be charged more than -100 unless the parking company can prove your parking offence made them lose this much money . You should appeal if you 've been charged more than -100 and think this extra cost is unjustified . <h> 7 . Your car broke down <p> You 've a strong reason to appeal if you were given a ticket while waiting for your car to be fixed or towed away the ticket issuer should understand that you could n't move it . <h> 8 . You were only just out of time <p> It 's worth appealing if you were only 5 or 10 minutes late . <p> You should be given a few minutes after your parking runs out called a ' grace period ' . ATA members must give you an extra 10 minutes before giving you a Parking Charge Notice as should the council before giving you a Penalty Charge Notice . You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car park if you decide not to park . <p> A parking company might disagree with your appeal if they time your stay from the moment you entered the car park , rather than from when you parked .

And once they 're on the doorstep , they might just wander in. <h> 3 : Prune that bush <p> Any plants that are too close to your house will provide an appealing habitat for spiders .

It 's also messy . <h> 4 : Tidy up ! <p> Speaking of mess , make sure that the interior of your home is as unappealing as possible . For spiders that is . Clean homes are less hospitable for spiders because there are fewer places to hide out in . And do n't leave leftover food lying around . That will attract the pests that spiders feed on . <p> Regularly sweep and vacuum your floors . Wipe down tables and work surfaces , and avoid letting your dirty dishes sit out for more than a few hours . <p> Old newspapers and piles of laundry make the ideal hiding place for spider species that thrive in darkness .

If you 're afflicted by a major plague of spiders , consider hiring a professional exterminator. <h> 6 : Go traditional <p> Spiders are apparently rubbish at conkers , so leaving a few horse chestnuts scattered around might make them think twice a long stay . Smashed ones are twice as effective , apparently . <p> They do n't mush like the smell of peppermint or eucalyptus either , so spraying a dilute solution of peppermint oil near any possible entry points might help . <h> 7 : Just hit them with a newspaper <p> Your local paper 's best .

@@1934251 <p> Motorists are being hit with unnecessary fines after councils are failing to give the correct advice on how they can challenge their tickets . <p> A report by the Local Government Ombudsman has said councils need to do more to inform motorists of their rights when issuing traffic and parking penalties . <p> These are five examples of how councils are incorrectly fining drivers , including case studies from the Local Government Ombudsman report . <h> 1 . Failure to listen at the ' informal ' stage <p> If you are given a parking ticket you can make ' informal challenge ' which usually involves writing to the authority within a set time . The council must consider any of these challenges and give reasons if they turn down your request to cancel your ticket . Very often a council will turn down the explanation without giving any reasons . <p> Barbara 's Story ( from the Local Government Ombudsman report ) : Barbara was driving her elderly and infirm grandmother home and parked across the dropped kerb outside her house . <p> While she was making sure her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Barbara for parking on the pavement . Barbara believed she had parked legally and responsibly so she wrote to the council setting out all that happened . <p> While she fully expected the council to cancel the penalty charge , she enclosed a cheque for -55 because she would have to pay the full penalty of -110 after 14 days . <p> Although it was clear Barbara was challenging the PCN , the council 's response addressed none of the issues she had raised . It simply said she had accepted liability by paying and the matter was closed . <p> To comply with Government guidance - and good administrative practice - the council should have considered all that Barbara had said and decided whether it should cancel the penalty charge . <p> If it was not persuaded to do this , it should have explained its reasons to Barbara and given her an opportunity to make formal representations against the full penalty charge or agree to pay the discounted amount . <p> If necessary , Barbara could then have appealed to an adjudicator . By simply banking her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have her case heard at an independent appeal . <p> The Local Government Ombudsman raised concerns with the council about Barbara 's case and it agreed to refund the money she had paid . It also exercised its discretion to cancel the penalty charge and said it would take action to ensure the requirements of the guidance were met in future . <h> 2 . Failure to inform people of their rights <p> A local authority must always inform people of their rights at the informal stage . Too frequently local authorities are failing to do this . <p> Fran 's Story ( from the Local Government Ombudsman report ) : Fran had driven to a local shopping centre and parked in a place she was quite familiar with . <p> When she returned to her car , there was a sign saying the parking bay was suspended and a penalty charge notice had been placed on her car . <p> Fran firmly believed the bay was not suspended when she parked in it and she wrote to the council to challenge the penalty charge . <p> The council replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay where there were prominent signs showing the bay was suspended . <p> It said she could pay the discounted amount of -55 or wait to get a notice to owner when she could make formal representations against the full penalty charge of -110 . <p> The council made no mention of Fran 's right of appeal to an independent adjudicator . Fran wrote back to the council to say the photographs only showed the suspension signs were there after she parked , not when she did so . <p> However , she had little faith in the council reaching a different view , so she enclosed a cheque for -55 . The council accepted the payment and closed the case . Fran complained to the Ombudsman because she felt she had not been listened to . <p> The Ombudsman asked the council to refund the money Fran had paid and put her in a position where she could appeal . <p> The council agreed to our recommendation and it was then open to Fran to decide whether she wished to pursue her appeal to the independent adjudicator , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 3 . Unpaid penalty charges <p> A formal process must be followed if a local authority wants to collect an unpaid parking charge or a successful challenge . They can not simply ask bailiffs to collect the money from people . <p> Julie 's Story ( from the Local Government Ombudsman report ) : A debt for an unpaid parking penalty charge was registered with the Traffic Enforcement Centre ( TEC ) at Northampton County Court . <p> The TEC issued an order for recovery which allowed enforcement agents ( bailiffs ) to act on the council 's behalf . Julie paid the bailiffs the outstanding penalty charge and the bailiffs ' own fees . Julie made a witness statement to the TEC , saying she had been unaware of the original PCN and had not received a ' notice to owner ' . <p> The council contested this , but the TEC decided to accept it and ordered that the order for recovery be revoked . This took the matter back to the ' notice to owner ' stage . The TEC made it clear it had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refund the money , including the bailiffs ' fees she had paid on top of the penalty charge , and complained to the Local Government Ombudsman when it refused to do so . They decided that when the TEC revoked the order for recovery it withdrew the basis for the bailiffs ' fees . <p> Similarly , by taking the matter back to the ' notice to owner ' stage , the TEC decided that additional penalty charges should not be paid . <p> For these reasons , the Ombudsman has in this and similar cases taken the view that councils should refund everything except the original penalty charge . The council accepted the view and refunded a total of -382 , including bailiffs ' fees of -310. <h> 4 . Sending information to the wrong address <p> Too frequently councils continue to send documents to the wrong address , despite receiving credible information an address has been changed . <p> Callum 's Story ( from the Local Government Ombudsman report ) : The council fixed a PCN to an unlawfully parked car . It was not paid or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner . <p> The address provided by the DVLA was Callum 's but he was not the named owner . The council sent a notice to owner in the post . <p> After it received no response to this , the council obtained a warrant to recover the charge and passed it onto enforcement agents ( bailiffs ) who called at Callum 's home . Callum was not in , so the bailiffs left a letter . <p> Once he saw the letter , Callum contacted the council and explained that the person it was writing to was the previous owner of the property . Callum told the council that he had returned all of the previous owner 's post . <p> The council advised Callum to provide details to the bailiffs to show he had n't incurred the PCN . He wrote to them explaining the situation but they requested evidence he lived at the property . <p> After further correspondence the bailiffs returned the debt to the council to investigate further . Neither the council nor its bailiffs contacted Callum again . Following an Ombudsman investigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but even if had , it would not have caused it to change the address to which it corresponded . <p> This was to avoid a genuine registered keeper dishonestly returning documents . The Ombudsman decided , however , that the council should have done more to help Callum . <p> It should have been mindful that he may have been anxious about dealing with bailiffs , and it was not fair to expect him to do so once he had explained the wrong person was being pursued . The council agreed to our recommendation to review its policy on this point . <h> 5 . Can you talk to anyone ? <p> Wrongfully receiving a parking ticket can be annoying for a variety of reasons . However not being able to talk to anybody about your concerns is top of the list . <p> Dan and Kirsty 's story ( from the Local Government Ombudsman report ) : Dan and Kirsty received a penalty charge notice by post from the council for a moving traffic contravention . The notice contained a photograph of the car involved , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the notice itself . <p> The council had clearly sent the notice to the couple in error and they wrote to point this out . Although it was correctly addressed , Dan and Kirsty 's ' letter was returned marked ' addressee gone away ' . <p> The couple say Royal Mail told them that this was because the council had not paid for the PO Box . Despite several letters and phone calls , the couple could not resolve the matter and complained to us . <p> The council accepted it had been at fault and cancelled the penalty charge . It agreed to pay Dan and Kirsty -25 to recognise their time and trouble . It confirmed that the issues with the PO Box had been rectified . The error was readily apparent , and there seems no reason why a phone call or letter did not result in the immediate cancellation of the penalty charge notice .

Luckily I could use the top half of my body to keep myself up . My eyes and legs were still everywhere . The doctor told me he thought I 'd had a stroke and that he better call an ambulance . " <p> Since his ordeal , Mr Humphrey is still yet to fully recover and although he did n't fault the work of paramedics or William Harvey Hospital staff in Ashford , he remains upset with how his situation was handled in the lead up to receiving medical attention , describing it as a " real shame " . <p> The driver said : " I will never know if the delays I experienced have inhibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Luckily it was a minor stroke because if it was n't , their slow response and lack of reaction means I probably would have been dead inadequate is an understatement . <p> " I had no one else to call for me , I told them every symptom but they just neglected me and left me to suffer .

Generally these conditions are much more common in summer and so it is not unusual to have regular thunderstorms throughout the summer months . However they can also occur in winter as well . <p> " If the weather is cold the rain associated with a thunderstorm can then fall as snow and thus is called thundersnow . This is unusual only because it can only occur in a few months of the year . " <p> They added : " Interestingly , the snow contained within the thunderstorm acts to dampen the sound of the thunder . While the thunder from a typical thunderstorm might be heard many miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard if you are within two to three miles of the lightning . <p> " When thundersnow occurs at night the lightning seems brighter - this is because the lightning reflects off the snowflakes .

" <h> 5 comments <p> Cheggers TDC are under a statutory duty to inform the public about environmental hazards to health . They have not done so . They have not even told Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group on which ex TDC leader Clive Hart sits . So I feel sure the first RO solicitors learned about the precautionary principle situation , I set out below , was when I told National Planning and emailed RO solicitors . I think RO has cause of action to sue TDC . A weakness for RO in such an action is that their man Roger Gale addressed Commons in Jan 2000 about Foreland Outfall and chose to conceal the remediation project at Sericol and thus concealed 30 years of contamination of Thanet water supply . One of two situations must apply . Either , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Gale has told them and RO have been trying to simplify their application by condoning TDC breach of statutory duties . The fact remains that the expert authority in 2009 stated that public health epidemiology inquiry is required . The situation with some UKIP cllrs is that they snuggled up to SMA and RO then got into office and the TDC history of failure to obey public health and environmental health laws became known to them . The ward where public health inquiry should start is Northwood which still has two sites direct abstracting water for laundry and agricultural use . The Environment Agency position re Sericol is that the ground water contamination will remain a problem for the foreseeable future . The chemical concerned has been identified in medical research as causing illness including cardiovascular when it leaches in tiny amounts from plastic tubing in medical equipment . There appears to be research showing that it increases toxicity of pesticides . Thanet has been ill served by a popular but deeply irresponsible blogger who shunned the expert authority position and substituted his own . For example the claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhale . He also issued assurances , about WMD chemicals maker Thor , for which he has absolutely no evidence . As I stated it will be up to National Planning . Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group is to be included in RO impact study . National Planning are mindful of this as I provided a copy of the Environmental Agency response to FOI re Sericol . They have advised me to keep RO solicitors informed and to register as an interested person when and if RO make a formal application . Then it will be a matter of judgment by the authority . If they feel precautionary principle to compress medical public health uncertainty to an available minimum then that might prove fatal to RO cause . If the authority decide not to apply precautionary principle so be it . This is why we have a rule of law , <p> Has anybody noticed the trend here ? Politicians who are not in office snuggle up to SMA and RiverOak and promise to reopen the airport if elected . Politicians who have been elected fall out with SMA and RiverOak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport . The bit I ca n't work out is why the local media keep bothering to report it , when some jumped up wannabe politician with no hope of ever being elected tries to make political capital out of the issue . <p> jmturner you miss the point . For argument sake let us say that Thanet i 'll health pattern is related to past contamination of ground and of water supply for 30 years . The issue for a planning inspectorate applications is " Precautionary principle " . How would airport pollution effect people who are already i 'll at national high rates ? As I understand it the application of precautionary principle is mandatory . TDC has been in breach of statutory duties , arising from Aarhus Convention , since 2003 . For example even Thanet Clinical Commissioning Group ( now to be included in scoping for the RO application BTW ) was never told about Sericol massive contamination of water supply nor about Thor ground contamination including mercury . If you check Hansard for Jan 2000 you will see that Roger Gale misled the Commons by concealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public health stated that epidemiology inquiry is required to assess the adverse health consequence including in longer term of the 30 years of contaminated water supply . Riveroak may feel they have a cause of action against TDC who have been in continuous breach of statutory duties in public and environmental health . It will be up to National Planning Inspectorate whether to impose precautionary principle inbestigation . And whether to reject RO " Consultation " because due to TDC breach of Aarhus duties the public are under informed to participate in consultation .

@@1934348 <p> Christmas dinner is the biggest meal of the year and definitely the one you do n't want to mess up . <p> So if you 're a cooking novice , here are some things you should NEVER do to make sure your day goes smoothly : <h> 1 . Forgetting to serve anything else to eat <p> Roast turkey with all the trimmings is the centrepiece of Christmas Day but if you 're hosting celebrations , do n't neglect your guests before lunch . <p> A special breakfast will get things off to a great start and does n't have to be difficult . Scrambled eggs and smoked salmon is a luxurious option that 's easy to prepare , for example and Tesco have used this recipe . <p> Look out for festive-themed prepared items in the supermarket , such as tree-shaped crumpets or cranberry-filled muffins . <p> You could also get creative by decorating ready-made pancakes with icing sugar and chocolate chips so they look like snowmen or serving toast cut into stars and smothered with honey or golden marmalade . <p> As if it was n't enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send , presents to buy and gifts to wrap , these pampered cooks expect us to produce something extraordinary for the dinner table too . <p> Of course , there 's nothing wrong with spending hours slaving over a recipe that demands every ingredient from allspice to lemon zest if that 's what you really want but there 's no need to feel under any pressure to do so . <p> There 's no shame either in using a few shortcuts , so buy ready-made gravy , veg that 's been peeled and chopped and potatoes that are ready to roast and look forward to a relaxing day . <h> 3 . Leaving it too late ! <p> No matter how last minute you leave your present buying , when it comes to cooking Christmas dinner , you really do have to plan ahead . <p> A roast dinner takes time to prepare so unless you get organised , you could find yourself serving turkey at midnight . <p> The good news is that many of the traditional trimmings will look after themselves once in the oven , all you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in time and get the food in there so it 's ready before everyone is so full on tins of sweets that they do n't want to eat your efforts . <h> 4 . Trying to do it all yourself <p> When one of your guests says " Do you ned me to do anything ? " , for goodness sake , say , " yes ! " . <p> Do n't be afraid to get them doing the boring jobs , like emptying the bin , scoring the sprouts or wrapping bacon around the chipolatas . <p> Pour them a glass of champagne as their reward and enjoy having a companion in the kitchen , it 's no fun being up to your elbows in washing up while everyone else has fun . <p> Ask you guests to assist in advance too , give them something to bring to make your preparations easier , such as cheese and crackers , a dessert or the starter . Marks and Spencer has a brilliant cake range for 2015 , include a Chocolate Candle Wreath featuring a real tea light to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> 8 . Getting stressed out <p> The perfect Christmas is all about the company , not the cooking , something you should hold on to when the sprouts have turned to mush or the Yule log dessert rolls right off the table and on to the floor . <p> There 's no point in having tears over a dry turkey because , apart from anything , it 's unlikely that anyone will notice . <p> As long as everyone is warm , comfortable , fed and watered , they will be happy . <p> Throw a tantrum on the other hand and everyone will be talking about how you stuffed it up for years to come . <h> 9 . Buying a turkey that 's too big for the oven <p> You may be supersizing your weekly food shop in order to cater for the masses this Christmas but your oven is n't going to be any bigger than it was last week . <p> Think about the space you have available before you buy your meat there 's no point getting a huge carcass that 's so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the other food that you want to cook a dessert that needs six hours in the oven is n't practical if you have to cook turkey and all the trimmings in one appliance . <p> This great survey by Which ? reckoned 11 million people in the UK have struggle to get their turkey in the oven on Christmas day and its reviews include tests on whether they are big enough to fit in a turkey ( with room to spare ) , worth checking if you are in any doubt . <h> 15 . Forgetting the drinks <p> Give yourself a break and get guests to help themselves to a tipple if you are the one sorting the Christmas dinner . <p> They will not only feel relaxed and welcome but you wo n't be constantly interrupted by requests for a glass of sherry , a cup of tea or a cold beer . <p> Set up a temporary bar if you have room , where guests can find a bottle opener , a selection of drinks and glasses and perhaps a few nibbles such as crisps and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make even a small shelf or table look good for this purpose . <h> 16 . Sticking to tradition <p> Turkey remains the number one choice at the Christmas dinner table but if you do n't like it , start a new tradition in your house . <p> Choose whatever meat is your favourite , and the easiest you find to cook , such as goose , duck , beef , pork or chicken . <p> You could even have salmon or forget about having a main meal at all , instead providing a sumptuous buffet that you can replenish throughout the day and allow guests to graze as they please . <p> Or why not have a barbecue ? Do n't laugh - Weber has a recipe for barbecued turkey ! <p> Remember , it 's a day to celebrate so anything goes . <h> 17 .

Last year it rose to an admirable 3rd place . <p> But this year it has been beaten by other boroughs including Winchester , <p> Horsham , Mid Sussex and Chiltern . <p> But there are three pieces of good news in the results Tunbridge Wells remains in the top 50 districts to live in the country , the borough outranked Sevenoaks by 18 places and it also beat its rival Harrogate , with which it ended up in a row earlier this year over which was the most attractive town . <p> Tunbridge Wells Borough Council leader David Jukes said : ' While we have n't looked in detail at which of the factors has influenced the results for this year 's survey we are pleased to note that Tunbridge Wells is still in the top 30 best places to live .

@@1934386 <p> Even if you work hard and pass the 11-plus , it 's no guarantee of a grammar school place . His birthday fell on National Offer Day , March 1 . <p> This week again , many kids will have learnt there was no room at the grammar schools in Tunbridge Wells for them , and they 've been allocated an empty place elsewhere , inevitably at a less popular school . <p> Parents feel helpless , but you are entitled to appeal , and if you win the school is forced to take your child . <p> Last year 287 children gained a grammar school place through appeals to Kent County Council , with 36 per cent of all hearings being upheld , according to independent consultant Peter Read . <p> Some grammars hold their own hearings so actual figures will be higher . After a fight , my son is now a happy pupil at a Tunbridge Wells grammar . <p> You can appeal to all four schools which you selected . Get the forms in quickly - the deadline is March 19 - to register your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June , so you will have a couple of months to prepare your case . <p> Get on the schools ' waiting lists before March 19 , and it could save you going to appeal . Places come up when people decide on a different school , or win appeals elsewhere . <p> One Horsmonden boy joined his chosen grammar 's waiting list on March 17 last year and got a place in mid-June , the day before his appeal hearing . <p> Even if you think your child will only go to the unwanted school over your dead body , you must accept this place , otherwise your child could be left without a school at all . And an appeal panel will not look kindly on you flouncing in and saying : " There 's no way my child is going to that school . " <p> Visit the offered school and meet the head teacher . Use it as a research trip to identify what it ca n't offer which your preferred school can . <p> Does your child have special needs or health issues which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gifted at a sport for which it has no facilities ? Is the peer group at a similar academic level ? <p> And it might not prove to be as bad as you had feared . <p> One Paddock Wood mother took a different view after visiting a school which had a poor reputation , but had recently appointed a new head teacher and was receiving a lot of attention and investment . <p> She thought her son could well benefit from the status he would have as a star pupil in a school which was under a lot of pressure to improve . <p> Provided you are still keen to appeal , next start collecting letters . Most important is the one from your primary school 's head saying he or she thinks the child is best suited to a grammar . Get one from his form teacher highlighting any academic and personality strengths . <p> If you 've got any medical reasons , get a doctor 's letter . <p> Think of anything that makes your case different . You have to prove that yours is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want based on family heritage , religion , difficult family circumstances , transport routes ? <p> The appeal panel must decide whether the harm done to your child who was n't given a place will outweigh the harm caused to the school and its other pupils if it goes over numbers . <p> You need to convince them why your child would suffer if denied a place . <p> Schools must give you reasons for refusing to admit an extra child . <p> These will be along the lines of lack of classroom space , insufficient sports facilities , risk of injury in overcrowded corridors and so on . <p> Some will be plain silly one school said it had to keep an empty desk in each classroom " for an observer " . <p> These claims are often presented as complicated architectural equations for bodies per square metre . <p> Do n't get too bogged down in the detail , but do research them . <p> One school we were appealing to quoted their lack of sports facilities for extra children yet they were boasting on their website how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Another school argued that an extra pupil 's bag on the floor could cause tripping accidents . The father involved pointed out that a single badly-placed bag could cause a tripping accident regardless of the number of pupils in a classroom . <p> A parent from Pembury countered a school 's argument about the threat to its sports provision through overcrowding by highlighting the school 's stunning fixture results in the previous year - when it had taken extra pupils . <p> Quotes from Ofsted reports about thriving pupils , and details of record exam results , can be matched to a year where the school was forced to take extra pupils to show existing pupils need not suffer . <p> Have counter-arguments up your sleeve , but resist the temptation to take their case apart like a barrister at your hearing . Remember that the panel are often hearing 60 to 70 appeals for each school , and if the opposition has a flawed argument they will have heard it many times over . <p> You should put most of your emphasis on your own case . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare a concise summary . <p> Expert Mr Read says one of the biggest pitfalls is " boring them with irrelevant detail " . <p> Practice this so you can deliver the speech and contain the emotion , because on the day it will feel like the most important thing you have ever done for your child . <p> You will be questioned afterwards , so make sure you can back up everything you 've said . <h> Comments <p> And , sometimes you ca n't win an appeal at any school because your child is normal , does n't have any of the above and played the game fairly . We looked at all the schools . We made our choices . We got a school we had n't even chosen . We appealed , we lost them all because I refused point blank to play the system .
