Vass , a Senior Staff Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Tennessee in Forensic Anthropology , human decomposition begins around four minutes after a person dies and follows four stages : autolysis , bloat , active decay , and skeletonization . <p> Stage One : Autolysis <p> The first stage of human decomposition is called autolysis , or self-digestion , and begins immediately after death .

The sulfur-containing compounds that the bacteria release also cause skin discoloration . Due to the gases , the human body can double in size . In addition , insect activity can be present . <p> The microorganisms and bacteria produce extremely unpleasant odors called putrefaction . These odors often alert others that a person has died , and can linger long after a body has been removed . <p> Stage Three : Active Decay <p> Fluids released through orifices indicate the beginning of active decay . Organs , muscles , and skin become liquefied . When all of the bodys soft tissue decomposes , hair , bones , cartilage , and other byproducts of decay remain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stage Four : Skeletonization <h> Body Decomposition Timeline <p> 8-10 days after death the body turns from green to red as the blood decomposes and the organs in the abdomen accumulate gas . <p> Several weeks after death nails and teeth fall out . <p> 1 month after death the body starts to liquify . <h> How Can the Stages of Human Decomposition Affect the Site of an Unattended or Traumatic Death ? <p> An unattended death , and the accompanyingbacteria , mold , and insect infestation , can cause damage to a buildings structure and personal belongings .

@@77036647 @5736647/ <h> What Are the Biohazard Safety Levels ? <p> Biohazards are chemical or biological substances that are dangerous to the environment , humans or animals . These substances are categorized into four different biohazard safety levels ( BSL ) ranging from BSL-1 to BSL-4 . <p> Each biosafety level uses distinct control procedures for microbial and biological agent containment . Developed for use in enclosed laboratory facilities , biohazard safety levels help reduce lab technicians and researchers risk of exposure to potentially infectious material ( PIM ) . It is important to note , however , that lab technicians are not the only individuals who are at risk of potential biohazard exposure . Crime scene investigators and other members of law enforcement , healthcare professionals , and bioremediation specialists should also be cautious when handling blood and PIMs . <h> What Determines an Agents Biosafety Level ? <p> According to the Center for Disease Control ( CDC ) , " The primary risks that determine levels of containment are infectivity , severity of disease , transmissibility , and the nature of the work conducted .

Ordinarily , cases of HBV require the virus to enter the body through a puncture , wound , or mucosal membrane . Common methods of infection include unprotected sexual activity , sharing of needles , syringes , or drug-preparation equipment , direct contact with infected blood or body fluids , accidental needle stick or sharing items like razors or toothbrushes . <p> Infants can also receive the virus from their mother . The World Health Organization states that " adults infected with HBV usually acquire acute hepatitis B and recover , but 5 to 10% develop the chronic carrier state . " Contrarily , 25 to 90% of infected children become chronic carriers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liver or liver related cancer as adults . <p> Unusual Cases <p> One of the scariest and yet little known facts about HBV is that it can survive outside the body for up to 7 days , meaning that areas effected by blood or other biological fluids carry the potential risk of transmitting the virus . There are numerous well-documented cases that illustrate the need to treat all blood and body fluids with extreme caution : <p> According to one example , an Israeli butcher with chronic HBV transmitted the virus to three of his co-workers , who later infected their spouses . The mode of transmission was speculated to be shared butcher knives : when the infected worker cut himself , his contaminated blood or knife may have come into contact with other employees through breaks or cuts in their own skin . <p> In another case , a pregnant school teacher contracted HBV when an infected student sneezed , and saliva and nasal secretions came into contact with her chapped , cracked hands . Three weeks later , her child was born with the virus , prompting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HBV infection concern medical equipment and facilities , shared supplies and other forms of indirect contact with the virulent pathogen . <p> *** <p> Hepatitis B is just one of many contagious bloodborne illnesses that Aftermath Services can help protect you against .

Last year , several major ice cream makers were impacted by the same dangerous bacteria , right at the height of the summer season . ( For a full list of recalled products , visit the FDA website ) . So what is it about Listeria that makes it so easy to catch , and what steps can you take to prevent it in your home or place of business . <p> What is Listeria ? <p> Listeriosis is caused by a bacterium called Listeria monocytogenes .

Throw away any materials used during cleaning as medical waste in proper manner in accordance with the law . <h> 3 Misconceptions About Cleaning Blood <p> There is a lot of confusion around blood stains and how to safely remove them . Below are some common misconceptions surrounding the issue , followed by solutions for thorough cleanup . <p> 1 . If I can no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . <p> Why this assumption is wrong : Blood has the ability to seep deep into surfaces , and can be impossible to get out of porous materials such as fabric , carpet , concrete , and hardwood . This means that although a piece of fabric or carpeting may look clean after a few minutes of scrubbing , only the surface of the material is actually clean . As a result , the material can continue to harbor bacteria . <p> The solution : As hard as this may be to face , the only way to completely rid porous material of blood is to throw away or replace the affected object . <p> 2 . It is safe to clean up a bloodspill that belongs to a family member or someone I know . <p> Why this assumption is wrong : Blood has the potential to carry infectious diseases , and not everyone who has been infected realizes it .

After the body is removed by authorities , families may be at a loss figuring out what to do next . Many do not know where to turn and choose to handle cleaning on their own , believing that there is no other option . Others look to funeral directors , the police , or their insurance adjuster for advice . However , even most professionals are not aware of the existence of biohazard cleanup specialists .

@@77036761 @5736761/ <h> Death Cleanup : Just One Part of the Process <p> The process of death concerns both physical and spiritual aspects . As morbid as it seems , death is a natural part of the life cycle . As a result , every culture and civilization maintains beliefs on what should be done with physical remains upon a persons demise . <p> Such beliefs range from practical matters ( such as proper disposal of the remains ) , as well as more metaphysical concerns relating to a persons soul or inner being . While the details can vary greatly , humanity as a whole remains connected to the end-of-life process , regarding this inevitability with a mixture of fear and awe . <p> The Physical Aspects of Death <p> Regardless of any spiritual implications , death cleanup presents a very serious health issue . Distinct physical changes begin as soon as ones heart stops beating , and can impact the area where the death occurred , if they are allowed to continue unimpeded . This is one of several reasons why professional assistance in cases of unattended death cleanup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety of any who may enter the area afterward . <p> One of the first changes to occur after death is that the body 's temperature decreases the moment of death , and continues to fall until the deceased reaches room temperature . This is known as algor mortis , or the cooling of the body . Rigor mortis also takes place during this time , which occurs when blood pools at various points within the body . This process typically spans two to six hours after death . <p> While the body in question may no longer be among the living , that does n't  mean it is entirely devoid of life . Bacteria thrives throughout the decomposition process , causing additional and often pronounced physical changes . These changes happen over a period of days , and include discoloration , as well as the emission of a foul-smelling gas as internal organs begin to break down . As weeks and months progress , additional decomposition takes place . Fortunately , very few in the modern world are privy to this stage of death , thanks to strict laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spiritual Realm <p> Every culture that has ever existed developed exacting rules on how to handle the dead . Some choose to leave the deceased in the open to let nature take its course , while others rely on receptacles such as urns and coffins to afford the dead a seemingly more dignified send off . <p> Religion also plays a role in how the physical remains are dealt with . For instance , Hindus look to cremation as a means of releasing the soul from ones mortal remains , while Catholics regard the practice as disrespectful . There are also rules relating to the time in which the deceased is finally interred , with each religion possessing unique beliefs on the appropriate course of action . <p> Assistance When You Need It Most <p> Dealing with death can be a traumatic experience , but there is after death care available for a variety of situations .

My sister and I arrived in Massachusetts from out of state to the home of our elderly aunt who lived alone . The situation was nightmarish and within 24 hours of us reaching our dear aunt , she passed . Her home was contaminated with body fluids and we were suddenly facing the unexpected loss of our aunt as well as the huge question of what to do with the aftermath . A friend in Florida referred me to Aftermath . I remember thinking the company name was perfect and I was grateful that there was such a company out there . <p> From the moment I called , I felt like we were in the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more manageable . We met with Bill Ciaccio and his team the following day . I find it difficult not to just use a string of superlatives to describe the job that Bill did . The excellent job they did with the house was the smallest part of this process . Bill made the worst case scenario somehow something that we could make our way through . He dealt with us with compassion , understanding , gentle humor when appropriate , a seamless delivery of services and brought a calm to an unthinkable situation . <p> Thank you , Aftermath , for providing this needed service and for employing Bill Ciaccio . He made all of the difference . Thank you , Bill . You will always be in our hearts for your warmth , competence and just flat out awesomeness at a really difficult time in our lives . <p> - Leslie J. <p> I could write a novel about the level of work ethic and compassion that I experienced in my dealings with Darren , Alan , and Andrew .

This individual experience can be further complicated by the deceaseds online presence on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter , which can live on in perpetuity after their death . <p> Grieving online may be a new occurrence , but culturally speaking , after-death rituals are nothing new . While some may find modern coping methods in poor taste or even unsettling , they often share much in common with historical expressions of grief . For example , so-called funeral selfies are one recent trend that many find distasteful , yet there is actually a rich history of post-mortem photography , either for remembrances sake or out of necessity . <p> Memorial- Pages <p> When it comes to the official policies on social media sites like Facebook , memorial statuses are the preferred method of online grieving . These statuses offer a respectful reminder of the deceased , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . Though this can be helpful for some users , there are a few changes that take place once a memorial page is established . <p> First , the family must initiate the process of memorializing or preserving the page . If the family does not have access to the deceased persons account , this can require submitting proof to the website to establish control of the user page . Once the website agrees to memorialize the page , the profile will lose a number of capabilities . Profiles will no longer be visible in public searches , and friends will be unable to tag the deceased with fond memories for their families to enjoy . It may also be impossible to add - new friends to the page after it changes . In some instances , Facebook may delete memorial pages if they are found to be inappropriate . <p> Original Profileor No Profile <p> Because of these restrictions , some choose to let their loved ones original profile remain unaltered after death . Many see it as a reminder of those whove passed in their lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the deceased . This can be incredibly cathartic for anyone still grieving , as it affords an outlet for emotions , especially during difficult times such as the holidays . Users who prefer this method sometimes say that it feels as if the person is still in some ways an active part of their life . <p> - In the end , handling the online presence of a deceased loved one is ultimately up to the family and those closest to the person , though in some cases the deceased may still have some say . As people become increasingly savvy with social media , more and more people are including how to handle this situation as part of their will . For those who are looking to plan ahead , the Digital Death Guide can take some of the mystery out of creating and managing a digital legacy . <p> In the end , there is not a one-size-fits-all answer to digital immortality , as the grieving experience differs greatly from person to person . However , one thing remains certain : technology will continue to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . <p> Practical Matters Regarding After Death Care <p> While the subject of death is often a philosophical subject , practical matters are equally important to remember .

Leon M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wanda Rojas and her extraordinary team of dedicated , focused , calm and endearing individuals ? I arrived on scene to discover my father experienced an unattended death in his apartment . About 12 days had passed before the police and apartment personnel discovered his remains on Sept. 9 . The crew was on site on Sept 10 for the initial emergency cleanup but could not proceed further without a family member present . I flew down to the area on Tuesday , Sept 11 and meet the team on Wednesday , Sept 12 to begin their major cleanup . When I shook Wandas hand for the first time , I noticed her intense caring eyes and the reassurance in her voice . Immediately many burdens were lifted from my shoulders as they took control , with my permission , to contact local charities for the donation of salvageable worldly goods and the disposal of various possessions that were too far gone to be acceptable for donations . To tackle such difficult circumstances day after day is something beyond me . God bless those individuals who put the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job was finished completely and far beyond any of my expectations .

He dealt with us with compassion , understanding , gentle humor when appropriate , a seamless delivery of services and brought a calm to an unthinkable situation .

Argean H , North Little Rock , AR <h> Proven Community Partnerships <p> I cant thank you enough for what you company does and how it does it . Unfortunately , I have used your services three times recently ; once for a suicide by shotgun and twice for long term unattended deaths . Both times your company responded within hours and when they were finished the scene was spotless , odorless and free from any biohazard . And it was done in a very professional and courteous manner . The families were so grateful and all three times insurance paid the claims with nothing out-of-pocket for the families we served . I remember when it was the duty of the funeral director to clean after a tragedy or unattended death ; I am so thankful for your business . Feel free to use me as a reference for any funeral home in doubt. J. Paul , Funeral Home Director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , no one was sure who to contact to resolve our remediation issues . Our local coroner told us to try Aftermath . Luckily Aftermath who was in a nearby town promptly came to assess the situation . From beginning to end the company kept us informed and up to date about what they were doing . Each one of the crew members were kind , courteous , and extremely professional . A special thanks to John and Kyle for their extra efforts . Hopefully our community will not have to go through another situation like this , but if so Aftermath is the only company to call. Jason O. , Kansas <p> I found myself in a very difficult situation with very little help from anyone . Fortunately my lawyer connected me to a company that could assist me .

We pride ourselves on being a resource for those we work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or agencies , or offering a referral when the work needed goes beyond the scope of what we do . <p> While there are hundreds of books and websites out there offering tips and pointers about how to deal with grief and loss , these are a few that we 've found to be invaluable . We hope you will find them as useful as we have . <p> 1 . Get back to basics . <p> Or stick to them . Eat well , and do n't  skip the gym . Even if you do n't  feel like it , you need energy . Also , keeping to a schedule helps others around you focus as well . Its easy to put your health and well-being on the backburner as you help others cope , but taking time to ensure your needs are met keeps you strong for them , too . <p> 2 . Mourn with others . <p> This suggestion is n't for everyone , as people handle grief differently , and some are private about their experiences . However , it can beneficial to speak about what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking yourself . If you are not comfortable sharing , hearing others talk about their experiences can help you gather your thoughts and put them into perspective . Grief counselors and support groups are traditional ways to approach the conversation , but speaking to others who knew your family member or friend can provide additional relief that these settings can not . Set aside time to spend with others who knew the person . Being comfortable sharing personal details and reminiscing about your loved one are part of the healing process . <p> If you prefer a less formal setting and are open to trying something new or different , Dinner Parties and Death Cafes are two modern options that have grown in popularity , particularly in larger cities . Dinner Parties are as they sound a group of people get together for dinner , with the commonality being loss , whether it be the death of a parent , partner , or another life hurdle . On the other hand , Death Cafes are open to everyone . By learning to talk openly about death and dying , organizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general . <p> 3 . Honor their memory . <p> There are many ways to pay tribute to a loved one . Hosting a gathering , paying tribute at a yearly family function all of these are ways to remember your friend or relative as theyd wish to be remembered . If you 're not into larger group activities , or you 're not sure how others will feel about them given the circumstances , consider doing something on your own in tribute to the person . Races and marathons , or charitable donations to a favorite cause are a few of the best ways to honor your loved one while giving back to the community at the same time . <p> If you 're religious ( or your loved one was ) , lighting a candle and saying a prayer , or requesting a prayer be said by a local priest or pastor can help put your mind at ease . You may also consider an online memorial website , so that distant friends and relatives can take part and share their own thoughts and memories , too . <p> 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if they 're not present in body , they 're with you in spirit . Some find it useful to write letters to the departed , while others document their grief in a journal or personal diary . If you 're not comfortable expressing your feelings to another person , writing is a way to convey your thoughts about the loss without fear of judgement . Other suggestions include writing stories suffused with details about your loved one , whether its the smell of their perfume , their favorite song , or tales of the activities they used to like to do . However you chose to put pen to paper ( or fingers to your keyboard ) , <p> 5 . Let others carry the burden for awhile . <p> You know all those offers people make when you are grieving ? Accept them ! Fill your fridge with casseroles and let the neighbor or a friend watch your children one night . Use the time you save to catch up on chores , or simply take a moment to cry , to let loose and actually grieve . Its okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , should being on your to-do list . <p> Also : Having a professional biohazard company like Aftermath clean your home is a practical way to help put your mind at ease following the death of a loved one .

Children are especially vulnerable when suicide occurs . Death may already be confusing , and adults often do not know how to discuss the topic with young family members . Having an open and honest conversation can help children process the event . It is important to provide children with the proper support after suicide . <h> Reassurance <p> According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention ( AFSP ) , children may feel responsible for the death . It is important for adults to reassure a child that he or she did not do or say anything that would have caused a loved one to take his or her life . People of all ages who experience grief after suicide usually move through a range of emotions , such as : <p> Loneliness <p> Feeling responsible <p> Shock <p> Being ashamed <p> Feeling relief <p> A child may be confused as to why he or she is feeling this way .

Caregivers should be prepared to answer questions multiple times a day , especially right after the event . Children younger than three typically can not understand death . Those conversations may be restricted to simply stating that the loved one is gone , and the adult feels sad . Older children may be able to have a more in-depth conversation regarding what happened . The AFSP notes that children should guide the conversation and adults should respond with simple but honest language . <h> Explaining the Death <p> Some people may fear that speaking with children about suicide will invite copycat behavior .

Humans are one of the only species that will kill their own kind for reasons other than self-preservation . People commit murder to survive less often than people commit murder for other reasons . High profile mass murder and serial killer cases are far from the norm . <p> Aside from highly unusual situations , there are almost always warning signs before homicides occur . Presented below are just some of- the factors commonly associated with homicide : <p> Drug and Alcohol Involvement <p> One of the most prevalent high risk behaviors associated with violence in the United States is presence of drug and alcohol related activity . According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence , over 40 percent of violent crimes committed today involve alcohol alone . <p> Additionally , substance abuse and alcohol are commonly associated with gang culture . Social influence can prompt violent crime and murder . Ultra-machismo and a glorified view of homicide can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as petty theft . Drug use often results in paranoia , increased levels of impulsivity , and poor judgment . Monetary transactions suspected to have gone bad can also fuel murder . The best warning sign of trouble is the situation . Simply stay away from illicit drug trade and others involved in drug and alcohol abuse . <p> Domestic Violence <p> Domestic violence does not always lead to murder . However , there exists a definitive pattern . According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation , about one out of every four murder victims was killed by a family member . Warning signs that apply to almost all domestic violence cases include when your partner insists on controlling everything , your partner yells at you , your partner calls you names , your partner destroys your belongings , your partner physically hurts you , and your partner threatens to hurt you or your loved ones . Additionally , polishing firearms , talking about murder cleanup , and threatening to commit suicide if you leave are all warning signs that you should leave . <p> Often , outbursts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by victims such as choosing to attend night classes or seeing a new circle of friends might seem harmless , but they can prompt an abusive spouse to snap . It is also important to note that one of the most controlling behaviors by an abusive spouse is seeing whether or not you will take your spouse back after wrongdoing . <p> Stay Safe by Leaving a Dangerous Situation <p> Simply leaving a group of friends or an abusive relationship is easier said than done . Develop a plan , and get out quickly . <p> However , even avoiding these risks does not eliminate the possibility of tragedy . The crime scene cleanup professionals at Aftermath understand that no one plans for a traumatic incident to occur . If the worst does happen , there are many options which may help reduce the impact of the event . Hiring a trauma cleaning company to handle the cleanup is one way to manage the aftereffects .

While this practice is rather uncommon , it can be a crucial undertaking in cases of criminal investigations , as well as situations where family members wish for an alternate resting place for the deceased . <p> Understanding the Exhumation Process <p> During exhumation , officials are typically present to ensure the work is performed according to state and local regulations . A funeral director may be in attendance , as well as members of the local police force . The family of the deceased is discouraged from attending , as the process can be extremely difficult for loved ones to witness . <p> Excavation often involves both mechanical machinery as well as manpower . Further , most exhumations take place during summer months , as the process can prove difficult in lower temperatures due to hardening or freezing of the soil . Before the casket is unearthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other structures existing above the burial ground . Great pains are taken to keep coffins intact while they are lifted , which can be difficult when the deceased has been interred for lengthy period of time . Once the casket is removed , the remains are then transferred to a laboratory or alternate vessel . <p> Common Reasons for Exhumation <p> There are a number of reasons why one would elect to have a loved one exhumed after burial . Criminal investigations are a common factor , as additional forensic analysis may be necessary if new information comes to light . DNA testing may be another factor ; this kind of test may be used to establish or confirm the identity of the deceased or in special cases , determine parental or genealogical relationships . <p> Other reasons usually involve family members who wish the grave of the deceased to be relocated . War veterans are sometimes exhumed to be interred in an official burial ground , such as cemeteries dedicated to honoring service men and women . One enterprising blogger has created a very reader-friendly walk-through of the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Cost and transportation are just two of the matters that a family must consider before pursuing this course of action . <p> Professional Cleaning When You Need It Most <p> While in most cases burial marks the end of a life , it is often just the start of the grieving process .
