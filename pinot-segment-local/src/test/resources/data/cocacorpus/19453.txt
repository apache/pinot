With a maximum power output of 731 hp at 8250 rpm , it also generates maximum torque of 508 lb-ft , yet 80 percent of that torque is available at a mere 2500 rpm . Outstanding response and strong acceleration rushes through anywhere and everywhere . Moreover , the V12 's high specific power output of 116 hp per liter is a record for an engine of this type . Impressive by any standards , these stats make Ferrari 's F12berlinetta the benchmark . <h> Dimensions and weight distribution <p> Shorter , lower and narrower than its predecessor , the 599 GTB Fiorano , the new F12berlinetta is more than a design success , it 's a performance virtuoso and that is no accident .

The engine is lower in the chassis , netting a lower center of gravity . A new rear suspension / gearbox unit enables a smaller rear end . Weight distribution is therefore optimized for a slight rear weight bias , at 46 percent front / 54 percent rear . <p> The F12berlinetta also uses innovative materials and technologies new to the automotive industry . A spaceframe chassis and bodyshell employs more than twelve alloys to shave off 154 pounds when compared to the 599 GTB Fiorano . <h> Ferraris sports car ethos takes on a- new form <h> A modern take on classic design with new aerodynamic solutions <p> Sensuous design and aerodynamics - two automotive goals often at odds - are 100 percent synchronized in F12berlinetta . Pininfarina and the Ferrari Style Center exceed expectations with brilliant style and balanced proportions . Though it is largely original in looks , many signature elements from the grand Ferrari V12 history remain . Despite compact exterior dimensions , the F12berlinetta offers superb cabin space and comfort . Designers also left room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the hood and front fenders meet to create downforce . In a similar vein , Active Brake Cooling opens air ducts only when the brakes reach a threshold temperature . The result is extreme aero efficiency , a fact borne out by the F12berlinetta 's drag coefficient of just 0.299 , while also generating 271 pounds of downforce at 125 mph . <h> T-shape : F1-inspired <p> The F12berlinetta employs a modern , functional reinterpretation of the Kamm tail , which seamlessly integrates the two vertical fences of the rear diffuser . The resulting original T-shape also incorporates two full-LED circular tail-lights and the F1-inspired rear fog light . <p> The F12berlinetta has the very latest carbon ceramic braking system ( CCM3 ) , a new " Evolution " magnetorheological suspension ( SCM-E ) and advanced vehicle dynamics systems ( E-diff , ESC , F1-Trac and high-performance ABS ) .

The tunnel console is both light and functional while the central bridge - a signature interior element - incorporates Ferrari 's famed F1 gearbox , warning lights and switchgear . <h> F12berlinetta CABIN <p> Designers intently focused on making the F12berlinetta 's seats as trim as possible to increase freedom of movement within the cabin while attaining even greater comfort during steady-state driving . Simultaneously , they restrain lateral movement due to cornering forces during aggressive driving . <p> Headrests are fully integrated into the backrests , giving the seats a very modern , track-inspired look . <p> An upholstered bench in the rear offers leather luggage straps to hold bags securely in place . <h> F12berlinetta BODYWORK <h> BETWEEN SPORTINESS &amp;EFFICIENCY <p> The F12berlinetta 's design strikes the perfect balance between maximum aerodynamic efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Designers and engineers collaborated to sculpt beautiful surfaces that seamlessly incorporate innovative aerodynamic function , rather than overlaying different appendages .

At normal operating temperatures , the flaps remain closed , minimizing aerodynamic drag . <p> The F12berlinetta 's rear employs a modern , functional reinterpretation of the classic Kamm tail which elegantly integrates the two vertical fences of the rear diffuser . The resulting original T-shape also incorporates two full-LED circular tail-lights and the F1-inspired rear fog light . <h> Powertrain <p> The F12berlinetta 's maximum power of 731 hp at an operatic 8250 rpm is also accompanied by remarkable flexibility . A healthy 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from merely 2500 rpm . This powerplant also records a specific output - horsepower relative to displacement - of 116 hp per liter . Naturally , the net effect is massive maximum acceleration at low speeds right up to the 8700 rpm redline . <p> Just like Ferrari 's F1 engines , this production V12 operates with very low friction and inertia to ensure that revs climb rapidly . To heighten this quick-revving character , Ferrari concentrated on a number of areas including oil control , valvetrain drag and the compression ratio which rises to 13.5:1 . An innovative ignition system fires three successive sparks of different intensity and duration over the time that a normal ignition system fires once . This helps reduce fuel consumption by 30 percent compared to the 599 GTB Fiorano , despite the increase in power and torque . The lower crankcase is completely new and yields a markedly lower center of gravity than the F12berlinetta 's predecessor . The engine not only sits 1.1 inches lower than in the 599 GTB Fiorano , but further back in a fore-aft plane , making the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear wheels through the racing-derived dual-clutch F1 transmission which gives instantaneous gear shifts . <h> TRANSMISSION AND ELECTRONIC E-DIFF REDUCE OVERALL WEIGHT <p> The F12berlinetta 's transmission not only responds rapidly to input in the name of performance , it contributes to dynamic behavior by being lighter . Very close gear ratios in the dual-clutch F1 gearbox make the best use of the V12 engine 's power and torque spread at high and low rpms . The electronic E-Diff mated to the transmission was developed along the same weight-conscious mind-set . <h> Architecture <h> MULTIPLE ALLOYS - 12 IN ALL - INCLUDE TWO NEW STRUCTURAL MATERIALS <p> Breakthrough use of new alloys keeps the F12berlinetta 's weight down . Ferrari has pared 110 pounds from the bodyshell alone . And if one considers the additional weight that would have been required to meet heightened safety regulations to the previous model , the equivalent weight loss is even greater , at 198 pounds . Torsional rigidity has also been improved , increased by 20 percent . Crash resistance is already in line with future requirements . Also , particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair times and therefore reducing repair cost . <p> THE F12BERLINETTA DELIVERS TRULY EXTRAORDINARY PERFORMANCE AND DRIVING INVOLVEMENT THANKS TO ITS HIGHLY EVOLVED TRANSAXLE ARCHITECTURE WHICH WAS DEVELOPED WITH EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS OBJECTIVES IN MIND . Every part and every system in the F12berlinetta was placed under a weight-savings microscope . Furthermore , placement of weight in the chassis is just as vital . The engineers ' objective was to move mass rearward . With a front-to-rear weight distribution of 46/54 percent , success is achieved . Frontal area is also reduced , helping aerodynamics . <p> The F12berlinetta 's rear bodywork is now more compact as a result of the new transaxle , multi-link rear suspension , electronic differential and repositioning and diminishing the fuel tank size . There is no compromise in driving range , though ; this is unaffected thanks to greater fuel efficiency . <p> Rather than a traditional separate trunk , the F12berlinetta features a generous tailgate which contributes to much greater luggage space and easy accessibility . Structural integrity is in no way compromised , borne out by the 20 percent increase in rigidity over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also ensures that more mass sits within the wheelbase , improving handling dynamics . Rear overhang is greatly reduced by 3.2 inches , while front overhang is extended by 2.5 inches to accommodate the cooling systems required for the powerful V12 engine . <h> Aerodynamics <p> The aerodynamic development of the F12berlinetta ran hand-in-hand with styling in the studio by Ferrari designers . The result is the most overall aerodynamically efficient V12 Sport ever , and a model of aggressive beauty that furthers exotic design . Downforce increases by 7 percent to 271 pounds at 124 mph ( over the 599 GTB Fiorano ) , while drag is significantly reduced to a Cd of just 0.299 . <p> A series of innovative features enables the F12berlinetta 's exceptional aerodynamic efficiency . The Aero Bridge uses the hood to create downforce . Air passing over the car is drawn into special air intakes in the rear fenders , altering pressure in the wheel wells before exiting through the rear diffuser . <p> The front splitter is now separate from the fascia and actually generates downforce while directing air to the rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat surface with minimal turbulence and drag . The generous rear diffuser and its four fences also contribute an increase in downforce . <h> ACTIVE BRAKE COOLING AND AIR MANAGEMENT <p> Active Brake Cooling vanes on the front brake air ducts open only if brake operating temperatures are very high . When brake temperatures are normal , these vanes remain closed , providing greater aerodynamic efficiency . <p> The hood 's central air vent increases the efficiency of the cooling system and lessens the impact of air , lifting much of it over the windshield at high speed . <h> Vehicle dynamics <h> RECORD-SETTING PACE , YET FLUID TO DRIVE <p> The F12berlinetta sets a blistering pace at Ferrari 's private Fiorano test track , lapping the circuit in just 1 minute , 23 seconds . It also posts acceleration from 0-62 mph in only 3.1 seconds . Beyond the pure performance figures , though , it is fluid and intuitive to drive with confidence-inspiring handling at all speeds , not just at the limit on the racing circuit . The chassis ' optimized layout with highly centralized mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall weight compared to the 599 GTB Fiorano enable this agility and responsiveness , even at slower speeds . <p> All of the F12berlinetta 's key mechanical parts and sub-systems like springs , dampers , wheels , tires , yaw control , the E-Diff , F1-Trac traction control , stability control and the EBD auxiliary braking system are integrated to achieve these performance figures with no compromise to occupant comfort . <p> The CCM3 carbon-ceramic braking system , itself new , features a new material mix for the rear pads . Together with Active Brake Cooling at the front , these improvements eliminate fade and deliver excellent stopping distances , shortened to 429 feet from 124 mph , an impressive 22-foot improvement over the 599 GTB Fiorano . <h> STATE OF THE ART DOUBLE WISHBONE SUSPENSION <p> As has been a Ferrari hallmark for years , the F12berlinetta uses the most sophisticated double wishbone suspension design . The front lower wishbones are L-shaped while the rear uses a multi-link arrangement that keeps geometry as perfect as possible throughout the rear wheels ' travel . The F12berlinetta 's suspension also sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ECU with more powerful software . The key to this system is the fluid inside the dampers . The fluid 's viscosity is altered instantaneously by an electromagnetic field generated inside the damper . This translates into faster response time and more precise bump control which improves both performance and ride comfort . <h> ON-BOARD EXPERIENCE <p> The perfect balance is struck between advanced technologies and the beautifully hand-executed detailing of the Frau leather interior , reflecting the core Ferrari values . <p> The logical , ergonomic architecture of vital functions within the cockpit enhance the human-machine interface . All the major controls are on the steering wheel and all the main information is displayed in the binnacle straight ahead . <p> Eliminating stalks for turn indicators and other equipment , plus the clustering of all driver commands on the steering wheel underscore the car 's link to racing . The fact that the driver can reach every single control with hands firmly on the steering wheel rim , plus more ergonomically efficient F1 shift paddles maximize achievable performance in any driving condition . <p> The dashboard 's new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aeronautics .

It couples an 800 CV 6262cc V12 with a 120 kW ( 163 CV ) electric motor for a total output of over 960 CV . <p> Thanks to the HY-KERS system , it is the most high performance and efficient Ferrari ever built . Making full use of Ferrari 's F1 expertise with KERS systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantees perfect integration of the V12 and the electric motor , seamlessly blending the advantages of both . The high levels of torque available at low revs from the electric motor allowed the engineers to optimise the internal combustion engine 's performance at higher revs , thus providing exceptional , continuous power throughout the rev range and a maximum torque peak of 900 Nm . <p> Coupled with the F1 DCT , the electric motor was designed employing High Specific Power Density technology which enabled the engineers to drastically reduce weight and volume in relation to available torque . The result is performance figures comparable to those of the F1 car with the same torque density and the same efficiency ( 94% ) or , in other words , very limited power dissipation . <p> The batteries consist of 120 cells assembled into eight modules , with a power output that 's the equivalent of 40 traditional batteries but weighing just 60 kg . The batteries are charged in two different ways : under braking - even hard braking when the ABS intervenes , such as when driving on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than required , such as in cornering . In the latter instance , rather than the being sent to the wheels , the excess torque is converted to energy and stored in the batteries . The Hybrid Power Unit is essentially the HY-KERS system brain and controls power delivery from both the V12 and the electric motor via two inverters and two DC-DC converters . Variable-frequency control makes torque delivery rapid and precise . <p> The 6,262 cc V12 is the most powerful naturally aspirated engine ever sported by a road-going Ferrari . It punches out 800 hp and spins to 9,250 rpm , to deliver absolutely extraordinary performance , fun behind the wheel and an unmistakable Ferrari sound . These unprecedented results are the product of meticulous honing of the engine 's volumetric , mechanical and combustion efficiency . To boost volumetric efficiency , the V12 employs continuously variable-length intakes - a mainstay in F1 engine technology until banned by rule changes " which optimise performance as a function of engine speed . Similarly , the torque and power curves are optimised across the rev range . The hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instantaneous torque from the electric motor is employed at lower revs and V12 engine power and torque is optimised at higher revs . The V12 's peak torque of 700 Nm is , in fact , developed at 6,750 rpm . <p> The new layout of the radiating masses made it necessary to create a duct that could channel air from the upper section of the front grille over the bonnet . This solution generates downforce depending on the variations in the flow momentum striking the car . <p> Furthermore , deflecting the hot air to the underbody also meant that the vortex generators needed to be redesigned . The front dam is now longer while the underbody surface around the longitudinal vortex generators has been lowered to boost the ground effect and thus the car 's ability to generate efficient downforce . <p> In terms of open-top aerodynamic comfort , an innovative integrated system was developed . The high-speed air flow that would otherwise enter the cabin from top of the windscreen is captured by an angled wind-stop fixed to the parcel shelf . The wind-stop is angled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior structure before exiting at a slower speed behind the passenger seats . This delivers a level of interior comfort in line with other convertibles in the Ferrari range without increasing drag . <p> Proprietary Ferrari algorithms guarantee optimal integration of the electric motor and V12 engine and thereby optimising dynamic behaviour . When the car is cornering , the HY-KERS keeps the V12 's revs up to ensure quicker response times to the accelerator pedal when exiting . The Brembo brakes , which integrate with the energy recovery system , have lighter callipers with a specific design designed to guarantee perfect heat dissipation from the new carbon-ceramic discs . @qwx21121@@296452 @qwx21124 @qwx21121

Most of these have traditionally been American , French and Italian , but there are also rare cases of teams from other countries , such as the Dominican Republic , Cuba and Morocco . The Scuderia Askolin belongs to this category as the only Finnish team in the history of the Casa di Maranello , founded by Carl-Johan Askolin in the 1950s . <p> Throughout its short history , the team raced with several Ferrari cars , including the 250 Testa Rossa , which , in the last few days of 2016 , re-emerged from the Ferrari Classiche workshop , having undergone a complete overhaul to restore it to its former glory , harking back to Spring 1958 . <p> The car was purchased in Maranello by the Swede Tore Bjurstrom , and delivered to Askolin in May .

Lincoln was also fourth in the race at Karlskoga , Sweden . <p> At the end of the year , the Scuderia Askolin closed its doors and the car was sold to Alfred Hopf , a Swiss national , who entrusted it to the young driver Peter Monteverdi , who more than 30 years later would go on to attempt ( unsuccessfully ) to found a Formula One team . The car 's colours were deemed too striking to be covered with the Swiss emblem , and so , still bearing the Finnish livery , the 250 Testa Rossa won the uphill Sierra Crans-Montana 1960 race , as well as dominating in the Swiss Mountain Grand Prix , on the Ollon-Villars climbs . In October of that year , the car was seriously damaged on the Freiburg-Schauinsland climb when Hopf came off the track . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on to make radical changes to the bodywork and mechanics of the vehicle , changing its name to the Gachnang-Ferrari 3000S .

The car remained in France until 1982 , when it was sold to an American collector . <p> The 250 Testa Rossa has since changed owners five different times . The last of these came into possession of the vehicle in April 2014 , unveiling the car in public for the first time during the Pebble Beach Concourse d'Elegance in the US .

Product , process , working method : there is n't a single area in which we are not constantly striving to deliver improvement at all levels . <p> Our approach to product innovation has resulted in a range of cars that are at the very leading edge in terms of technology , making the company a benchmark for the entire automotive industry . In recent years , our investments have focused on materials research , leading to the creation of the Scaglietti light alloy hub and the integration of F1 technologies into our carbon-fibre applications , electronic control systems , and active aerodynamics , all of which have reached unprecedented levels of achievement for a road car. - Naturally enough , there has been plenty of development also in our powertrains , which are a more traditional part of our work . In fact , Ferrari has built its reputation on its powertrains but they have evolved not only from a performance point of view but also in terms of efficiency and usability . High pressure fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports cars , being just a few examples . <p> Each new model brims with technological innovation , solutions that pave the way for the rest of the industry and which are often picked up by other manufacturers at a later date . The many innovations we have debuted in our 60-plus year history include steering wheel-mounted gearshift paddles , which Ferrari transferred from its F1 car to its road cars . Unsurprisingly they quickly became a standard fixture on all sports cars. - Given that track record , it should come as no surprise- that in the decade between 2003 and 2012 , Ferrari registered an impressive 150 patents , some of which were genuinely revolutionary . These included the 4RM system which allows the FF to be in four-wheel drive mode only when driving demands it , guaranteeing a light , efficient drive and the kind of sporty behaviour impossible to achieve with conventional 4WD technology . In recent years , we have been placing particular research emphasis also on weight reduction , an area in which in-depth knowledge of materials is vital . <p> In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of our construction materials . In fact , Ferrari has been building all-aluminium cars ( both bodyshell and chassis ) as standard - since 1999 as the latter material 's high performance lightness and stiffness guarantee a far better time-cost ratio for large scale production runs whilst still being easy to maintain . The Scaglietti aluminium hub has perfected more than 25 different alloys , some of which are being used for the first time in the automotive sector . This has led to a significant weight savings thereby boosting performances and safety . <p> Another of Ferrari 's focuses is on innovating its working methods and this also involves stimulating the creativity of its employees . With this in mind , we have implemented programmes designed to encourage the development of ideas and solutions that will improve our product , methods and working environment .

The latest artful racing documentary from avowed car and film aficionados Adam Carolla and Nate Adams does n't  chronicle one 24-hour race , but rather the years-long mid-1960s battle for supremacy between Ferrari and Ford at iconic Le Mans . <p> And what a war it was , pitting sinister machines , rakish engineers and courageous drivers against each other in a literally death-defying contest that bestowed on the winner not only sporting bragging rights but also the financial spoils reaped from marketing buzz . <p> Ford had all but abandoned the race-on-Sunday , sell-on-Monday mantra when it duelled Ferrari a half-century ago .

In terms of Ferrari , after this duel , they largely pulled out of Le Mans as a factory team and focused on Formula One . They realised they could not spend what Ford was willing to do .

This means that the FF offers more luggage space not only than any other car in its category , but also many four-door saloons , too . <p> Everything aboard the FF is tailored specifically to the needs and tastes of its driver with a choice of six exclusive colours and the finest Frau aniline leathers specially treated to enhance their natural softness . The FF 's exceptional specification enhances in-car enjoyment for all four occupants .

To win World Championships both on two wheels and , in grand prix racing , on four , is a feat almost impossible to imagine ever being repeated . As well as competing at the highest level he won seven motorcycle world titles with MV Agusta and , of course , the 1964 Formula One World Championship with Ferrari he also formed Team Surtees in 1970 , running his own cars successfully , and winning the Formula Two Championship in 1972 .

It was officially unveiled at a press conference presenting the programmes for the season ahead .

It was not simply a great tourer , but a real racing car with a number plate . It was an icon , whose sinuous and at the same time aggressive line is still captivating down to this day , and for many regarded as the most beautiful Ferrari of all time . It won everything there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest valued historic car in the world we are talking about figures of 30 million , which are bound to increase . The car was designed by the brilliant Giotto Bizzarrini based on the 250 GT SWB , to race in the World Marques Championship , which from 1962 changed its name , moving over to GT and was divided into categories . The letter O in GTO stands for Omologata ( approved ) , but the 100 examples that were then requested were never produced . There were 36 plus another three equipped with a 4000-cc engine . <p> Bizzarrini cared about aerodynamics and the vehicles lines were sculpted in the wind tunnel . However , the engineer , a native of Livorno , was n't there for the launch of the car in February 1962 , as he had been part of the core management that Enzo Ferrari decided to renew at the end of 1961 . Responsibility for the vehicle and its approval then passed to Mauro Forghieri . Sergio Scaglietti gave the last touches to the body , shaping the metal exposed on the frame , piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation developed on racetracks around the world , and on road courses such as the famous Tour de France Automobile . <p> The 250 GTO delivered three world championships to Maranello from 1962 to 1964 , plus many victories in the most prestigious races . In the early season conference , it was the only one that still had a front engine , the 3-litre V12 300 hp designed by Gioacchino Colombo , while the sports cars and F1s had changed to a mid-engine over the wheel axle . A rear spoiler was added before its debut in the 12 Hours of Sebring . In the race , Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill drove their 250 GTO to second overall and first in the GT category , behind the Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa , which won with Joakim Bonnier and Lucien Bianchi . We can also see that the 250 GTO is a work of art by the fact that this racing model has the largest number of differently coloured liveries , besides the classic red .

Figures that no other front-engined production car has ever even come near to delivering and which ensure the kind of thrilling top-end performance that is the exclusive characteristic of Ferrari 's noble V12 heritage . <p> The engine 's power is underscored by a full , rich exhaust sound that exploits the acoustic clout delivered by its increased displacement. - Maximum torque is 718 Nm @ 7,000 rpm , a significant 80% of which is already available at 3,500 rpm , improving both driveability and pick-up even at low revs . These performance levels were achieved in part by adopting a 350 bar direct injection system for the very first time on a high-performance engine and pairing it with variable geometry intake tracts conceptually derived from those of naturally-aspirated F1 engines . <p> The 812 Superfast 's dual-clutch transmission has specific gear ratios which , combined with shorter up and down-shifting times between gears , sharpen throttle response still further . <p> Vehicle dynamics <p> The 812 Superfast is equipped with leading-edge control systems and components , resulting in unparalleled handling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Electric Power Steering ) which , in accordance with Ferrari 's uncompromising engineering approach , is used to fully exploit the potential of the car 's performance and , through the complete integration with all the electronic vehicle dynamics controls " including the latest 5.0 version of Ferrari 's patented Side Slip Control ( SSC ) - make its powerful performance easier to handle and even more thrilling to exploit . <p> The vehicle controls also feature , for the first time , the Virtual Short Wheelbase 2.0 system ( PCV ) which , following the experience gained with the F12tdf , features a further evolution of the software that improves the nimbleness of the handling and reduces the vehicle response times even further . <p> Styling and aerodynamics <p> Designed by the Ferrari Styling Centre , the new 812 Superfast redefines the formal language of front-engined V12 Ferraris , underlining the car 's exceptional performance with very sporty lines and proportions . - Seen in silhouette , the 812 Superfast has a fastback sleekness : a two-box design with a high tail reminiscent of the glorious 365 GTB4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tail and is characterised by impressively muscular wheelarches which imbue the 812 Superfast with the power and aggression warranted by its imposing V12 .

" , the 288 Evoluzione is the Maranello great that never truly was . <p> Back in the mid-1980s , world rallying was at the apogee of its popularity , rivalling Formula One as the premier global motorsport entertainment . Much of this success was down to the savage new Group B formula , which saw some of the worlds most gifted driving improvisers wrestle increasingly powerful rally cars around the forests and across deserts . <p> Audis Quattro morphed into the Quattro SWB , Peugeot under the guidance of the future Scuderia Ferrari Team Principal and FIA President Jean Todt fielded the brilliant 205 T16 , and Lancia ran the lissom 037 and by mid-decade the technologically advanced but unruly Delta S4 ( a car which was both turbo- and supercharged ) . <p> The 288 Evoluzione was originally created to compete in Group B formula rally driving Photo : Rex Features <p> The regulations required that 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road use . Although the connection between these extreme rally weapons and their everyday equivalents was somewhat tenuous , it was still strong enough to fire the imaginations of WRCs many fans . <p> Into this maelstrom of horsepower came Ferrari , whose 288 GTO ( Gran Turismo Omologato ) was conceived to compete in Group B. The 288 GTOs body represented a considerable reimagining of the 308 GTB on which it was based . So much so , in fact , that it was almost a new car . <p> Only six examples of the 288 Evoluzione were produced Photo : Alamy <p> Although still mid-mounted , the engine a dry-sumped 2.9-litre , 90 V8 boosted to 400hp by twin IHI turbochargers now sat longitudinally rather than transversely in the chassis , the wheelbase was extended , and the body was a mix of composite materials and resin . <p> With 400bhp , the GTO ( the 288 prefix was unofficial ) could accelerate to 100km/h in 4.9 seconds , and reach a top speed of 305km/h . In responding to the Group B regs , had Ferrari invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toivenen plunged his Lancia Delta S4 over a ravine during the 1986 Corsican rally , killing himself and co-driver Sergio Cresto , the FIA concluded that Group B had become too dangerous to continue .

Pininfarina reworked the GTOs already thrilling bodywork , using Kevlar and fibreglass in its construction to reduce its overall weight yet further . The rear wing was made of carbon fibre , an early appearance of this expensive new material on a Ferrari . <p> Factor in enlarged turbos and additional engine tuning , and the result was around 650hp in a car that weighed a mere 940kg : that 's the sort of power-to-weight ratio that seriously gets your attention . <p> The Evoluzione was meant to compete in Group B tarmac events , in the hands of sufficiently capable privateers .

His name was Franco Cortese . <p> As the Company prepares to celebrate its 70th anniversary , his moment in the sun has invariably come around again . That Cortese is not as celebrated as the likes of Alberto Ascari , Mike Hawthorn , Peter Collins , Phil Hill or John Surtees to name just a few of the big personalities from the earlier chapters of Ferraris history is partly down to the fact that he was involved as the Company was taking its first faltering steps , but also that he is generally regarded as a talented " gentleman " driver in the pre and post-war era . <p> That is a misnomer . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not least because Cortese , born in Oggebbio , Piedmont , in 1903 , raced a remarkable variety of cars in a career that spanned four decades , from 1926 until 1958 . <p> Cortese , on the far left ( number 21 ) at the 1947 Pescara Grand Prix <p> This included participation in the very first Mille Miglia , in 1927 , driving an Itala .

Ferrari had manufactured machine tools in Maranello during the war and , amongst others , had given Cortese a licence to sell them .

Each one represented the very state of the art in terms of performance-oriented engineering , the most recent being , of course , the likes of the 288 GTO , F40 and F50 .

Joining their exclusive ranks in 2002 was the Enzo Ferrari , a superb car of which just 399 were built . <p> At the time of its launch , the Enzo contained the most advanced track-derived technologies of its day . What made it truly unique was the fact that it was benefiting from the technological crossover at a time when Ferrari was on an impressive winning streak in Formula 1 .

Pininfarina did a majestic job of drawing these and other functions together and moulding an incredibly charismatic line out them . <h> The Body <p> The car 's uncompromising stance , compact size and weight reduction objectives made for a strictly functional cabin . In fact , all of the main surfaces were unadorned carbon-fibre while the steering wheel bristled with vehicle control buttons and switches like a Formula 1 car .

The new V12 was completely focused on delivering a unique blend of blistering power , huge torque at low revs and a broad range of use . Its rear-mounted gearbox was connected directly to the engine with just the F1 version being available . <p> The priority with the Enzo design was to cut gearshifting times ( which went down to 150 milliseconds ) to deliver superbly sporty driving . This was thanks to a new control logic and further refinements which , in line with the car 's extreme vocation , were less influenced by comfort considerations . <p> The Enzo 's braking system was specifically developed for it by Brembo and featured CCM ( Carbon-Ceramic Material ) discs , the first time these had been used on a Ferrari car despite having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This also contributed in no small part to the benchmark braking performance results delivered by the Enzo across the board . <p> Careful selection of the best shots of the Enzo Ferrari in high definition .

@@6333295 @qwx21124 <h> Innovation <p> Innovation is part and parcel of Ferrari 's DNA . Product , process , working method : there is n't a single area in which we are not constantly striving to deliver improvement at all levels . <p> Our approach to product innovation has resulted in a range of cars that are at the very leading edge in terms of technology , making the company a benchmark for the entire automotive industry . In recent years , our investments have focused on materials research , leading to the creation of the Scaglietti light alloy hub and the integration of F1 technologies into our carbon-fibre applications , electronic control systems , and active aerodynamics , all of which have reached unprecedented levels of achievement for a road car. - Naturally enough , there has been plenty of development also in our powertrains , which are a more traditional part of our work . In fact , Ferrari has built its reputation on its powertrains but they have evolved not only from a performance point of view but also in terms of efficiency and usability . High pressure fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports cars , being just a few examples . <p> Each new model brims with technological innovation , solutions that pave the way for the rest of the industry and which are often picked up by other manufacturers at a later date . The many innovations we have debuted in our 60-plus year history include steering wheel-mounted gearshift paddles , which Ferrari transferred from its F1 car to its road cars . Unsurprisingly they quickly became a standard fixture on all sports cars. - Given that track record , it should come as no surprise- that in the decade between 2003 and 2012 , Ferrari registered an impressive 150 patents , some of which were genuinely revolutionary . These included the 4RM system which allows the FF to be in four-wheel drive mode only when driving demands it , guaranteeing a light , efficient drive and the kind of sporty behaviour impossible to achieve with conventional 4WD technology . In recent years , we have been placing particular research emphasis also on weight reduction , an area in which in-depth knowledge of materials is vital . <p> In terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment of our construction materials . In fact , Ferrari has been building all-aluminium cars ( both bodyshell and chassis ) as standard - since 1999 as the latter material 's high performance lightness and stiffness guarantee a far better time-cost ratio for large scale production runs whilst still being easy to maintain . The Scaglietti aluminium hub has perfected more than 25 different alloys , some of which are being used for the first time in the automotive sector . This has led to a significant weight savings thereby boosting performances and safety . <p> Another of Ferrari 's focuses is on innovating its working methods and this also involves stimulating the creativity of its employees . With this in mind , we have implemented programmes designed to encourage the development of ideas and solutions that will improve our product , methods and working environment . Pole Position Evo , for instance , rewards ideas put forward by individual staff members . In 2012 alone , in fact , we received more than 3,000 suggestions for employees with a blue collar participation rate of 56% .

It is easy to see why work was needed on the chassis : without a roof , it was necessary to share the load lines in the lower part of the body . The end result is a negligible increase in weight , while preserving the torsional and flexural rigidity of the LaFerrari . <p> As with every self-respecting Ferrari roadster , cockpit turbulence is reduced to a minimum . This is possible due to the design of an integrated system , capable of " capturing " the high-speed flow that tends to enter the compartment .

@@6333351 <h> Evolution of an Icon <p> It is difficult to evolve an icon like the Testarossa . Difficult , but not impossible , and in 1992 Ferrari responded with the 512 TR . While keeping the conceptual framework that had stunned the world in 1984 , the new car featured a number of external cosmetic changes that improved the aerodynamics of the elegant Pininfarina lines , while the interiors were more comfortable and ergonomic . <p> The new car marked a return to the use of acronyms : the " 5 " refers to the engine capacity in litres , the " 12 " to the number of cylinders and " TR " stands for Testa Rossa . It was unveiled at the Los Angeles Motor Show , an event always interested in all news from the world of the Prancing Horse .

New alloy wheels were also introduced , as a very stylish interpretation of the traditional Ferrari five-pointed star shaped design . These rims concealed big drilled and ventilated disc brakes with 4-piston callipers . The independent suspension and steering systems were based on the Testarossas , albeit with small variations and adjustments to adapt to larger diameter wheels and to ensure more precise handling . <p> The 12-cylinder boxer engine , with four valves per cylinder and dry-sump lubrication , was an improved version of the drive unit used in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injection system .

The designers of the Testarossa created an " unbalanced " layout on the rear , placing the radiators there in order to eliminate the hot water pipes . Pininfarina transformed a potential limitation into an opportunity and created a shape that could convey the flow along the sides where the radiators were positioned . To hide them from view , the designer came up with the cars iconic stretch of horizontal spoilers that fit harmoniously into the three-dimensional shapes of the tail . <p> However , it was not just the style that left people speechless .

@@6333430 @qwx21124 <h> Overview <h> 250 GTO <h> 1962 <p> This was the car that summed up Ferrari philosophy best : the highest levels of performance and styling . Created by a team led by Giotto Bizzarrini , it owes its lines to research carried out in a wind tunnel . <h> Focus on <p> Charisma came not only from its innumerable racing victories , but from the unique sum of its parts stunning looks , a highly competitive chassis and a thoroughbred V12 engine . <p> The 250 GTO model was the pinnacle of development of the 250 GT series in competition form , whilst still remaining a road car . It made its public debut at the annual pre-season Ferrari press conference in January 1962 , and was the only front engine model on display , with its monoposto and sports racing counterparts all having a mid-engine configuration . <h> The Structure <p> This model had no tail spoiler , but one was added before its competition debut at the Sebring circuit in America in March 1962 . On its maiden outing in the 12 Hour Race , driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished second overall to a Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa sports racing car . It also won the GT category comfortably , an impressive debut performance upon which it would build during the next three years . <p> The model was built on a 2400 mm wheel base , as had been the 250 GT SWB from which it was derived . Although the chassis was built along the same lines , it used smaller section tubing , with additional bracing for increased torsional rigidity , and was given factory type reference 539/62 Comp. , and then 539/64 Comp . Like the earlier 250 GT SWB Berlinettas , four wheel disc brakes were fitted , with a cable-operated handbrake to the rear wheels , and it was also available as both a left- and right-hand drive . <p> Early development of the new model was shrouded in secrecy , with Giotto Bizzarrini charged with developing a car to take on and beat the Jaguar E Type . In various interviews over the years he has said he was given an old 250 GT Boano chassis as a basis for the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided with a 250 GT passo corto ( chassis 1791GT ) on which to base the new car . <p> On its first outing at Monza in September 1961 , prior to the Italian Grand Prix , the 250 GTO earned the nickname Il Mostro ( The Monster ) , due to its rough-hewn and i 'll fitting prototype body . During test sessions , Stirling Moss drove the car to record times far better than those ever achieved by a 250 GT passo corto . A palace revolution followed later in the year , and Bizzarrini found himself on the outside , with refinement of the GTO body entrusted to Sergio Scaglietti , who created its definitive shape . <h> The Body <p> The power unit was essentially a 250 Testa Rossa specification version of the Colombo single overhead camshaft per bank 3-litre V12 engine , with bore and stroke of 73 x 58.8 mm , but using dry sump lubrication , with factory type reference 168 Comp/62 . The spark plugs were outside the vee of the block , and there was a bank of six twin choke Weber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of engine mounted distributor ignition system , to produce a claimed 300 bhp . <p> The engine was coupled to a new 5-speed , all synchromesh gearbox , with an open gate gear-change tower in the cockpit , similar to that used on the sports racing models since the mid-fifties , driving through a propeller shaft to the rigid rear axle , fitted with a Watts linkage . As befitted its intended competition use , a wide range of rear axle ratios was available . <p> The overall shape of the aluminium bodies designed and built by Scaglietti changed very little during the production period from 1962 to 1964 , apart from a one-off example bodied in the style of the 330 LM Berlinetta . The last three cars in the series received Pininfarina-designed and Scaglietti-built bodies of a style very similar to that used on the mid-engine 250 LM sports racing car . Four earlier cars were also re-bodied in the later style during 1964 . Although the overall body shape did n't  alter to any great degree , the detail differences during the production run certainly did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elliptical radiator opening , bounded by rectangular driving lights , initially with brake cooling ducts under the nose , which then changed to vertical brake cooling slots in the nose alongside the driving lights , with the sidelights mounted below the Plexiglass shrouded headlights . The rear spoiler was bolted to the tail panel , and there were cabin exhaust air slots in the sail panels . The brake cooling ducts soon became circular , and the side lights moved to a semi-recessed location in the wing sides ; a little while after these modifications the tail spoiler , still of the same profile , became an integral , riveted part of the body construction . <h> Removable ' D ' -shaped panels <p> All of the examples produced , apart from the 64-bodied cars , had three removable D-shaped panels , retained by quarter turn fasteners , on the upper face of the nose , for increased radiator air throughput , the pattern being repeated with three similar uncovered openings in the underside of the nose panel . The 64-bodied cars and re-bodies again have detail differences between individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was either long , short with integral spoiler , or short without spoiler and the bonnet , which either had a long slim bulge tapering into the nose panel or a cold air intake . A number of cars were modified during their competition careers , notably with the addition of a third front wing exhaust air slot , and occasionally louvres were added to the bonnet to aid heat dissipation . Apart from these main points , there were numerous individual differences between the various cars , i.e. some had the rear lights mounted on raised bridges , while others had them fixed directly to the tail panel . <h> The Engine <p> The 250 GTO Berlinettas continued the run of successes of the preceding passo lungo and passo corto models , and with the manufacturers championship being transferred to the GT category from 1962 , gave Ferrari a hat trick of victories between 1962 and 1964 . They were virtually dominant in their class , and were only being caught by the AC Cobras ( with much larger capacity V8 engines ) during their last competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GTO were wins in the Tour de France in 1963 and 1964 ; GT class wins in the Targa Florio in 1962 , 1963 and 1964 ; victories in the Tourist Trophy at Goodwood in 1962 and 1963 ; with GT category wins at Le Mans in 1962 and 1963 , and in the Nurburgring 1000 km in 1963 and 1964 . <p> The 250 GTO was the ultimate expression of the Ferrari 250 GT car . It was equally at home on the road or track " perhaps the last dual purpose road/race car produced " and has achieved legendary status amongst aficionados of the marque . With only a relatively small production run of thirty-six cars , and with many of the examples produced having a great race pedigree , it has become one of the icons of Ferrari production history , with a revered position in collector 's circles . <p> Careful selection of the best shots of the 250 GTO in high definition .

The 458 Italia now boasts the lowest emissions of any sports car in its class on the market . <p> The FF also makes its eagerly-waited debut at Geneva after the huge build-up of expectation and interest created by the client premiere at Maranello broadcast online by www.ferrari.com . <p> The revolutionary FF offers a completely new take on the sporting Grand Tourer theme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , but , more significantly , a model that hails a major break with the past , effortlessly melding extreme sports car performance with the versatility and usability of a genuine GT and boasting an extremely innovative design . <p> Every single area of the FF brims with innovation , not least its engine , the first GDI V12 to be coupled with the seven-speed F1 dual-clutch gearbox . The V12 unleashes a massive 660 CV at 8,000 rpm , and maximum torque of 683 Nm at 6,000 rpm with 500 Nm already available at just 1,000 rpm . This ensures the performance figures of an extreme sports car , with the 0-100 km/h sprint covered in 3.7 seconds and a top speed of 335 km/h . Efficiency has been significantly boosted too , with fuel consumption now standing at just 15.4 litres per 100 km , and CO2 emissions at 360 g/km , a 25 per cent reduction compared to the previous V12s , thanks in part to the HELE ( High Emotions- Low Emissions ) System which incorporates Stop&amp;Start technology . <p> Uniquely , the FF also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coefficients , thanks to Ferrari 's own patented 4RM four-wheel drive system . Torque is still delivered by the rear wheels , but the PTU ( Power Transfer Unit ) ensures that as much as is required is also transferred to the front wheels when necessary on low grip surfaces . The FF intelligently distributes torque to each of the four wheels individually , thanks to the fact that all of the dynamic vehicle controls ( E-Diff , F1-Trac and PTU ) have been integrated into a single CPU . <p> Exceptional sporty driving is guaranteed by the FF 's transaxle architecture ( mid-front engine with gearbox over the rear axle ) and the positioning of 53% of weight to the rear of the car . Meticulous attention has been taken in lightening the engine ( new castings ) , bodyshell ( new aluminium alloys and production processes ) and a host of other components . The interior has also been optimised through the use of high-tech materials such as magnesium for the seats . Third generation Brembo carbon-ceramic brakes are now lighter and longer-lasting , with virtually negligible wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovations have combined to produce an absolutely exceptional weight-power ratio of 2.7 kg/CV , a new benchmark for this kind of car . <p> Styled by Pininfarina , the FF 's lines effortlessly reflect its signature uncompromising balance of sportiness and versatility . It can comfortably accommodate four in its bodyhugging seats and spacious cabin . Its 450 litre boot can also be extended to 800 litres as the rear seats fold down independently . This means that the FF offers more luggage space not only than any other car in its category , but also many four-door saloons , too . <p> Everything aboard the FF is tailored specifically to the needs and tastes of its driver with a choice of six exclusive colours and the finest Frau aniline leathers specially treated to enhance their natural softness . The FF 's exceptional specification enhances in-car enjoyment for all four occupants . Features include a new rear-seat infotainment system with two screens for watching TV and DVD and a 1,280 Watt , 16-channel stereo system with Quantumlogic Surround Sound . <p> The three FFs on the stand are joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sporting HGTE package , and a Ferrari California in an elegant Blu Tour De France finish .

Victory for the third consecutive year came in the GTE-Am class where the 488 GTE literally dominated . The car of JMW Motorsport won with a lap advantage over everyone . The British team was making its debut with the new berlinetta , driven by Robert Smith , Dries Vanthoor and Will Stevens .

The same held for the 488 no. 82 of Risi Competizione driven by Toni Vilander , Giancarlo Fisichella and Pierre Kaffer , which was struck and put out of action due to a crazy manoeuvre by Mathieu Vaxiviere in the Oreca of TDS Racing . The class win went to the Aston Martin of Turner-Adam-Serra , while the overall laurels were taken by the Porsche no. 2 of Bernhard-Bamberg-Hartley . <p> GTE-Pro . Alessandro Pier Guidi pulled off a lightning start in the 488 GTE no. 51 of AF Corse to overtake the Aston Martin of Turner-Adam-Serra and lead the group .

A series of Safety Cars in the night left both Ferraris in the leading group by the morning with no. 51 in the third place and no. 71 further behind .

The youthful Dries Vanthoor , a former Formula One driver like Will Stevens and the experienced Robert Smith drove impeccably to pull off an extraordinary result for the British team that a few weeks ago in Monza had won its last race with the 458 Italia GTE ( in the European Le Mans Series ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era in the best possible way .

The two Bs stand for Berlinetta Boxer . This name was derived from the fact that the cylinder banks form an angle of 180 , producing an engine with a flat , rectangular shape which enabled the cars centre of gravity to be lowered . From a technical standpoint , this solution rendered design and construction more complex . Precisely for this reason , the gestation period for this model took longer than usual .

The alternation of these corners enabled Ferrari to evaluate cars handling , weight distribution and braking ability , as well as engine pick-up and acceleration out of the bends . The tracks straight , meanwhile , meant that high-speed braking could be safely carried out . Elsewhere , the slight incline of certain sections was used to analyse vehicle behaviour and stability during changes in trajectory . Both the straight and the fast corners were useful for assessing the aerodynamic efficiency of the cars . Fiorano thus became an extremely useful training ground for the Scuderias drivers , as well as for its technicians and engineers . <p> Right from the start , the track was described as an experimental test track , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for racing this also meant a ban on public access , with only one car allowed to lap the track at any one time . Over the years , the track was subject to certain modifications ; first , a chicane was added , increasing the length of the track to 3021 metres , with subsequent changes shortening it again to 2997 and then 2976 metres respectively ( without chicane ) . Depending on the type of car in question , the average speed over a lap is more than 160 km/h , with a maximum speed of 290 km/h . The circuit has a pit lane with a garage , and today is equipped with an advanced telemetry system that provides all the information required when developing a car . A video system with fixed cameras captures the entire track .

@@6333645 <h> Extreme refinement <p> Can a masterpiece be improved by a copy made years later ? The answer may be yes , looking for example at the famous " Virgin of the Rocks " by Leonardo Da Vinci . The first version of this work , now kept in the Louvre , was painted some time between 1483 and 1486 , while the second , found at the National Gallery in London , was completed between 1506 and 1508 . The differences between these two versions may seem imperceptible to a casual observer , but not when subject to in-depth analysis . Similarly , the F512 M is a reworking of the Testarossa from the 1980s , but an improvement on it in many important details . <p> The F512 M is not only the most developed version of the Testarossa series , but is also the rarest . It was the last of the Ferraris with the centrally positioned twelve-cylinder boxer engine , derived from the famous 312 T that dominated Formula 1 in the 1970s . Obviously Ferrari technicians profoundly revised and optimised the unit fitted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kinematics , with undoubted benefits for maximum power , now increased to 440 hp . The increase in power provided improved acceleration over the previous model and , because various parts of the car were now lighter , there was also a better power to weight ratio . The letter " M " that appears next to the F512 , and that indicates the " Modified " version of the car , was no mere marketing operation , but emphasises the in-depth work carried out on every part of the model . This can be seen , for example , in the improved aerodynamic penetration , achieved through big changes to the lines and the shape both at the nose and the tail . However , the Pininfarina designers and Maranello engineers focussed mainly on the front . <p> The new nose line was closely related to that of the 355 model and with the style of the 456 GT 2 + 2 . The most radical change in the appearance of the front , from the original Testarossa or the 512 TR was the disappearance of the double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a glass cover . The bonnet was fitted with a pair of small NACA ducts , situated towards the windscreen , which convey air to the improved air conditioning system . The stain black full-width horizontal grille in the tail is smaller and its sides contain new circular twin rear lights , in stylistic homage to the history of the company . <p> The F512 M , which replaced the 512 TR , was presented at the Paris Motor Show in the autumn of 1994 although it was shown in secret at Maranello to a number of foreign specialist magazines by official Scuderia driver , Jean Alesi . This car also uses an " F " ( for Ferrari ) as a prefix to the model numbers . In this case it indicates as previously on the 512 TR , its five-litre engine capacity and the number of cylinders . However , the suffix " M " , in addition to indicating the " Modified " version , is itself a tribute to the letter that Ferrari used on the 512 S competition sports car prototypes of the early 1970s when they were updated to the 512 M.

In addition , Dan Gurney , Cliff Allison and Olivier Gendebien were also available . <p> The 250 Testa Rossa was the benchmark in the Sportscar class , updated with new specifications including a new body designed by Pinin Farina and built by Medardo Fantuzzi .

This is why people often say that , in terms of wear , the 12 Hours of Sebring is equivalent to the 24 Hours of Le Mans . In fact , many teams have used the American race to develop prototypes for the Circuit de la Sarthe classic . In late 1959 Sebring also hosted the first edition of the United States Grand Prix , in which Tony Brooks finished third , and , unfortunately lost the World Championship by a few points , the Scuderia having missed the British Grand Prix due to a strike . <p> Ferrari was favourite in the 12 Hours of Sebring with four official cars on the track three 250 Testa Rossa models and , for the first time , a 250 GT California Spider , joined by several other specimens entered by private teams and NART of Luigi Chinetti .

In fact , all of the main surfaces were unadorned carbon-fibre while the steering wheel bristled with vehicle control buttons and switches like a Formula 1 car .
