And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90% , the researchers added . <p> " Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP , " the international team of study authors wrote . <p> Retinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina , the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye . When the vessels grow , they can cause the retina to detach , destroying vision , according to the U.S. National Eye Institute . <p> For the study , researchers from China , Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula , and whether or not they developed ROP . <p> However , the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP .

In the United States , 59% of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder , said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen , a neonatologist at Children 's Hospital of Fudan University , in Shanghai . He added that in China , a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50% in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams ( 2.2 pounds ) . <p> ROP " has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time , " Chen said . " In general , there are more ROP cases in developed countries , but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries , according to Chen .

Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds . No information was given about how long the breastfeeding continued . <p> In re-evaluating the studies , Chen 's team found that breastfeeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP . And it appeared that the more breast milk , the better . Exclusive breastfeeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75% compared to exclusive formula use .

The antioxidants in human milk may help , Chen said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Breastfeeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy , which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP , the study authors said . <p> Dr. Adolfo Llanos , a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children 's Hospital in Miami , who was not involved with the new study , said the " quality of this analysis is very good .

It may be that you are experiencing fibrocystic breast changes " a benign condition that occurs in women of childbearing age . <p> It sounds very unglamorous , but the human breast is no more than a lumpy gland made up of milk glands , ducts , and the tissues that separate and support them . Most breasts have at least 1 or 2 lumps ; however , if your breast feels especially lumpy and uncomfortable , you are probably experiencing fibrocystic breast changes . <h> What Are Fibrocystic Changes ? <p> Fibrocystic changes are benign breast changes . The medical literature used to refer to them as fibrocystic disease . That was before fibrocystic changes were found to be no more a disease than menstruation or menopause . The breast tissue may feel dense with an irregular area of thicker tissue having a lumpy or ridge-like surface . You might also feel tiny bead-like masses scattered throughout the breasts . <p> Your breasts may feel tender , swollen , and full with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch with a burning sensation . This discomfort is normal and does not indicate the presence of disease . For some women , the pain is so severe that they can not exercise or lie on their stomachs . Fibrocystic changes usually occur in both breasts , most often in the upper outer quadrant and the underside of the breast where most of the milk-producing glands are located . <h> Why Does This Happen ? <p> Fibrocystic changes are associated with hormonal shifts in estrogen and progesterone , which affect the breast tissue . During the menstrual cycle , the breasts swell as the milk glands and ducts enlarge and the breasts retain water . After menstruation , the breast swelling goes down and the breasts return to normal . <p> Fibrocystic changes generally begin when women are in their 20s or 30s and usually last until menopause . For a small number of women , the condition worsens over the years , causing constant pain and lumpiness . In general , some of the lumps become permanent and may or may not shrink after menopause . <h> Breast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their breasts . A cyst is a fluid-filled sac that is usually smooth , firm , movable , and sometimes tender . The cyst will generally enlarge before the menstrual period and shrink afterwards . A large cyst may be round and feel like an eyeball when pressed with the eyelid closed . <p> If you are concerned about a lump , your healthcare provider can determine whether or not it warrants further attention . Determining whether a lump is a cyst or something more serious can be determined by a simple office procedure known as fine needle aspiration . A fine-gauge needle is inserted into the lump and fluid is withdrawn . <p> If the lump is a cyst , it will collapse once the fluid is removed . If there is concern about the lump , a needle biopsy or a surgical biopsy can be done . <h> Treatment <p> While there is no definitive , medically proven treatment for breast pain caused by fibrocystic changes , there are various remedies that may be helpful . <p> For some women , avoiding foods and beverages containing caffeine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinks , may help to alleviate the discomfort . Women who stop smoking may notice that their lumps decrease as well . <p> Aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers , as well as heat application can relieve uncomfortable symptoms , as does wearing a bra that provides firm support . In serious cases , oral contraceptives " which change the hormonal balance in your body " can lessen fibrocystic changes . For severe cases , a synthetic form of the hormone androgen , may be prescribed . However , many women find that the side effects , including weight gain , hair growth , and voice changes , are more distressing than the fibrocystic discomfort . <h> Fibrocystic Changes and Breast Cancer <p> There is no correlation between fibrocystic changes and breast cancer . However , fibrocystic changes can make it more difficult to detect breast cancer .

@@45665607 @5665607/ <h> Spinal Fusion <h> Definition <p> A spinal fusion is a surgery to weld together two or more vertebrae .

All fusion surgeries include the use of a graft that is made of bone material . It stimulates healing and encourages the two bones to heal together into one solid bone . The graft may be a piece of bone from the hip , a piece of bone from a cadaver , or artificial bone material . <h> Reasons for Procedure <p> Spinal nerves exit the spine between the vertebrae .

Metal screws and plates may then be placed on the outside of the vertebra to help stabilize the bones . There are 3 types of interbody fusion based on the approach to the area : <p> Posterior lumbar interbody fusion ( PLIF ) " the incision is made in the back . To access the spinal bones , the surgeon must move muscles and nerves out of the way . Part of the spinal bone covering the spinal column , called the lamina , may be removed so the surgeon can access the area between the vertebra .

The cage is inserted through the front part of the spine . No surgery is done on the outside of the vertebra . <p> Another option called posterolateral fusion starts the fusion on the outer surface of the vertebra . An incision is made in the back . The muscles are pushed aside to access the vertebra . Damaged bone and structures may be removed to relieve pressure on spinal nerves .

Cardiologists with the Wellmont CVA Heart Institute- discovered a blockage of more than 90 percent in one of his heart arteries . <p> Undergoing a cardiac catheterization procedure at Holston Valley Medical Center , Neely immediately received a stent , which restored proper blood flow . He soon returned to work and resumed his beloved hobby of running . <p> What saved Neely was not chest pain or a helpful family member or friend noticing something was amiss . Instead , it was a simple test called HeartSHAPE-- that showed he had an exceedingly high level of coronary calcium in his left anterior descending aorta . A blockage in this artery has been nicknamed a " widow maker " because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a cardiologist . <p> Neely recognizes the value of taking this test . <p> " It 's extremely important , " Neely said . " I 've told friends of mine who are runners that the calcium score was the key to my learning about my condition . I would n't have found out otherwise . I would highly recommend getting that test because it can save your life . " <p> A painless and noninvasive test that takes less than five minutes , HeartSHAPE- produces pictures of the coronary arteries using a 64-slice computed tomography scanner . From those images , medical professionals calculate a calcium score , with 0 as the desired number . Neely 's was more than 1,000 . <p> " We 're pleased to add locations for this test because of its ability to detect a potential health issue with a person 's heart when he or she otherwise might not have known , " said Dr. Jerry Blackwell , a board-certified cardiologist and the heart institute 's president . " We encourage anyone who is at risk of developing heart disease to strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Eddie 's story is quite poignant in illustrating how heart disease can affect you when you least expect it . That 's why it 's been so important for us to establish multiple sites where this test is available .

He renewed that resolution every year and embarked on an impressive regimen that included several marathons , including the Boston Marathon in 1993 . <p> He even tried to convince his cardiologist and wife to let him run the day of his cardiac catheterization and the day after the procedure to keep the streak alive . They did not believe that was the best choice for his health , so the streak ended . <p> Neely also rode a bicycle , was an outdoor enthusiast and lifted weights . Because of his active lifestyle out of the office , he did not monitor what he ate . <p> His mother and father did not have heart disease , but some of his uncles on both sides of his family had died of a heart attack .

" Everyone on the executive team at Alpha was amazed because I was fit and trim and leading a pretty healthy life . " <p> If Neely has any regret about his heart health journey , it is not taking another HeartSHAPE- test for five years . He participated in a physical in 2009 as part of Wellmont Health System 's executive health program that included the HeartSHAPE- test . He was stunned by the score of more than 1,000 believing he had taken necessary precautions to address the potential for heart disease . <p> After that test , Dr. Larry Cox , another heart institute cardiologist , ordered a nuclear stress test . Dr. Cox discovered the bottom part of Neely 's heart was not getting enough blood flow after exercise , leading to the catheterization and the stent . <p> These days , Neely is enjoying a more leisurely pace .

The driver might have diabetes and be experiencing a complication with the disease that is impacting his or her ability to drive properly . <p> The event was held the day before the flag drops on the inaugural Drive to Stop Diabetes 300 presented by Lilly Diabetes at the speedway . <p> Wellmont developed the Diabetes Alert sticker , which is placed on a rear window and helps officers know they need to check whether the driver is having difficulties with diabetes instead of driving impaired .

@@45665882 @5665882/ <h> Prostate Screening Choices <p> Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States . It is a cancer of the prostate gland , which is only found in men . This gland sits below the bladder . In most cases , men with prostate cancer are over 65 years of age , but it can occur in younger men . <p> In its early stages , prostate cancer has no symptoms . It is often a slow-growing cancer . In fact , it may take years to develop . As the cancer gets larger or spreads , it may cause problems . This may include impotence , urinary problems , and pain in your back , hip , or thighs . To help detect cancer in its early stages , your doctor may recommend a prostate specific antigen test ( PSA ) and a digital rectal exam ( DRE ) . <h> PSA Test <p> The United States Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) and the American Academy of Family Physicians ( AAFP ) do not recommend PSA tests to screen for prostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the American Urological Association , recommend that it be a decision a man can make after discussing the risks and benefits with his doctor .

It is important to know your history , your family 's history , your risk , and your comfort level . <p> PSA is made by the prostate gland . A PSA test measures the level of the antigen in your blood . It is done with a sample of blood , which can be taken at your doctor 's office during a regular physical exam . It is normal for healthy males to have some PSA in their blood . Levels sometimes increase when prostate cancer is present . There are other conditions which may increase the PSA .

Further testing would need to be done to find the cause . <p> Prostate cancer does not always increase PSA levels . A test that shows normal levels does not mean you are cancer-free . Do not ignore symptoms common to prostate cancer because you had a normal PSA test . This could lead to a delay in treatment . <h> Digital Rectal Exam <p> The digital rectal exam ( DRE ) may be done during a routine physical exam . The prostate gland lies next to the rectal wall . Normally , the prostate is roughly the size of a walnut . The doctor will use a gloved finger to feel the prostate through the rectum . This exam is done to find lumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> The DRE may not be able to determine if the lump is cancerous or not .

This could lead to delays in treatment . <h> Next Steps <h> Further Testing <p> Based on the results of one or both tests , your doctor may recommend a prostate biopsy . A needle is used to remove a sample of the prostate . The sample will then be examined under a microscope for cancer cells .

Your age , cancer risk factors , DRE , and PSA results will all play a role in treatment decisions . One option is to simply wait and monitor changes in the cancer . The PSA levels can be used to track any changes . <p> Some may be uncomfortable with having untreated cancer . However , cancer treatments have risks of their own . Treatments may cause impotence or trouble with leakage of urine . <h> Decision-Making <p> The benefit of a screening test is measured through its ability to save lives .
