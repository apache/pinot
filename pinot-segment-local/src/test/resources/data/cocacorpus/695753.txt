This was covered very quickly with tons of silt ( silt is earth washed from higher ground ) that compressed the plant , people and animal matter and over time formed the coal and some of the crude oil we use today . <p> As you can see , this was stored energy from the sun that produced the coal and some of the crude oil . This stored energy is not going to last much longer at current usage rates . We regard these energy resources as a non-renewable energy . <p> In the Bible God promised never to flood the earth again and gave us a sign , the rainbow . Read Genesis chapters 6 to 9 for an accurate account of what , why and how it happened ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> We can find out more effective ways to use the sun 's energy right now ! Encourage each other to use stored energy more wisely and start looking after our precious environment . How can we do this ? <p> There are so many ways we can save stored energy and one of the most important ways , is to capture the energy that 's going to waste . What 's that ? ' SOLAR ENERGY ' ! 
@@83566106 @5066106/ 187101 @qwx807101 <h> Method 4 - The Context Support Method <p> When your students are just learning to read it is important to choose books that really interest them . If boys like cars , choose a book with pictures and simple words about cars . This will keep their interest and they will enjoy learning with you . If girls like dolls , obtain a book with doll pictures and simple words . Again it will encourage enthusiasm because they are actually looking at something they can relate to <p> Some books are especially written to support this method of learning . You will find a longer sentence on one side of the page while the other side has a single word or maybe two to three words for your student to read . You will read the longer sentence while your student reads the simpler version . <p> You may like to try this method of long and short text or maybe combine it with one or all of the other methods above . The debate still rages among educators , parents , and experts . Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only you can answer and it comes with practice and experience . <p> Most children learn to read reasonably well between the ages of four and eight . Check the following 10 point checklist , which was originally written for parents to help ascertain if students are heading in the right direction . <p> 1 . Do you read regularly with your child ? ( five or six days a week ) <p> 2 . Do you give your child time to browse through a book before attempting to read it ? <p> 3 . Do you show confidence in your child 's abilities ? Your lack of confidence may affect your child 's ability to read . <p> 4 . Do n't tell your child you are worried about his/her reading progress . This will only fuel your child 's problem . Discuss with your partner or other homeschool parent for advice . <p> 7 . Are you always rushed ? Do you give your child enough time to read or write ? <p> 8 . Do you provide opportunities for your child to write ? Such as shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or relatives , the child 's own name at the bottom of a letter or card you have written . <p> 9 . Are you using books at the correct level . Use easy books to encourage your child 's abilities , making sure it is not too easy or you will undermine your child 's confidence in him/herself . Do n't choose books too hard , that also may undermine your child 's confidence in him/herself . <p> 10 . If you do all the above and you are still worried , your child 's hearing or eye sight may have something to do with the reading problem . Visit your doctor for a check-up because hearing or eyesight could affect his/her ability to learn .

@@83566135 @5066135/ 187101 @qwx807101 <h> Unschooling Method Good or Not So Good <p> Many homeschool families have adopted and some continue to adopt the unschooling method so aptly named by a school teacher from Boston because he considered that the confinement and rigid process of the then present day traditional schooling was not working for him or his students . John Holt developed the idea that children needed to avoid most if not all negative things that traditional schooling and traditional classroom learning imposed upon students . In short , the method of unschooling entails avoiding anything a child considers negative for him or her ( in the learning environment ) and strengthen only those things that are perceived as positive . What that is saying to me is that apparently only those things a student considers as positive would promote learning and increase student knowledge . <p> The philosophy behind the unschooling method is simply that the child only needs to learn what interests him or her at the time rather than following a predetermined curriculum devised by the parent or some other third party . Parents desires evidently do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn mathematics , homeschool parents simply do n't  need to do this at this stage as the childs interest is not there yet . But when will it be there ? Will a child automatically develop an interest for maths at any stage during his or her school years ? What if that does n't  happen ? <p> Perhaps we then have a problem called dyscalculia or in simple terminology , a math disability . Or perhaps worse , we encourage our children to become libertines ! Isnt that what homeschooling is all about ? Avoiding all those nasties ? So if we encourage children to solely use the unschooling method , I wonder if parents are encouraging a libertine philosophy to grow within their children . Unbeknown to the parents they may encourage the attitude of Do What Thou Wilt an Aleister Crowley philosophy . <p> Now Crowley , who by the way was also bisexual , a recreational drug user , a social critic , against moral and religious values and also known as " the wickedest man in the world " promoted a form of libertinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> A libertine is one who has no or very little moral restraints . Evidently , those moral restraints are regarded as not required and detrimental to ones development . Libertines ignore accepted morals and forms of behaviour valued by society in general . They simply place value on physical pleasures , meaning those experienced through the senses . <p> Is that what unschooling promotes ? Learn What Thou Wilt ? <p> Remember . according to the unschooling method only those things a student considers as positive would promote learning and increase student knowledge . <p> Ok let 's unschool ! Only let the children learn what they wish at any given stage . By doing so , would homeschool parents provide adequate opportunities for their children to learn about a wide range of topics ? Do parents provide a learning environment for children to develop beyond their personal interests ? Will those children have the ability to learn anything else besides cow , cats , chickens , dogs and vegies ? Will those children grow up to understand basic mathematical concepts , or understand whether the world is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth or the other way round ? <p> Unschooling is just one method and should definitely not be used as a standalone method . Children need guidance . Guidance can only come from someone who has more knowledge , in this case the parent . If a parent can not provide the expertise for their child in a given learning area then they should find a person who can and of course make sure that person is safe to work with their child . <p> Parents need to guide their children so they can develop their learning and become intelligent , law abiding citizens who can contribute to personal family life and society . I do n't  think Learn What Thou Wilt philosophy is going to cut it . It is as good as Aleister Crowleys philosophy of " Do What Thou Wilt . " Perhaps that 's why so many children have grown up to be frustrated adults . <p> According to wikipedia information , Holt 's philosophy was simple : " ... the human animal is a learning animal ; we like to learn ; we are good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how or made to do it . What kills the processes are the people interfering with it or trying to regulate it or control it . " <p> Wow , if that statement is true then from a Godly point of view it is one of the most devastating statements any homeschooling parent could adopt . First were animals , which is ok from an evolution point of view but definitely not from a Christian point of view . <p> Secondly , yes most people like to learn but we may not necessarily be good at it therefore we often need help with what we learn . Not all the time but as children I would say we need help from someone more experienced . <p> Thirdly , most of us need to be shown how to do certain things . Perhaps John Holt was an exception to the rule and needed to be taught absolutely nothing , however most people need someone else to show how certain things are accomplished . <p> Fourthly , we should not be made to do it . What kind of a statement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things or you 'll find those children out of control doing what they want , how they want it , when they want and telling you or rather yelling why they want it . <p> Finally , Holt finishes by stating that those interfering with the process of learning are killing learning opportunities for children because they regulate or control the process of learning . <p> If that includes teaching literacy and numeracy to children as young as three , four , five and even fifteen years of age then I 'm guilty . Yes , I 'm guilty of interfering with childrens development . I taught them to read and write Im doomed . I taught them something they should have taught themselves . I controlled their learning process by introducing one letter a day so they could master the alphabet , ABC and their first reading book within months . With that said , I had the joy of hearing them read and they had the joy of being able to read , and now many years down the track they have become highly skilled adults . <p> Perhaps if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many homeschoolers have adopted his philosophy and I have seen firsthand the disasters that it has dealt out ; a thirteen year old illiterate child , an eleven year old rebel , a nine year old at Kindergarten level and the list goes on . <p> Unschooling sounds great but when one delves into the true meaning of this method one needs to consider what they are embarking upon . Have we fought so long and hard to provide freedom for our children or to enslave them back into the bondage of illiteracy and ignorance ? <p> In 1980 Holt stated : " I want to make it clear that I do n't  see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools . I think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education . Home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were . " <p> And with part of that statement I would have to agree . Home is the best place to learn however , sometimes children need a different place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of learning . If parents are not patient enough or if they think they are incapable of teaching their children school is not all that bad . <p> Self-directed learning should be encouraged but not at the expense of a child not being able to read or write properly . The unschooling method adopted by many unsuspecting , first time , homeschooling parents can become a stumbling block for their childs future learning .

It 's surprising what you can achieve if you set your mind to it . Did you know that learning to draw what you see gives you the joy of achievement in art ? <p> It is said that drawing is logical and the ability to draw what you see is a simple , logical process . You have to develop your observation skills so you can draw two and three dimensional objects . <p> Just a tip ... when you draw try moving your whole arm not just your fingers or wrist . Most professional artists use their entire arm even when drawing something small . By moving just your fingers and wrist your whole arm will soon begin to ache . It is much better to use your whole arm from the shoulder down with smooth , unrestricted motions . <p> Begin drawing with big , simple shapes without worrying about precise lines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those personal details . <h> But before you can start drawing you 'll need the ' basics ' . <p> Choose whichever paper you prefer or can easily obtain . <p> Experiment with a variety of pencils , charcoal or chalks . <p> Try to create the illusion of depth . <p> Draw shades of grey to create contrast in your drawing . <p> Learn to draw simple geometric shapes by drawing almost anything . Even landscapes can be drawn as cubes , cylinders , cones and spheres . <p> Start with a few basic lines then add more complex details when you are happy with the basic lines . <h> Draw using these four basic steps . <p> Identify geometric shapes . <p> Create realistic contours . <p> Use shadows . <p> Add all details . <h> Identify your pencils . <p> When we talk about pencils , we usually mean graphite pencil . Artists ' pencils are roughly divided into two groups - Soft &amp; Hard . A soft pencil will make a darker line than a hard pencil . Soft pencils are marked B plus a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blacker than 2B . <p> Hard pencils are marked H plus a number . 3H is harder and makes a paler line than 2H . HB pencils are considered an all-purpose pencil because it is between hard and soft . Artists usually use more soft pencils than hard pencils . <p> If you want to buy a range of pencils , buy a full range of soft ones from HB to 6B . Cylindrical graphite sticks are also available in various thicknesses to fit into plastic or metal holders . You can also buy rectangular graphite sticks which will make broad lines . <h> Chalk <p> A black pastel pencil or Conte Pencil is a cylindrical stick of black chalk and like the normal graphite pencil it has a wood casing . After you 've tried chalk in pencil form you may like to try the rectangular black stick of hard pastel or Conte crayon . You can also try the cylindrical sticks of black chalk that fit into plastic or metal holders . <h> Charcoal <p> When trying charcoal for the first time buy hard , medium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HB to 6B . HB is the hardest , 6B the softest . Also try a few sticks of natural charcoal leads which fit into metal or plastic holders . Excellent for experimenting light and dark shades . Also try charcoal from a fire place or burned log . Tribal artists in some countries have used this type of charcoal for many years and produced lovely results . Try charcoal drawing on a different medium besides paper . <h> Erasers <p> For pencil drawing , the usual eraser is soft rubber either pink or white . If you want to erase a chalk or charcoal drawing you use a kneaded rubber ( or putty rubber ) . A kneaded rubber comes in the shape of a small block which you can squeeze or knead like clay into whichever shape you desire . There is also , what is called a blocky soap eraser which is useful for cleaning up the white areas of your drawing . <h> Paper <p> Ordinary white paper is great to start with but you really should experiment with different types of paper . Charcoal paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your lines look rough but you can blend your strokes to create blended tones . Ask your art supplier to show you some different types of paper , buy a few sheets of each type and have fun experimenting with these different mediums . Try cartridge paper , litho paper , tracing paper and water-colour paper . Some papers yellow and crumble over time and if you intend to keep your drawings for years and years you should use a good quality paper . Few papers are still made of ' rags ' ( as in the last century ) but some manufacturers still use the term " 100% rag " to indicate durable paper made from chemically pure cellulose fibers . <h> Bits and Pieces <p> You may find a wooden drawing board to support your drawing pad handy . Or try a soft fibreboard to which you can tack your loose sheets of paper . You may need a retractable single edge razor or sharp knife for sharpening your drawing tools but be careful not to cut yourself . A sandpaper pad for shaping your drawing tools is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets to your fibreboard . Also a ' stomp ' for blending tones and a spray can of fixative . This is a very thin varnish which keeps your drawings from smudging . <h> Your Work Area <p> You should always have good light when drawing . Natural light is often the best . When using a lamp it should be on your left if you 're right handed so your hand wo n't cast a shadow on your drawing paper . Reverse of course if you are left handed . Always store your pencils points up in a jar so the tips do n't get damaged . Store chalk , charcoal and other drawing sticks in a shallow box or tray with handy compartments . This can be good for storing pencils as well . Keep erasers in a separate small box to keep them clean . There is nothing worse than erasing part of your drawing with a smudged eraser and ruining your hard work .

Wow that 's a mouthful , this statement says a lot but are these stated outcomes being achieved for the majority of students within the education system ?

While that day her child did a two hour cooking class . <p> Her analogy of this was ... she should be teaching the fun things like learning to prepare food to her child , while the teachers teach the more complex subject of mathematics . I would have to agree , but as our educational administrators dump more stated outcomes , the less time teachers have to spend on the more important subjects like literacy .
