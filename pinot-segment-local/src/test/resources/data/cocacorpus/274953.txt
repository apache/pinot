@@100319778 @4519778/ <h> Six Questions to Ask Before Selecting an E-Signature Platform <p> As technology continues to transform the way we work , more offices are trying to make the move to become truly paperless . E-signatures help keep a document 's workflow in the digital realm and can improve efficiency and security , giving you peace of mind that your company 's " and clients ' " information is safe . But unfortunately not all e-signature platforms are created equal , so it 's important to delve into specifics so you can select the option that best meets your needs . <p> Here are six questions to ask potential e-signature vendors : <h> 1 . Can I ensure that a document has n't been altered or tampered with after each signature ? <p> Some e-signature solutions offer a feature called tamper evidence , which allows you to see if an e-signed document has been altered , but varying technologies handle this in different ways . When looking for an e-signature partner with top-notch security , ask if its tamper-evident technology tracks everything from the moment the transaction begins , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process . <p> For legal certainty , it makes sense to make the document tamper evident after each individual initial and signature versus waiting until all signatures are complete . The technology should highlight any unauthorized attempted changes . The document 's integrity can be easily defended when you can prove that the first signer did n't alter the document before it was sent to the second signer . <p> Some platforms have the added option of making the document tamper-proof , preventing any modifications to the document once it has been completed . <h> 2 . How comprehensive is the audit trail ? <p> There is a wide variance in the amount of detail recorded by different e-signature platforms . The most secure e-signatures come with a granular audit trail that tracks and logs every element of the entire process , including : <p> The date and time a document was submitted <p> The signers ' consents <p> Opt-outs or cancellations <p> The IP address of each signer <p> The precise time each signature and initial was made <p> The issuing of digital certificates <p> Many more details <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence behind it to stand up to scrutiny in court . <h> 3 . Will I need to rely on the provider to prove the legality of the signature ? <p> Detailed information from tamper-evident technology and audit trails comes in handy when defending against attempts to repudiate , or contest , a transaction . But what good is this information if you ca n't access it ? <p> Look for an e-signature partner that allows you to verify signatures independently . That means you want the evidence of a digital signature to be permanently embedded into the signed document . An independent e-signature platform has technology that uses published standards and public key infrastructure ( PKI ) to prove that documents are valid and unchanged . The bottom line is that you own the evidence , so you can access it anytime " even years after the transaction took place . <p> That is not the case with most electronic signatures , which are tied to proprietary standards and require relying parties to go back to the vendor 's website to retrieve information about the signature . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 10 years when you need to prove a signature in court ? Or what if the vendor 's server goes down or the vendor goes out of business ? Or what if you simply want to change to another vendor ? You would n't have the necessary evidence to prove that your documents are valid . <h> 4 . Does the platform meet industry compliance ? <p> In addition to meeting ESIGN and UETA e-signature requirements , it may be - important to investigate if your potential e-signature platform complies with regulatory standards relevant to your industry , including : <p> Be sure to look into compliance needs and potential issues before picking an e-signature solution . <h> 5 . Can I be sure that only authorized persons receive , view , and sign documents ? <p> To ensure that your documents do n't get in the wrong hands , make sure your e-signature partner uses at least two factors of authentication . For example , a basic version of multi-factor authentication combines something you know , like a password , with something you have , like an SMS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forms contain more sensitive information than others , so you may need higher levels of authentication , based on the level of risk involved . There are a few other ways to prove your signers ' identities , including : <p> Email-only authentication : A user clicks on a link in an email he receives , which takes the user to the transaction . <p> Shared questions : A users answers personal questions that the sender has the answers to , such as the signer 's account number . <p> Knowledge-based authentication ( KBA ) : A user is prompted to input her date of birth and the last four digits of her social security number . When answered correctly , she 's then given a set of multiple-choice questions , which she must answer correctly to enter the transaction . <p> Generally , the more stringent the authentication requirements are , the more defensible the e-signature is . <p> A number of e-signature services have this capability , but the catch is looking at the level of integration . Most simply link users from one application " like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few go a step further and allow you to customize the e-signing process to match their own branding , which helps you tie the look of the two platforms together . <p> Even better is a partner who can provide true integration . That means the e-signature solution is fully customized to match the look and feel of your company 's existing technology , creating a seamless and comfortable signing experience for your customers . <p> It 's important to be informed and understand what you 're looking for when searching for an e-signature service .

And its something her husband is desperate to rectify , so that other families do n't  have to endure the same pain and suffering . <p> Elliot Choueka <p> Rosie and Elliot after getting married in 2004. - <p> Rosie was 37 years old when she found a lump on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary breast cancer . <p> " It turned out that she had triple negative breast cancer , which is very rare and one of the most aggressive forms , " says Elliot . <p> " When we got the news , we asked lots of questions . I ca n't remember if we cried there and then but I know that I cried when we got in the car to call her parents afterwards . <p> " The intention was that I would call her parents to tell them the news because I thought it would be too hard for Rosie. - But I was the one who broke down and she had to tell her parents . " <p> Following her diagnosis , Rosie had a lumpectomy followed by chemotherapy sessions which ran from August until November 2014. - Some of the sessions would last for between eight and nine hours . <p> " That was a pretty horrible thing to see her go through . It 's debilitating , " says Elliot. - " The irony of most cancers is that it 's the treatment that makes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously if you leave it then it will make you very i 'll but it was the treatment that laid her so low . " <p> Elliot Choueka <p> Elliott and Rosies children , Natalie , 8 , and Joseph , 5 . <p> Elliot says telling their children that Rosie had cancer was extremely difficult. - Their youngest son Joseph was born profoundly deaf and was just four years old when Rosie was diagnosed. - Their older daughter Natalie was seven , but still too young to fully understand what was going on . <p> " We did n't say anything to the children initially , " explains Elliot. - " Joseph was very little . We told Natalie that mummy was n't very well , that she was going to have an operation and that she was going to have a drug , chemo , that would make her feel very i 'll and that her hair might fall out . <p> " We did n't use the word cancer ' . " <p> Elliot was unsure how to help his wife , so he called Breast Cancer Cares helpline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , ultimately , what helped him was that Rosie was completely accepting of her situation and that she had researched everything thoroughly. - <p> " There was no denial that she had this disease , " he says . " It was something to deal with : she had the treatment , she carried on working , she did n't want to bury her head in the sand but equally she wanted normality . " <p> After finishing her primary treatment , Rosie was given the " thumbs up " from her oncologist and breast surgeon . She was finally getting better . <p> But five days later she found another lump and was back in hospital . She underwent a series of tests and was met with devastating results the cancer had spread to her liver , she had secondary breast cancer . <p> Her next course of treatment was chemotherapy but a more intense cycle . <p> " It was a pretty tough regime , " says Elliot . " I think it was after about six rounds of this type of chemo that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been put on this regime had only managed one cycle and she had done six . <p> " She was adamant that she was going to get through this . " <p> Her chemotherapy sessions started before Christmas 2014 . The treatment was working to shrink the cancer however it was having a negative impact on her blood count , which was constantly dropping. - <p> As a result , Rosie had blood transfusions to try and boost everything , but it was n't enough . <p> " Her oncologist explained to her that she needed to come off chemo because if she did n't , it would kill her , " Elliot explains . <p> Elliot Choeuka <p> Elliot , Rosie and their two children Natalie and Joseph . <p> By this point , the couple had started to " lay the ground " to their children that Rosie might die . <p> She was accepted to have SIRT treatment , a special type of radiotherapy that targeted the cancer in her liver . But to have the treatment she had to stop having chemotherapy . <p> During a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday to Israel. - It was during this time that Rosie became desperately unwell . - <p> " A couple of days into the holiday she said she had a stomach bug , but was adamant she did n't need to go to the doctors , " explains Elliot. - <p> As the holiday went on , she became more and more unwell. - <p> " It 's only when I look back at the photos that I realise just how ill she was , " - says Elliot. - <p> On 31 May 2015 , the family returned from their holiday and on 1 June , Rosie went to hospital and her breast surgeon immediately asked to admit her. - Rosie insisted she was okay to go back home , but by Tuesday morning she was on a morphine drip. - <p> " From that point on it was a slow decline , " Elliot recalls . " She was displaying really odd symptoms . She fell when she went to the toilet and when she 'd try to drink something her arms would n't hold themselves up properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cancer had spread to her brain which is what she was most fearful of . But they did a brain scan and it turned out that the toxins in her blood were overwhelming her body , as her liver had given up , and the liver is responsible for cleaning the blood . " <p> On the following Friday , Rosie was transferred from hospital to the Marie Curie hospice in Hampstead . <p> " I remember we were in the ambulance going from the hospital to the hospice , and she was really bright and awake and we were talking , " Elliot recalls. - " She said how ironic it was because we were going back to the place where we met that our life together would end where it started . " <p> In her final moments , Rosie was on very strong medication and was sleeping a lot . It was at this point that Elliot had to explain to their children that " mummy was going to die " . <p> He recalls : " The last time they saw Rosie was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart to tell them that this would be the last time they 'd see her. - <p> " That day I made them say goodbye to her , but obviously they would n't have understood what that meant . " <p> Five days after the childrens final hospital visit , Rosie passed away. - <p> " I 'd called Natalie in the morning to say , have a good day at school ' and I asked her if she had any messages for mummy and she said , give her a kiss ' , " says Elliot , who was staying at the hospice with Rosie . <p> " I went back to her room , gave her a kiss and she kissed me back . About five minutes later she 'd gone . " <p> Elliot Choueka <p> The familys final photo together. - <p> In the months leading to her death , Rosie ensured that measures were put in place for when she was gone. - <p> " She left me three letters . One was a four-page letter of what to do immediately after she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elliot . <p> " She left me a letter which was filled with her memories of our life together and she also wrote a letter about which of her precious possessions were to go to friends and family . <p> " She had put together memory boxes for the children and she had also started writing birthday cards for the children . She bought 20 years worth but had only managed to write cards for their next three birthdays . <p> " She requested she wanted me to be buried next to her . She told me how she wanted the children to be brought up . She said she wanted me to find a wife and not be alone. - She was entirely selfless . " <p> Perhaps most importantly to her , Rosie had asked Elliot to set up a charity to raise money for secondary breast cancer research . <p> In the wake of her death , Elliot began work on setting up the charity , while juggling copious amounts of life admin , managing two young children and working full-time as head of creative for Experion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of . <p> The charitys purpose is to channel funding into secondary breast cancer research and raise awareness of the illness . <p> Kris Hallenga , the founder of Coppa Feel , was diagnosed with secondary breast cancer seven years ago. - She says lack of public understanding surrounding secondary breast cancer is a huge issue that needs to be addressed. - <p> " We often hear advanced , metastatic , stage 4 and secondary and guess what ? They all mean the same thing . And they all eventually lead to death , " she tells HuffPost UK . <p> " Cancer that is found in one area and which stays in that one area , for example your breast , does n't  kill you . It 's when it spreads to your organs and grows to a size that stops your vital organs working that it becomes life-threatening . " <p> She says : - " When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer there was a sense of urgency , that my breast would be removed and I would be fine. - Within a week we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatically , it switched from let 's cure this to let 's see how long we can keep you here . <p> " It 's not just an increase in money going towards secondary research that is needed , but also a change in attitude . Seven years on and I am still here and so are thousands of others living- with cancer every day . <p> " The sooner the public are educated about secondary cancer , the better . " - <p> Katie Goates is the senior research communications officer for Breast Cancer Now . She explains that the difficulty with secondary breast cancer is that secondary tumours do n't get operated on , which means researchers do n't have access to tumours to do experiments with . <p> She says that in order to tackle secondary breast cancer , there are a number of questions that need answering : For example , how do we stop it spreading in the first place and stop it becoming secondary breast cancer at all ? Even when it does spread , some people have cancer cells that lie dormant and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , secondary cancers are very good at becoming resistant to treatment after a period of time . We need to get to the bottom of why this happens . " <p> There 's a long way to go before we can begin to save the lives of people with secondary breast cancer . But hopefully , with the help of Secondary1st , this will fast become a reality . <p> While the death of his wife has caused Elliot an indescribable amount of pain over the past year , he now insists that its time to move forward. - <p> " You slowly get used to the absence . She 's still there , but she 's not there , " he says . <p> Rosie was the sort of person that got on with anyone . She was a people person . She was incredibly clever but she never made you feel small . <p> " She was a great mother , a great daughter , a great wife and a fantastically successful lawyer . " <p> The most important thing for him now is to keep living life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to never let the children forget who their mother was . <p> " Natalie asks me every single night to tell her a story about mummy , " he explains . <p> " I 've got hundreds of photos of Rosie , so I 'll randomly pick one out and we 'll look at it , and I 'll tell her where it was and what we were doing . She wo n't go to sleep without me telling her stories . " <p> He adds : " Rosie will always be around in the photos and videos and memories. - She will never leave our lives . "

@@100319836 @4519836/ <h> Murnane Brandt 's Journey to a Virtual Desktop Infrastructure <p> I 'm the IT manager for Murnane Brandt , a nationally recognized law firm founded in 1940 that 's known for its- successful complex litigation practice and strong business department . Our headquarters are in St. Paul , Minnesota , and we have branch offices in Bismarck , North Dakota and Hudson , Wisconsin . <p> With more than 80 attorneys and staff , our goal is- to provide desktops that are more- reliable and easier to support , while also reducing the risk of sensitive client information being lost or stolen . In addition , we wanted to support our users ' growing needs for mobility and device flexibility to maximize productivity and client service . <p> A Virtual Desktop Infrastructure ( VDI ) based on technology from Unidesk , VMware , - and Nimble Storage enabled us to centralize our desktops in our own private cloud . We 've been running VDI for over two years , and we 're 100% virtualized . Since deployment , we have seen improved IT efficiency , data security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we did it . <h> The Journey to VDI <p> The servers at Murnane Brandt had been virtualized for several years using VMware vSphere . But with our PCs overdue for a refresh , Windows XP coming to its end-of-life , and attorneys and staff pushing for Bring Your Own Device ( BYOD ) support , we started looking into virtual desktops . <p> The more we researched VDI , the more we thought it was the right avenue to pursue . Cost-wise it was a wash compared to constantly refreshing PCs , but the security , mobility , and management advantages of VDI made going virtual an easy decision . <p> One of our goals was to make the user experience so seamless that our attorneys and staff would n't notice the difference between virtual and physical . We had decided on VMware Horizon to help provide this seamless user experience . But we needed a management solution that would make it easy for our two-person IT shop to provision desktops , deliver applications , patch images , maintain personalization , and do fast break/fix . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had been researching how to deliver our apps and was struggling with some of the issues with traditional application virtualization technology . In my searches , I saw videos of Unidesk and how their new layering approach to app delivery was fast and easy , while giving the experience of a local install . That 's just what we wanted . <p> Once we implemented Unidesk in our environment , it made- it easy for us to deliver the many different applications required by our staff , without the image management challenges that have traditionally made patching and updating Windows and applications inefficient . <p> Unidesk has greatly simplified the day-to-day management of desktops and applications at- Murnane Brandt . Most applications are packaged as a Unidesk layer so they can be updated separately from the Windows 7 Gold OS layer . Unlike traditional application virtualization , which isolates apps in their own protective bubbles , Unidesk 's layered apps act like they are locally installed so there are no interoperability issues . <p> With Unidesk , it 's easy to deliver new applications and apply updates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then we can assign it to any desktop . Layering has saved me many times ; if a certain app is having problems , I just click on the desktop , tell the app to reinstall itself , and 10 minutes later it 's working again . <p> The same goes for personalization layers . Our attorneys expect their desktops to remember where they left off so they do n't lose valuable time . The Unidesk personalization layer captures each user 's unique settings , documents , and plug-ins . If a desktop stops working , we just revert back to an earlier personalization layer snapshot and reboot . This simple step fixes whatever was causing the problem and recovers any lost information . We are even able to specify when and how often snapshots are taken as well as control how many snapshots are saved . For a small IT shop , this is an incredible time-saver . <h> Unexpected Branch Office and Remote Access Benefits <p> Opening a new office can often be a nightmare for IT . But with our VDI solution in place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient . When we opened our office in Bismarck , we had them up and running in just an hour without having to go- on-site . Instead , I only needed to preconfigure a router and ship it out with the other equipment . I was able to walk one of our attorneys through the VDI setup over the phone . <p> The Bismarck office virtual desktops were provisioned using Unidesk on the HP servers located in our St. Paul headquarters . All of the applications were quickly assigned by selecting from any of the 37 application layers . With the combination of Unidesk and VMware Horizon View , the user experience in Bismarck is no different than in our corporate headquarters in St. Paul . <p> VDI has also provided unexpected remote access benefits . For example , one of our attorneys had to travel to China for two weeks and was working remotely from a business traveler hotel . The other U.S. hotel guests were frustrated that they could n't access the resources they needed because of local Internet restrictions . However , our attorney seamlessly connected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access all of the applications and resources he needed to stay productive during his trip . <h> Conclusion <p> Since starting with Unidesk more than two years ago , we have seen desktop help requests decrease dramatically . Unidesk makes everything easier " desktop provisioning , Windows updates , app delivery , break/fix , and recovery . Unidesk 's layering approach to desktop management gives me the control I want and the experience our users expect and demand . It also makes it easy to customize any of our 80+ persistent virtual desktops with any application we need . It 's not often you find a solution that makes IT and end users so happy. - We 're glad we 've found one .
