@@27574075 @1274075/ <h> Share This <h> Why " Maundy " Thursday ? <p> Thursday of Holy Week is called " Maundy Thursday . " The name " Maundy " comes from the Latin " mandatum , " or " command , " and is the first word of the phrase " Mandatum novum do vobis ut diligatis invicem sicut dilexi vos " in English , " A new commandment I give you , that you love one another . " Jesus , speaking to his disciples , continues , " Just as I have loved you , you also should love one another " ( John 13:34 ) . <p> Jesus says these words during- his final meal with his disciples . For this reason , worship on Maundy Thursday is almost always a communion service and is , indeed , often used as an occasional on which to reflect on the nature and import of the Lords Supper . Which is a tad ironic . For while there is indeed a " last supper " recorded in Johns Gospel , there is no scene of the institution of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Jesus final meal with his disciples which is , importantly , a Passover meal he offers them instructions about how to commemorate this occasion and , indeed , his life and ministry , by instituting a new meal , even a new Passover meal . But in Johns Gospel , Jesus instead washes the feet of his- disciples in an unusual display of service , and perhaps even servitude ( which is why Peter objects ) and then commands them to do the same . Discipleship , in other words , is about service , about caring for others . And having set this example for them , he then adds- a new commandment to the Ten with which they were most familiar : to love one another . <p> Which raises an interesting question : can you command someone to love another person ? Isnt love beyond commands , discipline , the human will , or even logic ? <p> Not according to Jesus . For when he commands his disciples to love one another , he does not use- the Greek word- eros- that captures- passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) or the Greek- phileo of familial endearment and loyalty ( the root of Philadelphia , the city of " brotherly love " ) .

To care for and serve each other as he has cared for and served them . This kind of love because is more about behavior than emotion you can command . <p> And here , perhaps , is where the story John tells and the stories the other evangelists tell come together in our worship practice , as on Maundy Thursday we come together to remember Jesus sacrificial love for us and , indeed , Gods enormous sacrifice to witness the death of one child to save all the other children of God as perhaps best captured in the pouring out of his life that we remember in the Lords Supper in order that we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love one another . <p> Its an important night and worship service in the church years , as it draws us deeply into the heart of the biblical story , and so I hope you have a chance to celebrate it with- your local congregation .

Whereas technical competence and excellent managerial skills are highly valued traits of leaders during the long stretches of stability in between more tumultuous times of paradigm change , those very traits can greatly limit an organizations ability to adapt to new circumstances . <p> Why ? Simply because you cant- manage your way through a paradigm shift and knowing what you do n't  know rather than relying on what you do is absolutely essential to finding a new way forward in a vastly changed landscape . <p> Not that its bad to be technically competent or a good manager . Its simply that when these are the chief traits of an organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solid and reliable- set of skills that worked brilliantly during periods of stability rather than being willing to abandon skills and perspectives that no longer suffice . This is , essentially , the heart of adaptive leadership , the term and leadership perspective proposed- by Ron Heifetz in his outstanding book , Leadership Without Easy Answers . ( Heifetz distinguishes between technical change , - which- requires us to do things differently , and adaptive change , requires us to think differently about what we 're doing p. 22 . ) <p> Among the skills required of adaptive leaders , ones that are- often overlooked are the social skills of listening , caring , networking , and empowering . New York Times writer- David Brooks describes some of these in a recent column , naming them social courage : <p> In today 's loosely networked world , people with social courage have amazing value .

They are discriminating in their personal recommendations since character judgment is their primary currency . <p> Notice the emphasis here : listening rather than talking , connecting rather than ordering , building relationships rather than simply organizing people . This is the ability to create social capital because , living in a world in which we recognize that we really do n't  know the best way forward , we also recognize we wont get there alone .

@@27574158 @1274158/ <h> Related Posts <h> Share This <h> How Do We Define Competent Leadership ? <p> When I talk about making the move from what I describe as " performative leadership " to " formative leadership " ( as I did obliquely in last weeks Dear Partner letter ) , I regularly encounter a reaction as understandable as it is predictable . <p> First , let me say a little more about what I mean by these terms. - Performative- leadership is essentially leadership that focuses on- certain skills or practices that the leader has acquired through training and practice and now uses on behalf of the organization he or she is leading . In congregational ministry , these are often of the skills of preaching , teaching , pastoral care , and so forth . Performative leadership is about , quite literally , performing these practices well for the sake of the community. - Formative leadership , by contrast , is focused on training others in developing set of- skills that is useful to them and to the larger community . It is , again literally , focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you apply it to church leadership , because then it sounds like I 'm saying that congregational leaders should train others to preach and teach and offer pastoral care and the rest . And I cant mean that , can I ? <p> Actually , that is what I mean . And when people and particularly pastors ( though also folks in the congregation as well ) sense that , they offer a couple of incredibly understandable reactions almost always framed as questions : " Then what was all of our training for ? " " But did n't  we go ( or send our pastors ) to seminary precisely so that they would be the experts , the ones who know how to do this stuff right ? " <p> Two explanations that may help address these concerns and delve a bit more deeply , or at least more clearly , into what I mean by this shift from performative to formative leadership . First , I 'm not against expertise , I just think we need to deploy our expertise differently . In particular , I think we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " equipping the saints for the work of ministry " ( Eph. 4:12 ) . That 's what our training was for not simply to become great interpreters of Scripture in the pulpit , but through our preaching to help others interpret Scripture ; and not only to make great connections between the biblical story and our life story in our sermons , but through our preaching to help others do that in their daily lives and to be able share those connections with others . That is deploying expertise differently . <p> Second , formative leadership does n't  rule out , let alone negate , the value of performative tasks . There is a place for pastors to teach and preach and all the rest , so long as the primary goal is that , over time , those in the community will get better at these same skills themselves if not always preaching , at least interpreting Scripture and connecting it to daily life ; if not necessarily making hospital visits , certainly praying with and for others and extending Christian care . ( And , just for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this in their daily lives is to be invited actually to preach and make pastor visits from time to time ! ) <p> The key difference between performative and formative leadership is , I think , how we define competence . In performative leadership again focusing on congregational leadership as an example its about how good the pastor is at these central skills . In formative leadership , its about how much better the congregation becomes over time through the pastors leadership . <p> For me , a great example of this distinction comes from another profession : - coaching . Most coaches played the sport they now coach . But few of us care what kind of individual career they had ; we just want to know that when they are on the field or court their team plays better . Teachers are much the same , as are conductors of music groups . In each case , the mark of competence is n't that the leaders can perform some skill or practice , but that their community or organization or team was better because of their efforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was one other question that I regularly got ( this time only from pastors ) : " So now I 'm just a teacher or coach ? " <p> It took me a little while to figure out how to answer this one , but eventually I found this response helpful to me and my conversation partner . " I hear what you 're saying . Can you name for me the three most important and influential people in your life ? " After a moments thought , the person would begin to answer , then hesitate , and then smile , as it dawned on him or her that among those three was always a teacher or coach and often both . And , indeed , as I 've tried this response with others its become clear that teachers and coaches and guides and Scout masters and conductors and other " formative leaders " have played incredibly important roles in almost all of our lives . <p> And that 's the kind of leadership I think we need in the church and world right now . <h> 7 Comments <p> May26 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to teach someone else the skill of doing Gods work in their own unique way ?

We have to model honesty , faith , trust , vulnerability , compassion , forgiveness , healthy communication , etc as best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in honesty , faith , vulnerability , compassion <p> Thanks so much for this insightful comment . It comes to me on the day when our Kirk Session will discuss the goals our congregation is setting itself for the next 3-5 years which will include experiencing vacancy as our minister is due to retire . Whilst I see formative leadership as key to this , there will have to be a degree of sensitivity as this has not so far been a trait of our minister and so not sure how we might encourage it in these later stages of their ministry . <p> Formative leadership is such an important concept ! As an educator , I studied leadership for many years . As a lay person I have been involved with a variety of committees , teams , and projects . Most of those activities have needed someone to teach/coach . Leaders for the most part see themselves as persons who are getting a job done or a task accomplished . Or they see themselves as an organizer of persons to accomplish tasks . It is a spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Just because the need for a ministry exists , does not mean that a person will see themselves as a part of that ministry . Nor does it mean that they will have or develop their own ministry . A large part is the acceptance and ownership of it . Most people are willing to help if they are able to see themselves as capable . For many that does not happen without teaching and encouragement . I am reminded of Maslow 's Hierarchy of Needs . One can not move to the next level until the needs of the previous level are met . There must be a system in place to encourage growth and learning . It must be welcomed and encouraged . When people want to stay in the same comfortable position for a lifetime , it can prevent others from having the experience of growth . <p> Dear David , I am so very thankful that our Pastor is a believer in formative leadership ! She has encouraged us from the beginning to step out in faith. She is raising up new leaders , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us over the past few years have preached a sermon , lead Bible studies , and regularly visit our homebound and hospitalized members , bringing them Communion . I am giving a devotion on Saturday at our WELCA Spring Brunch , one that I have written from my own experiences . I am also giving each woman present a prayer rock with a little story attached , reminding them to pray daily . When I asked our Pastor if she would like to bless them before our brunch on Sat. , she said , " Raye , you can do that yourself ! " So I did ! For me , it is so refreshing to see that our Pastor does not feel threatened by lay people preaching sermons , visiting the homebound , etc . She encourages us and is thrilled when we accept the invitation to be bold ! By the way , those of us who have preached often quote you in our sermons ! You are encouraging us as well ! Thank you for believing in us lay people ! <p> What if it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pastor is at central skills , AND how much better the congregation becomes over time ? I think you are right in that it is good as a corrective to speak up for focus on formative leadership ( often the focus has been tipped the other way ) , but it is also important not to throw the baby out with the bathwater . We need people that can walk both sides of this line . I think performing and forming should be two sides to the same leadership coin , and balancing them is what makes a truly competent leader . 
@@27574167 @1274167/ <h> Share This <h> Pentecost 11 A : Who Do You Say I Am ? <p> I do n't know about you , but I think that , more often than not , I 'm with the crowds . You know , the people who say Jesus is like John the Baptist , Elijah , Jeremiah , or one of the prophets . Oh , that 's not what I confess , of course . When it comes time to answer the question in public , I 'm quick to join myself to Peter 's insight , claiming it as my own , or at least assenting to it . And each time to I do , I swear I mean it . <p> But if actions speak louder than words " and you and I both know they do " then I have to admit that most of my actions do n't confess that Jesus is the Messiah , the Son of the Living God . Rather , they testify that he is a good man , a great man , even , an example to follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophets of old . <p> And here 's the thing : I suspect that I am not alone in sensing the disconnect between my public confession and my everyday actions . I think most of our people also know that there is a gap between the words they say on Sunday and the lives they lead the rest of the week . Not intentionally , and certainly with no malice aforethought . In fact , I suspect that most of us would like the words we say on Sunday not just to align with the rest of our lives but actually to matter day in and day out . <p> So rather than wait to the end of this letter to offer a suggestion , I 'll start right here . This Sunday , ask you people Jesus ' question : Who do you say he is ? Not just say when repeating the Creed , but say with your lives ; that is , with your relationshiops , your bank account , your time , your energy , and all the rest . Who do you really say Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be so incredibly easy for the sermon at this point to become something of a well-intentioned guilt trip . You know , making people admit that they do n't lead lives that confess Jesus as Lord . But that 's not what I 'm after . Rather , I want us to wonder together for a moment or two what we actually mean when we say , with Peter , that Jesus is the Messiah , Son of the Living God . Or that Jesus is Lord . Or , for the theologically inclined , that Jesus is the second member of the Trinity . Or , in the words of the Creed , that Jesus is light from light , very God from very God , begotten but not made . <p> You see , I think it 's really hard to align our lives with our confession when we do n't really understand what that confession means . And I 'm not sure most of us really do " myself included . ( We can take some comfort , I think , that Peter did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . And , yeah , it 's okay to give a preview ! ) Because this whatever-it-is that Jesus was and isit 's really hard to put into words that we can understand . And so we come up with titles and formulations and all the rest , trying to get at the mystery of what God has done in and through Jesus , and that 's understandable . But all too often I fear that those words only keep the wild and unpredictable God of love and grace at arms distance from us , and Jesus remains inspiring and exemplary , but ultimately rather tame and eminently safe , kind of like the prophets of old seem to us . <p> Okay , so here 's the next thing I want you to do . I want you to spend a little time before composing your sermon trying to say in plain and simple words what you mean when you confess Jesus is the Messiah . How would you describe Jesus , that is , to someone who never heard of him before . To a childor adultor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , when you 've given some thought to that and when you 've found words that , even if they still do n't feel adequate are at least concrete and reasonably clear , share that confession with your people . <p> I know that can be a little scary , so I 'll go first . I think Jesus is God 's way of showing us how much God loves us and all people . God is so big that I think we have a hard time connecting with God . And so God came to be like one of us , to live like one of us , in order to reveal just how God feels about us . In this sense , Jesus revealed God 's heart , a heart that aches with all who suffer depression and think seriously about ending their lives , a heart that is upset and angry when a young black man is shot dead for no explicable reason , a heart that is torn up in grief at the desperate situation and violence that rips apart the land we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adoring parent can and so not only wants the best for us but is always eager to welcome us home in grace , forgiveness , and love . <p> But it 's more than that , too . I think Jesus also came to show us what 's possible . And so rather than give into the threat of disease , Jesus healed . Rather than surrender people to demons , Jesus showed compassion . Rather than let people starve because there 's not enough to go around , Jesus fed people who were hungry . Jesus refused to be satisfied or limited by the status quo and invites us to do the same , because if Jesus ' life and death show us how much God loves us , Jesus ' resurrection shows us that that love is more powerful than hate and fear and even death . Jesus shows us , in short , that God 's love wins . <p> So there it is . Not perfect " there should probably be more about forgiveness " and shaped by some of what 's going on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril of the preacher ! " and I can imagine it changing a bit as I do . But at least when I formulate it this way I have an easier time imagining what it means for me to confess Jesus as Messiah and Lord . Because I think it means that I try to live filled with and sharing God 's love , aware of the brokenness of the world but even more aware of God 's grace and the power of the resurrection . It means , I think , that I look at all of my life " my time , my relationships , my hopes , dreams , finances , and all the rest " through the lens of both the power and possibilities created by seeing God 's heart laid bare in Jesus . <p> Perhaps , Dear Partner , we can end the sermon there , inviting our people to come up with a sentence or two that describes what they believe about Jesus and then ask them to let that confession shape their lives more fully this week . <p> Because the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confess who we believe he is for his sake , but rather for ours , that we might be caught up in the power of his love and life . Could we imagine preaching that ? That the confessions we offer about Jesus in church and in our daily lives are n't finally words of praise to God but rather are words of power that help root us in the love and possibility that Jesus offers ? No doubt it takes time for all this to sink in " Peter , again , is a wonderful example . But perhaps if we start this week , over time we 'll sink deep into those words so that they shape every part of our lives . <p> Thanks for your good work , Dear Partner , for your creativity in thinking about how we might confess Jesus and your courage for sharing your faith with others .

One of the major problems , I think , with the penal substitutionary ( sometimes also called satisfaction ) theory of atonement is that it is conducted almost entirely in legal and accounting terms rather than relational ones . God ca n't forgive without satisfaction of sin , the old argument goes . God 's justice would n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our sin . Therefore , we 're lucky Jesus was willing to be punished for us . <p> I think that understanding of forgiveness misses entirely the relational dimension of forgiveness whereby we release our claim of justice on someone simply because we know the relationship can not move forward without doing so and that relationship and person more important to us than our claim . Which means that the cross is n't the mechanism by which God is able to forgive us but rather is the sign of just how far God will go to communicate that God loves us and already has forgiven us . <p> By putting it this way , I do n't mean to imply that forgiveness is easy . Usually it is not and sometimes it can be excruciating ( though rarely worse than harboring bitterness much of our lives ! ) Instead , I just want to point out that when forgiveness happens , it 's always a relational act rather than a legal one . <p> So take a look at the four-minute video .

@@27574354 @1274354/ <h> Share This <h> Pentecost 6 B Independence &amp; Interdependence <p> Anyone interested in talking about prejudice and racism this Sunday ? What about gay marriage ? <p> My guess is that a few " probably a very few " of us ca n't wait to talk about just these things because they are passions of ours . My other guess is that most of us would rather not . And that we 've got lots of very good reasons not to . These issues are too controversial , too painful , too divisive . And , perhaps above and beyond these reasons , we know that people do n't come to church to talk about these things . <p> But here 's the thing : People are talking about them . With friends , with family members , with co-workers . In fact , because of the shootings in Charleston two weeks ago and the Supreme Court verdict last week , our folks are talking about just these things lots of placesjust not at church . Which makes me wonder if our people experience church as a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kinds of difficult things , or whether church is the place you end up talking about lots of things that do n't seem to matter in daily life . <p> I have this feeling that more than our people than we might imagine actually would n't mind having church be a place where you can talk about some of the hard things going on in life and in the news . Not the place where you 're told what to think or how to vote , mind you , but where we take the task of Christian formation seriously enough to offer perspectives on how the Scriptures and our faith help us navigate this very challenging world . <p> Which is really the reason I 'm bringing all this up " not simply because there are huge issues in the news right now that our people are talking about , but also " and more importantly " because the Gospel passage appointed for this week has a lot to tell us about what it means to be a disciple , a disciple in a challenging , difficult , confusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously a place of beauty and wonder and beloved of God . <p> While there are various elements in what amounts to two connected scenes " Jesus ' preaching in his hometown and then sending his disciples out " there is between them a fascinating movement and even transformation in the relationship between Jesus and his disciples . By the end of these scenes , the disciples are no longer observers , they are no longer just followers . Discipleship , as it turns out , is not just about learning from and following another , but also taking on the role and authority of the one you follow . <p> What I find fascinating in the first scene is the treatment Jesus receives from his neighbors and hometown friends . Why such disdain ? Perhaps it 's just that familiarity does indeed breed contempt . But perhaps it 's also that we have such a hard time receiving grace from unexpected places . Jesus was n't what they expected a prophet , let alone a Messiah , to look like . And to accept him as such was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the world and about people and about themselves . <p> Is n't that also what is so difficult when we talk about perceptions of those who are different from us ? Whether they are different in terms of their age or occupation or economic status or race or ethnicity or sexual orientation , we tend to have a construct about how people should be and when we meet someone who differs from that we often find it threatening . <p> In this case , it 's not that Jesus is different from them " he was one of them ! " it 's that he 's different from what they think a prophet should be . And so rather than revise their expectations , they dismiss him . Indeed , when Mark reports that they name him according to his mother and brothers and sisters ( who knew Jesus had such a large family ? ! ) but omitted naming his father , one wonders if they were n't calling his legitimacy into question , trying to taint him in his person to dismiss his proclamation . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reducing someone who challenges us to a single attribute about that person " whether skin color or age or orientation " in order to dismiss them and thereby fail to receive the totality of the person God has created and redeemed and offered to us as a gift . <p> I think it 's interesting to notice what does Jesus does in response . First , he cures a few folks but then seems almost unable to do any great work of power because they have no interest in receiving what he offers . And so he then commissions his disciples to go out . This mission to announce the kingdom and share God 's love , as it turns out , will take more than just one miracle worker , it will take a team of people empowered , equipped , and sent to witness to God 's grace , justice , and mercy . <p> And notice that when the disciples are sent out , they are sent out to live utterly dependent on the grace and hospitality of others . They are not to take everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their lives . Which is interesting , because while Jesus had just been on the receiving end of an extreme lack of hospitality , yet he knows that the human community he is forming has at its core the interdependence , mutuality , and utter vulnerability that true hospitality simultaneously demands and creates . <p> Which might be a place to move in our sermons this week . Yes , it 's difficult to talk about prejudice and racism because it hits too close to home . Some bear the scars of prejudice , while others fear being accused of it . And , yes , it 's frightening to contemplate changing moral values or , more accurately , noting our changed sense of what really is moral and true . And , yes , in the face of these challenges it can be really , really tempting to want to keep things the same , gather with those who look and think like us , and draw the boundaries of who 's in and who 's out a little tighter . <p> And yet deep down we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time you draw a line , in fact , between who 's in and who 's out , you can bet you 'll find Jesus on the other side . And the steps we may take " the steps most of us actually want to take " toward greater acceptance , even when it means uncomfortable moments and difficult conversations " are easier to take when we do n't walk this path alone . And so we turn for help and courage to Jesus , the one who still sends disciples out equipped with the power to face down the unclean spirits of prejudice and racism in whatever form they appear . And we take these steps together , because that 's what it means to be the Body of Christ . <p> I am writing this letter to you in anticipation of the July 4th weekend and celebrations , and those of you living in the U.S. will you 'll be preaching a day after all that as well . Might we this week , Dear Partner , invite our people to independence from the idea that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on ourselves and those just like us , that we can not grow or change without losing something dear to us . Jesus is still sending out disciples , still inviting us to do great things together , still calling us to discover independence through interdependence and strength through vulnerability . This can still be a hard message to hear , and so I pray God 's gifts of courage and grace as you announce the good news in your communities and neighborhoods . <p> Yours in Christ , David <h> 4 Comments <p> Thanks David . I know you have been talking and writing about vulnerability and the community of faith as a place to open ourselves up to the discussion of the issues we face the other six days of the week .

@@27574375 @1274375/ <h> Related Posts <h> Share This <h> Is The Church Really in Decline ? ( Pt. 2 ) <p> A few weeks ago , I asked whether the church was really declining . That may seem like an odd question , given the constant bemoaning of attendance and membership declines in mainline congregations , but I pointed to the unparalleled growth of Christianity across the rest of the globe as indicating that perhaps our vision is at times to narrow when we consider Gods work in and through the church . <p> This time , I 'd like to suggest that we also at times unnecessarily narrow our vision when thinking about Gods work through the church by limiting our imagination only to congregations . When we do this , we overlook the profound ministry of the church carried on in , by , and through Social Ministry Organizations ( SMOs ) of all shapes and sizes . <p> Did you know , for instance ( and talking for a moment about my tribe ) , that each and every day in the U.S. 2% of the American population receives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roughly 6-7 million people who are being helped by Lutheran SMOs every single day ! - ( And this is only Lutherans imagine how that number multiplies when you add other Christian traditions and organizations into the mix ! ) <p> And here 's the kicker these ministries are only growing , serving more and more people each day and every year . <p> It seems to me that- if you take Jesus words seriously in Matthew 25 that we are called to serve " the least of these , " knowing that when we do so we are being encountered by God , - than it sure looks like- one of the core elements of the Christian Church is only growing . <p> So here 's my question : if this has been a new thought to you , or if this is new information for you , I 'd love to ask why . Why , that is , do we hear so little of what these fantastic organizations are doing when we gather on Sundays in our congregations ? Why are we given so little information about how we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finances to strengthen their crucial ministry ? And why again staying with Lutherans for the moment when we talk about the church do we talk about the " three expressions of the Church " as congregation , Synod , and national or churchwide body , leaving out Social Ministry Organizations ( and camps and colleges too for that matter ) entirely ? <p> This , I think , has to change . And I 'll make bold to ask your help in doing that . If you know of , or are connected to , an SMO in your area , invite your congregational leaders to invite someone from that group to come preach and/or teach at your congregation , advocate for regular updates on the activities of local SMOs in your newsletter and on your website , and see how much support your congregation directs from its budget to local and national SMOs . <p> And if you 're not familiar with any SMOs , I 'd invite you to become more so by visiting the website of- Lutheran Services in America .

My prayer is also that there may be an understanding that a conflict with authority in one congregation may not be indicative of any other communities around . To put it bluntly , the ELCA needs dissonant voices that offer a challenge to the institutional authority . <p> I hope that you are able to influence those individuals in the community you 've felt welcome in and are able to encounter and engage all folks outside of those church walls who are offering themselves in organizations that David talks about .

If you take care in reading Johns Gospel the Passion narrative appointed for Good Friday ( the Synoptic accounts- are read on Palm/Passion Sunday ) you 'll realize quickly that celebration is probably more the mood John- invites then solemn grief . Because , according to John , Jesus death is no tragic accident but rather the culmination of Jesus earthly mission to rescue a fallen humanity from the power of sin , death , and a world captive to evil and draw them to Gods abundant life . Jesus , in other words , goes to the cross not just willingly but eagerly , for the cross is actually his throne , the place where he will be lifted up and from which he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are two places where Johns description of Jesus triumph through the cross comes to fullest expression . The first is the scene in the garden on the night of his betrayal . I wont say " Garden of Gethsemane " because John identified it only as a garden . Its Mark and Matthew who name the place- Gethsemane but do not describe as a garden ( and Luke only calls it the Mount of Olives ) . For John , it is a garden , reminiscent of that earlier garden in Eden in order to contrast Jesus steadfastness with Adams failure . <p> In the descriptions of this scene provided by the other evangelists , there is always a moment of agonizing self-doubt when Jesus asks , even begs , his heavenly Father to remove from him this- cup of suffering and then comes through this moment of grievous testing and doubt by affirming , " not my will , but yours , be done " ( Mk. 14:36 , Mt.26:39 , Lk. 22:42 ) . There is no such moment of trial in John . Quite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soliders ! ) come to arrest Jesus and Peter tries to defend him by- attacking one with his sword , Jesus orders him to put away his weapon and asks , " Am I not to drink the cup the Father has given me ? " ( Jn. 18:11 ) . In other words , " Bring it on ! " - this is the mission for which Jesus was born . <p> The second scene , this one from the crucifixion , follows suit . For Jesus utters no cry of despair from the cross in John but instead fulfills prophecy , gives orders to his followers , and finally dies saying , " It is finished . " But our English translation is , frankly , a rather limp , even lame translation of- the Greek word- tetelestai which has more of the force of " all is concluded " or " it is completed " or " it has been paid in full " or , perhaps most fully , " it has been accomplished . " On the cross , that is , Jesus is saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been sent to do he had completed successfully . <p> Few capture Johns- sense of victory at the cross better than Johann Sebastian Bach , where those words , " Es ist vollbracht " ( from Luthers translation of the Bible ) are the spiritual and dramatic highpoint of the piece . Bach has the soloist begin in low and somber tones matching the mood we expect , but then rise and rise until there we reach the crescendo and hear Jesus words as a- victory shout from Gods appointed champion . <p> But lest we imagine that Johns characterization lends credence to the belief that violence is redemptive , its vital to keep in mind that Jesus actually eschews violence commanding Peter to put away his sword and instead achieves victory through his own vulnerability . For Jesus is , in John , the Good Shepherd , the one gives his life for his sheep ( Jn. 10:17 ) , who triumphs through the greatest of loves ( 15:13 ) , and who gives his life for the world God loves so much ( Jn. 3:16 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we remember the cruel death of an innocent " Good Friday , " for on it we remember that vulnerability is more powerful than violence , forgiveness more powerful than justice , love more powerful than hate , and life more powerful than death , as we witness Jesus peculiar , unexpected , but oh so ultimate victory in and through the cross . <p> I 've put below two videos for Bach ( or John ) fans . The first is Marian Andersons soulful , powerful rendition of the- " Es Ist Vollbracht " aria and the second is the- English Baroque Soloists &amp; Monteverdi Choirs rendition of the whole of the Bachs Johannes Passion . <p> Notes : 1 ) If you have received this post by email , you may have to click on the title at the top of the post in order to watch the videos . 2 ) If you want to learn more about Bachs St. John Passion , you can find a short and accessible exploration here , complete with a more recent recording of it .

Anyone . <p> Even you . = <p> Note : 1 ) If you are receiving this post by email , you may need to click here to watch the video . 2 ) We 've worked with a great team from Luther Seminary and Bethlehem Lutheran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them all , and special thanks to Ben Cieslik , pastor , dad , videographer , and editor extraordinaire. 3 ) Partial funding for the Bible Story Jam came from a grant to Luther Seminary from the Lilly Endowment.We are most grateful ! <h> 17 Comments <p> I LOVE this idea ! Each week I spend an hour and half or so with some of my parishioners batting around ideas about Sundays texts and very often my sermons reflect our conversations . These videos will add some richness for sure . Is there any chance you will have them " up " several weeks in advance ? I try to plan ahead and this ( and your Working Preacher podcasts ) would be even more helpful if I could get them 4 or 5 weeks in advance ! Thanks for the good work you do . We are seeing lives changed and your work so often contributes to that ! Blessings on you all Marie <p> Well try to get the videos up relatively early . We came up with the idea , frankly , only recently and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get most of the commentary up well in advance but the podcasts and my columns tend to be more timely and deadline-driven . Well keep working at it ! Thanks for your ministry ! <p> What an amazing idea ! I 've got a lectionary study group which meets weekly but something like this adds " fun " if that makes sense , and opens it up to a larger group . Just so I 'm clear the idea is to advertise it , have copies of the story available , and then let the folks go at it in small groups , and then come together in the larger group to share insights , questions , etc is that right ? <p> Who knows it may even be fun ! Gosh , imagine that ! <p> David thanks so much for your ministry with your blogs . Please know how deeply its appreciated , and how it has renewed me in my preaching and presence . <p> Thanks Yme ! Because were trying to cover a few different texts , the groups will each have their own text and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group with the next group near by to collect their insights and then edit them together . You do n't  have to do the video part , of course , but we wanted to share what were doing to remind us and esp . our people ! that anyone can read the Bible with understanding and enjoyment . <p> The insights of these women are amazing ! Shows the power of discerning the word in community we can all learn something new when each person shares from their unique perspective and understanding and faith ( and , yes , I was happy to hear that we are not the only family to have lost our child for a brief period of time in a public place ) . Thanks for sharing this great idea ! <p> Wow ! This is great ! I 've done this in a much simpler form and continue to be amazed and excited about what " regular " people ( as opposed to us " irregular " clergy ! ) come up with . Im inspired every time ! I look forward to this series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just listen to each other ! Thanks , David , and all who are involved with the project . <p> What a wonderful gift in this Christmas season ! I 'm in my study here in England , the day after Christmas , preparing for my next sermon and found this so inspirational ! Thanks for all that you do . Your work is much appreciated . God bless you richly ! <p> great ideabut a variety and diversity of perspectives would be more helpful all were white women . As a white female pastor myself , a multicultural mid rash would expand our understandings and sensibilities in the church , whatever our demographics may be . <p> This was excellent , I 've watched three times now ( when you posted here and when you posted it on workingpreacher.org ) Could you say a bit more about process ? How did you get the conversation rolling ? It seems that the small group is helpful , because it allows one group to be the " expert " on a given text , but since everyone had the same amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well-researched , or whatever normally holds every-day Bible experts back ( because many of the congregants in the congregations I pastor know their Bible at least as well as I do ) . However , I rarely have enough people in Bible study to break up into small groupsany suggestions for adaptation ? <p> Thanks for your comment , Adrianne . We invited the group to read the passage aloud , talk about it , and then filmed each person sharing their insights and questions with the rest of the group gathered around the one being filmed in a semi-circle . But basically we simply invited folks to pay attention to 4 things : details that stood out to them , places they felt invited to fill in the gaps with their imagination , insights that occurred to them , and questions that were sparked in them . These four things details , gaps , insights , and questions prompted a lot of great conversation . <p> That 's just such a simple way to look at a Bible passage so often we try to ask complicated questions but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow even more easily I 'll be trying it soon . <p> Jan04 <p> Bob Braxton <p> I like the improv nature of the work . Walter Wink would add Transformation of lives ( potentially ) . <p> I really appreciate these videos and I can see the value of doing something like this in my own context ( the congregation I serve , the synod we are a part of ) . Is there any conversation about opening up this concept to include videos from other places ? If we did something similar and kept the production values at the same level of those you 've posted , could they be included somehow in this series ? Thank you for sharing this powerful resource . <p> Weve been talking even this week about both trying to do this in a variety of locales as well as to offer a more in-depth set of suggestions of how we want about it so as to teach and share , in a sense , how to do this . I do n't  know that the point needs to be getting a finished video up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get one up on the page of your congregation and synod or even to create an independent site where we can collect such attempts and offerings . Thanks for the suggestion well keep thinking ! 
@@27574417 @1274417/ <p> Vocation " the belief that all of God 's people are called to lives of purpose , service , and meaning " has always been one of the most important theological convictions to me . But , as I 've learned through several years of research funded by the Lilly Endowment , it is also one of the least understood or actualized . Many , many of our people who listen to teaching and preaching about vocation regularly nevertheless report that they do not feel called . That is , they do not see their work and play and volunteering and everyday relationships as things of particular concern to God and the church , let alone view them as arenas of God 's ... <p> I am spending a lot of time in the Rockies of late .
