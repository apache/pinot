Ive been wearing tampons for about ten years now , and despite a pretty rough learning curbyou know , trying to make them work on and off for a few years before the one time when it finally didI find them pretty- reliable during that time of the month . But even after all that time , I still have a small , latent fear of developing toxic shock syndrome , a potentially fatal illness caused by toxic bacteria . Do n't  we all ? I mean , the thought of harmlessly putting a tampon up your cooch one second and going into septic shock a few hours later and , uh , dying is pretty effing horrifying . <p> But are TSS fears legit or overblown ? Are you actually at a high risk of developing TSS after inserting a tampon , especially if you leave it in for longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , shall we ? <p> Okay , what exactly is toxic shock syndrome ? <p> Toxic Shock Syndrome ( otherwise known as TSS ) is an illness caused by bacterial toxins . Hospitalization is necessary and while recovery is possible , it has the potential to be fatal within hours . <p> What 's the association with tampons ? Its not like the vagina is the only place in the body with bacteria . <p> So here 's the quick and dirty : Back in 1978 , company Proctor and Gamble did some test marketing for an ultra absorbent tampon called Rely . The goal was- to create a tampon that could withstand an entire menstrual cycle without leaking , and the finished product was a tampon that could hold more than 20 times its weight . Fast forward a couple years to 1980 , when doctors reported a spate of TSS incidents . It felt like a mini epidemic , and the cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) . The CDC concluded that people who used Rely tampons were at an increased risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tampons posed a unique risk for developing TSS , it was discovered that higher absorbency tampons in general can increase ones chances of having TSS . <p> While tampon manufacturers have learned from the error in their ways , TSS is still strongly associated with tampons , and there 's still a risk of developing TSS for any and all tampon users . <p> What happens to your body when you get TSS ? Why is it so deadly ? <p> Ugh , nasty stuff . Usually , you 'll experience a spike in body temperature , causing a fever . Other symptoms include diarrhea , vomiting , dizziness , muscle ache , rash , headache , and a drop in blood pressure . The body basically starts to shut down , depriving vital organs of oxygen . This can lead to kidney failure , brain damage , and eventually death . <p> Most cases occur in sufferers- under the age of 19 , and up to 30 percent- contract it again in the future . <p> So tell it to me straight : What are my chances of getting TSS from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't  want the tampon gods to kill me or anything , but here 's the truth : You can wear a tampon for more than eight hours and you wo n't necessarily get TSS . Sure , your chances increase the longer you wear a tampon , especially if it is high absorbency . And I 'm in no way advocating ignoring the instructions on the tampon box . But sometimes s**t happensor , you know , you fall asleepand that bad boy is in there for longer than eight hours . You still , most likely , will not contract TSS . <p> Its really easy to get caught up in the odd TSS case or two that makes the news every now and then . Its scary , but remember that that some folks contract TSS after wearing a tampon for nine days straight . Use the lowest absorbency that works with your flow , change your tampons regularly , and you 'll most likely be just fine . <p> What if I want to avoid any and all chances of getting TSS ? <p> So , heads up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TSS is n't the tampon disease ! Other things like skin infections , surgery , severe burns , etc , can cause TSS . But when it comes to menstruation , the best way to avoid your chances of developing TSS is by wearing pads or menstrual cups . <p> Okay , but if I want to stick to tamponsyoure- sure I wont develop TSS and die ? <p> There are no certainties in life , so I cant make that promise . There are probably people who contracted TSS who also thought they would never get it . But the numbers are clear : Your chances of getting TSS are so low that you really should n't worry about it as long as you 're using tampons responsibly and staying in tune with your body . <p> Are you sort of afraid of getting TSS ? Do you avoid tampons because of it ? - Tell us in the comments !

You need to brush it , wash it , cut it , protect it from sun , heat , and chemical damage ; not to mention the actual styling it requires if you want it to look good .

Just pat them against your roots and greasy ends when you 're in a pinch . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Use Mousse On Dry Hair <p> You might only think to use mousse on wet , freshly washed hair , but it can also be used on dry ( oily ) hair to give it a lift " just work it in like you normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Rub In Hand Sanitizer <p> Hand sanitizer contains alcohol for killing germs , and just like perfume , it 'll dry out the grease in your hair . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Mold It Into Beach Waves <p> Who needs perfect hair when tousled beach waves are all the rage ? Use your hair 's natural grease to your advantage ; just add some salt spray to combine with the oils and transform your hair into cute and casual waves . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Use Wet Wipes <p> Same concept as perfume and hand sanitizer " the germ-killing ingredients in wet wipes will suck the moisture out of your hair and leave it grease-free .

Once everyone realized you really do n't have to wash your hair every day to keep it clean , practically every hair care brand made their own can of the stuff . And it actually works - sometimes , on my worst days , I use two different brands of dry shampoo to really get rid of grease . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Use Baby Powder <p> Before we were all #blessed with the healing powers of dry shampoo , baby powder was a go-to solution for oily strands .

Just be careful if you have dark hair - the powder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use Dry Shampoo Paste <p> One drawback of dry shampoo and baby powder is the white powder it can leave behind in your hair , which can be especially visible if you have dark tresses .

There have been rave reviews for R+Co 's new dry shampoo paste " the formula combines dry shampoo powder with a paste-like styling gel , so you work the formula into your hair with your fingers instead of spraying it on , which eliminates the powdery residue left by many sprays . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> Absorb Grease With Paper Towels <p> We all have those days when we do n't put 100 percent effort into getting ready in the morning . If you ever get to school before you realize you 're sporting greasy roots , one quick fix is using paper towels to absorb the grease . While it 's not as effective as oil-absorbing face sheets , you can layer chunks of hair between paper towels and blot away . If this less-than-perfect method does n't work , keep a travel-size bottle of dry shampoo in your locker.

In fact , - if you are anything like me , you 'll know that it only takes a few hours post-shave before it starts growing right on back , which is both unfair and inefficient . <p> The only true solution , of course , is to stop shaving altogether and let it all just , like , go . And , if you want to grow out your armpit hair , you totally should . It grows there naturally , and guys get to keep theirs , so there 's no reason why you should remove your underarm- hair just to satisfy- some archaic , patriarchal societal standard that you do n't  even believe in . But its also fine if , archaic , patriarchal societal standards aside , you just want to get rid of your armpit hair . See , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-maintenance affirmation of feminist worth , you might not enjoy it all that much . And this is fine ! Underarm hair can be itchy .

This will last for a few days , so if you 're sick of shaving in the morning and having stubble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the product for you . Just make sure you get one that 's formulated for sensitive areas like your underarms or bikini area , leave it on for about three to ten minutes , then rinse it off . <h> Spa Waxing <p> If you want hair removal that can last about a month , you might want to hit up a salon to get your pits waxed . It definitely hurts a littlle , but it 's definitely not as bad as getting an eyebrow or bikini wax . It also leaves your underarms stubble-free for at least a few weeks and makes your chances of getting that weird dark shadow that can crop up around your pits much lower . The one disadvantage is that waxing can be sort of pricey--and if you 're planning on doing it every month , it definitely adds up--but it 's nice because , unlike shaving , it leaves you totally smooth- for a while . 28675 @qwx438675 <h> DIY Waxing <p> If you do n't want to shell out the cash for professional waxing , you can also get some at-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal experience , I do n't know that I could recommend this method with a totally clear conscience--it 's easy to miss patches , it hurts a little more than it should , and it's- hard to get at the bits that an esthetician would be able to- wax . But I guess some people like them , and they sell them for a reason , so if you definitely want to try waxing but are n't sure about spending all the money , an at-home wax could be worth a shot . <h> Sugaring <p> Sugaring basically has the same effect as waxing--it pulls hair out from the follicle , leaving your pits smooth and hair-free for about a month--except it 's made of natural ingredients like lemon , sugar , and water , so it- can be less irritating for sensitive skin . There are probably some studios around you that do this procedure , but most people actually do it themselves . You can either buy a pre-made sugaring mix , or combine 2 cups sugar , 1/4 cup lemon juice , and 1/4 cup water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a machine that , as WikiHow puts it , works about the same as an automated pair of tweezers .

This is a process that destroys hair follicles by applying heat or a chemical directly into the pores and prevents its growth for a couple of years . The amount of pain you feel probably depends on your own level of pain tolerance--I 've done it before , and it felt like pulling hair out with a pair of tweezers- to me , but some people have described it as being both significantly more and less painful than that .

There 's very little pain ( though it 's definitely not pain-free ) , and hair should stop growing there permanently after about three to seven sessions .

A vagina , ideally , will get itself naturally lubricated enough to make things comfortable , but every girl knows that sometimes it just does n't  work that way . Sometimes , even if you 're really turned on , you do n't  get super wet down there . Sometimes , were on medication that makes it harder to get wet ( this can often happen with birth control pills ) . Other times , you 're really wet , and then suddenly , in the middle of things , you realize you are n't  . And you do n't  know why . These are all reasons lubricant is great to have . On top of that , even if you do get naturally lubricated with no issue , lube can still make things better . <p> Unfortunately , lube can be hard to come by as a young girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be difficult when you do n't  have any money and/or you live at home . There are some things to consider : can you buy it without borrwing money ? Will you be able to successfully hide it so that no one else finds it ? And even if you have no problem owning lube , weve all run into the unfortunate situation of running out at the absolute worst times . <p> In this case , you start to wonder if there 's anything else you can use in its place . Good news : there is ! And the natural alternatives to lube are probably already in your kitchen .

Here are a few products you can use down there instead of lube : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Aloe Vera <p> It might sound random , but aloe vera actually makes an excellent substitution for lube . In fact , if you want to be all natural , all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Why ? Here are a few reasons . One : aloe is known for being extremely gentle and neutral , leaving skin super soft , even if it 's sensitive - and the same is true for your skin down there . Two : it 's even safe to use on condoms , because it wo n't break down latex . Just make sure it 's 100 percent aloe , with no added sugars or any other ingredients , as those can irritate you down there . And , as with everything else on this list , you might want to check it on a patch of skin before using it to make sure you 're not allergic . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Coconut Oil <p> Is it any surprise that the miracle product that is coconut oil can be used as lube ? It 's great to use on sensitive skin , because it 's safe , natural , and it feels good . On top of that , it will last longer than regular lube before getting sticky and a little dry . It even has anti-fungal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just do n't use it with condoms , as it can break down the latex . <h> Egg Whites <p> Does it sound gross to put egg whites in your vag ? Yeah , kind of , but if you 're desperate , it works . Some people worry about salmonella , but others say there 's no risk for it . It 's not the BEST option on this list , but it will work ! Just stay safe by making sure you do n't put your fingers ( or whatever touches them ) anywhere near your mouth . You might also want to consider using a dropper , since egg whites can be tough to handle . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Olive Oil <p> Similar to coconut oil , olive oil is a great natural alternative that lasts for a long time , feels good , and is totally safe .

Just do n't rely on it for every day use ! <h> Plain Yogurt <p> Plain yogurt is great for lube . Not only does it feel good , but it 's not that hard to work with , and it can even keep your vagina healthy by preventing yeast infections . It 's also cheap and easy to find , and looks really innocent . Just make sure you 're getting totally plain yogurt with no flavors or anything else added . The sugar can bother you down there . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Saliva <p> If you do n't have any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then stick with the classic : your saliva .

Even when all of the hair is gone and I shave every single day , its still always there and in the last few months I think its gotten worse ! I do n't  know what to do besides maybe bleaching my armpit , and that sounds weird . How do you get rid of the armpit shadow ? <p> Dark underarm shadow is common ( super common , actually ) , and when you think about it , quite a weird thing to feel insecure about although that has n't  stopped most of us from feeling insecure about it . It- happens when your skin there gets exposed to certain things , most of which are " things " you use/do every single day . They include shaving , sweating , no ventilation there ( not wearing shirts that give air to your underarms ) , alcohol-based deodorants , and hair removing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaving , and also normal for the shading to get worse as you continue to shave . <p> All of this information is true , but not exactly helpful or comforting .

Here are some ideas : <p> Use vegetables/fruits . Potatoes and cucumbers can be used as natural bleaching alternative . Slice up one of these , or get some of their juice , and rub it on your armpit . Let the juices sit there for about 20 minutes , then rinse off . Do this a few times a week and you might see a difference. - If you look online , you 'll see a lot of tips about using lemons or orange peel . Avoid those . Both of these acidic fruits can irritate that sensitive area , especially right after shaving , and actually end up making the shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some reason , does n't  always leave behind the same dark shadow as shaving does ( probably because it rips hair out at the roots rather than surface level ) .

Waxing your underarms also happens to be the easiest wax in the world . There are so few nerve endings there that you barely even feel the wax being ripped off . Its quick and relatively painless . <p> Switch up your deodorant . Doctors have found that dark shadows under your armpits can be a result of your skin reacting to certain deodorants . Try using a different deodorant . To make sure you 're not buying the same thing under a different brand , check out the ingredients list . <p> Moisturize and exfoliate . You probably do n't  pay any attention to your underarms if you 're not removing hair there , but that skin needs love to . Exfoliate gently twice a week with a gentle exfoliating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , because too much can make the shading worse . Then use a light moisturizer or oil to hydrate the skin . <p> Try Retin-A . If the shadow really wo n't go away , talk to a doctor about a skin lightener like Retin-A . This might help the situation . Keep in mind , though , that Retin-A is powerful ( which is why its not over the counter ) and makes skin extremely sensitive to the sun . So if you 're going outside and wearing a bathing suit a lot , you might want to skip it . <p> If nothing on that list works , see a doctor or just stop thinking about it . Armpit shadow can be a genetics thing , so maybe you 're just pre-disposed to it . And honestly , I promise , you notice it more than anyone else out there . Good luck ! <p> What 's on your mind ?

If you 're a hypochondriac , like me , I 'm sure you 've heard that ingredients and chemicals found in deodorant can lead to cancer , blocked sweat ducts , and Alzheimers . Yikes , dude . We all need deodorant to keep our body odor in check and to not sweat all over our clothes , but most of what makes them work also makes them hazardous to our health so , now what ? <p> The thought behind using anti-bacterial cream ( I used Neosporin ) instead of deodorant is that our body odor is caused when the sweat from our armpits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bacteria , and you can sweat freely .

I wish I can go full-hippie with this , but I had a long week of public events ahead of me and I could n't take that risk . <p> Very embarrassingly , I am a pit sweater .

No chemicals , a chance at no weird pain , and still not-smelling ? Sign me up . <p> How do you try this ? You put Neosporin on your armpits in lieu of deodorant . That 's it .

My goal was to get rid of my sweat , not to smell like coconut breeze , or whatever scent I just bought .

These include harsh pesticides and chemicals , like chlorine ( more on that in a minute ) . Add to that the fact that the FDA does n't regulate tampons closely enough ( meaning not everything in them is approved ) and that your vagina is naturally very absorbent , and it seems pretty terrifying . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> They 're Linked To Cancer <p> Remember how I said tampons contain chlorine ?

TSS is an infection that can occur when you wear a tampon for too long ( which is why there are warnings for not wearing them longer than eight hours ) and it can potentially kill you or paralyze you .

I am also sure that , on at least a few occasions , I have- tweeted something relating to my not enjoying bras all that much , - but deleted- it when did n't  get enough likes , which shows that while I am more than willing to vocalize my personal issues with what I view as a patriarchal item of clothing that exists to make women feel as though their natural bodies are inadequate , - I only allow myself to deem it as valid if it receives the external validation that I so badly crave .

So , get a bralette ! It offers ( most of ) the support of a regular bra without all of the annoying pinching and digging into your skin that comes from underwire . Try one with a racerback , which tends to offer the most support without discomfort . <h> Leotard <p> Leotards and bodysuits are trendy AF right now , and they 're a perfect excuse not to wear a bra , since many of them are open-backed so , uh , you basically ca n't wear a bra . They 're tight enough in the chest , however , that you wo n't feel over-jiggly when you wear it . <h> Bodysuit <p> Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has adjustable straps so you can tighten or loosen in depending on the amount of support you want . You can also layer it under a sheer dress or skirt , if you do n't feel like wearing a full-fledged bodysuit or are looking to transition some of your summery clothing items to fall . <h> Long Sleeve Crop Top <p> Crop tops are totally easy to wear without a bra , since they 're usually fitted enough up top that they can smooth everything over and offer some support . Since the weather 's getting cooler , look for one with long sleeves--this way , if you pair it with a high-waisted skirt or pair of jeans , you can even wear it to school . <h> Camisole <p> I know , I know--to you , camis are probably so very reminiscent of the " training bra " you wore back before you even really had boobs that you 'd prefer to stay far , far away from camis altogether .

Sometimes you 're just in the mood to sit and listen to your teacher talk for 45 minutes , and you end up going out of your way to get out of it . Some of these excuses are so innovative and creative , you even impress yourself . You probably thought you were the only one doing these weird things to get out of class , but guess what ? You are n't  . Also : your teacher most likely knows exactly what you 're doing . My mom is a principal at a middle school , and she 's heard some pretty strange excuses the solid ones are the ones that get passed through the whole school system . <p> For me , it was gym class . If you could get me out of sweating or playing organized team sports that I 'm innately bad at , I was all over it . Gym @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a good student . My brother , on the other hand , was a fan of full on , good old fashioned skipping . If you 're the same way , I 'm not judging in fact , I 'm actually a little impressed . You have to be a really good actor to pull some of these off ! Here are 12 weird things you thought only you did to get out of class . And if you have n't done them and are inspired , well do n't  say you got these from Gurl.com . <p> 1 ) You blame your allergies for acting up . <p> Gym class outdoors ? Running on the tracks ? No , thank you . In fact , your allergies are irritating you so much that you need to stay indoors , in the air conditioning . <p> 2 ) You say you have asthma . <p> Whether you 're faking it or not , " asthma " is the " allergies " of cold weather . No one is going to call the nurse to check to see if you have a diagnosis , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't because the cold air is constricting your airways . Do n't  your gym teachers know this ? <p> 3 ) You say you 're lightheaded and you need to sit down . <p> Say you 're hypoglycemic . Do n't  know what that means ? Does n't  matter . I 've seen people go full out and blink distractedly like the worlds gone grey and blurry and by that , I mean Ive done it . In my defense , this has happened to me for real on more than one occasion , but once you know it works , its hard to stop using it . <p> 4 ) You claim a fake injury sustained in gym class . <p> This may buy you some extra time to get out of another class if its " really bad " and you need to go to the nurse . This is where you say things like " I landed weird on my knee , somethings definitely wrong . " If you 're like me and you get hit in the face with a ball , run with it . Say you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse to leave the room and chill out in the nurses office . <p> 5 ) You say you sustained a mild injury outside of school . <p> The key to this excuse is making it minor enough to not need a doctors note . Perfect : you twisted your ankle at dance class . No big deal ! Also , it could buy you a few days to get out of gym . Figure out what the minimum amount of days is where you do n't  need a doctors note , and go one under that . Of course , that means faking a limp for a week , but you 're doing it for a good cause , you know ? <p> 6 ) The ever famous leg cramp . <p> Fake it till you make it . You need to " walk it off . " Around the school . Maybe off of school grounds . Who knows ? <p> 7 ) Distracting , painful period pain . <p> Your female teachers may call your bluff if you do this twice within four weeks , so be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time lying down with a heating pad at the nurses office during regular class . Thank you , uterus . I knew you were good for something . <p> 8 ) You say you need to get something in your locker . <p> and then taking a walking tour of the school . Do n't  overlap hallways twice or you 'll get caught , but take the long way . If you get caught , say that you 're running an errand for your teacher , then do n't  double back past wherever you got caught . Stop at the bathroom . Take your time . <p> 9 ) The fake guidance counselor appointment . <p> Teachers are reluctant to ask you about it because the reasons are usually personal . If they do ask , you just say its a family emergency . Be careful that you do n't  use it too much because the guidance counselors are usually present during team meetings . Your teachers may ask them how you 're doing during your appointments and oops , those appointments were never real . <p> 10 ) You have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is waiting for your mom in the main office , then concede you must have the wrong day once its too late to do anything productive in class . Fake being flustered and embarrassed in front of the secretaries , and if you 're a typically good kid , theyll probably let it slide . <p> 11 ) Disappearing to the bathroom for a long time , and coming back with , " I think I ate something weird , can I go to the nurse ? " <p> Your teachers do n't  want to hear details of your vomit or poop and are more willing to let you go if you come back looking extra sick and embarrassed . <p> 12 ) You missed lunch and need to run to the vending machine . <p> This one came care of my mom and one of her anonymous students . Why did I think of this before ? People miss lunch period all the time and if you get extra hungry , what 's your teacher going to do , deny you food ?

While tossing these relationship reminders might be a good idea at the time , I say , screw that . There are somethings you got from an ex that you should never get rid of . You do n't  want to hold onto their favorite t-shirt that they asked to have back because that 's basically stealing , but destroying all evidence that this person took up space in your heart once is a bad idea , and is something you 'll regret later on .

As long as you 're on the healthy path to moving on , you should hold onto these things from your ex .

Unless , of course , you 're using it to muffle your heartbroken cries for help , in which case , put them in the box with the old photos of you two .

@@45901074 @5901074/ <h> 8 Weird Side Effects Of The Morning After Pill <p> Plan B , AKA " the morning after pill , " is a form of oral emergency contraception that 's relatively new , so there are fewer statistics available on the side effects. - This is typical with newer medications , as doctors havent been able to see long-term effects just yet . The dosage is even changing it used to be a single dose , and now the most common suggestion is two separate pills . This is not to say that Plan B is n't effective it totally is but the women who take it are basically learning about it right along with everybody else . For example , it was only a few years ago that we realized that Plan B was not effective for women over 165 pounds ( for those of you who ca n't use Plan B : Ella is here for you ) . <p> Emergency contraception is still controversial to some pro-life enthusiasts , so if you 're still feeling apprehensive about it , here are some helpful facts . Plan B is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfertilized egg . You can only get pregnant when you ovulate , so if you are ovulating when the morning after pill becomes necessary , you have three to five days in order for it to be effective , but within 24 hours of unprotected sex is the best . If you have not ovulated yet , it will prevent your next ovulation from happening . If you already ovulated , it will prevent fertilization of the egg that 's still chilling out in your uterus . Its a large dose of chemical hormones , not poison . <p> Its also low-key upsetting that some of the side effects of Plan B are also pregnancy symptoms . So , while they 're a perfectly natural response to a flood of synthetic hormones , and technically nothing to worry about , its okay if you feel stressed about what Plan B makes your body do . Like I said , its a huge dose of hormones , so that 's going to mess up your system for longer than a few days . That 's why its called emergency contraception , so you only use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top side effects of the morning after pill anyone with a uterus needs to know , in case you need to use emergency contraception . 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Nausea <p> Nausea is basically par for the course with Plan B. This is because you just took a heavy dose of chemical hormones - much heavier than the dosage in a standard birth control pill , for example , and nausea is a side effect of that . If you know that feeling , imagine multiplying that by four . That 's Plan B level nausea . Again , it 's a heavy dosage , so this is n't going to get out of your body in a few hours . It may take a few days , or even weeks , though it may decrease in severity over time . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Fatigue <p> Okay , your body is doing the most right now . Of course you are going to feel fatigued ! A good way to guess what your side effects might be is assessing what your period or PMS symptoms are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week leading up to or during your period , chances are you are going to be wiped out by the morning after pill . Fatigue is one of the more common side effects , so do n't be surprised if your energy drops after using emergency contraception . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Migraine Headaches <p> Plan B headaches can range from mild to full blown migraine headaches . According to The Migraine Trust , women are more prone to migraine headaches because they are often triggered by female sex hormones . Large spikes or drops in hormone dosage will greatly effect your liklihood of getting a migraine or even a mild headache . So , you can imagine what the heavy Plan B dosgae will do for someone who already gets chronic headaches . Yikes. 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Breast Soreness <p> Oh , hormones . Thanks for making our bodies so weird and achy all the time . We forget that the breasts are part of the endocrine system . Yup , the glands in your breasts also produce estrogen . When your hormones are effected by birth control , pregnancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore . It 's no different when you take emergency contraception . It 's natural for your breats to become sore in reaction to hormones . After all , they 're part of your reproductive system , too . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Abnormal Menstrual Cycle <p> Your next period could last a long time or even arrive late . The hormones in Plan B could , and probably will , throw your already balanced system off kilter for a while . This is normal when you go on birth control for the first time , or switch hormonal birth control methods , so Plan B is just doing the same thing to your body right now . It 's a foreign source of additional hormones that naturally occur in your body . Taking emergency contraception could also increase your risk of spotting between periods . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Weird Discharge <p> This woman on Yahoo Answers said that she had brown colored discharge following her taking emergency contraception and before her period . As anyone who menstruates will tell you , the color and thickness of your menstrual blood changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all liklihood , this was just some strange spotting , not discharge . However , you should be aware that the morning after pill may effect your normal vaginal discharge and normal color of your spotting . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Ectopic Pregnancy <p> Like I said , if you take the morning after pill after an egg has already been fertilized , there 's not much you can do . However , an egg can be fertilized in the fallopian tube and travel down towards the uterus where it embeds itself in the uterine lining - perfectly normal . After emergency contraception , though , the uterus may be too hostile of an environment for a fertilized egg to implant itself into the lining , so instead it implants in the fallopian tube or anywhere outside of the uterus . <p> Ectopic pregnancies can be life threatening if left untreated . If you think you may have an ectopic pregnancy , please see your doctor . Symptoms include : rash , itchiness , swelling , trouble breathing , wheezing , hives , and difficulty swallowing . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of taking Plan B. The morning after pill does n't make you pregnant , but you should still be aware that if your body is already pregnant when you take it , it might be too late . Of course , there are ways to handle an unwanted pregnancy whether you choose to get an abortion or not ( and if you choose to - good for you , it 's your body , and your choice ) . Plan B is n't 100 percent fool proof even if you take it in the recommended window of time . While researching this , I read about a woman who took it 20 minutes after having sex with her husband and still managed to somehow get pregnant .

Do whatever works , whether it 's putting on lipgloss , staring at your awesome butt , or doing a quick power pose . Do what you need to do in order to feel at your peak , most badass , sexy self .

Well , when you stalk someone on the internet , you inevitably wind up learning a lot about someone 's personal life you may not have gleaned from having an actual conversation with them . So , when this information comes up in a real-time conversation and you forget to pretend that this is *new* information ( aka lie ) , it 's quite embarrassing . Yup , your crush just caught you stalking them online . Protect yourself and do n't cyber stalk , as fun as it is. 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Do n't Put Yourself Down <p> Do n't make excuses for yourself or put yourself down . No more of this " Oh yeah , I 'm in the school play . It 's no big deal , it 's so stupid , I 'm just doing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide or discount your personality . If all goes well and you actually wind up in a relationship with this person , they 're going to find out eventually . Getting embarrassed by who you are and what you think is fun is n't attractive , to be completely honest . Own who you are and do n't shy away from it . The right person is going to think all of you is awesome , not just some parts . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Let Go Of What You Think They Want To Hear <p> No more conditioning girls to be people pleasers . It 's heteronormative , for starters , and I blame society for this weird phenomenon where girls are supposed to fake a whole new personality in order to get someone to fall in love with them . Stop trying to play into the type of girl this person wants you to be . It 's either you , or it 's not , and if it 's not you , it 's nothing personal . Trying to play into what you think someone wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you are and makes some weird assumptions about who you think your crush is . Eventually , lies catch up to you , which can be really embarrassing when it happens . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Bring A Friend Along To Diffuse The Awkwardness <p> All hail the buddy system . If you know that you 're bound to forget how to use your words or embarrass yourself , bring along a friend who ( important : does not also have feelings for your crush ) will be there to assist any dragging conversation and prompt you with a swift excuse to leave , if need be . That 's what friends are for : they harbor your secrets and help you achieve your dreams ( of putting your face on your crush 's face ... eventually ) . Having a third party in a conversation automatically makes it feel less intimate and therefore less awkward . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Take Them Off The Pedestal <p> Contrary to what your heart has to say , your crush is not , in fact , the most factually correct and perfect human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . You need to remember that this person you have feelings for is just a human person . Making them this higher being and putting them at a more elevated status than you are just sets you up to cower in their shadow that somehow only you can see and interact with . Your crush is a flawed human and so are you . Save yourself the embarrassment and remember to relax . They 're not Justin Bieber ... or his new , weird face tattoo. 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Do n't Plan Everything Out Beforehand <p> What 's up , Type A planners ? I have some bad news for you : nothing ever goes according to plan . Oops ! Mentally rehearsing when , where , and how this perfect conversation is all going to go down will only set you up for disappointment in the end . Why ? It 's not going to happen exactly that way IRL . When anything deviates from this plan is when the embarrassing stuff all comes bubbling up to the surface , because you 're desperately trying to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Save everyone a lot of trouble and just - stay with me - go with the flow . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Replay What You Want To Say in Your Head Before Saying It <p> Yeah , this might seem like contradictory advice after the other slide , but if you 're anything like me and you stammer or say things you do n't actually mean to say , you need this advice . Sometimes thinking about what you want to say before it comes out of your mouth is helpful . Is this the right order of words ? Is it awkward ? Does it make sense ? If you 're feeling unsure , just hit rewind in your brain to double check yourself . No harm in that . It 's not about planning what to say , it 's about making sure you actually know what you 're saying . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Keep Your Expectations Low <p> This is a crush we 're talking about , remember ? No one is going on any fancy dates or confessing their love here . Remember to keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to spectacularly and you wo n't always seem cool . Do n't bookmark every interaction you have with this person as a funny anecdote to tell your grandkids about how you two met because this person is still just a crush to you . Chill out as much as humanly possible and trust me , that 's 90 percent of not embarrassing yourself in front of someone who makes your heart skip . 28678 @qwx438678 <p> How have you embarrassed yourself in front of your crush ?

I know its unpleasant and uncomfortable and sort of taboo and maybe embarrassing , but its also something we need to discuss . Summer is fast approaching , and with the warmer weather , sunny beach days , and increased time spent outdoors comes sweat , especially down there sweating . Now , of course , vagina sweat does n't  only happen in the months of June , July , and August but there 's no denying that it probably happens more often then . And sweat is n't the only reason to take care of your vagina a little bit more carefully in the coming months . <p> Fun things like yeast infections and urinary tract infections might be more common in the summertime for some girls because of what they 're wearing and doing .

Here are eight tips on how to take care of your vagina in the summer that you 'll definitely thank me for later . 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Stop Sitting Around In Wet Bottoms <p> For many of us , summer means hanging out at the beach , at the pool , by a lake , or kid-style near some sprinklers . All of these things typically involve wearing a bathing suit and going in the water . That 's all fine and great , but beware of wet bathing suit bottoms . The warm , moist environment is perfect for bacteria to grow . Sitting around in wet bathing suit bottoms for hours very often leads to urinary tract infections or even yeast infections . You do n't want a UTI in the summer . It can be hard to change out of wet bikinis when you 're at the beach for the day , so if that 's the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they 're still damp , and then change as soon as you can . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Avoid Super Tight Shorts <p> What better time than the summertime to wear tight short shorts ? I know it 's hard to resist those cute little denim shorts , but they could be wrecking havoc on your vagina . Tight shorts or bottoms in general will always put you more at risk for an infection down there as it makes you sweaty and also leads to uncomfortable chafing . This gets even worse in the summer , when it 's really hot and gross . You do n't need to throw out all of your tight denim pairs , but try opting for loose cotton versions or dresses when you can . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Wash Your Towels Regularly <p> I go to the beach as often as possible in the summer , and sometimes this means I 'll go a few days without washing my beach towel - to conserve water , and also , I 'm lazy . If you do the same , you should stop . Wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your body , especially near your vag , can cause infections . Wash your towels ! That goes for shower and bathroom towels too . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Change Your Underwear If You Get Really Sweaty <p> Again , summer equals more sweat . This is a tip you should follow all year , but especially during the summer : if you get super sweaty , change your underwear . This is especially true if you work out or play sports during the warmer months . Keep a spare pair of cotton underwear nearby . Sitting around in sweaty underwear is not a good idea for your vag. 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Go Commando Sometimes <p> Underwear is great , but you know what is also great ? A healthy vagina . You can get that by skipping underwear sometimes . Go commando whenever you can , and you should really try going sans underwear every night when you 're sleeping . Your vagina needs to breathe , especially if it 's been hot and sweaty all day long . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Use Powder <p> Feeling sweaty and icky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucks . If you ca n't stand the feeling , invest in this Lush Silky Underwear Powder . It smells amazing and is made for that sensitive area down there ( although I still do n't recommend putting it ON your vag ) . Use this to stop chafing in between your thighs without worrying about it bothering your area , use it around your bra , or just put it anywhere . It 's great . <h> Wear Cotton Underwear <p> I 'm sure you 've heard this a million times , but let me say it again : cotton underwear is the best thing you can do for your vagina . It let 's your lady parts breathe and makes things more comfortable . It 's better for sweat as well . You should always be wearing cotton underwear , but especially during the summer months . Yeah , lace and satin is pretty , but is it really worth the possible infection ? 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Wash With Warm Water Every Day <p> Summer means we 're all feeling extra sweaty and gross every day . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross down there . Skip the douching , the scented body washes , and anything like that , and just wash your vag with warm water regularly .

For denim purists , this is the preferred method of getting rid of odors from jeans ; you 're , ideally , not supposed to wash your jeans that much , so this is a way of getting rid of the stink that might develop over multiple wears without risking your jeans shrinking or getting misshapen .

We became very good friends ( still are ) and I think that at some point he even liked me a bit , but then he got into this " f*ckboy " phase . Soon , all of the boys , him included , only cared about making out , having sex , sexting , and who got the most girls . He has had a few girlfriends who are all shallow but gorgeous , and one is older . He is pretty experienced when it comes to sexual stuff , even though he s still a virgin .

My fear of kissing wrong or bad is slowly but surely ruining my chances with this guy . I have this fear in my head that even if he told me it did n't  matter to him if I were bad , he would still secretly judge me .

Two , do n't  try anything crazy your first time , like lip biting . Just kiss ! Three , do n't  shove your tongue in his mouth . It should be more gentle and less , uh , tongue thrusting .

Dead skin cells are the ultimate enemy because they contribute to skin clogging , which can contribute to closed comedones , which can made your skin look bumpy AF . Glycolic acid will help keep them at bay , especially if you use it in the form of pre-moistened pads or a serum of some sort . There are also cleansers that have glycolic acid in them , but they 'll be less effective since they wo n't sit on your skin for very long . Glycolic acid ( and all AHAs ) are super sun sensitive , so either only wear it at night or make sure to wear sunscreen if you apply it in the morning .

Not only can it still get you pregnant , but it does not prevent STDs or infections the way condoms do .

But here 's my suggestion : find an alternative method of birth control , and combine the two . So , for example , take birth control pills also , or get an IUD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against STDs either , so if you 're going to forgo condoms completely , make sure that this is a long-term partner you trust who is n't sleeping with other people , and that you 've both been tested . <p> In the grand scheme of things , the pull-out method is n't the worst thing you can do , and I know there are a lot of people who defend it . But I just ca n't stand by it as a responsible form of birth control . Please , please , please use condoms or the pill or an IUD , or just speak to your doctor about your options . If you do n't  want to get pregnant , start relying on something more safe . <p> What are your thoughts about the pull out method ? Have you ever used it ? Let us know in the comments .

Hannah appears to be a black/a woman of color , and unfortunately non-white people are often hypersexualized ( as well as desexualized ) .

Still , as is the case with any other year , there were some- bad songs . Or , for lack of a better term , there were some songs that wereinfuriating . <p> To be clear , a song that is " infuriating " is not the same thing as a song that is bad , necessarily .

" Heathens " by Twenty One Pilots : <p> Consider everything that one must endure in order to watch this music video : First , there is thirty second-long advertisement for Capital One featuring Samuel L. Jackson . You can skip this advertisement after five seconds , but this involves clicking the actual computer screen , and if you are putting on your makeup on in a different part of the room , you have to listen to the whole thing .

I am inclined to say no , but the only song I actually like is " Christmas Is All Around " by Billy Mack from the movie Love Actually , so I 'll let you decide for yourself . <p> 3. " 7 Years " by Lukas Graham : <p> Like most people , I learned only recently that " Lukas Graham " is not the name of one singular person , but , instead , the name of a four-person " pop , soul , punk " band from Denmark . In any case , I heard this song far too many times back when I was trying to become a musical.ly celeb , so it carries a host of painful memories for me.I am sure you can agree . <p> 4 .

Every time I went out for a run , it was the only song I could listen to , and so it was the only song I listened to every day for thirty to forty minutes at a time . Eventually , I came to my sensesI had listened to this song enough times to ascertain that it is legitimately bad , as well as pretty racistbut at that point it was too late , and this song somehow ended up being my number one most-played song on Spotify in the year of our lord 2016 . <p> 6 .

I am glad for Charlie Puth , who seems like a nice enough guy , but I am not glad for myself , considering that this song has been stuck in my head since May . <p> 11 . " Work From Home " by Fifth Harmony : <p> For the record , I love formerly-Fifth ( and now Fourth , sniff ) Harmony , and the song " Work From Home " is a veritable bop .

The word actually became most popular on November 9th , the day after Donald Trump was elected president . Yep .

Icon <p> You probably knew what an icon was before this year , - but ICONIC and icon had a new meaning in 2016 , since so many iconic things happened . But what really made this word became popular this year was- the death of Prince , who was considered a pop icon . <p> 4 . In Omnia Paratus <p> Familiar with this phrase ?

More recently , it was used in the revival , which is probably why everyone was wondering what it actually meant . I do admit to googling this phrase , even thought I have heard probably a hundred times before . Hey , you learn something new every day . <p> 5 . Bigly <p> This word basically just means " big " or " of great force , " but for some reason , every time Trump said " Big League , " the world thought he was saying " bigly " which is what sparked the popularity of the word . To be fair , it totally sounded like that 's what he was saying . It actually took a linguistics professor to figure out what he was saying . So , I do n't  blame the world to looking up this word . <p> 6 . Deplorable <p> When Hillary Clinton called Trump supporters deplorable , they had to search it to make sure it was n't offensive .

Honestly , there seems to be quite a few stories of Forever 21 being beyond sketchy . <p> GAP has been at the center of this anti-sweatshop fight since the 90s . GAP is more transparent than it used to be and has made more of an effort to make sure that its garment workers are treated humanely . GAP even donated millions of dollars to the victims of the Rana Plaza factory collapse , which killed over 1000 people . But garment workers at factories that make GAP clothing still protest and strike . Why ? Their wages are absolute garbage . Plus , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go before it is as humane as it seems . <p> The Rana Plaza building collapse killed 1130 people , many of whom helped make clothing for UK fast fashion brand , Primark . While Primark was one of the first companies to come out and donate money to the victims of the tragedybut even then , victims could only obtain Primarks money if they provided DNA evidence that their loved one was killed . Uh , harsh . <p> Its not just Nike or Puma that gets a lot of flack for producing sportswear in harsh conditions . According to Oxfam , Adidas supplies thousands of its garment workers with poverty wages . On top of that , they 're bad at , upholding trade union rights .

Yes , allegedly , a dash of forced child labor went into your fave organic VS undies . Honestly , I wish I was surprised to hear this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bra fitting , I 'm not surprised that their oversight is evident in more pressing matters as well . <p> Wal-Mart hasfairlybeen called out for its history of underpaying and exploiting employees , but little is known about the origins of its cheap clothing . Well , unfortunately , Wal-Mart brand clothing was also made at the site of the Rana Plaza collapse , though Wal-Mart claims they had no idea that its clothing was made there . In the companys defense , it has , in the past , decided to opt out of producing its clothing at sites that it deemed inhumane and unsafe , but who knows what else slips between the cracks . <p> Uniqlo , a Japanese based fast-fashion company , has its eyes set on conquering the US market . A few years ago , its only US location was in NYC . But now it is expanding , but at what cost ? Well , apparently at the cost of garment employees , because they work in really crappy conditions . The Chinese factory where many of their clothes are made features disgustingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel treatment from managementyeah , sounds like a sweatshop to me . Employees claimed that they were paid just a third of their average monthly salary . Uh , WTF , Uniqlo ? Screw your cozy clothes , pay your workers . <p> What other brands use sweatshop labor ? Do you avoid certain brands due to their sweatshop labor practices ? Why or why not ? Do you have any recommendations of brands or stores that do n't  use sweatshop labor ? - Tell us in the comments !

I 'm kind of nervous . I DO smoke cigarettes sometimes so I 'm scared . What are the signs that I can look out for ? <p> Blood clots definitely sound terrifying , especially when you hear about them as a side effect of the Pill . I remember when I went on the Pill and my doctor told me about the possibility of blood clots . Every other side effect was normal and seemed like no big deal , but potential death ? I was just as freaked out as you are ! The good news is that blood clots from birth control pills are not the norm but because it happens and its so dangerous , doctors have to warn you about them . Knowing the signs is one of your best ways to stay safe , so I contacted my friend , Dr. Sherry Ross , for advice . Shes from- the site- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life ASAP ) and knows basically everything ( almost ) . <p> Dr. Ross said , " Blood clots are a rare side effect of being on the birth control pill . The good news is only 1 in 1,000 women each year will develop a blood clot . Plus , the factors are always different . The hormones in the pill , estrogen and progesterone , are responsible for this increase risk . The newer birth control pills and the transdermal patch increase your risk even more . " How ? Dr. Ross explains : " The hormones in the pill can make your blood thicker than usual , causing hyper-coagulation , which is the medical term for causing excessive clotting . Blood clots can develop in the veins in your legs and block the blood flow in different parts of your body , depending on where the clot travels . The clot can travel to your lungs ( pulmonary emboli or PE ) or your brain causing a stroke . Blood clots are extremely dangerous , even deadly in unusual cases . " <p> As for the signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The signs of a blood clot include pain , redness , or swelling in one or both legs , sudden unexplained difficulty breathing , chest pain , irregular heartbeat , slurred speech , coughing up blood or loss of coordination . If you are have any of these types of symptoms and are on the birth control pill , see your health care provider right away . " <p> And yes , there is a problem with the fact that you smoke cigarettes sometimes . Dr. Ross says , " If you smoke cigarettes after the age of 35 years old , have thrombophilia , or a history of blood clots you are even more at risk and should not use the pill as your form of contraception . " Even if none of those apply to you , its still dangerous yes , even if you only smoke sometimes . Do n't  hide that from your doctor . Tell him/her so that they can prescribe you a pill that does n't  have a high risk of blood clots ( some pills offer more of a risk than others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormones in it have been known to cause more blood clots than other pills ) . And if you start to smoke a lot , you might want to avoid birth control pills and try a different form of contraception . <p> But if you 're a healthy person and you 're honest with your doctor , you should be okay ! Dr. Ross says , " Overall the birth control pill is safe , highly effective , and the other health benefits outweigh the risks . " Blood clots from the Pill are NOT the norm , so it should n't be something you worry about every day . Remember that !

A smokey eye is n't just about the shadow on your lids - you should add some under your eye too . Do n't do too much , or you 'll look like a raccoon . <p> 4 . Think outside the box .

Preventative aging is better than trying to get rid of aging that has already happened . If you care about wrinkles , you should start some sort of routine now .

At night , after removing my makeup , I do a sheet mask ( super , super hydrating ) , use serum , and then I put on an overnight mask , which is basically a very heavy moisturizer that you keep on all night long . <p> Two : be safe in the sun .

I ... do not recommend this . You can very easily mess up and if it looks obvious , it 's not ideal . You can use those little lip glosses that claim to plump lips for a temporary effect - they 'll make your lips swell up to be slightly larger .

The answer is yes and no . Honestly , it depends on what were talking about here . Let 's waste no more time and dive right in : Here are six questions about food and periods that youve always wanted answers to . <p> 1 . Are there any foods you can eat to make your period lighter ? <p> Before we start , know this : Your period might not even be " heavy . " If you can fill up a tampon or pad within an hour , have a period for more than seven days straight , or produce a lot of blood clots when you 're menstruating , then you have a heavy period . If this sounds familiar , talk to a doctor ; you might be experiencing a hormone imbalance , fibroids , pelvic inflammatory disease , or another medical condition worth investigating . <p> If you just have a flow that is heavier than you 'd like , then you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can eat that will make it lighter. - There are some sources that claim that eating a diet with less saturated fat and sugar produces a lighter period , but , honestly , I have n't seen any hard evidence of this. - Your Google-ing might yield results that " prove " that cutting out carbs or adopting a raw vegan diet during your period will make your period lighter , but that 's mostly anecdotal . There are plenty of people who are vegan year round who do n't  have pantyliner light periods , okay ? <p> So if you want to eat a little healthier during your period and see if your flow is lighter , be my guest , but do n't  expect picture perfect results . <p> 2 . Okay , well , are there any foods that you can eat that make your period less hellish ? - <p> Yes ! According to Dr. Ross of HelloFlo , there- are plenty of food options out there that can help soothe cramps and bloating . Hydration can ease uterine muscles , so drink plenty of water ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veggies like watermelon , strawberries , blueberries , cucumber , celery , or lettuce . <p> Calcium can reduce cramps , so consider eating dairy like yogurt and cheese or other calcium rich foods like kale , tofu , almonds , sunflower seeds , and spinach . Bananas are rich in potassium , which can also help fend off cramps and bloating . Peppermint and ginger also do double duty in easing cramps and bloat . You can also try incorporating salmon , oatmeal , and even a little dark chocolate into your meals during your period and see if you notice a reduction in cramps . <p> Also , your iron levels drop during that time of the month , especially for women with heavy periods . At best , this can leave you feeling sluggish , at worst , you might have anemia . Consider taking iron supplements , or eating lentils , chickpeas , dark leafy greens , or lean beef . <p> But no matter what , hydrate , hydrate , and hydrate . That 's probably the best thing you can do for your body in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your period . <p> Coffee contains caffeine , and caffeine is a diuretic . Diuretics increase your urge to go to the bathroom , which can increase urine production ( and make you want to poop , too ) , which can cause dehydration . Dehydration canyou guessed it , make your cramps worse because they can cause blood vessels to tighten . Prostaglandins , substances in your body that prompt menstrual cramps in the first place , already have a tendency to temporarily disrupt blood/oxygyn flow to the uterus , which can cause pain , so caffeine just ai n't  helping . <p> Alcohol is also dehydrating and constricts blood vessels , making it another foe of menstrual cramps , not to mention bloating . <p> 4 . Now that you mention it , what about bloating ? <p> Bloating not only makes you feel uncomfortable , it can also make your menstrual pain feel even worse .

Why ? They contain- raffinose , a hard to digest sugar which can make you gassy af . The gassier you are , the more bloated you are . Legumes ( beans ) , apples , and dairy are also guilty of making you bloated . But since these are healthy foods , its best to keep your portions in check . Eat them with easily digestible foods that are high in fiber , like whole grain rice or quinoa . <p> Oh , and by the way , you might think that drinking more water when you 're prone to bloating is a bad idea , drinking more water can actually counter water retention .

Then , bam , nine-year-old getting her first period . <p> Of course , there are a lot of different factors that go into the age of someones first period , including genetics . There are plenty of overweight people who might not get their period early at all , it really depends . <p> 6 . Is it true that menstruation is actually unnatural , and eating a healthier diet will stop it ? <p> Okay , I had to throw this in because I 've seen- so many BS posts on social media claiming that menstruation is unnatural because there was no proof of people menstruating during ancient times or something .

Also , if someone claims that their period stopped because they cut out bread and meat and they eat healthier , know this : They might not be getting their period anymore because theyre- malnourished . Malnourishment can make your periods stop , which is why many with eating disorders report stopped or super irregular periods . <p> Honestly , anything from weight changes , extreme exercise , or stress can cause your period to change , but its not supposed to stop .

People say things like , " LOL she 's so thirsty for likes on Instagram , its pathetic " or " Shes so annoying when she tries to make her life look better than it is online . " But let 's be honest for a second the majority of us do care how we come off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us when they look at our profiles , and we want to seem a certain way to strangers or friends . Why are we making fun of other people for doing something were doing secretly ? ! <p> The obvious answer to that is usually insecurity . When we feel silly or insecure about something were doing , we project those feelings by making fun of someone else for doing them . Its backwards and twisted , but it happens and its the worst . I just think we need to unapologetically own who we are and stop making fun of other people for doing something we do n't  want anyone to find out we do too . I post a lot of pictures on Instagram and I love trying to create my *aesthetic* on my profile . My friends make fun of me all the time for this stuff , but I honestly do n't  care . That 's because , one , they do it too , just in different ways ; and two , I like to do it so I do n't  care what they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that being said , here are 18 things you need to stop making fun of other people for because at the end of the day , I guarantee you all have done almost every single one of these things at least once in your life . Do n't  be a hypocrite its not cute . <p> 1 . Responding to a text too quickly . <p> We all do that that thing where we get a text and then force ourselves to wait five minutes before we respond so we look like we have a life . But we also all have those moments where we respond right away because eff it , who cares ? Plus , we all know that our phones are in our hands 24/7 . What is even the point of this anymore ? ! <p> 2 . Liking a really old picture on Instagram . <p> Try to tell me you 've never been 194 weeks deep into someones Instagram and I will laugh at you . I once saw a friend post a status calling someone pathetic for liking one of her really old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " omg , puhh-lease. " - Do n't  make fun of the person who slipped up when you know you do the same exact thing . <p> 3 . Going a little bit crazy and flipping out on a crush/hookup/significant other . <p> Most of us try to be level-headed and calm , especially in the crazy world of dating . But we all have our moments where we get a little too angry or upset and we act , uh , a little bit cray-cray . We have all been there , and it sucks . So can we please stop acting like every girl who does something a little dramatic is a crazy bitch ? <p> 4 . Getting a little too jealous when it comes to their significant other. - <p> Jealousy is a normal human emotion that happens to even the most confident girls . When someone is obviously jealous , they already feel crappy . They do n't  need anyone elses taunting on top of it . The only way you can make fun of someone for being too jealous is if you 've never felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfies . <p> I am so over the selfie hate . Why do you care if someone takes a lot of selfies ? Why does it bother so many people when someone likes how they look and wants to document the moment ? Do you and let other people do what they want too . Stop being so judgmental ! <p> 6 . Trying to come up with good Instagram captions or pictures . <p> This goes under the general umbrella of making fun of someone for caring how they look on social media . If you have a social media page , you in some way care what people think about it . So stop making fun of others just because they might do things a little differently than you . <p> 7 . Being sad about being single . <p> I once heard a few girls making fun of their friend behind her back because she was depressed about being single . It sounded so mean and awful . Being single can be really tough for people sometimes why would you make fun of them for those very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never felt depressed about being super lonely . Try . <p> 8 . Period stains . <p> I know all about the dreaded period stain we do n't  want one because god forbid everyone know we have our period ! I 've heard people say such rude things about period stains . Listen , these are something we do n't  have 100 percent control over . Do n't  be that person making a girl feel bad about something she 's already embarrassed about when it could just as easily happen to you . <p> 9 . Being a little clingy with bae . <p> Clinginess is n't the best quality to have , but it usually speaks to deeper issues . The next time you 're about to roll your eyes at your friend for being a little too into her bae , ask yourself honestly if you 've done the same . You probably have or would , given the chance . <p> 10 . Doing something embarrassing at a party when drinking . <p> Almost everyone on this planet has a super embarrassing party story . Yeah , its fun to joke about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone apart for it . People make mistakes ! Unless you 're perfect , chill . <p> 11 . Having a big pimple . <p> I hate hearing someone make fun of someone else for having acne . Its something a lot of people have very little control over and it sucks to hear that others use that to bring someone down . Also , we ALL get pimples . You will have your day where you have one in the worst spot at the worst moment . You would n't want people making fun of you then , right ? <p> 12 . Smelling weird one day . <p> I mean , come on guys . This is just rude . <p> 13 . Getting caught stalking their ex online . <p> Stalking your ex is an unfortunate side effect of social media and has happened to the best of us . The next time you see someone doing it , refrain from calling them a pathetic loser , because I know you 've been in the same situation , or you will be in the future . <p> 14 . Texting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so over texting can be really annoying . But sometimes its necessary , and does n't  need to be something to torture someone over . <p> 15 . Subtweeting . <p> Yes , subtweeting is immature and a poor way to handle a social issue . But I know you 've done it at least once . You have ! So just let it go . <p> 16 . Telling a stupid lie for no real reason . <p> Every once in a while we all tell a story where we get a little dramatic and exaggerate something that happened . If you catch someone doing this once in a while , do n't  make fun of them . <p> 17 . Obsessing over a crush . <p> Um , hi . Part of having a crush is obsessing over them . Please stop acting like someone is pathetic for doing just that . <p> 18 . Making a simple grammatical error . <p> I do n't  like grammatical errors either , but they happen . There 's no reason to make a status about how everyone who does n't  know grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've all been there . <p> Which of these things do you make fun of others for ? What do you disagree with ? What did we forget to include ? Let me know in the comments .

Who can do that besides the few people who have thousands of dollars to spare on something trivial ? But that 's just the extreme end of the spectrum , because there are plenty of other everyday things that we use that feel massively overpriced . like , why does a moisturizer from Sephora have to cost $45 ?

For me , the worst thing about getting my period has always been some seriously horrible PMS . When I was younger , I used to get the worst cramps ever . I 'm talking so bad that at least one day a month , I either be late or miss school all together because I was in so much pain . <p> I 'm sure most of you can relate . Ugh are n't  period cramps the worst ? ! I do n't  get them as much anymore ( thank God ) , but maybe that 's because I tried out about a million ways to get rid of them . The upside of that ? I can now share my tips with you guys . So , wondering how to get rid of cramps or at least make them better ? Check out these 8 tips that will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Try Pills <p> One of the most obvious solutions for menstrual cramps is taking some pills . A few Ibuprofen or something like Midol is probably your best best . However , I happen to know from experience that these pills do little to nothing for really severe cramps . But if your cramps are pretty mild , these should do the trick - and if they 're way worse than mild ? They may take the edge off . It 's worth trying , especially if you need a quick fix . <h> Prop Those Feet Up <p> Whenever I used to get terrible cramps , I would lay down on my back and prop my feet up on a few pillows . Elevating your feet can help reduce some of the pain . If you do n't find that helpful , try curling yourself into the fetal position . Either way , lie down for a little bit ! <h> Use A Heating Pad <p> When you have bad period cramps , heating pads can be your best friend . Invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If you do n't have time to lie down and use one , then there are these great sticky heating patches ( like these ) that you can put on under your clothes and use them while you 're doing other stuff , like going to school or work . The heat will help soothe your cramps and , bonus , warm you up on a cold day . <h> Consider Birth Control Pills <p> For me personally , my cramps did n't entirely disappear until I started using birth control pills . Now I rarely get them when I get my period and it 's awesome . If you 're thinking about going on the pill mainly for this reason , let your doctor know so that he/she can prescribe the best ones . <h> Do Some Mild Exercise <p> I know the idea of working out when you have horrible cramps sounds insane . Trust me , I almost bit my mom 's head off the first time she suggested it . But actually , a little bit of exercise will help your cramps go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something too difficult , try just going for a walk or doing some yoga . <h> Take A Bath <p> Cramps are a perfect excuse to take a long , hot bath . JK ... not really . Like I said , heat will help you relieve your cramps - so take advantage of that and relax in a warm bath . Aaahhhh ... feels better already , right ? <h> Stay Away From Coffee <p> If you 're anything like me , you reach for a cup of coffee every morning no matter what else is happening . Um , maybe do n't do that when you have cramps . Caffeine will actually make them a lot worse . Stick to decaf coffee or just some herbal tea . <h> Head To The Doctor <p> If you 're reading this and thinking , " I 've tried all these things , and NONE OF THEM WORK , " you should probably go to a doctor .

While I get the purpose behind this , I have to tell you guys that it 's a bad idea . You 're sweating down there because you 're hot - do you really think adding extra material is going to make things better ? It might soak up your sweat , but it will also make you sweat more , and it will be uncomfortable . Avoid using panty liners or maxi pads ( if you do n't have your period ) to avoid more irritation to the area . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Get Rid Of Your Pubic Hair <p> What you choose to do with your pubic hair is your business , but it 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatier . Again , your vag is sweating because you 're hot , so anything extra down there is going to make it worse . Pubic hair will make you warmer , and it will also trap sweat . If you 're cool with removing it , try shaving or waxing . Being bare might help . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Wear Loose Clothing <p> Opt for loose clothing on the days you know you 're going to be seriously sweating . Tight clothing makes you feel more hot , so it makes you sweat more . It also shows sweat stains more . Palazzo pants are a great option for summer . They 're typically made of light material , so they wo n't be too warm , and they look so cute . If you ca n't imagine wearing pants , go for loose and breezy shorts or a skirt rather than denim shorts or a tight mini skirt . <h> Try Anthony No Sweat Body Defense <p> There are some products out here that are made to deal with down there sweat . I usually do n't recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive area . But Anthony No Sweat Body Defense was made with crotch sweat and chub rub in mind . It 's definitely worth trying . If you 're going to use it , just do n't put it IN your vag , unless you want an infection . <h> Choose Cotton Underwear <p> If you 're trying to combat vag sweat , you should avoid all underwear fabrics except for cotton . Lace looks sexy , but it will make your sweat worse . And silk ? Forget about it . Opt for cotton material because it 's breathable and more comfortable in the heat . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Opt For Moisture-Wicking Materials <p> You can also choose moisture-wicking underwear or pants if you really want to step up your sweat defenses . If you 're going to be exercising or you do a sport , you should definitely buy yourself some moisture-wicking underwear . It 's made for sweaty situations , so you know it works . <h> Try Lush Silky Underwear Powder <p> I mention this Lush powder in every article I write about sweat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's made for your more sensitive areas , and it will help keep chafing and sweat at bay . If you want to use this down there , again , do n't put it inside your vag . <h> Use Baby Powder <p> Do n't want to get all fancy with special powders ? You can use baby powder in a pinch . Baby powder helps with chafing and sweating , and is usually sensitive enough to be used in your vaginal area . Still , do n't get it inside you and do n't use too much .

Not exactly in a good way dating will always be complicated , confusing , and weird just in a different way . Seniors : its time to leave those immature , awful dating habits in high school where they belong . College dating and " real world " dating is not the same , and its better you learned that now . <p> That 's not to say that there 's anything wrong with high school dating habits . There is n't ! Learning to date is frustrating AF , and the habits you have before college fit the environment you were in they just wont work as you get older . If you want a fair shot at finding a healthy relationship and lasting love after high school , its time to try something different . A lot of the dating habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your BFF talk to your crush for you ? Yeah , that wo n't fly once graduation is behind you . Writing cute notes to each other in class ? Unfortunately , this is a sweet little flirting method that does n't  stand the test of time . So , what do you need to do differently in order to find a potential bae ? Here are 20 awful dating habits to ditch before you go to college : - <p> 1 ) Expecting your boyfriend or girlfriend to be a mind reader . <p> No one is going to know that you 're mad at them , unless you say the words , " I 'm mad at you because you did something . " Scowling and being passive aggressive is annoying and it gets no one anywhere good . <p> 2 ) Comparing your relationship to others . <p> Everyones situation is different . Do n't  get caught up in where these other people went for Valentines Day , or the fact that they said " I love you " before you did , or how crazy photogenic they both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be infinitely happier for it . <p> 3 ) Thinking all boys are the same . <p> If you 're an advocate for gender equality , do n't  run around and say harmful stuff like , " Boys are so dumb . " Generalizing a whole gender based on one bad experience you had with a guy hurts everyone . ( However , calling out chronic man-splainers and problematic language is totes okay . ) <p> 4 ) Pretending to be interested in something you 're not to please someone else . <p> Especially if someones pressuring you into sex or making excuses for shitty behavior : do n't  be cool with it if you really are n't  . Speak up . <p> 6 ) Dating someone so you 're not alone . <p> Being single is n't the worst thing in the world . Its actually *better* than being with someone you 're not into for the sake of NOT being single . <p> 7 ) Social media oversharing . <p> Omg they 're in your bio on every site , they 're tagged in every post , your love letters are all over their Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few posts is fine , but basically making all of your profiles fan-pages for your significant other is excessive . <p> 8 ) Obsessively stalking their social media pages . <p> It does n't  seem like a big deal until you 're pretending that what they 're talking about on the date is brand new information and not something you read off of Google . <p> No ones cool when it comes to dating . Quit pretending you do n't  have your phone on you all the time . Just text someone back when they text you . Sheesh . <p> 11 ) Being on your phone while you 're on a date . <p> Dude , no . Why would you ? <p> 12 ) Having shallow deal breakers . <p> They 're too short , tall , thin , fat , of a different race , or totally different than you 've pictured your dream man . So ? Give them a shot . Having deal breakers is totally okay , but if all of your deal breakers are based on looks , you need to reevaluate your deal breakers . <p> 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up with you ! That 's not how you have a disagreement . If you 're using an ultimatum to get your way every time you two hit some turbulence , use a different tactic . Constant deal breakers are immature . <p> 14 ) Letting friends have too much of a say in your relationship . <p> Your friends have an important opinion and they have your best interest in mind . However , letting them have too much sway and influence in your relationship is unhealthy . Were so easily influenced by our friends in high school , but afterwards , that space is necessary . <p> 15 ) Telling your friends literally everything you do together . <p> I believe everyone kisses and tells to some degree . Still , your friends do n't  need to be all up in your business about everything that goes down between you and your significant other . Going to your friends for advice is always cool , but borderline making a press release every time something major happens between you two totally alienates the person you 're with . <p> 16 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all have that friends who falls off the face of the Earth when they 're in a relationship <p> 17 ) Thinking you can change them . <p> You are going to magically make them not an ass hole anymore with your *love* . Nobody changes for anybody , unless they really want to , and let 's be real , not everybody wants to . <p> 18 ) Making sex the main event . <p> I blame being in a hurry to lose your virginity in high school . All hooks are based on how close or far you came to having sex . Not every hook up has to be about getting it on . <p> 19 ) Being in a rush to fall in love . <p> Do n't  put that pressure on yourself , you 'll give yourself anxiety ! Love will arrive when its supposed to , and when it does , it will be awesome . Patience , everybody . <p> 20 ) Believing a relationship will solve all of your problems . <p> Being in a relationship will not make you happier , have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prettier . It takes whatevers there and turns up the volume because now you 're sharing what you 're working with with another person . <p> Which of these bad dating habits are you guilty of ?

For 2016 , try focusing on something else : the bad habits you need to stop doing . <p> We all have a bad habit that we indulge in even though we know its wrong . Sometimes we decide to look the other way , because we feel like we can just let some things slide . While its unrealistic to think we will get rid of all of our bad habits ( not just in a year , but always ) , its also foolish to never confront them . Some bad habits truly are making our lives harder , and by making an effort to stop indulging in them we can make ourselves happier and more confident . Sounds nice , right ? <p> I do n't  know your life or what you do with your free time , but I 'm going to go ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the bad habits below . Ill be honest with you guys : I 've done them all . As the new year starts , let 's all focus on becoming our best selves and say goodbye to the habits holding us back . Here are 20 bad habits you need to get rid of in 2016 : <p> 1 . Facebook stalking your ex . <p> I know , I know . You really want to know what your ex is doing and who they 're doing it with . And social media makes it so easy to find out ! But you know what ? Stalking your ex online wont help you move on , it will just keep you in the past . Let it go . <p> 2 . Facebook stalking every single girl your crush/S.O. talks to . <p> I totally get the curiosity over the girls bae is talking to . But looking at pictures from 2008 after someone liked a photo of his dog ? You need to chill . That kind of behavior just leads to obsession , which only makes you feel crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . <p> This sounds corny , but guess what ? You 're pretty awesome . You 're also smart and you know what 's best for you . Trust your gut ! Make 2016 the year you stop second guessing everything you think or feel . <p> 4 . Washing your hair every single day . <p> I do n't  care if you think its gross its not . Washing your hair every day is bad for your hair . Go two days without washing it . Yes , it will feel greasy in the beginning , but that 's why dry shampoo was invented . Use it . And wait it out once your hair adjusts to the new routine , it stops feeling greasy . I promise . <p> 5 . Obsessing over Instagram likes . <p> Yeah , getting a lot of likes on a picture you took is pretty cool . But its not all life is about . I 've found myself worrying about this more than once , and I hate it ! Let 's stop focusing on what others think on Instagram this year . <p> 6 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This whole thing where being vulnerable and honest about your feelings is seen as lame is so annoying . Why do you need to act like you do n't  care when you actually care very much ? The ONLY person you 're hurting when you do that is you . Its ridiculous . <p> 7 . Thinking about your weight constantly . <p> If you want to lose weight , that 's totally fine . I would never tell you that you cant feel that way . Despite what everyone preaches about body acceptance , its still okay to want to lose a few pounds . But do n't  obsess over it . Do n't  make it your whole life . Your weight does not define you . <p> 8 . Spending all of your extra money on food . <p> Food is great , but if you find that ALL of your money is going towards buying snacks and coffee and fast food and lunch and dinner and fourth meal , please take a step back . You have to learn to save money ! You also have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things instead of trying to change them . <p> If you 're constantly complaining about something that you have n't even attempted to change even though you could , you need to stop . Not only is it annoying for everyone else to hear , but its also not doing you any good its just making you more negative . Make 2016 the year that you start trying to change the things that you complain about the most . Who knows , you just might make life better for you . <p> 10 . Binge-watching TV every spare second of your life . <p> I LOVE binge-watching Netflix . I 'm currently watching Parenthood and I 'm obsessed . I want to do it all the time . And while there 's nothing wrong with binge-watching , it should n't be the only way you spend your free time . Try doing other things , like seeing your friends , or reading or hanging out with your family or going for a walk . Trust me on this one . <p> 11 . Buying things you do n't  really need . <p> As a shopaholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can tell you that a lot of you are probably spending a lot of money on things you do n't  really need . 2016 should be the year you start to pay attention to money and only purchase things you really want or need . <p> 12 . Ignoring your mental health . <p> Mental health has such a stigma surrounding it , which sucks . I know so many people who could really benefit from therapy or medication , but they refuse to try it . If you 're feeling very stressed or anxious , know that it might be something you need professional help for . If you feel depressed , know you can talk to someone about that . Just do n't  act like it is n't happening . <p> 13 . Being passive aggressive online . <p> If you spent 2015 sub-tweeting and bragging about how cool your new friends are hoping your old friends will it and get jealous stop that right now . Being passive-aggressive online is so immature and it needs to stop . Learn how to confront your issues rather than making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone . <p> Okay , so I do n't  care what anyone says , its not okay to snoop through your S.O.s phone or email or Facebook messages or anything . Do n't  do it . Make a promise to yourself that you wo n't do it in 2016 . <p> 15 . Lying about your feelings instead of confronting someone . <p> If you 're hurt , tell the person who hurt you that you 're upset . If you 're angry , be honest with your friend or crush or family member instead of acting like its fine . Stop lying about your feelings just because confrontation is hard . It sucks , but its so important . <p> 16 . Sleeping late every single day . <p> By sleeping late I mean waking up late and then rushing around like a maniac to get to wherever you need to be . A stressful morning is the worst start to your day . Start waking up a little earlier and give yourself some time to get ready in the AM . <p> 17 . Relying on your parents for everything . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's great . My parents always did everything for me , which was wonderful . But now I 'm an adult and its not so wonderful . I do n't  know how to do basic adult things because I never had to do them before ! Its so frustrating . Maybe my parents spoiled me , but I also wish I took the initiative and learned how to be independent . <p> 18 . Complaining about things you have no control over . <p> Yes , the weather can be SO annoying . OMG I know , traffic is so frustrating . Yeah , politicians are huge jerks and they lie about everything . This is all true . But if you spend endless hours complaining about things you have no control over , you 're just making yourself feel miserable and angry . Its okay to speak your opinion , but at the end of the day , accept that some things just suck . <p> 19 . Viewing exercise as a chore . <p> If you only look at exercise as something that sucks and has to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less stressed . It also keeps you healthy . Start looking at it as " me " time and start enjoying it . <p> 20 . Telling yourself you are n't  good enough . <p> You 're awesome . Stop acting like you are n't  . <p> Which of these bad habits do you have ? What did we forget about ? Tell us in the comments .

She goes to school , comes home , does some homework , then repeats the whole thing over again . That all changes when she meets a strange girl named Kiki Strike who introduces her to a new clique .

There have been lots of reports about negative effects of diet soda that have had questionable results and findingsno ones really sure if it causes cancer ( so far , you 'd have to drink a whole lot for a really , really long time to show any changesand theyve only studied mice , so take it with an enormous grain of salt ) or makes you gain weight by increasing cravings for sweets ( what a cruel world ! ) .

Yikes ! <p> New studies have found that people who drink four or more sodas of any kind every day were 30 percent more likely to suffer from depression that people who did n't  drink as much soda at all .

Phew , that 's a lot of numbersgot all that ? <p> Good , because there 's more : Diet soda is n't the only culprit . Apparently diet fruit drinks might bum people out , too .

That would be terrible for the aquatic life . But maybe just do n't  drink so much of any one thing all of the time , whether its diet soda , fruity diet drinks or regular stuff .

@@45901228 @5901228/ <p> Well , I 'll let my reaction to Lily Allens latest video for " Hard Out Here " explain. - A lot of people are praising it for its cutting critique of how sexist the music industry is . I understand why my fellow feminists have a lot of love for the video : it is a satire that slams body shaming and the exploitation of womens bodies- and I love when women within the industry bring this to light . <p> What I 'm not as in love with is her use of predominantly , black womens bodies twerking and gyrating- to prove her point about the lengths the industry will go to exploit womens bodies . But in response to her critics who claim that that portrayal was racist , Allen said that the video had nothing to do with race and everything to do with gender . <p> Um , what ? Look , I know that we live in a sexist society that loves to strip women down to nothing more than object status , but are we really going to ignore the fact that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its usually black women who do the butt shaking ? Are we really going to pretend that black women are n't  disproportionately depicted in this manner or are we going to glaze past that and just look at it as women in general ? How are we going to challenge this when were going around pretending that women are affected by sexist crap in the same exact way ? <p> See , this is my problem with the way that feminist issues are often explored : - Many feminists approach feminism as the fight for gender equality , but what does equality between men and women even mean when there is n't even equality among women ? When you 're a woman who fits into other marginalized groupsdue to race , your sexual identity , your class , etcyou might feel like the problems that you face as a woman are n't  really addressed in a lot of feminist discussions because your struggles are either ignored entirely or treated as a niche issue . <p> For example , I 've sat in plenty of gender studies classes in school and had to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feminist issue or race is a distraction. - Well , what am I supposed to do ? Apologize and say , " whoops , sorry , let me just ignore the fact that I 'm black for a few minutes and just focus on the woman part of my identity . " <p> I cant do that . Being black is a part of my reality of being a woman . I do n't  choose one or the other ! So when feminist issues are approached in a way that only talks about gender , I ca n't help but feel alienated . Im asked to ignore my blackness for the cause and that 's unfair . <p> My point is that sometimes mainstream feminism just doest care about marginalized woman . It already feels like anytime there are big strides made in gender equality , they happen to straight , white women first and foremost . Brown chicks ? Queer women ? Oh , theyll get their chance later ! Theyll just have to wait their turn ! <p> Yeah , I 'm not feeling that . <p> Some of you young feminists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to do about it ? " Well , I 'm not expecting you to single-handedly dismantle the patriarchy , white supremacy or hetero-normativity overnight . I mean , if you could do that that would be great and much appreciated , but I 'm going to assume that that 's a little tricky to accomplish right now . <p> Honestly , my only suggestion is this : Become a feminist who cares about and fights for the inequality and disadvantages of every kind of woman , even if those problems do n't  personally affect you . The lack of women of color on Saturday Night Live is a feminist issue . Care about it ! The lack of rights that transgender teen girls have is a feminist issue ! Care about that , too ! Things that screw over all kinds women are feminist issues that you should care about and sometimes those problems include racism , homophobia , classism , and more . <p> That 's what solidarity looks like , its about fighting until things start looking up for all kinds of women , not just women in generalwhatever that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  addressed in feminist discussions ? What do you wish feminists would spend more time focusing on ? Tell us in the comments ! <p> I think as a woman of a very mixed background . I think I see people try to twist it to a vision that just suits them . We need to stop fighting eachother . Acknowleging that there are different view points and try to support all view points <p> If I was to try to find something in feminism to suit me exclusively I would never find it If I was looking for race and gender Because I am so mixed . Both parents were mixed , all grandparnets and great grand parents . I am mostly caucausian in genetic make up and I look light skined .. but it is golden because of the hispanic and black part that is added into the mix I always get strangers trying to tell me I am not acting black enough , or asking If I am Egyptian , or what part of India my family is from ( even though there is no Egytian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I look like There would be nothing out there Black or White or what ever race of women it would n't really apply to me <p> I think we should learn to listen to eachother . <p> morag <p> Nope sorry , teenage transgendered girls are not part of my feminism . Trans women will never really be women b/c they do n't  suffer the unique sex based oppression that we do . Womens shared girlhood experiences matter , which is why WOC need to be given a louder voice in feminism . Men , albeit gender nonconforming ? Not so much . <p> suzana <p> perfect , totally agree with you . women have to start thinking about ourselves . gay/trans dudes are not a matter for feminism , they have gay movement to take care about them . i 'm interested in only female issues . <p> about race : i 'm a brazilian woman of color and kinda agree and disagree with the author . the focus of feminism MUST be combat misoginy , rape culture , street harassment , prostitution , domestic violence , female murders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL of us , but mostly the poorest women ( what means women of color , women of third world , poor women , mostly ) . here abortion is illegal but rich woman still do that because they have money to pay , to educate themselves about it , to get safe and out of prison ) . poor woman suffer more with this issue . the same is true for prostitution ( most prostitutes are poor and women of color ) , domestic violence ( more common in poor areas ) , etc . <p> but we do have to pay attention how patriarchy affects different races , sexual orientations and economic classes . i really like allens videoclip , but i 'm disapointed with her answer ( i thought her choice to put black women there was to show how racist this clips are too ) . here we have a problem with how maids are underpaid and have less work rights , and most of them are poor black woman . does it mean upper classes women are not our allies ? of course not , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access and change politics and corporations to make it fair for all women . i endorse white upper class female candidates ( we have less than 10% os congress seats ) despite our differences <p> sorry for english mistakes <p> FoxxyRoxxy <p> I think that was part of the point she was trying to make .

It just seems silly to get mad because someone else " acts black " while at the same time also being mad because we show black people " acting black . " Its either a baseless stereotype or the reason why black women are portrayed this way is because they *are* the predominate image for this behavior . <p> Then again , perhaps the point of Lilys video was to point out that stereotype , and that no women should be portrayed that way . <p> bgurrl <p> Twerking is from Africa <p> Samantha Escobar <p> You know what sucks ?

Alas , from her own defensive blog post , it seems like she was inexplicably unaware sobummer . Big ol bummer . <p> shingekim <p> I agree , and this was very well said . Feminism is not even unique in being exclusive to some of its own members . For example , the LGBT movement , while ostensibly about equality for all lesbians , gays , bisexuals , and trans* people , is still often very forgetful of ( or downright unwelcoming to ) bisexuals and trans* people . Ive encountered a lot of judgement within the LGBT movement as a bisexual woman , even from those who have been discriminated against their whole lives for their sexuality . Youd think there would be more sympathy , and yet I 'm frequently treated as though my sexuality is made up , or that I 'm a slutty nymphomaniac . As though I am doing it for attention . I cant even imagine what trans* people experience . <p> On that note , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my experience , the same people who talk of intersectionality are often those who treat me as nothing but a " privileged white girl " . Yes , I AM well aware of my privilege in society as a white person , and I try to keep it in mind as often as I can and learn about it . That does n't  mean I have privilege in every aspect of my life . I 'm a lower-middle class woman in a relationship with another woman . Being white does not exempt me from prejudice about my sexuality , and it does not make me magically rich and powerful . Being white does n't  make misogynistic jokes any less hurtful . Privilege is not a matter of 1s and 0s . This is exactly what intersectionality is all about , and yet its often ignored by those who discuss it . <p> Simone <p> I understand with the video , but just because people mis understand with a video does n't  mean the ENTIRE world of Feminism is leaving out women of color .

No matter what kind of anxiety someone suffers from , one thing is certain : Its definitely something that should be taken seriously . Its not just an excuse for a pity party , its a disorder that can be incredibly debilitating ! <p> Some of our readers have to deal with anxiety issues on a daily basis . If this applies to you or someone you know , you 'll definitely relate to these 15 comments about anxiety . <p> I was diagnosed with a rare brain condition June of 2013 along with G.A.D. I was told by doctors I would n't be able to work or live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time high stress level job &amp; do it all without taking my prescribed medications .

Stay strong &amp; remember you 're loved ! <p> Ayesha <p> I have PTSD and Anxiety . I 'm suffering from panic attacks and nightmares , I wake up screaming because I feel like its happening to me , I was abused when I young by my bfs father . Ive been bullied my whole life and I live in this constant fear of upsetting people and saying or doing the wrong thing . People blame me for everything , they tell me I should be myself and then they tell I should n't because that 's not who they want me to be , I have this fear , this anxiety of being rejected by being me . I 've already rejected myself , there 's not much else they can do . Im scared that someones going to push me away when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up myself . My anxiety causes me to push people away so I do n't  get hurt again . <p> Nia <p> I 've had anxiety since I was about 13 , and it has worsened with age and experience .

Ive been on escitalopram for my anxiety for about a year now and I have seen a HUGE difference . I 've failed my drivers exam 5 times since 12th grade because I would be too nervous to function , but now that I 've found a medicinal regimen that works for me , I feel a lot more confident and I know I 'll get my drivers license the next time I take the exam !

If you 're a music fan ( and , honestly , who the hell is n't ? ) , then one of your favorite artists- probably- released a killer album this year . Whether you 're a hip-hop head , a top-40 pop fan , or an indie-rock snob , you got a little somethin somethin musically this year . In fact , there were so many great songs that its been almost impossible to choose a small selection of the best songs of the year . <p> This isnt- Pitchfork , were not a team of music journalists and it can be really tough to decide which , of the hundreds of songs released in the past 365 days , were superior . But we know what songs make us feel good , what songs were massive hits , what songs were impossible to ignore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liiiiiiiit , TBH .

Whether you like em or not , you cant say that they did n't  define the year . <p> 1 . Solange Do n't  Touch My Hair <p> If you thought that Solange was just Beyonces sister who wears dope outfits and beats up Jay-Z in elevators , she definitely proved you wrong with this one . This testament to the humanity of black women is pleasing to the ear and the video is a visual orgasm . <p> 2 . Ariana Grande So Into You <p> I think this is the one Ariana Grande song that everyone on the planet can agree is a total bop , whether you like pop music or not . Its fun , vibrant , and makes you want to dance . <p> 3 . D.R.A.M . featuring Lil Yachty Broccoli <p> This song is just sojoyous .

Chance The Rapper ft. 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne No Problem <p> Chance the Rapper- blew up in 2016 , and if anyone in the industry deserves it , its him . " No Problem " is a bop that will likely continue to be a bop in 2017 . Plus , am I the only one who low key- feels like a boss when this song comes on ? <p> 6 . The 1975 Somebody Else <p> If anyone is going to make 80s synth pop popular again , its the 1975 , and they definitely make a strong case for it with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I was n't a huge fan of- The Life Of Pablo , but the intro of this song was enough to make this song a winner .

If you 've never heard of her , take the plunge and check out " Shut Up And Kiss Me . " Most of her music is pretty mellow and folksy , but this is a fun detour . <p> 10 . Beyonce Formation <p> " Formation " played all of us , because we watched this video and thought that 2016 was going to be lit because Beyonce was back and ruling the world . Unfortunately , even Beyonce couldnt undo the garbage of this year , but this song definitely brings us back to a simpler time when the biggest controversy was the fact that she sang this at the Super Bowl . <p> 11 . Kanye West No More Parties In LA <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , this song , featuring Kendrick Lamar , was a bright spot . The flow is on point , the beat is killer , and Kanye almost feels likedare I say itthe old Kanye . <p> 12 .

Nothing , and Phantogram proved it . <p> 14 .

Shawn Mendes Treat You Better <p> Confession : I wanted to hate this song so badlybut after hearing it for the 28th time , I gave in and realized that it is such a perfectly crafted sensitive man pop song .

Kanye West Ultralight Beam <p> " We on an ultralight beam , we on an ultralight beam ! " - When this tune dropped , that was literally all anyone could talk about on social media , and for good reason . This is the kind of song that will even make an atheist sort of want to believe in God for , like , at least the duration of the song . <p> 21 . Beyonce Sorry <p> " Sorry " is the ultimate break up song , the ultimate " men are garbage " song , the ultimate " I 'm a boss ass bitch " song , the ultimate " you tried it " song . Beyonce has never made calling someone out seem more fun than this . <p> 22 . Radiohead Burn The Witch <p> If you 're a Radiohead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band releasing a new album .

Hip hop might not be your thing , but you have to admit that her flow OBLITERATES most male rappers in the game right now . <p> 24 . David Bowie Lazarus <p> This song is hard to listen to now that David Bowie is gone , but its a great closing to a legendary career . <p> 25 . Rihanna Needed Me <p> Rih Rihs album , - Anti , disappointed some people who wanted the whole album to be full of clubby bangers like some of her previous hits .

Kiiara Gold <p> Its usually a songs chorus that will get you hooked , and before you know it you 're singing it to yourself all the time . Well , the chorus of " Gold " is straight up indecipherable , which makes it vaguely frustrating when its stuck in your head . But , hey , this song is such a banger that you straight up forget that you have no idea what the chorus is . <p> 28 . Calvin Harris ft . Rihanna This Is What You Came For <p> Who else went , " wait , that makes so much sense " the second they found out that Taylor Swift actually penned the lyrics to this song ? Well , Taylor can write a pop hit like a champ , but Rihanna was the perfect choice for this- Calvin Harris dance track . <p> 29 .

If you ask me , he can out rap plenty of hip hop darlings but that 's another debate for another time . <p> 30 . Ariana Grande ft . Nicki Minaj Side to Side <p> This music video feels like an ad for SoulCycle sex ( I mean , there 's a reference to dick bicycles ) , but whatever .

How much hair should you be losing in the shower ?

I cant tell you how many times I 've felt a tinge of fear at the amount of hair that seems to have fallen out of my head as I wash it , but I too have been reassured that its okay to lose hair in the shower . Still feeling hesitant ? Let 's speak to an expert . I brought in my friend- Dr. Sherry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package you need to check out ) to discuss this . <p> Dr. Ross said , " It may surprise you that each of us normally lose or shed up to 100 hairs a day .

" <p> So if its normal for you to she 'd in the shower , then how do you know when something bad is going on ? Dr. Ross said : " When should you be concerned ? If you start to notice a significant change in the amount of hair you find in your hair brush or on the shower walls , or if you notice bald spots or clumps of hair falling out from your scalp . If its a big difference , you should bring it to the attention of your health care provider . " <p> That said , its also normal for the amount of hair you lose to fluctuate a little bit . One shower you might notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bunch more . I 've personally noticed that I always have more stray hairs if I 've gone a few days without washing it , have had it up in a messy bun , and have used a lot of dry shampoo . Like Dr. Ross said , its not a health care issue until its a significant amount more , you 've noticed patchy bald spots , or if large clumps of hair fall out for no reason ( i.e. you 're not showering or brushing it ) . So if you 're really worried , pay attention to how much hair is falling out but in general , if you were having a serious hair loss problem , you would probably know . <p> If you 're really stressed , head to the doctor to make sure everything is okay . Hair loss is not reserved for older people or sick people , and many young women experience it when they least expect it . Its definitely a valid concern , but again , it would probably be more dramatic if it was a serious issue . Good luck !

While some classic trends will always be around red lipstick and winged eyeliner , of course many trends are just that : trends . Theyre super popular for a few months , or even years , then they die out and are fondly ( or not so fondly ) remembered . This is necessary , in order to make way for new trends that well either love or make fun of . And 2015 was a year of many new beauty trends. - <p> From crazy hair colors and styles to makeup trends that seem weird but are actually awesome , there were tons of cool ideas out there this year . If you have n't tried at least one of the below beauty trends , what are you waiting for ? ! Youve still got a few weeks of 2015 left , so make them count . I 'm sure a few of these will live on into 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2015 : <p> Remember when you were a kid and half-up/half-down hairstyles were SUPER popular ( I do ) ? Well , this year , it returned , but in bun form . This half up bun was literally everywhere this past year , from celebs on the red carpet to style bloggers to " normal " people . Its cute , its easy , and its different so personally , I hope it sticks around for a little while longer . <p> Brightly colored hair was SO popular this year that it became impossible to tell what was fake extensions , what was mainly a filter , and what was real . Rainbow hair made a big splash , and while its gorgeous to look at , I cant imagine its healthy . But hey , let 's hear it for fun hair ! <p> A photo posted by KristinaLahairstyle ( @kristinalahairsyle ) on Dec 14 , 2015 at 12:41pm PST <p> I have naturally dark blonde hair , and dye it a much lighter blonde . I get my roots touched up like clockwork every six weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past year , I think I got more compliments on my visible roots than I did on my actual hair color . My colorist even told me that people come in literally asking for roots . Visible roots were a big trend for 2015 , and honestly , I hope they stick around . Not only do they help keep hair healthier , they also save you money ! <p> Asian beauty products almost always make a splash in the US , so its not surprising that this year , we were supposed with Korean beauty even more than normal . Korean beauty products work so well and have the absolute coolest packaging . Definitely one of the better trends of the year . <p> The most popular form of Korean beauty ? Sheet masks . Definitely sheet masks . While these have obviously been around since before 2015 , we really saw them blow up in the last few months . I couldnt be happier about it sheet masks work SO well and they also look ridiculously creepy and cool . My recommendation ? Anything from Dr. Jart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional beauty standards . One of the most important ways we did that was females showing off their body hair armpits , legs , pubes , and all . There 's absolutely nothing wrong with getting rid of your body hair ( I wax everything ! ) , but if you want to embrace it , go for it ! I love that 2015 let us feel comfortable enough to do that . <p> Are glitter roots practical ? No , not really . Could they ruin your hair ? I do n't  know , but I cant say no for sure . Do they look amazingly cool ? Yes , yes they do . Sometimes its fun to play around with your hair instead of being serious all the time . 2015 was definitely the year in which we were able to try new things with our strands , and this was one of the most fun styles . <p> Move over traditional facial cleansers 2015 brought us cleansing waters , and they rock . Does cleansing water work better than , you know , water ? I think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeup , feels light and gentle , and makes my skin soft . These are definitely worth trying , and I bet theyll be around for a long time . <p> This was one of my favorite hair trends of the year . Sunset hair is exactly what it sounds like bright hair with multiple colors that remind you of a sunset . A little impractical , I guess , but gorgeous nonetheless . <p> A photo posted by S A M A N T H A RAVNDAHL. ( @ssssamanthaa ) on Aug 3 , 2015 at 12:58pm PDT <p> I was n't a huge fan of gray hair until I saw it on my girl Samantha Ravndahl . Samantha had THE most gorgeous color of gray/silver hair and really converted me to accept the Granny hair trend . Kind of sad to see it go , as its been dying out already . <p> I do n't  know why " bronde " became a thing , since its basically just light brown/dark blonde hair with highlights and that has been around forever , but it did , and Blake Lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronde was so popular this year . Its a much more natural color that is n't very high maintenance , which is nice . Sometimes we just needed a break from those rainbow styles ! <p> Pastel hair in general was huge this year , and it eventually became known as mermaid hair . I think this is easily my favorite hair trend of the year because the colors are just so beautiful . I wish I had the guts to do this ! <p> A photo posted by King Kylie ( @kyliejenner ) on Dec 5 , 2015 at 8:45pm PST <p> Thanks in part to Kylie Jenner and crew , brown lipstick that was reminiscent of the 90s was huge this year .

Not only is it totally normal for him to think about other people sexually , you 'll also never be able to control that and trying to do so is only going to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear ! But in order to move past this , you have to accept that . <p> I 'm not saying that you have to be happy about your boyfriend being sexually attracted to other girls your feelings are totally valid and you 're allowed to be sad but I do think you need to learn how to deal with it without making yourself feel really bummed out and anxious . You will never know exactly what your boyfriend is thinking about , or why he s thinking about it . Its completely out of your control , which means that stressing over it is kind of useless . You could end things with him because he was honest with you , but I can promise you that you 'll never meet someone who does n't  think about other people during solo sex sessions .

When it comes to what guys think about when masturbating , its usually very primal and just about what gets them off . That sounds gross and skeevy , but its true . <p> Heres what you need to remember : you cant tell your boyfriend what to think about , you cant control his mind , and you 'll never fully know what 's going on in his head .

Focus on the good things about your relationship . If you truly are n't  happy anymore , or you think something more shady is going on behind your back , then think about ending things . But to be completely honest with you , I think his behavior is pretty normal and not something to worry about . Like I said , you 're not going to find someone who does n't  think about other people in a sexual way but you will find someone who can lie about it . <p> Give yourself some time to accept and move past this .

While some of my friends made light of his racist statements and tried to keep things funny , I could n't help but feel incredibly uncomfortable . Its worth noting that I was the only person there who was n't white . When my friend asked me what was wrong , I said , " His policies make me afraid for my life and the life of my family , and I cant make a joke about it right now . " Cue everyone justifying themselves with a " But " statement . <p> This is only one of the many awkward moments I have had as the only person of color in a room . Being the only POC happens to me most of the time , although not necessarily all of the time. - I 'm aware that the above circumstance sounds dramatic , but in all truth , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often awkward than it is serious . I 'm fully aware that this rationalization may be a coping mechanism for this very situation being the majority of my life ( yes , even at family gatherings ) , but I have a feeling this happens to more people than just me . <p> For however much dialogue there is about race , racial tensions , and what it means to be a POC , there 's an equal amount of thought on white people and how they should behave and talk about race themselves . I know that race is everyones favorite low-stakes small talk conversation topic ( kidding ) , so this might feel weird to talk about , but bear with me . The frustrations my white friends feel is that they cant have an opinion about race because one of us POC is always there to " get angry . " Ahem , no . For me , the key to being a good ally is staying open , validating the other persons experience without attempting to correct or diagnose it , listening , and then amending your behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and you do n't  know what it is that people of color go through all the time , or you , like me , are frequently the only POC in the room , these 19 awkward AF things probably happen all the time .

How did this lecture hall get so white , I thought this was an environmental science class ? It truly ca n't be just *me* . <p> 3 ) After a quick interaction , you can tell if someones going to be okay with being called out . <p> Youve developed a radar for people who are aware that the human experience is n't singular and those who are so self-involved that they are n't  open to discussion . The middle aged man who refused to acknowledge that Native Americans and Sheikhs werent appropriate mascots then accused me of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animals as mascots ? Not game for intelligent conversation . <p> 4 ) People try to be ethnically sensitive when pronouncing your name . <p> I used to get " Ah-lee Chun " all the time .

You know you can only speak to your experience of something , but people act as if you speak on behalf of everyone and that puts you in an awkward position . <p> 13 ) You 're very careful when articulating your point . <p> Using the exact words , politically correct phrasing , trying not to alienate everyone in the room . <p> 14 ) You 're very aware that you have to remain cheerful and non-threatening when making a point . <p> Or else you 're " angry " which leads people to believe your point is driven by emotions ( which does not make your point invalid ) , not facts ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of smiling while pointing out how Islamophobia hurts all people of Middle Eastern descent , which itself , is awkward and troubling . <p> 15 ) You feel obligated to read up on every piece of criticism and news item when it comes to race . <p> Just so no one sneak attacks you and shames you for being a bad " un-woke " POC . <p> Or debates ! I used to hate those . Of course , its important for all to experience , but how do you tell the teacher that this is n't news to you ? How do you tell the authority figure who thought up this idea in the first place that giving your fellow classmates a forum to deny police brutality in a debate in the name of education is deeply troubling ? <p> 17 ) You have to loop in white feminists when discussing gender equality . <p> Race plays a big part in feminism .

When the toothpaste dries and loses its tingle , wipe it away with a warm cloth and gently rub the area from the center outwards to encourage recirculation of the trapped blood . This trick only works sparingly . To avoid irritating the skin with excess toothpaste use , be sure to only do this maybe one a day . You do n't want to do more harm than good . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Freeze A Metal Spoon <p> If you have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . Put a metal spoon in the freezer for 15 minutes then place the convex end of it on your hickey to restrict your blood vessels , making them appear less red .

Again , doing this on a fresh hickey is the best , but it should also help you if you 've only just noticed it a few hours after the fact . To make the cold last longer , run the spoon under some water before you put it in the freezer. 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Use A Hot Compress <p> For long term hickeys that wo n't go away , you may need to use heat . Blood that 's been trapped in one area for a long time is going to need some encouragement from the heat to get it moving again . You do n't need to go out and buy a hot compress - a washcloth in hot water will do just fine .

Honestly , though ? It still is a big deal , at least to me . I recently went on a date with someone I met online , and it was not easy for me . I 've avoided online dating for as long as I could , and 95 percent of the reason was because I was scared of actually meeting up with someone . I never had any idea how my peers did it . But after much deliberation and chatting , I decided to do it : I met someone from online dating and hung out IRL. - I 'm never going to see him again , he is not my boyfriend , but I did not get kidnapped , which is always a positive . <p> What was it like ?

Here are the 20 stages of going on a date with someone you met online. - <p> Oh , and guys ? It should be said that , legally , if you are under 18 , I do n't  think you should meet up with an internet stranger without parental consent or supervision . Your Tumblr bestie who lives across the country ? Take your mom . Seriously . A guy who claims to be your soul mate ? Do n't  do it without a friend or a public space . BE CAREFUL . Just because my experience was good does n't  mean every experience is good . <p> 1 ) You select a person and determine that that person is n't a threat , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via messages or texting . Do they sound real and genuine ? Does it feel like you have a good rapport and things in common ? If were being real , having good text chemistry is vital its how you talk to most of the people in your life , so having a good messaging relationship with the person you 're prospectively dating is a no brainer . <p> 2 ) You do a lot of research . <p> This is what I called it instead of " combing their messages for red flags that they 're *really* not who they say they are . " For example , if they give you the name of the company they work for and the neighborhood they work in , Google it . See if its real . <p> 3 ) You brainstorm conversation topics that are n't  on their profile . <p> One of the big downfalls of online dating is that you have to make a profile with all of your hobbies , interests , family background , and personality . So , what is there to talk about when you 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Always Sunny in Philadelphia and that you 're both from New Jersey ? Bye bye , small talk . <p> 4 ) You ask your friends to review to double check . <p> Do they look legit ? Are they attractive ? Do these feel like outdated , old pictures and they might not be this person in real life ? Do they see anything alarming you might be missing ? <p> 5 ) Quit looking at profile so they stop getting notifications . <p> You get profile view notifications on most dating websites . Oops . Its hard out here for a habitual stalker <p> 6 ) Ask for their phone number to avoid future profile stalking . <p> First off , its so much easier to text than it is to check a whole separate message inbox . Most of all though , its super important that you call this person and chat on the phone for a little bit before you meet up with this person . Can you hold a real-time conversation ? Its it awful or does it flow naturally ? <p> 7 ) Seriously debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never giving any more internet strangers your real phone number . <p> Can you still text from your phone with Google voice ? Can someone tell me what 's up with this in the comments , please ? <p> 8 ) Pick out an outfit . <p> " I have nothing to wear ! " she shouts at her closet full of clothes , like she does before every date . <p> 9 ) Prepare your room so when Olivia Benson looks for evidence , you have everything prepared . <p> Okay cool , I 'm paranoid , leave me alone . I texted my best friend to let her know where I would be . I left a Post-It on my laptop with his username , phone number , and first name . Just in case . Because you never know .

Do n't  comb it over or spike it straight up because you 're fooling no one . Moving on . <p> 14 ) Attempt a normal conversation . <p> While , of course , reciting affirmations in your head - that you are safe in case your paranoia creeps up on you again . <p> 15 ) Have some good moments . <p> If your match percentage were a grade in school , it would be an A+ so of course you 're having an easy , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Weigh the pros and cons of going to a second location . <p> Is it dark out ?

DJ catches the boys drinking , and one of the a-holes sprays beer all over her in retaliation for calling them out . She 's pissed and decides to mock them by grabbing the beer and pretending to offer them a drink . But--DUN DUN DUN--Uncle Jesse spots this and thinks that DJ is the one who was drinking . <p> DJ is in a ton of trouble and tries to tell everyone--her uncles , her dad--that she was n't the one drinking--but despite being a " good kid " nobody believes her because she lied about something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Kevin eventually owns up that he and his crappy friends were the ones drinking , and then Danny Tanner feels guilty and apologizes to DJ . If I were DJ , I 'd hold that over him for life , but I 'm petty so ... <p> Full House/ABC <h> ' Shape Up ' <p> This is , hands down , one of the most iconic Full House episodes ever . Basically , DJ is nervous about Kimmy 's upcoming pool party and thinks she 'll look terrible in a bathing suit unless she looks like a model . Before I get snarky , I do want to point out that eating disorders and fad diets were n't subjects that were being tackled when this aired in the early ' 90s , so props to the show runners for bringing it to light in a big way . <p> However , this episode was just loaded with cheese . It was like a pizza with extra cheese and a cheese stuffed crust . None of the adults question DJ 's sudden interest in being healthy or losing weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really lose the pounds . Uh , dude , should n't you be wondering why your niece feels the need to lose weight in the first place ? In the course of 22 or so minutes we witness DJ skip meals and plaster the fridge with pictures of models for thinspo , and only her little sister Stephanie notices that something is up . It is n't until DJ passes out at the gym that everybody else grows concerned and daddy Tanner eventually has to have a heart to heart with DJ about looking beautiful no matter what . Cute ... I guess . But like most TV shows that have a special episode about eating disorders , they 're often not that easy to get rid of , so the situation resolving itself so quickly is so unrealistic .

Stephanie 's solution is to run away to Mexico , so she says her goodbyes before eventually being coaxed to come clean and tell her dad what happened . <p> Danny Tanner is mad AF , obviously , but Stephanie is worried he wo n't love her anymore and he assures her that that 's not the case . He still loves her , even though she ruined his finances for the foreseeable future . Wow , tender moments .

Cue eye rolling . Of course , the guys tell her that a real friend does n't pressure you into things you do n't want to do , that smoking is bad , etc .

At the end of the episode , Steph stands up to the mean girls and Mickey stands by her side ; they bond over ... not smoking in a middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes like this that take such a heavy handed approach to serious issues like smoking that make smoking seem cool .

Like ... that does n't really happen , y'all . <p> Full House/ABC <h> ' Making Out Is Hard To Do ' <p> Stephanie 's pal Gia ( yeah , they become friends ) hosts a party and promises to invite a boy , Bobby , who has the hots for Steph . When her pops Danny finds out about it and asks if there will be parental supervision , Gia lies and says yes . Stephanie still does n't realize that this is n't an average party and does n't know what 's really up until she shows up at Gia 's house with a board game . Surprise , Steph !

Uh oh <p> There 's a moral lesson somewhere here about not having a party without permission and to tell the truth and stuff , but the focus should have really been about not being pressured to make out with boys you do n't know just so you can look cool . <p> Full House/ABC <h> ' Stephanie 's Wild Ride ' <p> Stephanie and her friend Gia want to look cool for these Cool ' 90s Teen BoysG they just met at the mall .

Cool . Well , Stephanie tells DJ about her wild adventure , and DJ freaks out like a normal person would . When Gia invites Stephanie to join the boys on another joyride , DJ threatens to narc on her if she goes , so Stephanie declines the invite and has a tantrum . But apparently it 's good that she did n't go , because dad tells her that Gia was injured in a car accident with those naughty boys !

I wo n't even get into why it 's super unrealistic for a teen boy to afford an apartment in San Francisco all by himself but I digress ... <p> Papa Tanner is uncomfortable about the prospect of his daughter being alone at her bae 's new place because THEY MIGHT DO SEX THINGS . He 's not wrong to be paranoid , because in that episode Steve does try to convince DJ that they should totally do it , but after a little making out DJ realizes that she 's not ready .

@@45901276 @5901276/ <h> 15 Signs You 're Conceited , Not Confident <p> Before we get into this , I want to make one thing clear : there is absolutely nothing wrong with being confident . Confidence is so great , and so many girls could use a lot more of it in their lives . I love it when people love themselves ! Sometimes , though , people take it too far and they become conceited , not confident . A healthy dose of self-love : amazing . Acting the same way Kanye West has been acting on Twitter : annoying . <p> There is a fine line between confidence and arrogance . Feeling good about yourself is a self-assurance that you are capable and worthy . Being conceited means that you take that to an excess wherein you believe that you are the best . There 's a quote that I like that sums things up pretty easily : " Confidence is not they will like me. Confidence is I 'll be fine if they do n't  . " See what I mean ? - So , not going out with someone you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else because you 're convinced that Zayn Malik is the only guy in the world on your same level of attractiveness could be a sign that you 're conceited . <p> Finally being confident after warding your way though a mountain of insecurities and self-doubt is a journey and a half . In fact , most conceited people are insecure themselves , they 're just masking it really hard with aggressive fake confidence . If you 're worried that you come off as conceited , not confident , you can check in with yourself about whether or not your confidence comes from an authentic place . While you may use your confidence to be a boss-bitch in your every day life , its chief purpose is not to slam others . Being conceited feels like over compensating for something you lack by pushing others away with this false bravado . <p> By all means , I do n't  want to discourage you from being confident . If you 're secretly conceited and you do n't  know it , maybe consider these 15 signs as a signal that something may be up . Chill out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , and trust that no ones out to steal your confidence . <p> 1 ) You feel like you always have to one-up everyone. - <p> Its normal for anyone to want to share experiences and similar stories . But if you feel like your stories are always better , funnier , and more interesting than everyone elses , that 's a problem . <p> 2 ) You talk down to others . <p> You 're condescending to people because they 're clearly not on your level . You doubt the intelligence of everyone else and always assume people do n't  know what they 're talking about because you clearly know better . Sure , there are some things you might be more of an expert on , but you do n't  know everything ! <p> 3 ) You constantly interrupt anyone you have a conversation with . <p> Because what you have to say is way more important , more important than what they 're saying . <p> 4 ) You can never admit you 're wrong . <p> When you 're conceited , you 're infallible . You can do no wrong because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you admitted you were wrong , that 's a problem . <p> 5 ) You never ask for help . <p> If you constantly refuse to ask for help because you do n't  think anyone can really help , you 're coming off as a huge know-it-all . <p> 6 ) When you do ask for help , you can never share credit with the people whove helped you . <p> If you act like you make everything happen , you 're too focused on yourself . <p> Your opinion deserves to be heard . But that does n't  mean you should put others down while expressing it . <p> 8 ) You rage or get hurt whenever someones critical of you . <p> Not being able to take constructive criticism is a big problem and a sign of arrogance . <p> 9 ) You take everything really personally . <p> Because everythings always about YOU !

Especially when you loudly complain when something does n't  go your way . <p> 13 ) You flaunt your status in front of others , even if its fake . <p> You pretend your fake bag is real in the name of being better than everyone . When your friend tells you they have a crush on Ryan , you say things like , " Oh , Ryan ? Ugh , he was texting me last month . Why is he so obsessed with me ?

It does n't  only suck because it makes it difficult to wear those jeans that normally fit you perfectly fine it also sucks because its just plain uncomfortable . <p> A lot of us probably deal with bloating when we have or are about to get our period . Its a common side effect of PMS , and sometimes it can last for days . Of course , you can get bloated at other times of the month too , like if you ingest too much sodium . Whatever the reason for it , bloating is annoying , something you want to get rid of ASAP . So how you can make that horrible puffy feeling go away for good or at least for the day ? Read on for 10 tips on how to get rid of bloating. 28677 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you find yourself bloated very often , make sure your diet is high in foods that contain a lot of potassium . And if you 're feeling bloated right now , grab a banana to soothe yourself . Potassium helps to regulate the fluid in your body , and since bloating comes from fluid , eating high-potassium foods can help with it . Some examples include bananas , cantaloupe , spinach , tomatoes , mangoes , nuts and asparagus . Asparagus is great because it also acts as a diuretic to flush excess liquid out of your system , which is exactly what you need . <h> Make Sure You 're Eating The Correct Amount Of Fiber <p> Fiber can either relieve your bloating or make it worse , depending on how much you 're ingesting on a regular basis .

Popping a probiotic pill ca n't hurt , but it wo n't be a quick fix on it 's own - they need to be taken every day . <h> Massage Your Stomach <p> Bloating can be a result of excess gas in your stomach ( meaning you need to fart or burp ) .

If you 're not up for a hardcore gym sesh , take a 25 minute walk at a fast pace . <h> Nibble On Parsley <p> It might sound gross , but munching on a little parsley is actually a great way to get rid of bloating . Parsley acts as a natural diuretic , which flushes excess liquid out of your body .

@@45901283 @5901283/ <p> Is there any shade of lipstick that is more intimidating than red ? This is a rhetorical question because the answer , of course , is no . In general , most lipstick on its own is frightening enoughjust think of the pigment-to-teeth transference possibilities ; horrifyingso any kind with a bright , blood-red hue is downright terrifying for anyone with less than an obsessive interest in makeup and beauty. - - ( That is , I assume . I am not trying to project grossly on the Internet populace at large here ! ) - You know what 's extra scary ? Putting red lipstick under your eyes . I did it , but only to see if it would get rid of my dark circles . <p> Sounds crazy , no ? Let me explain . Last January , a beauty editor named Deepica Mutyala- made a video in which she applied red lipstick under her eyes as a means of covering up dark circles . This sounds weird , but it follows the logic of traditional color correctingthat is , applying shades of an opposite color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masking itwithout having to spend money on a color-correcting palette . In the video , this works perfectlythe red lipstick makes Mutyala look insane ( but in , like , a fun way ) for about a minute , then , she covers it up with her regular makeup . The effect is a good one , since she does n't  look as though she skipped out on a full night of sleep or like she has red lipstick under her eyes . <p> I decided to try it . Heres what I looked like before : <p> Now , it is true that my dark circles are not so terrible . Ive been using the same under-eye cream that Kylie Jenner usesKiehls Avocado Eye Cream and I must say that King Kylie knows what 's up when it comes to dark circle remedies. - More concerning , I now realize , might be my eyebrows , which have not been tended to in at least three months because I am trying to grow them outthis is code for " I lost my tweezers and am too lazy to call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regain their natural shape ( I do n't  know , Gwyneth Paltrow told me to do it ) . But I am not here to wax irrelevant on the state of my eyebrows ! Besides , the dark circles are definitively there , and , personally , I 'd rather go without them . <p> To do this with pale skin , like the kind I have , you 're supposed to use a red lipstick with pink undertones ( check out the guide here for your skin tone ) . I used " Moulin Rouge " from Make Up For Ever ( it is described as a " satin , vibrant red , " - which very evocative of tuberculosis that was so prevalent amongst Parisian prostitutes in the early twentieth century . Peggy Olson must have been on this account ! ) , which was both the closest approximation to what was recommended to me and something that I already owned . It is indeed- quite- the vibrant- red , as you can see here : <p> Then , as advised , I rubbed it beneath my eyes using an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face four times this week , I 'll explain GI <p> I do love " twinning " with my favorite fashion icon , Marilyn Manson .

Or , at least , I had toblending my makeup onto my skin made the red lipstick leach down my face a bit , and it took a lot of spackling of foundation and concealer to totally cover it up . Heres what that looked like : <p> My dark circles look.different , I guess ? While at first glance , my dark circles seem to be gone , a closer look reveals that there is very clearly lipstickthough it has turned a bruised plum color , rather than the " vibrant " red it was beforeunder there , which I guess averages out at giving me marginally improved dark circles .

It added about five minutes to my makeup routine , which is n't *that* much , obviously , but that 's time I 'd rather spend , I do n't  know , sleeping . Which might , in fact , be more beneficial for those dark circles . So , I pass ! <p> So , I 'll keep my dark circles the way they are . Still , this does n't  mean that you cant try it ! Some people swear by it , so it could work for you ( particularly if you have darker skin , which seems to respond best to lipstick color-correcting ) . - If this is a way for you to conquer a fear of bold lipstickor simply scare your friends with some Marilyn Manson-esque selfies , as I obviously didby all means , try it out .

@@45901284 @5901284/ <h> Why Did Your Vagina Get Very Swollen After Sex ? Is That Normal ? <p> I 'm really freaked out . A few days ago , my boyfriend and I had sex without a condom . Afterwards , I felt like my vagina was pretty swollen , and when I looked down at it , I saw that it was VERY swollen . My right vaginal lip had swelled up , almost like a balloon , much bigger than the other side . It felt puffy and swollen , but not exactly painful , just uncomfortable . When I put underwear on , it felt like something was down there , but it was just the fact that my lip was so , so swollen . Although I 've felt swollen down there after sex before , I 've never experienced anything like that and it really scared me . It looked like my vagina was going inside out ! <p> I do n't  know why it happened . It was almost gone in the morning , although the area still felt a little tender . Is this normal or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing was exceptionally rough . What should I do if it happens again ? <p> Vaginal swelling after sex is pretty normal , especially if you werent using a condom , but I can definitely see how it would be alarming if one side swells up to look quite large . Fortunately , this is pretty common and not an indication that something bigger is happening . Your down there area is so sensitive , and sometimes , the smallest thing can set it off . So , while it may be uncomfortable , its not exactly cause for concern . <p> Intense vaginal swelling that results in a ballon-like appearance is most often the result of rough sex or not using enough lubrication . Vaginal swelling can also happen when you 're really aroused , but in that case , it probably would n't swell up in that way although it certainly is possible . This is more likely from sexy time that was a little too rough , not using a condom and irritating your vag , or skimping on the lubrication . Let 's quickly go through each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely the issue here , let 's start with that . A lot of friction down there can easily cause some pretty serious swelling . If you werent wet enough down there , you probably felt it , and maybe you ignored it . Do n't  do that ! Keep lube on handy this reduces the friction and will prevent that kind of swelling . This lack of lubrication is especially common when changing position a lot . Its easy for your vag to dry up or even for his penis to get a little softer , which tends to hurt a bit more . <p> This could also be the case of rough sex , although you said you guys werent doing anything too crazy . In general , rough sex can lead to a lot of friction , and you might ignore it because pain is part of the process . Again , make sure you 're using lube and please be careful . <p> Sometimes a condom allergy can also cause swelling like this , although that clearly was n't the issue here . In any case , please use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternate form of birth control , nothing else protects against STDs . <p> As for what to do once the swelling has already happened ? First of all , relax . Freaking out and convincing yourself that something serious is wrong is only going to make things worse . Once you 're more calm , wrap some ice in a paper towel or grab an ice pack , and gently place it near the swollen area ( over underwear or under it , just do n't  put ice directly on the area without a paper towel or cloth ) . Like any other swollen body part , ice will help reduce the swelling by restricting blood flow . It will also make the area feel a little more comfortable . Put on loose sweatpants and consider going commando anything tight will irritate things further . Then just take it easy until the swelling goes down , which could take a few hours . <p> If for some reason the swelling does n't  go away after a full 24 hours or gets worse , call a doctor to get yourself checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away on its own . And to prevent it in the future , remember : lube is your friend . Good luck !

It should be almost entirely gone . <h> Wear A Cute Scarf <p> Probably your best option is to accessorize with a cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes with the rest of your outfit , it wo n't seem weird . In the warmer weather , add a light , flowery scarf with a tank . In the colder weather , wear a cozier one . You 'll look chic AND no one will see your hickey . <h> Apply Ice <p> If you want to try to get rid of your hickey more than just cover it up , get some ice . Put it in a baggie or wrap it in a cloth or paper towel - do n't apply it directly . Try to do this as quickly as possible . It will minimize redness and swelling . <h> Wear A Turtleneck <p> Two notes : do n't wear a turtleneck if it 's warm out . And do n't wear one if you 've never worn one in your life . People will immediately know something is up . Instead , choose this easy option if you wear turtlenecks a lot . <h> Apply Heat and Massage The Area <p> If it 's been a few days since you got your hickey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area ( do n't do this unless it 's been 48 hours ) . Put a heating bad or warm towel on the area and hold it there for a few minutes . Once it 's warm , massage the area gently from the inside out . The massage breaks up blood clots and improves circulation . Be gentle though ! <h> Use A Frozen Spoon <p> This is basically the same as the ice method , but everyone 's heard about the frozen spoon method , so I had to include it ! Does it work ? A little bit . Like I said , applying ice to the area minimizes redness and swelling . Do this as quickly as possible . <h> Use A Warm Teabag <p> A damp , warm teabag is a good substitute for a heating pad . Teabags are good for swelling ( I put them on my eyes when they " onclick= " gaTracker ( 'send ' , ' event ' , ' outbound-article ' , LONG ...

Add a gentle massage at the end . <h> Brush It With A Toothbrush <p> I know this sounds weird , but hear me out . Take a brand new , stiff toothbrush , and brush the area of the hickey . Be careful - if you press too hard , you 'll make this situation a lot worse . Brush for a few minutes , then wait about 20 minutes , and then apply ice or a frozen spoon . If it looks like it 's improving , repeat the process . <p> Toothpaste works really well to get rid of hickeys . I found this out from the cashier at a volleyball tournament who pointed out that thing on my neck . <p> Kristen <p> Usually , I take a comb and comb the edges of the hickey .

The reason this works is because the little capillaries come to the surface of your skin and clot with blood not dangerous in any way but by pulling the skin apart it loosens the clots and then bam wam kazamm they are gone ! 
@@45901290 @5901290/ <h> The 15 Unofficial Rules Of Texting Your Crush That You Should Know <p> As an introvert who usually prefers not to initiate conversations with my crushes in person , I consider texting to be a life-saver . Its such an easy way to communicate , and the guys that I text do n't  have to see me get all shy and awkward around them . Whenever I text a crush , I feel like I can just be myself without the added pressure of thinking about whether or not I look like a total weirdo . <p> But here 's the interesting thing : I feel like texting can be both a blessing and curse , because even though its safer and its fun , it can still get incredibly awkward and embarrassing . I mean , its a little scary to think about , because some of the simplest things , like adding inappropriate emojis or giving super short answers , can make a really good conversation turn into a total disaster . Unfortunately , texting wont- always solve your problems if you struggle with talking to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips that will make you better at flirting by text . <p> Here are 15 unwritten rules that you need to follow when you 're texting your crush . <p> 1 . Do n't  be afraid to include some humor . <p> Being funny is actually really attractive , so if you get them to laugh it will earn you some major bonus points . But do n't  overthink it or spend hours trying to come up with the perfect joke . Just let your personality show and be yourself ! <p> 2 . Do n't  wait too long to reply . <p> You might be tempted to keep the upper hand by making your crush wait for hours , or maybe you 're just playing " hard to get . " But really , all this will do is convince your crush that you do n't  really care to talk , or that youre just not interested . <p> 3 . But do n't  text them back too quickly , either . <p> This will come off as super creepy , especially if you keep replying just seconds after you 've received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clingy and desperate , so when you get a new text , allow for at least a minute or two to pass before responding . <p> 4 . Adding emojis is not required . <p> Yes , adding some fun emojis is totally fine , but its not always required to have a really good conversation . So do n't  feel like you have to add an emoji to every single text . <p> 5 . Do n't  overuse phrases like " LOL " and " Hahaha . " <p> Just recently , I noticed that I 've picked up the habit of adding " lol , " " lmao " and " hahaha " to almost every single text that I send my friends . And you know what the funny part is ? Most of those texts are n't  even funny . If you 're one of those people who always feels the need to add an " lol " to every text like its a personal signature , try your best to ditch that habit when texting your crush . <p> 6 . Do n't  overdo it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't  text an entire line of exclamation marks . And if you 're asking a question , do n't  use more than one question mark . Too many punctuation marks can be overwhelming and its ! ! ! ! ( See what I mean ? ) <p> 7 . Do n't  be afraid to initiate conversation if it feels like you 've lost touch . <p> If you guys have n't talked in a while , its okay to reach out to them first and break the silence . And no , this will not make you look too clingy . It actually shows them that you 're still interested . <p> 8 . Do not freak out if they do n't  respond to you right away . <p> This is so much easier said than done , so I get it . I mean , I 've had my fair share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the next 15 minutes . But you know what ? Stressing out does n't  really do anything to help the situation . It will only drive you crazy and make you do something insane , like send them multiple texts in a row ( which another big no no ) . If you see that they 're taking a while to respond , do something to distract yourself . <p> 9. - Do n't  pretend to like the things that they like to impress them . <p> When you text your crush , chances are they 're open up to you about their interests . But whatever you do , do not compromise your personality . For example , if they text you that they 're a huge fan of something that you actually hate , do n't  jump at the opportunity to lie and say that you agree with them . Be honest . <p> 10 . Do n't  over-analyze every message they send you . <p> Guys are n't  really the type to play mind games and send super complicated messages with hidden meanings when they text . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple message and assume that they really mean something else . <p> 11 . Do n't  type a message and then not send it . <p> One of the most annoying things ever is actually seeing that someone is typing a message , only the find that they are n't  actually going to send anything . If you feel like you 're stuck and you 're not sure how to respond to something , just take a few minutes to think about what you want to say . Once you 've figured that out , text them back . Do n't  leave them hanging . <p> 12 . Do not give one-word answers . <p> One-word responses like " yeah , " " sure , " and " okay " are literally the worst . Put some effort into your responses and try for a full sentence . <p> 13 . Unless the topic comes up , do n't  talk about your single status . <p> If you bring this topic up out of the blue , itll seem like you 're desperate to be in a relationship . And even worse , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you up with someone else . <p> 14. - Do n't  rely on your friends to respond for you . <p> Okay , I have to admit that even I 'm guilty of this . One time , when a guy I liked texted me I literally took a screen shot , sent it to my friend and texted : " What am I supposed to say to this ? " But as tempting as it might be to ask for help , you really should try your best to carry the conversation on your own . After all , your best friend wont be there with you 24/7 to push you along . <p> 15 . Proofread your texts . <p> I can not tell you how annoying it is to see some texters mix up " your " and " you 're , " or " they 're , " " there , " and " their . " Do n't  make these mistakes when you 're texting your crush . <p> Which of these rules surprised you the most ? Have you made any of these mistakes before ? Tell us in the comments below !

Its not that often that you all get to hang out together because you 're all busy , but when you do , its seriously full of love . <p> SO MUCH LOVE . And so much talk about how , " OMG , why do n't  we do this more often ? We have to do this again , ASAP . " <p> 2 .

Or , more specifically , to get my first wax ever . I had never had any hair waxed off my body before , and I decided to jump into it with one of the more painful procedures . But I 've never regretted the decision . I love getting waxed down there ! It has made hair removal so much easier for me , and I do n't  really plan on switching things up anytime soon . <p> However , even though I 've been singing the praises of Brazilian waxes for months to anyone who will listen ( I 've already convinced a few other friends to get it done ) , even I have to admit that there are some negative sides to waxing . Its not for everyone , and its really important to consider both the pros and the cons before you go strutting into a salon to become completely hairless down there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  need to do it yourself ! Here are the 12 pros and cons of getting a Brazilian ( or bikini ) wax . Good luck ! 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> PRO : You 're Hairless For Longer Periods Of Time <p> You know how , after you shave , tiny little hairs start growing in and you 're prickly by the next day ? Yeah , it 's not like that with waxing . It takes longer for the hair to grow back . Of course , it depends on how much body hair you have . I am not very hairy and can go a full month without needing a Brazilian ( I also do n't mind a teensey bit of hair down there ) . One of my friends , on the other hand , has to go every two weeks . <h> CON : You Have To Let Hair Grow Out <p> One big negative of waxing ( especially if you hate body hair ) ? You have to let the hair grow out a little bit so that there 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to deal with a little bit of hair ( at least 1/4 inch of hair is needed for waxing ) for at least five days before a wax . I wanted to start getting my legs waxed until I realized they would n't always be totally smooth and hairless . <h> PRO : It Wo n't Grow As Thick After A While <p> When you 've been waxing for a while , you 'll notice that your hair starts growing in differently . It wo n't grow in as thick as it once did , and after a long time , patches of hair might not stop growing in completely . That means that even though you have to deal with a little hair for a few days , it wo n't be as thick or dark as if you were in between shaves . I get my underarms waxed , and when the hair grows in , you can barely even see or feel it . <h> CON : Waxing Can Increase Your Risk Of STIs or STDs <p> Numerous studies have found that bikini or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or STD . This is because when you remove the pubic hair , you 're more susceptible to infections . Another reason ? If you go to a wax place that is n't clean or that double dips , they can spread STDs through the wax . That 's so scary ! European Wax Center is one of the well-known clean places that uses blue wax , and does n't double-dip . Make sure you 're going to a place that you know is clean . This study also states that people who get waxes down there are having more sex , which is another reason you 're more likely to contract an STD . But that statistic is probably because people are more likely to get a wax before a sexual encounter . <h> PRO : It 's Not Too Much Effort For You <p> I hate , hate , hate shaving , which is one of the major reasons why I love getting waxed . Shaving is just a boring little task to me that I am too lazy/busy to do myself . Waxing allows me to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say goodbye to shaving every other day ! It 's nice ! <h> CON : It Costs More Money <p> No one can argue that waxing is as inexpensive as shaving . When it comes to shaving , you have to buy razors ( usually less than $15 ) every once in a while , and shaving cream ( which is also really cheap ) . Or you do n't even have to buy shaving cream because you can use conditioner or coconut oil . But waxing costs money . I bought a package at European Wax Center for 12 waxing sessions that cost over $400 . Prices vary depending on where you go and your location , but it 's definitely more money . <h> PRO : It Gets Rid Of Black Stubble <p> You know that black stubble that gets left behind on your skin after you shave if you do n't have light blonde hair ? It 's not a big deal at all and something that everybody deals with , but some people get really annoyed by this stubble . I know it bothers some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubble , or at least makes it a lot less noticeable . Like I said , I 've started getting my underarms waxed , and I have n't seen any stubble there since I started doing that . <h> CON : Waxing Can Cause Ingrown Hairs <p> Sure , waxing means saying goodbye to stubble ... but it also means saying hello to ingrown hairs . If you 're not careful , waxing can cause ingrown hairs down there that can be painful and annoying to deal with . Sure , shaving can cause this also , but it 's a little more frustrating with waxing since you 're paying more for it . It is especially likely to happen if you have sensitive skin or your waxer is n't doing a great job . I buy ingrown hair serum to use to prevent them , but that again is extra money . <h> PRO : Waxing Can Get Deeper Than A Razor Can <p> A Brazilian wax involves waxing the hair off the outside of your labia and the inside , as well as your butt .

Pubic hair actually works to protect our down there ares from infections and bacteria . If there is absolutely no hair down there , there is basically no protection . This means that not only are you more likely to contract an STD or STI , it also means you can get other bacterial infections . And if you 're going to a waxer who is n't doing a great job , waxing can even remove tiny bits of a layer of skin , which makes you even more susceptible to infection . <h> CON : You Can Get Wax Burns or Scarring <p> But hold on : waxing is n't painless either .

I 've found that the guys who are whining about how they 're scared of commitment are the ones who are lying - the ones who actually ARE afraid usually do n't say it because they do n't even really realize it themselves .

He might not act like the picture perfect boyfriend you 've been imagining . Of course , this does n't mean you need to let him get away with everything .

Show your guy that wo n't happen by giving him alone time . My boyfriend and I do n't hang out every day - I give him days to himself where he can hang with his friends , watch TV or just sleep . He appreciates it and it does n't leave him feeling suffocated .

Constantly playing the blame game is one of the best ways to end a relationship . Part of being in a relationship is realizing that it takes two for things to happen - good AND bad . If your partner is always blaming you for everything , that 's not acceptable . And if you 're always acting like everything is his fault , that 's not okay either !

But if your partner cheats on you over and over again , or is constantly lying to you and going behind your back , and it 's something you 're always fighting about , that 's not okay . That means something is seriously wrong . Or , maybe they cheated once , but you ca n't stop fighting about it . That means you 're not over it - and maybe you need a break . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Fighting About How They Blow You Off <p> Does your S.O . blow you off all the time ? Is he/she not answering your text messages and never answering when you call them ? Not okay . Are they constantly making plans with you and then canceling or just not showing up ? Nope , not okay . If these fights are happening on a regular basis , something is really wrong in your relationship . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Constant Insults <p> Fighting brings out the worst in people , and sometimes when we get heated , we say mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if your S.O . is saying horribly mean things when fighting , then not apologizing later - that 's not okay . That could be a form of emotional abuse . Maybe they insult you even when you are n't fighting and that leads to a fight - that 's not okay either ! Your partner should encourage you and make you feel good about yourself . They should never be insulting you or bringing you down . 28678 @qwx438678 <h> Fights About Spending Time With Family and Friends <p> If you ca n't hang out with your friends on your own without getting in an argument with your partner , that is not acceptable . When you 're dating someone , you have to be able to have your own time with your friends - your S.O . should n't be fighting with you every time you want that . It 's an even worse warning sign when they do that when you 're with family . It means that they 're suffocating , that they do n't trust you , and it 's even a sign of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No To Something You 're Uncomfortable With <p> If you say you do n't want to do something because you 're uncomfortable with it , sexual or not , and your partner starts a fight over it ... that 's not a great sign .

You can rock a long sleeved top with a turtleneck in the colder months and opt for a breathable short sleeved shirt when it gets a little warmer . This combo will be a lifesaver when you 're feeling lazy or rushed and want to look like you put effort into your look . <h> A Dress With A Fun Collar <p> Here 's why collared dresses rule : Some have embellished collars , which really pop and make a statement without you having to load up on accessories . Others have collars in fun shapes , like scallop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have a retro vibe . Also , if the collar is a different color than the rest of the dress , you can rock a fun color block look . <h> A Shift Dress <p> If you 're under the impression that shift dresses are n't meant to be worn by curvy and only look good on thin folks , then it 's time to change that . I 'll admit , as a curvy chick with a frame that 's on the larger side , I 'm hesitant about shift dresses because they can look a bit too boxy sometimes . But that can be easily remedied with a belt or a jacket . Opt for a shift dress that 's on the shorter side ( just as the 60s intended ) and pair them with ankle boots , platforms , or Oxfords . <h> A Shirt Dress <p> This is similar to a shift dress in the sense that there is n't much of a defining shape to it , but shirt dresses tend to be a little more oversized . If it 's long enough you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it and call it a day . You can also wear them with tights or leggings , too .

I 'd also argue that they can absolutely be worn year round because you can just wear them with tights or over the knee socks if you need to . <h> A Midi Dress <p> Midi dresses are just starting to make a comeback after being abandoned in the late 90s and early 00s . But they 're a great alternative to an ultra short mini or a maxi . Throw on some chunky platforms , ankle boots , or sneakers and you 're good to go . Just make sure you can actually walk in it , though ! If it 's too tight you 're going to end up walking down the street with embarrassingly short strides . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that I 'm apprehensive about maxi dresses , despite the fact that I 'm tall which , apparently , makes me the perfect candidate for them ( even though short women can rock em too ) .

Here are a three tips on making a maxi dress work for you : <p> 1 . Explore different styles . Not every maxi has the sack of potatoes look . You can also find some that are a little more form fitting or structured . <p> 2 . Wear shoes with a little height in the heel . Adding a little height really makes maxi dresses look more balanced on every body type . <p> 3 . Have fun accessorizing .

Hell , I 'm not sure I had a solid black dress that I actually liked until the past year or so . Whether it 's long sleeved or sleeveless , shift or form fitting , having a black dress that you can always count on for an instantly cute look is essential . <h> A Form Fitting Dress <p> No matter what body type you have , your wardrobe should have at least one form fitting dress chilling in it . No , it does n't have to be a suffocating bodycon or bondage dress . Just a little something that fits closely to your body . Whether you 're going for a sultry look or something casual , there is absolutely a snug dress out there that will make you feel like a million bucks . <h> A Dress With A Cool Print <p> Why ?

A little form fitting at the top and flaring out on the bottom ? Flawless . They 're especially great for those of you who have wider hips or a bit of a booty because they do n't have to be super constrained . Yesssss , sweet freedom !

It was a bit darker than most other Disney movies as the original tale by Victor Hugo is , well , not the lightest story . The original of course is n't packed with talking gargoyles , but its an interesting story nonetheless . <p> The Disney remake is colorful and one of the more mature animated films to come out of the studios . Critics actually loved it ! I loved it too , and I was obsessed with Esmeralda .

Creepy Judge Claude Frollo just ca n't help himself from wanting her because she 's too hot . LIKE HELLFIRE . GET IT ? He actually says " This burning/Desire/Is turning me to sin/It 's not my fault . " Guess what that sounds like ? Victim-blaming , rape culture , etc . Ugh . <h> Sexuality Is Power <p> There 's a big focus on power in this movie . Frollo especially uses his power for bad and thinks it 's his right by God to do crappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality , but she does n't want it that way . Esmeralda is n't a whore and does n't want to be treated as such , but no one let 's her escape it . <h> What You Wear Matters <p> There 's also this perpetuation of the idea that what you wear matters . Esmeralda bares her shoulders ( what a skank , amirite ? ) which is just too much for everyone . She 's not traditionally dressed compared to the other women in this little town so she 's totes asking for it . No . Nope . False . Wrong . What you wear whether you 're wearing sweatpants or a crop top does NOT mean you are asking for anything . It means you felt like wearing an outfit . That 's it . <h> That Whole Friendzone Thing <p> Long story short , Quasimodo loves Esmeralda because she 's kind to him . She does n't love Quasi as more than a friend , but instead loves Phoebus because chemistry . Or something . Anyway , Quasi is all broken up about being friendzoned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'll romantically be interested . I hate that they do this because Quasi is a good person , and I really think he is totally fine with being your friend . BUT there is a redeeming moment because Quasi still saves Esmeralda in the end and even says that he knows she loves someone else . So that was nice . <h> That Male Feminists Are Less Masculine <p> Quasimodo is definitely a feminist . He really wants everyone to be treated equally and with kindness because he is not treated nicely due to his appearance . But Disney turns Quasi into a pining princess-type character . There is no princess in this film because Quasi fits the role , which is pretty unfair to him because he is a strong human being . There 's just this feeling when looking at Quasi that kind men or male feminists are somehow less masculine because of how they portray him . <h> This Guy <p> I do n't really like Phoebus especially because in the original story , he 's a total jerk . But Esmeralda loves him and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give Phoebus and Esmeralda his blessing to be together . WHY ? Quasi and Esmeralda were never together . There were no expectations there .

The actual messages that we take away from movies , especially childrens movies , come from the admirable characters , not the evil ones . <p> Frollo is the bad guy . So when he does things like blame Esmerelda for his attraction to her , or set a familys house on fire while they are locked inside , the idea is not that we should walk away and do this , its that " these acts are things that bad people do .

I see the portrayal of Quasi more as a statement that there are lots of different kinds of people , and that a strong man can also be kind , would n't you agree ? <p> Diana <p> First off , Esmeralda has saved the guys butts as much as they have saved hers . You also have to keep in mind of historical context . Women were not on the same social level as men back then and considering she 's a gypsy OF COURSE there 's going to be some sexual issues ! The actual story written by Victor Hugo in 1831 ( just shy of 200 years ago ) was way more brutal . Its all about social and religious strife from that time .

The song is sung in counterpart to Confiteor , which is a Catholic prayer said during every mass , confessing that you 've sinned " in my thoughts , in my words , in what I 've done and what Ive failed to do , etc .

Not at all . <p> Frollo does n't  see what he s doing as " crappy things . " He sees the gypsies as a group of people who are leading other citizens of Paris into temptation , and sees them as living in sin . To say that Ezmeralda has power over men because of her sexuality is naive , too . She does n't  have power because she dresses provocatively . Shes powerful because she has the courage to do the right thing in the face of people who literally set fire to the city of Paris to keep her down . <p> " What you wear matters ? " Uhmwhat does that even mean ? Of course it matters . Your clothing identifies you . Her clothing identifies her as a gypsy , not as promiscuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing . <p> Friendzonenope . Missed the point again . There is NO assumption that just because she 's nice , shed be romantically interested . He hoped she would . Who would n't ? Shes pretty freakin awesome . Also keep in mind that other than Frollo , she is the first person who was willing to even acknowledge that he was just as much a human being as anyone else . <p> " BUT there is a redeeming moment because Quasi still saves Esmeralda in the end and even says that he knows she loves someone else . So that was nice . " What the hell is that ? So you expected him to let her die just because did n't  love him back ? How unbelievably petty and ridiculous do you think people should be ? <p> How is Quasimodo a feminist exactly ? Why not a human being who has been told his entire life that he s a monster and has been manipulated into thinking that Frollos emotional abuse is something he deserves ? As the damsel who 's saved , Ezmeralda still takes the role as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not masculine ? I see him as a strong male character , who also has the emotional maturity to say that he really would love nothing more than to be loved in return . To me , that 's about as manly as it gets . <p> Quasi gives Esmeralda and Phoebus his " blessing " to show them both that he s okay with them being together . Nobody was asking his permission , but Phoebus acknowledged more than once that Quasi clearly has feelings for her and that he respects that . By the end of the movie , they were friends , rather than two men vying for the affections of the same woman . I 'm not even sure I 'd call him a jerk , either . He protected Ezmeralda in the Church , stood up to Frollo , saved the millers family , gypsies and Quasithe list goes on . <p> Angel <p> Frollo is the villain . Villains do bad things . That 's the point . You cant just get disgusted by him victim-blaming , you 're supposed to hate him for it . <p> Annie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie . Also its based off of the book and Disney changed a lot of things to make it less dark . Its also a bit historical and the point is to show the corruption in the old churches and Esmerelda is a gypsy and that 's why she 's dressed that way i do n't  have enough time to get into how completely stupid this is <p> monika <p> The point of the movie is discrimination , revolution and social strife . It has sexualization like any other moviewhy ? because it sells things . Even if is a kids moviewho is going to buy it ? The parents . Is it right ? no because is dehumanizing woman and it leads to other problems . Instead of complaining we should encourage young woman and girls to be active in their society and decide how they are being portray . <p> Anita <p> Oh god , that was a waste of time . About 3 points could be summed into one . Not to mention the article is n't exactly bright either , smells heavily of bias steamroller , ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missreading a plot . <p> Becky <p> If this is seriously what you got from Hunchback , you need to watch it again . Seriously . <p> Rene <p> Its not Disneys fault , reallyall these points are also in the original ( especially the whole mess with Claude Frollo ) . <p> Lindy Dineen <p> Not to mention the offensive stereotypes of Roma ( gypsies ) . <p> lauren <p> this literally all the points the movie was trying to make like when you make these do you even watch the movie or just read a brief summary about what happens

Baird-Murrays conclusion is this : - " The tits will not be out for the lads . Or for anyone else , for that matter .

School subjects are difficult for everyone , not just the people who have a million things going on . Even if you understand what you 're being taught , you need to be able to do your homework the right way , put effort into projects , and actually give yourself time to study . Its all about applying yourself , and it is n't the easiest thing in the world . <p> Even successful students who consistently get the top grades struggle . Want to know how they manage to stay so on top of their game ? They have study habits . Sure , there are some grade A students who are naturally smart and do n't  have to put much effort into their work in order to impress their teachers but this is rare . Even when it seems effortless , most of the top students are actually doing a whole lot of work to maintain their GPA . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their secrets on their own , so I decided to do it for you .

Here are 20 secret habits grade A students have that you need to try : - <p> A photo posted by 2 German Girls 17 ( @polaroidsaddicted ) on Oct 12 , 2015 at 8:33am PDT <p> First and foremost , successful students are organized . They are n't  scrambling around searching for their notes a few hours before a test . They do n't  forget to write down homework assignments and thus forget to do them . They keep their school stuff in one spot , and they know how to manage their time . You can get more secrets on how to be more organized right here . <p> You know how a lot of teachers offer extra credit , and a lot of students ignore it until they realize they 're failing and need to do something ASAP ? Yeah , well , straight A students do n't  ignore extra credit . In fact , they usually do it even when its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EXTRA work on top of what you already have . But instead of thinking of it as extra , think of it has part of your coursework that 's what these students do ! <p> Straight A students are n't  intimidated by teachers , and they 're not afraid to admit that they do n't  know everything ( well , most of them , anyway ) . They know how to ask for help when they need it . Getting help from a teacher can not only help you understand things better , but it also shows your teacher that you 're trying and making a real effort oftentimes , this can change their opinion of you in a really good way . <p> The most successful students are typically the ones who are n't  afraid to stand up for themselves . If they get a bad grade that they do n't  think they deserve , they WILL say something to their teacher about it to try to improve it . It might not always work , but its definitely worth a shot ! <p> Good students do n't  just study whenever they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day/night that they dedicate to getting their work done . Establishing this daily habit is so important . When you have a specific time every day , its sort of like an appointment . You get used to it , and then it just becomes something you do without thinking about it . <p> I 'm sure you 've heard it before , but cramming does n't  work . Trying to jam a semesters worth of information into your head in a few hours is not the definition of success . Students who get the top grades do n't  cram they study consistently . They study even when they do n't  " need " to study . They study every night , then study more the night before a test . <p> Straight A students are usually excellent at time management . They give themselves a certain amount of time to get an assignment done , rather than spending hours on one thing and getting distracted throughout . They also usually know to get the hardest assignments out of the way first , then focus on the easier ones . <p> Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least they read the Spark Notes .

Straight A students feel that school is really important to them , and so usually they end up putting it before their social life . Instead of saying " eff it " about homework and going out instead , they do the homework and THEN go out if they have time . If you 're really serious about school , this is sometimes what you have to do . <p> Whether its to please their parents , get a certain GPA , get accepted into their dream school , or become the valedictorian , good students are working towards goals , both short-term and long-term . They think about their future and they put effort into achieving it . They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motivates them . Find what motivates you , and remind yourself of it every time you 're feeling lazy . <p> This goes back to being organized . Straight A students stay on top of their game by always reminding themselves of what needs to get done . They make to-do lists either for the week or the day , or even both . They check things off as they go along , which helps towards a sense of accomplishment . Making to-do lists helps you remember everything and makes your day easier . <p> Successful students take notes even when they are n't  told to . Furthermore , they write them out instead of typing them up . Its proven that writing things out helps you remember them better . Not only do these students take notes , they also read them over . Some students read their notes over right after class , and some read them at the end of the night , even if they do n't  have homework or a test . <p> 13 . They create their own study habits that they stick to making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc . <p> Good students usually have their own study habits that they know work for them they realize that the same thing does n't  work for everyone , and so they find what makes sense to them . Whether this is creating flashcards , making their own practice tests , studying with a friend , or saying things out loud , it does n't  really matter . Find what helps you the most , and stick with it . <p> When a good student comes across something they do n't  quite understand , they make a note of it so that they can look it up later . One of the best students I knew used to have a notebook where she would write down every word she did n't  understand and every phrase she did n't  . She would go home and look everything up , and write it down . She did this even when reading for pleasure . Its so helpful ! <p> Say a teacher assigns homework and says its due in four days . A good student goes home , and does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for the night before to get it done . Why ? Because the day the day the assignment was given is probably the day you learned about that particular topic . Its fresh in their minds , so why wait and push it off ? <p> Although they 're dedicated , great students also know that they need time to relax and re-energize . This is why they manage their time so that they can also give themselves breaks . Have times where you do your homework , and times where you read , take a nap , or just veg out in front of the TV . Better yet , do something creatively constructive , like coloring in an adult coloring book ! <p> A photo posted by Kiara ( @paperprincess ) on Oct 12 , 2015 at 1:08pm PDT <p> Good students write down every single assignment they 're given .

They certainly do n't  go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they usually have planners where they record all of their homework to look over later , with due dates included . <p> Great students usually do n't  sleep late .

Just wake up a little earlier each day ! <p> A photo posted by The Workspace Stylist ( TWS ) ( @theworkspacestylist ) on Oct 8 , 2015 at 11:39pm PDT <p> Despite this picture , you do n't  need the Instagram study nook of your dreams to get your work done . You just need a space where you feel comfortable , something quiet , private , and has the room to hold your school stuff . Maybe its a desk , maybe its a library , maybe its not even your bedroom .

@@45901327 @5901327/ <h> 20 Important Relationship Goals You Actually Want <p> I 'm online all day , every day , and so I end up seeing a lot of the #RelationshipGoals memes that float around social media . I 've seen #RelationshipGoals that range from very cute to sickeningly exaggerated ( most are the latter , to be honest ) . In the beginning , this relationship goals meme was realistic pictures of happy couples holding hands while walking in the snow , cuddling and watching a movie together , or sleeping with an adorable puppy . But at this point , relationship goals have become completely over-the-top . From long , dramatic declarations of love on an Instagram picture to cuddling in positions that seem extremely uncomfortable , some relationship goals make me want to roll my eyes until forever . <p> At this point , it feels like those #RelationshipGoals pictures or actions that get all the likes and shares are n't  even authentic it feels like couples are doing this stuff to get attention and 15 minutes of Internet fame . Does that sound cynical and bitter ? Maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about looking like #goals than actually being #goals . I oftentimes find that the couples who feel the need to post about their love every day for all to see are the couples who are trying to over-compensate for something ( maybe their actual unhappiness ) . <p> Ive been dating my boyfriend for a little over five years , and while our relationship is n't perfect ( no relationship is ) , I am very happy with it . To me #relationshipgoals is n't about being entangled in his arms and legs while I watch him play video games or reading a sappy Facebook status he wrote my goals for our relationship are genuinely feeling happy together . And we do that ! So , that said , here are some things you should REALLY strive for when dating someone . Because you can make any relationship look amazing online , but that does n't  mean it truly is these things do , though . Here are 20 important relationship goals you actually want : <p> 1 . Hearing your BFs phone go off and not feeling the immediate urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone could cheat on you these days , its understandable to be nervous about what your S.O . is doing on their phone while you 're not looking . Or , its normal to feel that way when you first start dating . But once youve established trust , you should no longer spend time being concerned about who that text they just got is from . <p> 2 . Being able to go a few days without seeing each other and not feeling totally freaked out about it . <p> You know you 're in a good place when you can go a few days without seeing your S.O. , and although you miss each other , its not the end of the world . This past year , I went to Spain for a week without my boyfriend . I missed him and he missed me , but we did n't  spend the whole time trying to talk or crying about how much we missed each other . Its so important to be able to have your own lives and do your own things sometimes . Do n't  get me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you 're too dependent on each other , that 's not good . <p> When you first start dating someone , getting into an argument with them makes you feel all sorts of nervous about whether or not the relationship will end because of it . After you 've been together for a while , you realize that little arguments every once in a while are normal and are n't  the end of everything . That sounds depressing , but its actually where you want to be . <p> 4 . Going out with your friends and not being bombarded by texts from him asking what you 're doing . <p> You know what 's not cute ? Trying to hang out with your friends during a girls night but having to field 20 different texts from your boyfriend who is freaking out because he s not with you . You know what IS cute ? Having a fun night out and then texting your BF afterwards to chat . <p> 5 . Not feeling the need to text each other 24/7 . <p> Speaking of texting , you should WANT to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  feel the need to be tethered to your phone . Again , its important to do your own thing without being totally dependent on each other . <p> 6 . Being able to be alone with his mom for more than five minutes without wanting to run and hide . <p> Once you 're able to hang out with his family even if he s not around , you know you 've made it . <p> 7 . Hanging out but just sitting next to each other doing your own thing and feeling comfortable . <p> There 's something really nice about a hangout sesh with your boyfriend that involves you reading a book while he watches his show . Its nice to be able to do your own thing while still being together . Of course , every single hangout should n't be you guys doing this , but you know what I mean . <p> 8 . Not feeling like you have to have sex every time you see each other. - <p> Sex is great , but its not the only part of a relationship . Its nice to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HAVE to do it every single time you see each other you do it if you want ! <p> 9 . Leaving your phone laying around because you know he/she is n't going to go through it . <p> Worrying about your boyfriend going through your texts because he s jealous ? Not cool . I see a lot of #relationshipgoals posts like , " when he does n't  have a passcode on his phone " or " when he asks you to check his new text instead of checking it himself . " To me , this seems more like a #goal for the girl to be able to go through his stuff when she wants than a #goal of trust . <p> 10 . Being able to tell bae you think someone else is cute without them freaking out and vice versa . <p> Hi , newsflash : attraction to others does not magically disappear when you enter a relationship . You 're still going to think other people are cute , and the same goes for your significant other . Once you can stop acting like noticing someones looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> 11 . Laughing during sex because something weird AF just happened . <p> You know what 's weird ? Sex . Funny , embarrassing things happen , and if you can laugh about them with your partner instead of feeling the urge to run away , you 're in a good place . <p> 12 . Taking care of each other when one of you is sick . <p> You know you 've reached #goals level when your boyfriend is happy to take care of you when you 're not feeling well . <p> 13 . Feeling comfortable enough to be totally gross around each other . <p> If you still have to pretend like you do n't  fart or poop or burp because lol you 're a **girl** that stinks . Being able to be " gross " in front of your partner indicates a level of comfort and trust that is amazing to have . <p> Its so nice to discuss your plans for a vacation in a year without wondering to yourself , " Will we really still be together in a year ? " <p> 15 . Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> One of the cutest relationship goals is getting to that point where you have enough inside jokes to have entire conversations together that other people do n't  get . <p> 16 . Not even having to ask if they 're coming with you to an event because you know they will . <p> You were invited to a party ? Your S.O . will probably be with you . Got a plus one to a wedding ? No need to stress about that . Your significant other does n't  have to do EVERYTHING with you , but its nice to know they probably will if you need them to . <p> 17 . Or when his family assumes you 're coming to something without even asking . <p> Isnt it so nice when his family or friends just assume you 're going to be around because they 're so used to you being there ? Awwww . <p> 18 . Finding TV shows you binge watch together instead of going out . <p> Going out and being social is great ! But its nice to also be the couple who can spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being cozy together . <p> 19 . Not feeling pressured to write about how great your relationship is on social media because you do n't  need to . <p> There 's nothing wrong with letting the world know how you feel about bae . But when you feel the need to make a spectacle of your relationship every single day , it seems like you 're over-compensating . It seems like its too much . Relationships are about two people , not about the attention two people can get by making others jealous . <p> 20 . Getting excited to see each other even after a long time of being together . <p> Even after years of dating , you should still feel a little bit of excitement about getting to see your boo . That 's a good sign ! <p> Which of these relationship goals do you want the most ? What did I forget to include ? Let me know in the comments .

There are a lot of misconceptions about what it is , what it does , and what it really means . WTF is a hymen , anyway ? ! I have n't even seen hymens labeled in my high school sex ed courses . No one talks about it ! Why ? As soon as you find out what sex is , everyone tells you that the loss of your virginity is marked by a penis entering your vagina and tearing your hymen ( this is where the phrase " getting your cherry popped " comes from ) . Bam ! Easy breezy . Done and done . Right ? <p> WRONG ! Super extra wrong . Not having a hymen does not equal non-virgin. - And if were going to break it down even further ? What even is virginity ? A lot of people qualify penetrative heterosexual sex as being the clear , definitive marker of " losing your virginity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of sexually active gay people who are technically virgins ! I 'm looking at you , everyones butt and mouth . <p> Newsflash : virginity is a made up construct to suppress women and keep us in line . So , why stress about it ? If not having a hymen does not equal not being a virgin , what 's the big deal ? Short answer : it is n't a big deal , but its important to be informed about your body , like always . When someone wants to put you in a virginity pigeonhole and enforce all the violent imagery that comes with busting hymens open and making you bleed , you can bust their sex-negative backtalk with some cold hard facts . <p> If you have a vagina or if you have sex with vaginas , get ready to have your mind blown because the hymen is n't what you think it is . Here are- 15 things you absolutely need to know about your hymen . <p> 1 ) For starters , babe YOU DO NT ALWAYS POP YOUR CHERRY ! <p> Throw a damn party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  have a before/after physical marker to indicate when you 've had sex . The hymens main objective is not to be a virginity marker . Some girls tear their hymen their first time , others tear it at other times . No biggie . <p> 2 ) The hymen does not cover your vaginal opening . <p> The big bad myth that comes with " popping your cherry " is that the hymen is a thin membrane that covers your vagina and breaks when you put a penis inside it . That 's weird , because how would your menstrual blood get out if your hymen is covering everything ? How would tampons go in ? There 's no freshness seal on that shit . <p> Those things are lifetime commitments . Your hymen does n't  violently rip or tear like people make it seem . <p> 5 ) Hymens come in all different sizes ! <p> They can cover a lot or a little bit of territory of your vaginal opening , but never the whole way . Its normal if you feel like you cant find yours , its probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The hymen is streeeeetchy . <p> Go slow the first time you have sex . Your hymen is n't supposed to break , its supposed to stretch . Your hymen is n't here to make sex painful , its going to stretch . <p> 7 ) The blood from having first-time sex comes from not relaxing your vaginal muscles and going too rough . <p> The hymen can tear a little if you go at it too rough or fast . Also , relax your vaginal muscles because being extra tense might also make the bleeding worse . Your body has got you covered . <p> 8 ) Hymens can also rip from living your life . <p> Horseback riding , bicycle seats , and the splits are the biggest offenders . Why do we think penises are SO POWERFUL that they 're the only things that can break your hymen ? Falling and hurting your vag might do the trick . <p> 9 ) Your hymen is never fully gone ! <p> Sexually active people can still have hymens because HYMENS ARE NOT INDICATORS OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY . They stretch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it being there . <p> 11 ) If you 're feeling nervous about your hymen tearing the first time you have sex , you can stretch it out beforehand . <p> Fingers and dildos are your friends .

The ones on my legs are very noticeable and I hate them . They makes me not want to wear shorts . The ones on my breasts make me not want to wear anything else besides a sweater that covers them up . What can I do about my stretch marks ? <p> Although stretch marks may not be ideal , they 're also very common many women go through the exact same thing you 're going through right now , if that makes you feel any better ! The bad news is that stretch marks are pretty difficult to deal with , and the majority of the time , almost impossible to get rid of completely . But do n't  get discouraged ! We can tell you how to deal with your stretch marks in the best way possible . <p> First , it helps to know what stretch marks actually are . I talked to my friend- Dr. Sherry Ross from the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out ) to get an experts advice . Dr. Ross said , " Stretch marks are pink , reddish or purplish indented streaks that often appear on the belly , breasts , upper arms , buttocks , and thighs . " Stretch marks are caused by the sudden stretching of skin ( hence the name ! ) , which is why they 're most common during pregnancy or on your breasts during puberty when your boobs start to grow . Stretch marks also happen when you gain weight , which is why they 're so often found on legs , arms , and your stomach . When you lose weight and the skin cant bounce back , stretch marks appear . <p> Can you prevent them from happening in the first place ? Dr. Ross says , " Unfortunately , stretch marks can not be prevented since they are genetically determined , which means if your mom got them , especially during pregnancy , you probably will too . " Basically , you can try to prevent stretch marks by making sure your weight NEVER fluctuates , but that is unrealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  bother trying to do that . <p> What about getting rid of them once they 're there ? You probably see a commercial or advertisement for stretch mark cream at least once every single day so are they worth it ? Dr. Ross says , " Using creams and gels rarely make much of a difference in their appearance . What can help to manage your stretch marks is using some of the new laser treatments out there . " Unfortunately , these laser treatments are often very expensive , and they also are n't  guaranteed to work . <p> So are we saying its impossible to do anything about your stretch marks ? Kind of , yeah . This is n't a quick fix and is more than likely something you need to learn to live with it . Please take comfort in knowing you 're not alone ! Personally , I also have stretch marks on the insides of my upper thighs and on my breasts . I gained weight in high school , and lost almost 40 pounds in college , which is what caused the marks . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks fade with time and become silvery white . " This is true ! My stretch marks have faded from an angry red/purple to a silvery white color that is n't visible unless you 're close to me . Its not IDEAL , but I 've learned to just accept them as a part of me . <p> I know its frustrating to hear that there 's nothing you can do as a quick fix for your stretch marks . But I promise you are n't  weird for having them , and there 's no need to cover them up . Your stretch marks are a part of you as corny as it sounds , you need to just accept them .

The person with low self-esteem would say something along the lines of , " Maybe , I mean there are other people who might deserve it more though , I could n't ask . " The confident person would say something like , " Yes . I work hard and I deserve to be compensated for it ! " Confident people speak confidently .

She is looking for someone to " complete her , " and that 's the definition of low self-esteem . <p> There 's a huge difference between cocky and confident . Someone who is cocky is constantly bragging about their achievements and believes they are better than everyone else . Being confident is not about believing you 're better than everyone . Its about believing in yourself and loving yourself . A confident person is proud of what they accomplish , but they do n't  need to rub it in everyones face to feel good about it . <p> The way you talk to someone says a lot about your confidence .

" People with high self-esteem know how to accept a compliment without putting themselves down or feeling like they have to return the compliment .

You know your BF loves you , and might think someone else is cute , but that does n't  take away from how they feel about you . Get it ? <p> A person with low self-esteem is scared to try new things because of so many reasons . So they stick with what they know , which does n't  exactly boost confidence . But a person who is confident is n't afraid to get out of their comfort zone . They try new things even when they 're scared .

They surround themselves with people who respect them . They also know how to return that respect . <p> People with low self-esteem do n't  know how to be happy for others because they 're jealous . For example : if your friend ca n't be happy for your new relationship because she 's too busy obsessing over how she does n't  have a boyfriend , she 's not confident . Someone who is confident can be happy for those they care about even when things are n't  going right for them . <p> I 'm sure there are confident people out there who gossip . But in general , someone with high self-esteem does n't  sit around putting others down . This is because when we put others down , its almost always to make ourselves feel better about something . Confident people know how to make themselves feel good without tearing others down in the process . <p> Its hard to stop caring what others think , but its such an important part of confidence . People with high self-esteem can do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others are going to say . Theyre only worried about how THEY feel about it . That 's so important ! <p> A photo posted by YoDaisy ( @yo.pinkpixie ) on Dec 1 , 2015 at 10:06am PST <p> Because confident people do n't  worry about what others think , they do n't  do things just to please other people . They do the things that make THEM happy . They are more focused on their well-being than doing what a friend wants them to do . Ignore what others want you to do if it does n't  feel right for you . <p> Second guessing every decision you have to make does n't  mean you 're confident . Trusting your intuition and believing that you can do the right thing means you 're confident . This also ties in to not being afraid to fail . <p> Confident people do n't  sit there feeling sorry for themselves because they 're too busy working on themselves . They 're too busy chasing their goals and focusing on what 's right for them to sit around regretting past mistakes or beating themselves up for something they failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present and future . <p> Seriously , confident people believe in themselves ! They do n't  look at a goal and think they wo n't make it there . They look at a goal , make a plan , and work for it . They know they can get what they want . They trust their instincts . Their belief in themselves helps others believe in them too . <p> Again , confident people have a strong sense of self . They know what makes them feel good .

Ugh . <p> 12 ) Privilege can give you the illusion of being the person of authority . <p> This for example . Its important to honor and respect others and make them feel safe . If it makes you feel uncomfortable , that 's a personal problem . Using your privilege to assert power where there should be understanding is an act of violence . <p> 13 ) Did you know that complaining about your hetero-coupled significant other was a form of privilege ? <p> I know this post is about marriage , but remember that some of your friends are not out to their parents for reasons beyond general nerves about coming out . Sometimes its an issue of safety ( theyll get thrown out ) , fear of abandonment ( real parents disown their gay kids ) , and a multitude of other issues not faced by you , the heterosexual couple . 
@@45901336 @5901336/ <p> When I finished reading John Green 's Looking for Alaska , three things went through my mind . The first was that this book was okay . Not great . Not really good . But just okay . Second , the only character that I actually liked and found relatable was The Colonel . I absolutely loved his humor ! And finally , I thought that the infamous Alaska Young was by far one of the most self-centered and obnoxious fictional characters I 've ever encountered in a novel . <p> I wo n't lie , though . At first , it was hard to see Alaska for who she really was , because the story was told from the point of view of a lovesick guy who constantly knelt at the feet of her altar . In Pudges eyes , she was " the hottest girl in all of human history " and she " smelled of sweat and sunshine and vanilla " ( barf ) . - She immediately came off as this gorgeous , whimsical , smart , and complicated young feminist . And her unpredictability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , her behavior throughout the book revealed that she was just a manipulative and selfish girl who did n't really care to help herself or her friends . <p> I suddenly realized that Green 's attempt to paint Alaska as this cool , complex , and beautiful individual was actually a major failure , because she only turned out to be a spoiled and misunderstood brat . Though I appreciated the discussion of religion and how it relates to the labyrinth of suffering , I believe that the main purpose of this book was to trick readers into thinking that Alaska was a good person . It was hard to empathize with her because Green basically tried to endear a helpless and pathetic character who had no intention of saving herself . <p> These are the nine reasons why I think Alaska from John Green 's Looking For Alaska is actually the worst . <p> 1 . She was extremely inconsiderate . <p> In the beginning , Pudge was taken by a group of rich kids and dumped into a lake with his entire body duct-taped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Alaska try and understand what really happened . But once he got to her , she did n't  ask what happened or try to comfort him . She just laughed it off as a joke and asked if the guy went for a swim . Even worse , when he did n't  respond , she had the nerve to tell him to " buck up . " Now , Pudge was new . And he was clearly- scared and confused . How inconsiderate and rude can you be to just disregard the fact that someone needs you as a friend ? <p> 2 . She tried to play the savior when she was the one who needed saving . <p> And speaking of that kidnapping incident , I found it fascinating that she was so quick to tell Pudge to move on from his traumatic experience when she could barely move on from her own . When she saw him again , she gave him a quick " Im sorry " and said that she was n't aware of how bad it was , but she continually repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found it odd that she was putting so much pressure on Pudge , the clueless new kid with barely had any friends , to be strong , while she herself was avoiding her problems and refusing to tackle them head on . <p> 3 . She was moody and unpredictable . <p> I feel like her unpredictability was meant to be a sexy and mysterious quality , but frankly , I just found it extremely annoying . One day , she was on good terms with Pudge and the next , she was cold and condescending for no reason at all . What annoyed me the most , though , was that no one ever bothered to call her out on this or stand up to her . I mean , what was everyone so afraid of ? Did they think that she was too fragile to handle the truth ? Or did they think that shed transform into some giant , violent monster ? <p> 4 . She manipulated people with her sexuality . <p> It was INSANE how often she manipulated her friends especially Pudge . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed the compliment by saying , " but I did n't  even say that , because I love my boyfriend . " And while in his room , she said something like , " I 'm not flirting , I 'm just tired , " right before she snuggled up to Pudge and rested her head against his crotch . And also , when Thanksgiving break was coming up , she tricked Pudge into ditching his own family to spend time with her . And I 'm sure she knew perfectly well that the poor guy was falling for her . I could go on and on with examples here , but you get the picture . <p> 5 . She failed to take responsibility for her actions . <p> In short , Alaska snitched on a roommate , and that led to the expulsion of one of the most popular rich kids at their school . But instead of owning up to what she did , she allowed other people ( like The Colonel and Pudge ) to get hurt . They were unfairly caught in a web of dangerous pranks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that she did n't  want to get The Colonel angry , but would n't you say that its more important to always be honest with the people you care about ? Especially if you can see how your silence is harming them ? <p> 6. - She was self-destructive . <p> I remember in the beginning , when Pudge needed comfort after getting kidnapped , how Alaska preached that people ( including herself ) have " real problems . " I actually took that as her way of suggesting that her problems were more important than everyone elses , and so therefore , she was the only one entitled to freaking out or getting scared . But that 's not even the worst part . Even though Alaska was perfectly aware of how her traumatic experience was affecting her , she did not reach out to anyone for help . She made no effort to truly cope with what happened and move on . So this can only mean one thing : Alaska did not want to move on , because she had already given up . <p> 7 . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people respond differently to traumatic experiences . And I get that Alaska was overwhelmed with guilt over what happened . But when it comes to a point where your actions are hurting your loved ones , its a different story . Its understandable to have moments where you lash out and break down , but if you turn these things into habits without at least trying to make it better , then guess what ? You are being selfish . Forcing others to try to make you feel better , or making them tip-toe around you like they 're on eggshells is just ridiculous . <p> 8 . She gave the impression that EVERYTHING was about her . <p> There 's a difference between explicitly asking for help during a difficult time and being extremely moody and weird to get more attention . I know that Alaska was going through a lot , but that was no excuse for her act in such a way that made everyone elses world revolve around her . Though she never admitted any of this , it was quite clear that she loved being the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarettes , and the go-to " friend " for deep and intellectual conversations . <p> 9 . She was not a genuinely good friend . <p> Well I guess this depends on how you define the term " friend . " If its a self-centered and moody person who also serves as your go-to source for cigarettes and alcohol , then by your definition , she was a fantastic friend . However , in my book , she was just awful . I know there were a few times when she actually tried to be a good friend by encouraging Pudge , but its hard to be consistently genuine and supportive when you 're emotionally unstable . So to me , she only came off as this moody , heartbroken girl whose friendliness only served as a convenient distraction from her own problems . <p> What are your thoughts on Alaska Young ?

An Instagram celebrity , in case you were wondering , is someone with a large following who posts a lot of aspirational pictures of their #ootd , their makeup , their fabulous vacations , gorgeous candid photos , cute relationship photos , beautiful home decor shots , and more . <p> An Instagram celebrity is someone who posts a grainy photo of their dinner in a popular restaurant and gets 3K likes for seemingly no reason . An Instagram celebrity is someone who seems to have enough money and time to do everything youve ever wanted to do but you have no idea what they do for a living .

User Essena ONeill , an 18-year-old from Australia , is sick of the false facades she and other Insta stars have been putting up . She is so sick of it that she 's speaking out , editing all of her captions to be more truthful , and deleting images . Essena , who currently has almost 600 thousand followers , has said she 's been living a fake life to look good online and she 's been completely unhappy doing it . <p> So , she 's speaking up . Like I said , she has changed the captions on her photos to reflect the truth behind them . Shes shattering the " perfect " and unattainable views we all have of Instagram bloggers who have a lot of followers , and it is beyond interesting . Its also inspiring .

This will make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret Insta famous people with bottomless closets share ? They are sponsored by brands who pay them to wear certain things . Or they get free clothes or accessories and " pay " by posting a photo that looks natural . This happens all the time .

It creates a false ideal . <p> You know those beautiful selfies you see online where the blogger looks incredibly gorgeous and it seems like they just took a quick shot before going on with their fabulous lives ? Yeah , that 's not accurate . Everyone takes a ton of selfies before painstakingly going through them to find the one they like best . I do it too ! Its a running joke with my sister and friends that I have hundreds of selfies on my camera roll because I take tons before I post . There 's nothing wrong with posting a photo you 're happy with , but let 's not act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrity out there uses photo editing apps outside of Instagram to create a flawless selfie or photo . I know some bloggers who use three , four , or five different apps on one image . Have you ever seen the app Perfect 360 ?

These " candid " shots make it look like this blogger is ALWAYS having more fun than you . But check out this caption most of the time , they 're posing . Seriously . <p> It is so amazing that Essena said this . A lot of bloggers get clothes , have to photograph them , and end up getting all done up JUST for an Instagram photo .

Nope she literally went to the beach ONLY to take a photo . What you see is n't always what 's happening . <p> Again , so inspiring to see these kinds of real captions . How many Insta famous people have bodies you envy ? And how many of them are actually real and not the result of good angles , filters , or extra help ? <p> This is my photo .

@@45901344 @5901344/ <h> 12 Things Someone Really Means When They Call You A Bitch <p> Just like every other woman out there , I 've been called a " bitch " on more than a few occasions . There have , admittedly , been times when I was actually acting like a bitch and deserved the name calling . By that I mean I was acting like what the insult " bitch " should mean : rude , bratty , kind of snobby , and probably a little mean . We all have our bitchy moments where were saying something nasty about a friend or gossiping about something we should n't be talking about or judging someone we have no right to judge and in those times , maybe we deserve the , " Hey , stop being such a bitch " comments that we might get . <p> But the word " bitch " is thrown at women far more often than it should be , and for reasons that are actually not so legitimate as the ones above . In many cases , women are told they 're being a bitch when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theyre told they 're being a bitch when they reject someone , even if its polite . The word " bitch " is used to mean many , many things , and so many of them are things you do not have to be sorry for . <p> Feminist activist Gloria Steinem reminded us of this when she was asked how to respond when a man calls you a bitch . She said , " The best thing Ive ever thought of to say when somebody calls you a bitch is Thank you. I mean , it totally disarms them . They do n't  know what to do . Marlo Thomas always used to say that for a man to be called aggressive , - he had to take over your business , but for a woman to be called aggressive , she had to only put you on hold. - Its just a terrible double standard . We have to call them on it . If you call them on it , it changes peoples heads . " <p> Yasss queen ! This is so true . So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  be upset ( unless you 're really doing something rude , then you should maybe apologize ) thank them for their " insult . " Why ? Because here are the 12 things someone REALLY means when they call you a bitch : - <p> 1 . That you 're acting like a boss. - <p> Let me explain : when a man acts like a boss ( as in an actual boss at work ) , no one bats an eye . If a man is your boss and he is assertive and not afraid to tell you what to do , everyone just thinks he s doing his job . But if a woman does it ? Even if she 's in a higher up position , someone is bound to role their eyes and mutter something like , " Jeeze , why does she have to act like such a bitch about it ? " Please . You do n't  need to be timid and say " please " and " um " and " I 'm sorry , maybe I 'm wrong , but I just want to say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally nails what I 'm trying to say . <p> There is absolutely nothing wrong with being assertive at work and whenever you 're taking charge in life . And if someone wants to call you a bitch for that , just thank them . Because honestly , in that context , its a compliment . <p> 2 . That you 're speaking your mind and they do n't  know how to deal with it . <p> I often hear a woman being called a bitch after she says what she really thinks without apologizing for it first ( i.e. " I 'm sorry , but can I just say . " or " I 'm sorry , but I have to say this " ) . Women are called a bitch when they say what they really think or they express an opinion that is different than what the person calling them a bitch thinks . When men speak their mind , its considered normal in fact , when men do n't  speak their mind , they are often asked , " Why are you acting like such a little bitch , bro ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bitch . Which literally does n't  make sense . <p> 3 . That you 're defending yourself ( or someone else ) and they know you 're right so its making them feel uncomfortable . <p> I have great parents , so I was always told to stand up for myself . It took me a very long time to get to the point where I could do that , though , because for years , I watched stronger girls than me get torn down for defending themselves or someone else . If you have the gall to talk back to someone being rude or to tell someone to be quiet when they 're acting mean , and you 're a woman , that person will likely sneer some kind of " bitch " insult at you . Why ? Because they probably know you 're right and they do n't  know what else to do with themselves . <p> 4 . That you 've rejected them and they now feel sad . <p> This is unfortunately pretty standard in online dating . A guy reaches out to you with a disgusting " compliment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of angry words about what a bitch you are . Or maybe a guy reaches out , seems nice , you politely decline his advances , and then he turns around and calls you a bitch . Why does this happen ? Because there are a lot of people ( men AND women ) out there with very fragile little egos who ca n't handle the fact that not everyone is dying to make out with them . This also happens because they feel hurt ( which is normal when being rejected ) and have to lash out to feel better ( which is immature ) . <p> 5 . That you 're not acting the way they thought you would act and they do n't  know what to do. - <p> You will often see someone call a woman a bitch because she has just acted in a way he/she has no idea how to respond to . Whether the woman being called a bitch is defending herself , being assertive , taking charge , or just dropping a truth bomb , some people do n't  know how to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman being a person , someone who does n't  fit in their nicely wrapped box of what a woman " should " be like . They 're confused , and honestly , you should probably feel sorry for them . <p> 6 . That they 're jealous of the powerful self-esteem you possess . <p> Women are constantly being told to be confident . It is the underlying most important piece of advice in every single advice article ever written . But then when a woman does act confident , and does feel good about herself , most people get totally freaked out . They 're like , " Wait , hold on she accepted that compliment without saying something bad about herself ! " or " Did she seriously just make a move on that guy Ive been staring at across the room with no intention of approaching ? What a bitch ! " When a woman is n't afraid to act powerful , fueled by her awesome sense of self-esteem , many people feel jealous and intimidated , and resort to calling her a bitch . Cool if that makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bitch . <p> 7 . That they think you 're acting like a feminist . <p> I know its hard to believe , because its 2015 , but there are still people out there who do n't  understand what feminism means . These people think of feminists as crazy , man-hating bra-burners who want women to rule the world while men serve at our feet . I 'm sorry that these people cant differentiate between the basic definition of feminism and the stereotype that surrounds feminism . But I 'm not sorry that I am a feminist , and I never will be . So , if you ask someone to stop telling their disgustingly sexist joke and they come back at you with a " bitch " comment , just remember they have a lot to learn . <p> 8 . That they feel like you 're being aggressive and assertive. - <p> Men are encouraged to be aggressive , demanding , and assertive . Women are told to be polite and to ask for what we want with a nice smile on our faces and a sweet attitude to go along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aggressive without also being rude these are very different things . And if someone ca n't see that difference , that says a lot more about them than you . <p> 9 . That you did n't  say what they wanted you to say and they do n't  know how else to respond . <p> Again , being called a bitch very often comes down to the fact that you said or did something that caught the other person off guard . This is one reason why so many girls are hesitant to tell their friends the truth about certain situations . What do I mean ? Think about it : when your friend meets a guy who clearly is n't into her and she asks if you think he likes her , what are you going to say ? What you should say is truthful , helpful advice , but what you often end up saying is some lame excuse for him because you do n't  want her to call you a bitch . There are lots of other examples , but basically , sometimes being honest can mean you 're called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand your shyness . <p> I 'm a shy person , and I 'm pretty awkward in social situations . I try to be a real adult , but I do n't  always succeed . So , there are plenty of times when I 'm feeling shy and uncomfortable , only to be told later on that everyone thought I was being a bitch . Uh , what ? Why does silence = bitch ? Some people truly do n't  understand shyness , and I get that it can be hard if you 're a naturally outgoing person . But try to get to know someone before you start spewing insults . Maybe that girl who was super shy with a case of resting bitch face was n't silently judging you she was just trying to work up the courage to start a conversation . <p> 11 . That they feel insecure about themselves and have to tear you down to feel better . <p> One of the biggest reasons people insult others is because they 're trying to make themselves feel better about what they 're insecure about . A weak man will see a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels insecure around her . A weak , insecure woman will see a confident , powerful woman , and will tear her down by calling her a bitch because they feel inferior . They do n't  think they can beat you another way , so they resort to petty words to try and make you feel as low as they do . <p> 12 . That they feel intimidated by you . <p> What all of these above points boil down to is this : Sometimes you 're called a bitch because someone feels intimidated by you . They do n't  know what to do with you . They do n't  know what to say . They rely on a fallback word like " bitch " because its all they can really think of , and they think it sounds mean . But you know what ? Its not always as mean as they think it is . To those people , take Gloria Steinems advice , and say , " Thank you . " Because I 'd rather be a bitch who is n't afraid to go after what she wants than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck any day . <p> Which of these do you disagree with ? What do you agree with ?

When she was 13-years-old , she made a promise to her father to remain " pure " until her wedding day , and when the time finally came , she got a doctors confirmation that her hymen was in tact . <p> Listen , if someones personal beliefs coincide with abstinence and all that jazz , that 's fine , as long as it is their decision . But what disturbs me more than the idea of a dad being informed of the state of their daughters cooch is the process by which her virginity was confirmed . The state of ones hymen literally has- nothing- to do with whether or not a penis has been inside of it , so the fact that a doctor actually participated in this farce is so bizarre and borderline unethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misconception that is associated with virginity .

Many folks with vaginas " break " their hymen doing all sorts of non sexy activities as children , like playing sports , riding on a horse , experiencing a nasty fall , etc . Some people are born with hymens that are n't even totally in tact . Some people have hymens with holes in them , others barely have a hymen to begin with . Also , it 's not like using a tampon and potentially breaking your hymen has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faulty way to tell whether or not somebody has had a penis inside of them .

Men never face the same rigorous tests or expectations , either . Also , the fact that one 's purity--wholeness , being untainted , etc--is associated with sex is ten levels of effed up . This just perpetuates the association between sex and shame . Nobody is less of a person for having sex , FFS . <p> Pinterest <h> To Be A Real Virgin You Ca n't Do Anything Vaguely Sexual <p> Um , plenty of virgins masturbate , watch porn , participate in non-penetrative activity , think about sex constantly , etc .

I honestly avoid bringing this up , even with people I 'm dating , and even with friends who are n't  explicitly super close to me . The fact of the matter is that I , in all of my 26 years , have never been in a relationship . Save for a few spells of non-committal dating that only started in college , very rarely am I in a situation where the person I am romantically and sexually interested in is also romantically/sexually interested in me . Sometimes its one or the other , sometimes its both , but its not a reciprocated feeling on either of our parts , and either way , its just my truth . <p> Truthfully , I forget that this may be a big deal for some people until being in a relationship is brought up as a presumed shared experience between people . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  you hate when you run into an ex ? " or " You know , everyones had their heart broken , " and you 're over here shrugging like , " Yeah , I definitely know what you mean , " because you do n't  want to bring it up and make it an accidental huge deal ? ( OK , maybe that 's just me , but still ) <p> Let me be crystal clear : there is nothing wrong with being single your whole life . Sometimes you 're going to feel like an affirmation-chanting cliche where you 're talking about " the universe " too much or how meditating changed your life . Not gon na lie , sometimes you 're going to feel super sad and lonely . Spoilers : the " OMG , I 'll never have a boyfriend " feeling you have when you 're 14 feels exponentially more hopeless the older you get . <p> But what 's absolutely going to happen is someone , when you least expect it , is going to show up in your life and sweep you off your feet and love you forevermake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , family member , or stranger , is going to make you feel weird for never having been in a relationship . Why ? Its weird because its not normalized . No one is talking about it , so everyone assumes that perpetually single people are somehow defective , which is a bold faced lie . <p> So , let 's open that conversation , shall we ? Here are 20 things no one tells you about being single your whole life . <p> 1 ) You 're pretty much over having a crush . <p> Somehow , your brain knows that this gigantic crush you have is the farthest you 're ever going to get and even dreaming about being in a relationship with them feels super false and far fetched . <p> 2 ) You always assume that you 're going places with friends . <p> When you 're invited somewhere with a plus one or you 're presumed to go with a date ( Hey , prom ! I never went to you for this exact reason . You too , homecoming ! ) , you immediately flip through all single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you so you do n't  feel like a loser . Go with your bf/gf ?

Do we formally say that were in a relationship or do I just wait it out ? When do we make this FB official ? I 'm so confused and I do n't  want to jinx it . Were definitely dating but are we- dating-dating ? Does hooking up count as dating ? <p> 5 ) You never know if you should tell your friends or mom about people you 're " hanging out " with . <p> Bless those people who are closest to us : they get their hopes up if someone so much as smiles in our direction . We cant break their hearts and ( probably ) our hearts , too . <p> 6 ) I know this is gon na end , so how does this end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real relationship , so while most people are busy actually enjoying their third dates , your brain is going , " I bet they 're just waiting for sex to leave . Maybe they 're gon na say they just want to keep it casual . They probably just got out of a relationship or some shit . " <p> 7 ) The thought of having a significant other is totally laughable . <p> Fully aware that everyone is lovable in their own way , but being in love with the person who 's in love with you has become such an unattainable dream that its almost like how you imagine one day winning the lottery : itd be nice , but its just not gon na happen . <p> 8 ) In the back of your mind , you 're constantly wondering " Am I being too picky ?

Why are n't  you dating someone ? You know you life is going to be so much better/different when you have someone to share it with . " <p> Seriously , did they have a meeting or something ? Bless them , they mean well , but OMG , no pressure or anything . Relax . <p> 14 ) Your friends will constantly tell you to enjoy it and that youre so much better off not being in relationships in the first place . <p> Which might be the most annoying thing , ever .

Do n't  be embarrassed . <p> 17 ) But that does n't  stop all of your friends from over explaining what being in a relationship is *really* like . <p> Ugh , give me a break , I 'm not dumb . <p> 18 ) No one takes your relationship advice seriously . <p> All other times ? Totally the go-to advice person . But if were talking about how your bf/gf is totally mistreating you , we " just do n't  get it . " <p> 19 ) People constantly treat you like you 're less mature . <p> Stop treating your relationship history like a resume for your life .

I have literally never felt so panicky in my life . I finally called my brother and begged him to come home from work to kill the spider for me .

We all want to believe the best about people , even more so when it comes to our crush or our significant other . Sometimes , our gut notices these signs and tells us that something is wrong , and we choose to ignore it because we do n't  really want to believe it . <p> No one deserves to be taken advantage of , and if the person you trust is doing that to you , you need to leave the relationship . Sticking it out and hoping it will change will never make things better it will only make them worse . Let me give you a quick example . I have a friend who has been dating a guy for a very long time . He s been taking advantage of her from the beginning and now , even after years of being together , he still wo n't make things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really depressing to watch . <p> You deserve better than that ! Look out for these 10 signs a guy is taking advantage of you , and if he is ? Kick him to the curb . 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> You Only Hang Out On His Terms <p> I was once with a guy who was clearly taking advantage of me . We only hung out when he made plans , and those " plans " were usually made at the last minute . When I asked to make plans , he would either ignore me or say he was busy . Once we were hanging out , we only did what he felt like doing - we never did what I wanted to do . If this is happening for you , it 's a bad sign . <h> He Wants To Hook Up Every Time You 're Together <p> A real relationship is about a lot more than just hooking up . So , if a guy is using you just for sex , he 's going to make everything about sex all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they consist only of you going over there , starting to watch a movie , hooking up , and then leaving shortly afterwards , that means he 's only in this for sex . <h> He Refuses To Make Things Official <p> How does he react when you ask to make your relationship official ? A dude who cares about you and really wants to be with you will make a commitment to you . If he has all sorts of excuses like , " I do n't like commitment " or " I 'm not ready for a relationship " or " I just want to keep this casual , " then something is holding him back . If he wo n't make things official no matter what , watch out - he 's taking advantage of you because he knows he can get away with it . <h> Everything Is Always About Him <p> Does he ever ask you how you 're doing ? Does he ask about your day and genuinely care about the answer ? Is he ever concerned with your feelings ? Remember that guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was super selfish and made everything about him . We could hang out if he wanted to , but not if I did . We could go out if he felt like it , but not if I wanted to . We could talk about him and his problems , but never mine . Take note of this stuff . <h> He Always Asks For Help Even If He Does n't Help You <p> Sometimes a guy is n't taking advantage of you for sex - sometimes he 's doing it for something else you have . That could be money , or a car to ride around in , or even just someone to lean on whenever he 's feeling lonely . I have a friend who dated a guy who clearly only kept her around so she could give him a ride and lend him money when he needed it . He NEVER did anything for her . A relationship is a give-and-take thing . If he asks for help , he should be willing to give it to you when you need it . <h> He Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping track of any romantic gestures or especially nice moments . Do they always seem to happen before he asks you to do something for them ? If so , he 's manipulating you and taking advantage . My friend 's boyfriend who takes advantage of her gets super , super sweet every time he needs a big favor . Also , whenever she tells him she 's done , he pulls out all the stops when it comes to romance - sending her flowers , buying her gifts , sending sweet texts . Once she 's back , it all stops . Pay attention to when your guy is extra nice . <p> The guy I dated who took advantage of me did this all the time : he refused to be my boyfriend , but he wanted me to act like he was my boyfriend . He got furiously jealous every time I flirted with other guys ( even though he flirted with other girls ) . He expected me to be around whenever he needed me , and he wanted me there when he needed to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <h> He Flirts With/Sees Other Girls <p> One huge sign that he 's taking advantage of you ? If he flirts with or hooks up with other girls while keeping you on the side . This means he just wants you there when he wants you . That 's selfish and gross . <h> He Never Says Thank You <p> How does he react when you do something for him ? If he never says thank you or expresses any sort of real appreciation , this means he just expects you to do this stuff and is n't actually grateful for any of it . In other words , he 's taking advantage .

And what can I do to get rid of stretch marks on my boobs ? <p> Do n't  freak out , girl : this is totally normal . Stretch marks happen to every woman , regardless of their shape or weight .

That 's exactly where the stretch marks came from the skin on your breasts stretching . <p> When they first appear , stretch marks are usually a reddish or purple color , and are a different texture than the rest of your skin .

Well , bloating does n't only affect your stomach - it can also cause swelling in your feet and hands . When you get your period , your body retains more water , which in turn causes the swelling . <h> You Do n't Want To Be Social <p> Whenever you get your period , do you feel like you just want to lie in bed and not talk to anyone all day ? You 're not alone . Feeling like you want to be on your own for a few days is called social withdrawal , and can be a symptom of PMS . It goes hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on . <h> You Have Trouble Sleeping <p> It 's common knowledge that your period might make you more tired and worn-out . But did you know it can also make it harder to sleep ? Right before your period , your estrogen levels will drop , which can make you feel really hot while you sleep - which is uncomfortable and may wake you up . Your progesterone levels also drop , and this can cause a little bit of insomnia . <h> Your Senses Are Increased <p> Some women have reported heightened senses during that time of the month . They might smell a little bit better , hear a little better , or taste things more . It could be just one , or all of the above . It 's different for everyone ! 
@@45901375 @5901375/ <p> We 've all got a few bad habits that we 've been told we have to kick because they 're not good for us but as it turns out , those bad habits really are n't  that bad after all . A recent post in The Daily Mail talks about the health benefits of five " bad " habits that I 'm sure we can all relate to and proves that maybe we really do n't  need to stop doing these things . <p> Since I do a few of these things myself , this is actually kind of a relief for me . I 'm so sick of doing some of this stuff and then having people around me be like , " Jessica , you seriously need to stop , " and I 'm just like , " Let me live . " Now I can take this post and shove it in their faces . *evil laugh* <p> Want to see if any of your " bad " habits are on this list ? Check out what might not be so bad after all : <p> Burping : As the Daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turns out , its really actually good for you . Burping is basically a release of natural gas in your stomach and its pretty important to the way your body functions . Its actually a completely normal part of digestion and stopping yourself from doing it when you feel one coming on is bad for you . So basically , burping is n't the bad habit not burping is ! Now , that does n't  mean you should walk around burping the alphabet in a public place , but it does mean that you should n't feel so embarrassed about it happening . <p> Biting your nails : This is a pretty common bad habit that I 'm actually having sort of a hard time believing is n't that bad . I do n't  have this habit myself , but I know a lot of people who do and wish they did n't  . But as it turns out , the worst thing about nail biting might be coming away with some gnarly fingernails that are n't  up for a manicure . Putting the bacteria on your nails in your mouth may help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick in the future . Dr. Hilary Longhurst tells the Daily Mail , " Unless your hands are filthy , the bugs we encounter when biting our nails could boost our immune system . " Who knew nail biting could keep you healthy ? <p> Farting : Just like with burping , farting may be rude , but that does n't  mean its bad for your bod . This is another way your body releases the gas that builds up inside of you and its pretty important to not , uh , hold it in . Releasing this gas helps to relieve that horrible bloating feeling you can get after eating sometimes . Not farting can actually be pretty painful . If you really need to do it , I would n't suggest letting one rip in the middle of all of your friends awkward . <p> Cracking your knuckles : Ahh , my favorite bad habit of all time . Guys , I 'm the worst when it comes to cracking . I crack my fingers at least once an hour and pretty much anything else that can be cracked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my hips , shoulders , elbows , the list goes on . I 'm always told to stop immediately , but contrary to popular belief , it really is n't harming your joints . In fact , its actually making them more flexible . <p> Eating in bed : Okay , honestly I 've never really heard about this being bad . I think moms just made it up because they did n't  want their kids getting crumbs in their beds and leading to icky little bugs . But if you 've been told you shouldnt do it , fight back because eating in bed actually may help aid digestion . Its sort of a stretch , but doctors tell the Daily Mail that when you 're in bed , you 're more likely to be relaxed and when you 're relaxed , your digestion is better . So go on and eat your dinner all cozy under your covers ! Just be neat , please . <p> So , you 're welcome for all of this handy info that will enable you to keep up with your " bad " habits . However , as with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never good . Doing any of these things excessively probably is n't going to offer as many health benefits , so keep things simple , short and sweet . <p> Which of these bad habits are you guilty of ? What other bad habits do you have that are n't  mentioned on this list ?

Dr. Jaque says : <p> " It can take up to two years for a girl to start ovulating every month ( which can lead to pregnancy ) after starting their period . A girl can ovulate in an unpredictable pattern any time after starting her period , which is why one should never gamble and have unprotected sex once they start their period . " <p> Youve probably heard older women or girls talking about period cramps . They 're pretty common and they 're definitely not fun , although cramp intensity and frequency can vary from person to person . Some people only get cramps just before they start menstruating each month , some have them throughout their period , and some people do not have them at all . <p> You can talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some pain relief for your cramps . Over-the-counter pain medications like aspirin , ibuprofen or Midol will help . Taking a bath or using a heating pad might also provide some relief . You can also check our article about some weird , yet effective remedies for menstrual cramps ! <p> What kind of menstrual products should I use for my first period ? <p> There are three main kinds of personal care products that you can use once you start menstruating : Pads , tampons and menstrual cups . For the first time , many girls use pads , but there 's no reason why you ca n't use whatever you are most comfortable with . <p> Pads , sometimes called sanitary pads or sanitary napkins , - are absorbent items that you put inside your underwear to soak up the flow of blood . The ones you can buy in the drugstore are usually made out of some combination of plastic and cotton , but you can buy reusable fabric ones if you 'd like . You should change a pad every few hours . <p> Pads can not be flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can wrap it in the wrapper it came in or in toilet paper and place it in the trash . Many public restrooms have areas that are specifically designed for pad or tampon disposal . <p> Tampons are basically a soft mass of fabric ( usually cotton ) that absorbs the blood from your period . You insert a tampon into your vagina , where it stays and absorbs your menstrual flow . Tampons have strings attached , so you can easily pull them out of your vagina when you are ready for a new one . They come in several different varieties , including with and without an applicator . You can also buy them in different absorbencies , including light , regular , super and super plus . Many women like tampons because they are less messy than pads and because they make it easier to continue doing physical activities like swimming , dancing and sports . <p> here 's a great video that explains how to insert a tampon , from blogger SaphiraFashion : <p> It might feel a little funny or awkward the first time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . There are detailed instructions on insertion inside each and every box of tampons . If you feel comfortable , you might also ask your mom , your sister , a close female relative or a friend to help you or show you how to insert one . <p> You should only wear a tampon for four to eight hours at a time . You might have heard the words " toxic shock syndrome " in relation to tampon use . Toxic shock syndrome is a dangerous illness that 's been associated with using tampons . It is caused by bacteria and has been shown to be linked to cases where women left tampons inside their bodies for long periods of time . It was more common during the 1980s , when tampons with a higher level of absorbency were sold . Although TSS is very rare and is becoming rarer all the time , its still something to be aware of if you plan to use tampons . <p> Some people say that if a girl uses a tampon before she 's had penetrative intercourse for the first time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserting a tampon for the first time can sometimes disturb your hymen . A hymen is a thin fringe skin-like tissue that is present in the vaginas of some women and girls . Not everyone has one . Hymens can break for many reasons , including horseback riding , playing sports , or just by living your life as a female . <p> In some cultures , whether or not you have a hymen can indicate whether you are a virgin or not. - Using a tampon does not affect whether or not you are a virgin . Virginity is about sexual contact and/or intercourse , not the physical condition of your vulva or vagina . <p> Some tampons can be flushed down the toilet , but others can not . If you 're worried about clogging the pipes or your toilet , you can always wrap a used one up and throw it in the trash . <p> Menstrual cups are small vessels , usually made of silicone , that you insert inside your vagina to hold the blood from your menstrual flow . - They are bigger than tampons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit up against your cervix ( the tip of your uterus ) to catch the blood . Instead of throwing them away when you 're done , like you would with a pad or tampon , you take the menstrual cup out and rinse it in the sink . Unlike tampons and pads , they can be worn for up to 12 hours . <p> Some popular brands of menstrual cups are the DivaCup , Mooncup and Lunette. - Personally , I like using a menstrual cup because its reusable . I save money on pads and tampons and I contribute less waste to the world as a whole . <p> If you happen to get some blood on your clothing while you 're having your period , its not a big deal . Cold water is great at getting blood out ; Simply rinse and squeeze once you 're able to take your underwear off . - If any blood remains , a simple stain remover should take care of it . <p> Some women even have designated " period underwear " which they wear only when they 're menstruating . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That way , it does n't  really matter if they get a little bit ( or even a lot ) of blood on them during a period . <p> As someone who got her first period on a rental car shuttle in the Orlando airport after a trip to Disney World , I speak from experience when I say : - Stay calm , stay cool and if you can , laugh it off . <p> Whether you leaked all over the back of your pants in front of your entire math class or if your dog dug your pad out of the trash while your boyfriend was on the couch , I promise that no one cares as much about what just happened as you do . Seriously . While it might seem like the end of the world now , anyone who was witness to your embarrassing period story will probably forget it sooner than you think . <p> And believe me , it would be really hard to find any woman who does n't  have an embarrassing period story . Pretty much everyone has gone through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing to remember is that its only one period , one day and one event . <p> Subsequent periods are bound to be better ! Soon , having your period will become more normal and a lot less stressful and embarrassing . And remember , there are also actually a few good things about having your period ! <p> If you 've ever wondered what guys think about periods , this video from Gurl should be able to she 'd a little light on the situation : <p> How can I talk to my parents about my period ? <p> Families are all different . You may feel comfortable talking to your parents about your period , or you may not . Your parent or guardian may have already talked to you about your period , or they might not have . Either way , its a great step to inform yourself about your own body and its cycles . <p> If you feel nervous or embarrassed bringing up the subject , you might try talking to just one of your parents alone , without siblings or anyone else present . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is important to let someone know once you 've started menstruation , just so your parent or guardian can help you get supplies if you need them . <p> How do I know if my period is normal or not ? <p> If you 're asking yourself- " Is my period normal ? " - remember that " normal " is different for every person . Your menstrual cycle can take up to two years to regulate itself . You might get a period for three months in a row and then not have one for a month or two . This is n't necessarily anything to be concerned about . <p> If you are worried that you have an irregular menstrual cycle , you should talk to your doctor . Your cycle can be affected by all sorts of things , including your diet , your weight , stress and the amount of physical activity you participate in . The most important thing to do is to pay attention to your body from month to month and learn what is normal and healthy for you .

If you did n't  , you might want to get a pregnancy test just to be sure . <p> Dr. Ross adds : " If you forget to take pills often , you might want to change to another form of birth control that you do n't have to take every day . Examples would be long-acting contraception such as the IUD , Depo-Provera and Norplant implants . Another alternative is the Nuvaring , which is a flexible , plastic ring that is placed in the back of the vagina working like the birth control pill , with the exception that you leave it in place for 21 days and remove it for 7 .

@@45901390 @5901390/ <h> Everything You Need To Know About Statutory Rape <p> What exactly is statutory rape ? Find all the answers to your questions about stat rape and age of consent here ! Illustration by Sarah Wintner <p> Statutory rape is probablyno , definitelythe most controversial topic for you , our readers . Not something super divisive like abortion or feminism , statutory rape . Every time we write about it we get a ton of comments claiming that were being unfair , that we do n't  believe in true love and that were old fuddy duddies who are n't  getting any . Well , I can assure you , were none of those things , but we are definitely young women who are trying to look out for yall . <p> Love is love , but laws are laws and sketchy is sketchy . When it comes to statutory rape , sometimes there 's a shade of gray that makes things complicated , but were going to try to keep it real . So here 's everything you need to know about statutory rape . <p> What is statutory rape ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which one person is under the age of consenting to sexual activity in the first place . <p> So its not real rape ? <p> Well , rape is about consent . If you 're underage you ca n't consent to having sex . See ? Its not necessarily the violent rape you 're probably thinking of , but its still a form of rape . <p> Okay , how do I find out what the age of consent is where I live . <p> Yeah , its such a faux pas to link to Wikipedia , but they have an extensive list of- the age of consent- in every single country/state/territory on the planet so there you go . <p> Wait , so if I 'm under the age of consent then what happens if I have consensual sex with someone else who is also under the age of consent ? <p> Well , in some states then technically both of you have broken the law . But jaywalking is also against the law and people do that all the time . The point I 'm making is that unless someone goes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youre safe to continue doing whatever you two are doing . <p> Isnt it sort of stupid for a law to determine how old I have to be to consent to sex ? <p> Yes and no . Everyone matures at different ages ; some 16-year-olds are more mature than 20-year-olds and are able to make smarter decisions about sex than their elders , that 's true . But one of the best ways to understand why statutory rape laws are in place is to look outside of how mature you think you are and think about things a little more generally . For example , with age differences comes a power play . Come on , we all know that there 's a difference between a 16-year-old and an 18-year-old being in a relationship compared to a 14-year-old and a 30-year-old . Statutory rape laws are generally far more concerned with the latter . They protect kids and teenagers from manipulative predators who can easily manipulate their way into a younger persons heart and bedroom . <p> Okay but what if the age difference is super tiny ! what if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he be charged with statutory rape ? <p> Now , here 's where things get a little funky and there 's a name for this funkiness : Romeo and Juliet laws . Sort of dramatic sounding , right ? Trust , its really not as over the top and fatal as it sounds . Basically , Romeo and Juliet laws reduce or terminate the penalty of statutory rape in cases in which the age difference between two sexually active and consenting partnersone above and one below the age of consentis very minimal . This means that some statutory rape laws exclude situations where the age difference fits a particular time frame , like if the older partner was less than three years older than you , or if you were over a certain agesay , 14when you two had sex . Some even disregard cases in which the sexual relationship started before one of the partners was over the age of consent . For example , you 're 16-years-old , your partner just turned 18-years-old and the age of consent is 17-years-old ; if you and your partner were having sex then both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws protect your older partner from getting in trouble . <p> Other laws make statutory rape charges involving minor age differences less severe , but still pretty intense ; some charge the older partner with a misdemeanor instead of a felony , others promise that their record will be erased after serving a certain amount of time in jail and there are even laws that require the older partner to register as a sex offender for a given period of time in leu of jail . <p> Again , these provisions are only applicable if the age difference between you and an older partner fits within a given time frame of whatever statutory rape laws apply to where you live . <p> So if you 're a little lost , think of it this way : Romeo and Juliet laws are in place to protect teens and young adults within a certain age range from getting in trouble just because they 're getting it on . One thing that sucks about these provisions , however , is that some less progressive states or countries make sure that Romeo and Juliet laws do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> But if I was hooking up with , say , my soccer coach or something then <p> Yeah , no , most laws are not- going to protect your ( creepy ) coach in that case . Why ? Because like I said earlier the law also acknowledges power play . A teacher or coach or another adult is in a position of authority and power over someone who is underage , period . Seriously , no matter how mature you are , that person is still a " grown up " ( for lack of a better term ) who is in a position of power over you , the student/teen. - Honestly , your teacher , coach , whatever should know better than to engage in a relationship with you if you 're underage . Theyre supposed to be there to guide you through a certain subject or skill , not guide you to the bedroom . Do n't  feel like the weird one here , seriously. - <p> Also , LOL , bye bye career if they 're caught . <p> If one of your underage friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone . No , really , nobody is fit to teach at a school if they 're going to creep on their students . Imagine if your little bro or sis was getting hit on by their teacher . Naw <p> What if my parents are okay with our relationship ! <p> Does n't  matter , its not like they 're approving of you two to be legally married or something . <p> Age is nothing but a number . Stop lecturing us ! <p> Um , its a little more complicated than that . When you 're oder , age starts to matter less . But when you 're still a teenager , age differences are a way bigger deal . Hell , by the time you 're in 10th grade , the 7th graders all seem so tiny , right ? Now multiply that and you 'll get a better idea of the weirdness . <p> Think of it this way : Imagine being 17 and dating someone six years younger than you . That 's an 11-year-old ! You 're at a totally different stage of life and maturity at 17 than you are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old , there is way less of a huge maturity difference . If you 're 15 and dating someone who is 25 , however , you 're also at very different stages of life . A 23 year old would be out of college trying to live their life . Most 15 year olds are still in high school and are n't  even allowed to drive yet , let alone get served at a bar like their 23-year-old boyfriend . As someone who is 23 right now , the idea of dating someone who is 15-years-old makes my head spin . Teenagers are livin their teenage lives , going to school , worrying about college apps , etc . When I was 15 those were my biggest worries , on top of whether or not my crush noticed me and dealing with my parents . But now , as a 23-year-old ? Um , Im worried about paying rent , getting to work on time , andstill wondering if my crush notices me but still , the point is that life is just different . Its still fun and exciting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was mature for my age as a teenager , people always thought I was older than I was . The fact that I was tall and was an only child ( SO MANY ADULTS ALL THE TIME ) helped , on top of the fact that I was well spoken and pretty smart ; I was talking to adults about politics and current events all the time ! But no matter how mature I was , in retrospect I know that I was n't as mature as I am now that I 'm sort of an adult . <p> So I 'm going to tell you from my point of view why something just smells- off when someone in their 20s and older is dating a teenager . While I interact with awesome teenage girls on the internet all the time ( uh , pretty rad job ) - I 'd still have to go out of my way to hang around enough high schoolers in real life enough to fall in love with one . So imagine that from someone who does n't  have a job talking to teen girls about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I knew that any of my friends were trying to hook up with underage high school kids , I 'd be freaked out . I know that it seems cool to be 16 and have someone in their mid-20s or older take a liking to you . Its like , wow , you 're finally hanging with a guy who is more mature than the goofs in your grade ; someone who does n't  think that fart jokes are witty . Yeah , if you 're a straight girl then high school boys can definitely suck , but you have to ask yourself a few questions about a considerably older partner , too . Are they going to still be into you when you 're not a teenager anymore ? Do they just have a thing for underage girls ? Why are n't  they dating women in their age range ? No , seriously , why cant they get a woman their own age ? - <p> I 'm immediately reminded of R. Kelly who had a relationship with the late ( and great ) singer Aaliyah back in the 90s . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that it looked as if she was 18-years-old when they decided to- marry each other . They got annulled a year later . Flash forward to 2002 when Kelly 35 and was allegedly caught on tape having sex with an underage girl . Its not like he just happened to be in love with Aaliyah way back when and she just happened to be underage ; this dude clearly has a thing for underage girls . Some dudes are just like that and you have to wonder why . You do n't  want to end up being some dudes one true love until you 're no longer an underage teen anymore . <p> I was talking to a friend of mine the other day who said that when she was in high school she had a 25-year-old boyfriend . She said , " it was the coolest , because I was way mature for my age . " They dated until her parents found out and were absolutely furious . She had a bit of a smile and a faraway look in her eye as she reflected on her time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , " In retrospect , I 'm glad my parents were pissed off . They should have been . That dude should n't have been wanting to hang out with a teenage girl in the first place , that 's justweird . " <p> I know , this seems like a very western approach to ages and life stages and I know that this varies from culture to culture , but work with me here . But its telling that in some countries there are movements in place protecting underage girls from adult men who are trying to put a ring on it , so looking out for young girls and teens is a priority for many women around the world , not just me ! <p> But people my own age are so immature ! <p> Dealing with immature people as teenagers is just part of the journey , girl . The answer is n't to date your cute science teacher or some random 30-year-old dude . <p> Some people in those relationships really work out , though ! <p> Sure , but do we want Mary Kay Laterno scenarios to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . <p> For those of you who do n't  know , Laterno was a teacher who , at the age of 34 , had a sexual relationship with her 12-year-old student . After serving jail time , they got married . Yeahcan we get a hell to the no ? <p> - <p> Do you think stat rape laws are too strict ? Have you or a friend ever been in a regretful relationship with a much older person ? Tell us in the comments ? <p> I 'm in the 11th grade and my crush is in the 12th grade . Good news is that the age of consent where I live is 16 ! The bad news is that we could only date for 5 months at a time . He s 18 and will turn 19 in January . There 's an age gap rule that you can be 16 , but they ca n't be no more than two years older than you . And I 'm sixteen . <p> carly <p> what kind of article is this ? Educational , informative or sheer brainwashing strategy ? What kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making girls paranoid and confused . <p> kitty <p> Statutory rape is just a convenient term . Then they use the tern " underage " meaning that all 13 , 14 , 15 , or 16 yr old girls are just dumb and stupid and can not give consent for sex . <p> I find this ridiculous and this is my opinion . We have such laws but are these laws really relevant or sensible or reasonable ? <p> Well if you go to South America and Europe the age of consent is 13 . But in some places like the USA the age of consent is 16 . In Egypt the age of consent is 18 . <p> So by Egyptian standards , in USA many teenagers are committing rape if a 16 yr old girl has consensual sex with an 18 yr old . Do n't  you think this is totally screwed up and we like cows follow the herd without even questioning . <p> How dumb are we ? <p> Now people will try and convince us that this is for the benefit and protection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now tell me which of us want to be categorised in this pathetic group we call naive , underage and vulnerable . If you do want to be part of that group they are telling you that you are a dumb bunch with no mind of your own and an inability to make a decision if you want to have sex or not . <p> Then comes the question as to why is it so bad to fall in love with someone older . Oh that 's because it seems that people are so paranoid that every older guy somehow wants to take advantage of your virginity and wants to force you and brainwash you into having sex . Little do they realise or are conveniently blind to the fact that most of these sexual crimes are committed by guys our own age and NOT by older guys who are more aware of the consequences , are more endearing and because they know the consequences tend to be more careful and caring of us that guys our own age who know that the law wont come down heavily on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a load of croc and a method of brain washing you into believing that someone actually cares . No they are not . This is just silly , stupid propaganda . <p> I 'm currently 15 , and in my opinion I am very mature for my age . I 'm quite shy and out of the way and before my current boyfriend , I have only had one other boyfriend who was my age . A few months ago however , I met this guy who really seemed to like me and which was very flattering and a huge boost for my ego and self esteem . We started dating after weeks of him pestering me and so now , we are finally a couple and have been together about three months.Hes 23 btw . I 've always had a thing for older guys so I did n't  think much of it at the time , I thought he just liked me for my personality but then I started wondering if my age was the true appeal to him . We have n't had sex or even done more then kiss yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the UK ) in case he " gets his ass kicked by my dad and sent to jail for pedophilia " - his words . No-one knows Im dating him . not even my BFF , but we do dirty talk sometimes ( I 'm a virgin so its pretty awkward for me ) and he seems to get.really turned on by my innocence . Recently , started being pretty abusive to me.not physically but verbally , he makes me cry often and says mean things to me , our relationship is n't fun anymoreand reading this article Ive come to realize how wrong our relationship is . I want to break up with him but I 'm scared of what he will do to me if I leave him . He sometimes tells me things like if I cheat on him he will kill me and goes in to detail- I 'm really scared of him and have no idea how I did n't  see his true colours before we started dating . I 'm so angry at myself for getting into this messbut in a wierd way , I still like hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A <p> Oh my god that must be really hard for you What you need to do is tell your parents and they will support you when you call the police I wish you well and I hope the lock up your scummy ex-boyfriend forever <p> Kaitlin <p> When I was sixteen , this 24 year old was into me , and in retrospect , it makes me feel totally sickened .

@@45901399 @5901399/ <h> I Used To Hate Eating In Front Of Guys , Especially My Crushes <p> Yesterday , I wrote this article called 12 Things You Think Freak Guys Out That They Actually Do n't  Care About , and I was pretty happy about it until I realized I might be kind of a hypocrite . One of the examples I gave was eating in front of guys . I made a point of saying that you should never feel embarrassed about eating in front of guys because that 's just silly . <p> The problem ? Up until recently , I was totally one of those girls who hated eating in front of guys , especially guys I liked or was dating . In fact , it got to a point where I downright refused to eat in front of a dude I had a crush on . As in , I would literally be so hungry my stomach was growling , but I just could n't bring myself to actually eat anything in front of him . <p> This might not sound so horrible , but refusing to eat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , dinner dates were simply out of the question . It took me months of dating my first BF to feel comfortable enough to go out to dinner with him . I still remember sitting in the restaurant , self-consciously ordering the healthiest , smallest item on the menu and then barely touching it . My first BF and I dated for almost five years , and so I eventually felt okay enough to eat in front of him ( if that never happened , I would probably have died from starvation a long time ago ) . But once we broke up , the cycle started right back up again . <p> When guys I liked asked me out , they would usually ask me to go on a normal date you know , dinner and a movie . Coming up with reasons as to why I did n't  want to go to a restaurant was really difficult . What was I supposed to say ? " No , I do n't  want to eat in front of you ? " Even I knew that would make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to subtly get around it by straight up lying . I would say things like , " I have to have dinner with my grandparents ( ? ? ? ? ) , but I can meet you for a movie afterwards ? " Then when he would inevitably try to schedule it for a better time , I would insist that this worked fine . <p> There are only so many times you can say you already have dinner plans before a guy starts being like , " Why do n't  you want me to pay for your meal " So , I would just start avoiding it . When a guy asked to go get dinner , I 'd be like , " Let 's just see a movie instead , I really want to see this ! " Or , " How about coffee ? " I could deal with drinking a coffee or tea in front of a dude . <p> Throughout college , I successfully avoided any and all dinner dates with guys this way . Seriously , I did n't  go on ONE dinner date with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my anxiety , but it also confused the heck out of some dudes . And in some cases , I think it made me seem a little uninterested . It was a confusing time . <p> What made this even more difficult for me was that , for seven years , I was a waitress at various restaurants and many times , I dated or crushed on guys I worked with . Let me spell this out for you : I was a girl who HATED eating in front of guys , and I worked in an environment where everyone around me was constantly eating because free food was all around . It was a mild form of torture . <p> At one restaurant , the owners regularly gave us food at the end of the night . Everyone around me would be happily eating , but if my crush was present , I just could n't bring myself to join . Even when I was starving , after an 8-hour shift , I could n't eat . Ill even admit this embarrassing secret to you guys : sometimes I would steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quickly scarf it down so no one would see me . That is mortifying . And ridiculous . One of the guys I was casually dating was a cook at the restaurant we worked at . He would try to sneak me food or offer to make me things and I would always be like , " hehe no Im not hungry . " Judging from the weird looks he started giving me after a while , he definitely thought I hated his cooking . <p> I wish I could tell you that I matured right after college and realized how silly I was being , but that 's not true . When I met my current boyfriend over three years ago , I was still doing this whole " I wont eat in front of you if I like you " thing . For our first date , my BF told me he wanted to take me to a really nice restaurant because he could tell I deserved something special . SO sweet , right ? Yeah , I was n't having it . The first time , I broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after my dinner with my grandparents ( I blamed them for a lot of things ) and we could go to the movies . He was disappointed but said okay . <p> Our first date went great ! At the end , he promised me he would take me to a nice restaurant for our second date . I was n't even excited . Instead I was immediately filled with anxiety thinking about eating in front of him . After my best friend yelled at me , I grudgingly gave in and went with him . We went to an Italian restaurant . I did n't  want to be " that girl " who ordered a side salad , so I got pasta with broccoli and picked at it while he asked me if I was sure it was okay . " Yeah ! " I said . " I just do n't  eat that much ! " ( This is not true . ) <p> For the first few months of us dating , I barely ate in front of him . I would literally be starving next to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , and I 'd be like " No thanks , not hungry ! " WHY DID I DO THIS I WAS SO HUNGRY . <p> Finally , after months of torturing myself , I asked if I could have some pretzels while we were hanging out . This was a big step for me . Eventually , as I started to feel more comfortable around him , I started eating more . Cut to three and a half years later and the other day I polished off half a pint of Ben &amp; Jerrys Smores ice cream with him . This is a Big Deal for me . <p> I 'm not sure where my eating issues came from all I know is that they always just seemed to be there . Throughout middle school , high school , and college , I dealt with a lot of self-esteem issues and I had little to no confidence . Most of the time I felt overweight- ( which , technically , I 've never been ) . I guess I felt that if a guy saw me eating , he would automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fattie . No wonder she looks like that . " The fact that I thought that way makes me really sad , but to be honest with you guys , I still sort of feel this way . <p> I have definitely gotten better , though . While I am absolutely not comfortable eating in front of new people , I do it ( even though I feel anxious the entire time ) . When my BF and I broke up for two months , I went on an actual , real , first dinner date with a guy ( it did n't  end well , but that was because he bragged about being the best drunk driver ever , which is just a story for another time ) . I honestly feel like now , if my BF and I broke up , I would be able to handle a dinner date with a different guy . Would it be hard ? Yes . Would I not eat as much as I would if I were alone ? Yes . But I would eat . And that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way ? Have you ever been self-conscious about eating in front of people you have a crush on ? Why did you feel that way ? Tell me in the comments . <p> This happens to me too only when I really like that person even after knowing them for years I guess I need to pretend there not therethere no one important or do n't  fall to hard idk but I do n't  want him to get turned off either smh idk what 2 do but I also think what will he say when he sees me eat that has me so afraid because he s thicker than me idk <p> bethan <p> Hurray for story time <p> Basically , I cant eat in front of someone I do n't  know well . I can eat in front of strangers who I 'm not talking to , and friends and family have the honour of seeing me eating constantly . But with new people , its a whole lotta nope . <p> I was with my friend , and she introduced me to 5 guys who were all attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that I was hungry . I was given money and was thinking " sweet ! MacDonald here I come " when we bumps into those guys . I was walking around , behind my friends , saying nothing with my scarf around my mouth . And my friends like " are you okay ? " A million times an I just nod , because words failed me <p> We go to subway , everyone orders like a normal person . Not me . I take about 3 minutes to order a turkey sandwich . Bread . Butter . Turkey . That 's it . I sit down after confusing the guy behind the counter , take 3 bites , hide the rest under the napkin and throw it away <p> Then one of the guys is hungry ( again ) so he buys a burger , fries , marshmallows , cream desserts , and eat everything . While he s eating , he offers me some chips . I decline . He offers again . I decline . He says " your not fat , just have some " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I get chips thrown at me . <p> *** Next day me and my friends spend the whole day with those guys , meaning all I eat is a haribo all day . Why ? Because my brain is evil <p> Lily <p> My boyfriend wants to take me out for ice cream and pay ! I did n't  want to be rude and turn down his genuinely sweet offer so I said " I would love that " I 'm giving myself panic attacks trying to think of a way to get out of this date because eating Infront of him would kill me ! ! 3 years ago I suffered from anorexia and all though I 'm fully recovered the thought of eating Infront of anyone ( even my parents ) scares me because I got in to the routine of never eating when someone is around because in my mind I was " fat " I hope I can get over this and fast because I really do n't  want to turn his offer down but I do n't  want to face my fear either ! <p> Kyra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the movies with him today and some of my friends and his . I am absolutely terrified of ordering food at the movies . Also , my friend Rem wants to go to McDonalds afterwards-no thanks . I have been told by all my friends , my brother and my mum that they worry that i 'm getting too thin and that i 'm not eating enough . I have always had issues with weight and eating , but now I finally feel like i 'm not alone ! I remember i had a boyfriend many years ago and I was fine with eating infront of him , although I never had much . Now that I am with this guy , this fear has just come back in full force . Do you think it will slowly go away as I get to know him more ? I 'm really nervous today and I asked Rem to order something small for me so I do n't  starve . <p> Alex <p> I have done this for as long as I can remember . I always felt the need to decline the invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like/ am crushing on . I knew it was something absurd to obsess over but I would do it regardless of if I was actually hungry or not . Recently though , this really great guy I met asked me out for dinner and suprise it was sushi ; well i 'm not the best at the art that is " proper sushi dining " so I was hesitant to eat in front of him as per usual . He totally made things comfortable though ! At one point we both had rice everywhere and it did n't  even matter to me that we were out eating of all things as a first date . So I can totally relate to this and the fact that it is stupid to feel stupid about eating . <p> Cat <p> I have this problem too ! Its really horrible . I do n't  even know WHY but I just cant eat in front of a guy I 'm on a date with if its a sit down dinner . Snacks and coffee and stuff are fine , but like I cant eat it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fades over time but ughhhh . Why ? ! <p> Ashley <p> I have this problem too ! I had anorexia about three years ago , and in the recovery process I find it really hard to eat in front of guys , especially guys I like . my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years and we 've never even been on a dinner date . <p> Belem <p> This is totally me . I just recently got into my first real relationship , and like whenever he s around I just feel so sel-conscious . Not only because he s around but because I bully myself around , so its hard for me to eat in front of anyone . And this is totally me , Honestly I 've never felt soo understood . <p> Tia <p> YeahI have this problem definitely . I physically CANT eat because I feel sick when I 'm around people of whom I care what they think about me . My guy friends also tease me like " Is there something you 're not telling us ? " And I 'm just like " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm seriously just not hungry . " They look at me like I 'm a freak and there 's no way I ca n't be starving ( especially since we sometimes spend the whole day together ) . They call me " Mouse " and stuff . Its horrifying . I think its more embarrassing because they HAVE to know that I do n't  always eat that little , because I 'm like 20 pounds overweight . Yikes , its bad . LONG ... <p> Ria <p> My friend used to do the same ! And it was ME who felt awkward ! I always used to think , " cant girls eat in front of guys ? Isnt it attractive ? " Sometimes I used to do the same : I just felt embarrassed if I dropped some spag-bol on my top , like the clutz I am . But when I did n't  eat anything , my guy friends used to tell me off for wasting food . My insecurities have gone now . You 're doing well = <p> Sweettreat <p> You just wrote the story of my life . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a movie , and I could n't think of a way to reject the dinner part of the offer , so I blew off the whole thing by being like " No , let 's just do something simple , like a walk , instead " ( it was raining that day ) and he was like " okay . But , umwhy ? " and I stood there like OO and then I blurted out " Because I hate movies ! " <p> Who hates movies ? TT <p> " I just do n't  eat that much " I SAY THIS ALL THE TIME , and then when I go to restaurants with my girlfriends I finish my food AND theirs ! ! ! <p> So just know that you 're not alone . And yeah , this article opened my eyes , because this whole issue has to come from some problem I have with myself . Maybe I think if I accidentally eat like a slob the guy will leave me ? But then again , why would I want to date that kind of guy ? *sigh* <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I am in my late twenties and am getting more serious about the guys I date . Eating in front of people has always been an issue for me . I do n't  like to eat alone ( I also have issues with weight ) and find it awkward at times when sharing food or when people hesitate to split the bill . I guess it comes down to manners with me , as well as a comfort issue . Getting food in your teeth happens , but its not like everyone is your friend and wont judge you if it happens . Not to mention potential bad breath from whatever you ate . . . <p> alex <p> This is totally me ! Honestly , my food anxiety has gotten so bad that if I have n't known a PERSON ( not even crush anymore ) for more than a year I will not eat in front of them .

Even if you do n't  know it by name , you know it by the feeling : chub rub is when your thighs rub together as you walk , leaving an uncomfortable and painful rash that makes the mere act of moving miserable . <p> Chub rub can happen at any time , but it happens the most in the summer . The reasoning is obvious : its hot , were sweating , and that extra moisture is making chafing even worse . Chub rub is nothing to be ashamed of , but like I said , its painful ! No one wants to deal with it , but unfortunately , it pops up at the worst times . <p> Fortunately , there are ways to make chub rub disappear and there are also a few things you can do once you have it to make it more manageable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 12 tips to keep your inner thighs happy for the rest of the summer : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Apply Bodyglide <p> Tons of women ( and men ) swear by Bodyglide .

This multi-purpose beauty balm is n't made for anti-chafing or for chub rub specifically , but I 've read a few things about how people use it for just that . Dr. FeelGood is meant to be a balm you put on your face before or after your makeup to give your skin a smooth , silky feeling . This is a great product to use in a pinch . <h> Try These Special Anti-Chafing Shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress or skirt in the summer without wearing shorts underneath .

They feature a seamless inner thigh , stay put leg , and a signature Stay-Cool fabric . Undersummers were made by a plus-size woman , so you know they work . <h> Wear Biker Shorts <p> If you do n't feel like ordering a special pair of shorts , you can opt for regular biker shorts that you have around the house or that you can purchase at Target . Make sure you opt for a pair that is longer - short biker shorts will just ride up and make you feel even more uncomfortable . I 've heard girls swear by these Jockeys , which are light and comfy and come in a lot of different colors . <h> Wear Bandalettes <p> While wearing biker shorts under your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also mean more sweat .

When you 're in a rush or you 're in a pinch , put some baby powder on your inner thighs . This works , but it can also be messy . I 've also heard that it needs to be reapplied often , so if you 're putting on some in the morning for the whole day , expect it to run out - especially if you 're super sweaty . <h> Use Cooking Spray In A Pinch <p> Sometimes we 're in an emergency situation where we do n't have biker shorts or deodorant or baby power or anything .

A lot of girls use it on their inner thighs to prevent chub rub or even to soothe the rash if it 's already there . This stuff goes on smooth , smells great , and really works . It also has multiple other uses , so it could be something great to buy . <h> Use Monistat Gel <p> If you 're like , " Uh , I do n't need to get all fancy here , Jessica , I just want to get rid of an inner thigh rash , " then go for this Monistat Chafing Relief Powder Gel .

Neosporin will soothe and treat the rash , and it 's especially important if you get a cut or are bleeding . <h> Soothe Rashes With Coconut Oil <p> Okay , so I 've read a few reviews by girls who swear that coconut oil helps prevent chub rub .

So , to answer this question , I 've enlisted the help of- Dr. Flo ( Dr. Sherry Ross ) from- HelloFlo- ( a monthly period care package you need to check out ) to answer this question the best way possible . <p> First , its important to familiarize yourself with what discharge is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . Dr. Flo says , " Women have a normal white vaginal discharge along with healthy bacteria that protect the vagina from infection . The vagina and cervix create fluid that cleans up the unwanted bacteria , which prevents infection and keeps everything fresh and tidy .

The vagina is not mean tot smell like a rose garden , but it does have a familiar scent that many do enjoy . Depending on the time of the month , the vaginal discharge can change in consistency and smell . In between periods , typically around Day 14 , you may notice a clear-slippery , odorless discharge that is normal and suggests ovulation .

These are all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The vagina is very sensitive , and there are a lot of factors that could mess with your discharge .

" <p> Dr. Flo says , " If you have a lot of discharge that is watery , thick , a color other than white , or vaginal itching , its time to visit your health care provider to rule out infection . If the color , smell or change in the normal consistency is not typical and you notice itching , you may have an unwelcome infection . " <p> And do n't  just try to take care of this on your own !

A recent study took a look at uncircumcised guys and also men before and after their own circumcisions and they discovered that there really is a higher risk for STDs for guys with a foreskin . Scientists found that circumcision protects against STDs and STIs because since there is no foreskin on the penis , there is no foreskin for bacteria to hide out and grow and do scary things . In other words , a foreskin can be a home to bacteria that are only going to do more harm than good .

This was almost excusable in the early days of Hollywood , like when Katharine Hepburnone of the most beloved and badass actresses of her timewas cast as a Japanese woman- back in 1944 . Still cringeworthy , but not entirely shocking given the time period .

Until she was recast for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , when she becomes Ron Weasley 's girlfriend . <p> What I do n't understand is that JKR must have always had a solid idea of what Lavender Brown looked like , including race .

What could go wrong ? <h> Pan <p> At a time where festivals are banning Native American headdresses , the Redskins baseball team might be getting rid of their racist name , and Native American actors and actresses stormed off of a set of a racist Adam Sandler movie ... it 's amazingly tone deaf for anyone to decide that Rooney Mara is the best person to play Tiger Lily in the upcoming Peter Pan prequel , Pan .

Their story was even turned into a book called Bringing Down The House . The leader of this squad of smart AF students was played by white actor Jim Sturgees . Co-star ? White actress , Kate Bosworth . Asian characters were basically background characters with minimal development . <p> Want to know why the leads were n't Asian ? According to producers , they could n't find any " bankable Asian-American actors . " The only way to become a bankable actor in any way , shape , or form is to be in movies . If nobody is casting Asian-Americans , how are they surprised that they ca n't find any that are household names ? They 're just perpetuating a vicious cycle . <h> Star Trek : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swirling around the internet when uber white British actor Benedict Cumberbatch was tapped to play Khan Noonien Singh , a villain in the Star Trek universe who is supposed to be of Northern Indian descent . Uh ... you can probably figure out why people were disappointed by this casting decision . <h> West Side Story <p> If you 're a musical nerd , you 've probably already seen and fallen in love with the 1961 film version of West Side Story . What you might not be so in love with is the fact that Natalie Wood 's character is Puerto Rican , but Natalie Wood is n't Latina in the slightest . The rest of her squad is portrayed by largely Latina actresses , but their roles are obviously not starring ones . <h> Breakfast At Tiffany 's <p> It 's one thing for a white dude--Mickey Rooney--to play a Japanese man in a movie ; that 's obviously gross and racist .

But Jake Gyllenhaal is n't Persian , nor is he of any other Middle Eastern ancestry . So the fact that he played a Persian dude in this movie based on the popular video game of the same name is pretty unfortunate . I 'm sure there was an actual Persian actor in Hollywood that would have loved to have this gig instead . <h> Aloha <p> Fact : Mixed race people can look all kinds of different ways . Still , it 's a bit sus , given Hollywood 's history of racism , that Emma Stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make you go hmmmm ... <h> The Lone Ranger <p> Okay , so apparently Johnny Depp claims to be part Native American but ... that still did n't do much to change how ( rightfully ) offended many Native Americans were by his portrayal of Tonto in the Lone Ranger movie . According to Native Appropriations , Native Americans are depicted as backwards , ahistorical , and stereotypical . What 's even more pathetic about this casting decision is that the original Lone Ranger TV series from the ' 50s ' 60s actually casted a Native American man named Jay Silverheels . When that time period has more progressive casting than today ... that 's embarrassing . <h> Warm Bodies <p> The movie Warm Bodies is based on a graphic novel of the same name .

I am developing breasts , so when do you think it will finally come ? Ive been waiting forever and I 'm starting to get worried . <p> I totally understand why youre feeling worried when you see everyone else around you getting something you feel you should have gotten already , its easy to get freaked out about when its going to happen for you . Feeling left out is also understandable , because being the odd one out can be a bummer . <p> However , there honestly is nothing to worry about . There 's nothing wrong with you , and its really not weird that you have n't gotten your first period by 13-years-old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 13 is certainly not the cutoff point . Some girls get their first period as early as age nine , while others wait until they 're 15-years-old to get theirs .

Its not ! You 're developing breasts , like you said , which means you 're starting to go through puberty . That means your period is more than likely on its way , although when it will arrive , I 'm not sure . And hey , did you ever think of this if you 're lying about getting your period to your friends , who 's to say they are n't  doing the same thing ?

For most girls , it happens about two to two-and-a-half years after breast development begins so , like I said , you 're on your way ! Another sign is if you begin to experience discharge , which usually happens about six months before your first period . Lastly , you may notice more body hair , particularly down there , before it happens . But remember : puberty is different for everyone , so take these signs with a grain of salt . <p> In the meantime , enjoy being period-less .

Leave your qs in the comments below ! 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> How Can You Keep Your Pads From Smelling ? <p> Sometimes when we 're on our periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This can happen even when you 're wearing pads , and it can definitely be embarrassing . While it happens to the best of us sometimes , there are certain things you can do to prevent or avoid the situation altogether . <p> Most brands make scented pads , but I do n't recommend using those . The chemicals used to add the scent can upset your pH balance down there , and can lead to infections that will smell even worse or for longer periods of time . So , do n't go for the scented pads . If you feel like you smell down there , make sure you 're showering regularly - hygiene is most important here . Change your pad frequently , and carry around an extra pair of underwear if possible just in case of leaks . Mainly though , do n't stress it . Showering daily should help the problem . <h> How Can You Bring A Pad Into The Bathroom Without Everyone Noticing ? <p> One of the worst things about having your period is having to transport your period products into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go change your pad or tampon . My best piece of advice for hiding your pad is to slip it into a little makeup bag and carrying the makeup bag into the bathroom . It will look like you 're just reapplying some makeup . It 's not as obvious as carrying your entire handbag or bookbag into the bathroom , and it 's easier to work with . <p> Some brands also make super light pads that are smaller and easier to tote around - some are even small enough to fit in a pocket . But if you need something heavier , you 're better off going with the makeup bag trick . <h> Can You Use A Pad Just For Discharge When You Do n't Have Your Period ? <p> A lot of you have asked about using pads to deal with discharge , even when you do n't have your period . At first thought , it seems like pads are your best answer to a lot of discharge - but this is n't necessarily true . <p> If you have a lot of discharge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pantyliner , once in a while . But I do n't advise using a heavy one or just a general pad every single day . Using pads too often will suffocate your vag , messing with your bacteria . This can lead to an infection and more discharge , so it will literally do the opposite of what you want . <h> Are Pads Better With or Without Wings ? <p> There 's no right answer here - it 's honestly totally up to you . Pads with or without wings work great , sometimes for different purposes . I personally have found that pads with wings stay in place better , but I 've also used pads without wings that work just as well . <h> How Can You Make Pads More Comfortable ? <p> Pads are often compared to diapers for a reason - they can be really uncomfortable . The best way to make pads more comfortable are to buy ones that are light and that fit correctly . There are really long pads that might be too big for you , just like there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right size for your body and stick with what works . <p> The other piece of advice is to go for lighter pads . Big , thick pads are obviously going to be more uncomfortable . Sometimes they 're necessary though , so sometimes you just have to deal . Also , make sure you 're changing your pads regularly - when they get too full , they get heavy and uncomfortable . <h> How Do You Know When Your Pad Is Full ? <p> The best way to tell whether or not your pad is full is to look at it . You 'll be able to tell when there 's too much in there . You can also tell by how it feels . Like I said before , when pads are full , they get very heavy . If it feels heavy , that means it 's full . <h> How Do You Make Sure Your Pad Wo n't Leak ? <p> When used correctly , a pad wo n't leak . If it 's placed in your underwear properly and if it 's changed regularly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the best way to make sure no extra blood leaks is to change your pad every few hours and to make sure it 's stuck in place . <p> You should also make sure you 're using the right absorbency . If your period is heavy , you need to use a thicker pad . You may also want to buy longer pads , which cover more of your down there area , and thus give more leak protection . On really heavy days , you can always go for a tampon and a pad for double the protection . <h> How Can You Make An Emergency Pad If You Do n't Have One ? <p> We 've all been there : you realize you 've gotten your period , you have no supplies on you , you 're stuck in a public bathroom with no friends or strangers around , and you 're basically completely out of options . You could either say " eff it , " and deal with leaks , or you can make an emergency pad . Trust me , ladies , go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A health expert on U by Kotex has this tip : " Start unrolling toilet paper , place one end on your underwear right where you would place a pad ( if you had one ) and start wrapping around and around . Then with the loose ends tie a knot on the underside of your underwear . Repeat a second time . This self-made pad should last long enough to get you through until you can stop by a store or go home for a change . " Voila ! Emergency pad until you can get a real one . <h> How Can You Get Rid Of A Pad Without Anyone Noticing ? <p> Say you 're at a boyfriend 's house or a friend 's house , and you REALLY do n't want anyone to know you have your period , but you also have to dispose of your pad . What are you supposed to do ? <p> Unfortunately , there are n't a ton of options here . You absolutely can not flush your pad down the toilet - this could clog the toilet , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the garbage . Just wrap it up in as much toilet paper as possible , until all it resembles is a round ball of paper . Then throw it away ! It 's THAT simple . <h> Do Pads Smell More Than Tampons ? <p> Some people say that pads smell more than tampons because tampons go inside of you and pads are on the outside . This is true in certain situations , but not always . If you 're worried about smell , look at the slide a few before this to find out how to prevent it . <h> Can Everyone See When You 're Wearing A Pad ? <p> I know that a pad can feel like a diaper , and I know that it feels SUPER obvious that you 're wearing one . But trust me : everyone does n't notice . In fact , the majority of people out there wo n't notice . I 'd go so far as to say no one will , unless they see you in your underwear . Unless you 're wearing a super thick pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good . <p> But if you 're REALLY worried about it , pick pads that are lighter and shorter . Again , this is n't always your best option , so if you 're wearing something thicker , just avoid really tight pants . <h> Is It Better To Wear Pads or Tampons ? <p> Again , there 's no right or wrong answer here . It 's totally up to you ! Some girls swear by tampons , while others ca n't imagine living without pads . And some girls are n't into either ! <p> I would say that , in general , tampons are better if you 're active , like if you play a sport or exercise . But I also know plenty of girls who are fine wearing pads to be active , so it really depends . In the end , try them both out , and go with whatever is more comfortable for you . <h> How Can You Stop Your Pad From Sliding Around ? <p> Sometimes pads do this really annoying thing where they move around even when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that : make sure you 're changing your pads every few hours . Adhesive does get less stick after a while . You can pick pads with wings , because those tend to be sturdier . You can also opt for wearing slightly tighter clothing rather than something loose , like a dress . Lastly , wear underwear that fits correctly , not something loose . <h> How Often Should You Change Your Pad ? <p> Pads are n't like tampons - there is no risk of TSS if you keep one in for longer than eight hours . That said , you should still change your pad regularly . If you do n't , it can smell , it can slide around , it can get full and start to leak - it just wo n't be great . I would say change your pad whenever it feels full to you , or whenever it starts to feel uncomfortable . But it 's totally okay to wear these overnight ! <h> Can You Wear A Pad While Swimming ? <p> I strongly advise against wearing a pad if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expand when they get wet , and so it might become REALLY obvious that you 're wearing one . Plus , it 's hard to hide a pad when you 're just wearing a small bathing suit . If you want to swim while you have your period , you should wear a tampon.

There are so many weird little things that can throw off your delicate pH balance , causing infections down there or simply making things smell a little funky . <p> Vaginal odor is certainly not the end of the world , and while it happens to literally everyone with a vay-jay-jay , its still not fun to deal with . Whether you 're stressing over someone getting grossed out when they 're all up in your business or you have a fear that people are going to smell it through your clothing , it can be pretty worrisome .

Here are 8 surprising causes of smells down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swimming Pools <p> Do you ever notice things down there getting a little funky after going for a dip in the pool ? There 's a reason for that : pools can eff with your pH balance . One doctor says that the chlorine used to kill bacteria in a pool ( and make it safe for swimming ) can go into overdrive and start killing the bacteria on you . As you may already know , your vag needs healthy bacteria to function correctly . If the chlorine kills the healthy bacteria , that leaves your down there area open for infection . Chlorine in swimming pools can cause itchiness , odor , yeast infections , bacterial vaginosis , and vaginitis . <h> Sleeping In Your Underwear <p> Think of your vag as an open wound : it needs to breathe to be healthy .

Maybe you 're into Brazilian waxes , which get rid of literally all the hair down there from your vag AND your butt . Brazilians are great for being silky smooth , but they may not be SO great for your girlhood . Pubes serve more of a purpose than you think - they protect your vagina by trapping harmful bacteria . Without pubes , there 's no barrier there , so bacteria can get in and infect you faster and easier . This could cause infections or just weird smells . <h> Scented Pads or Tampons <p> You might think that a scented tampon is perfectly healthy because it is literally an item that is made to be in your vagina . But you would be wrong . Putting any kind of perfumed scent down there is risky - the area is just too sensitive . Putting something scented literally INSIDE of you ? Definitely not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still make these . <h> Sugary Foods <p> Some women mistakenly believe that sweet , sugary food will make your down there area taste sweeter . Nope . Eating too much sugary food can actually have the opposite effect . It can cause yeast and bacterial infections , which lead to odor - or odor on it 's own . This definitely does n't mean you have to cut out sugar completely , but be mindful of how much you 're eating ! <h> Red Meat <p> Not only does red meat sometimes throw off your pH levels ( which can lead to odor , itchiness , and infections ) , but it can also just generally make you smell bad . Within two hours of eating red meat , you might notice that you smell bad ( down there and in general ) because red meat makes you sweat more AND makes your sweat smellier . It might be something you want to avoid if you have a big romantic night planned ! <h> Tight Clothing <p> Like I said before : your vag needs room to breathe ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing clothes that are super tight ? ! Sure , your skintight leather leggings look amazing , but they could also be contributing to smelly vaginal odor . It 's fine to wear these things once in a while , but do it too often , and you 'll definitely notice a difference . It gets sweaty down there ! Also , tight clothing or underwear becomes a moist breeding ground for bacteria . Yum ! <h> Foods With Strong Odors <p> You already know that certain foods can make you smell differently down there - we pointed out red meat and sugar specifically . But other foods that have strong odors can also be contributing to a smelly vag . Some examples : asparagus , garlic , curry , coffee , and dairy .

He was in the Army , and we had a thing for a few months while he was away doing whatever dudes in the Army do while on base in Virginia . After that relationship crashed and burned ( badly ) , I started talking to a lovely woman I met online . She was great , but the distance was weird , and we never actually met . I think we would both agree that the distance made getting to know each other and working out minor conflicts super difficult . So that was the end of that . Needless to say , I put LDRs to rest for a little while after they failed me twice . <p> But , the third time was a bit of a charm , IMHO . I met my now girlfriend of three-and-a-half years while at college my sophomore year . As luck would have it , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was beautiful and amazing . And I was lovestruck . So we gave it a go , despite the impending LDR situation . <p> For chunks out of each year , we went long distance out of necessity . School breaks will do that to you . But it ( somehow ) worked ! Now , we happily live together in NYC and do n't  have to deal with skyrocketing phone bills and horrible Internet connections to keep our relationship alive . <p> So when I say I know , believe me I do . LDRs are a whole lot of work . And they come with a whole set of unique problems . But they can definitely be worth the trouble ! As an ode to my LDR past ( and your possible LDR present ) , I wanted to answer all of your burning questions about the long distance thing .

But that does n't  mean that you have to sit there and let yourself get treated badly by every different kind of person ever . There 's a really big difference between being a genuine person and being a pushover. - <p> I 've recently learned that I can stop being nice to the people who do n't  really treat me great , and its been such a freeing realization . I 'm a nice person in general , so I usually go out of my way to treat people with respect , even if they do n't  deserve it . But you know what ? Its a waste of my time .

If a " friend " is always making fun of you or making you feel bad , they are not a friend . And they do not deserve your kindness . <p> 2 . The ex you do n't  like at all. - <p> I know you want to be the bigger person by being nice and friendly to your ex , but you really do n't  have to be .

The friend who never asks how you are. - <p> You know that friend who seems to only hang out with you to complain about their problems or brag about the great stuff ? And they never , ever say , " So how are you ? " or seem to care when you tell them about yourself ? Yeah . Theyre selfish and do n't  deserve your time . <p> 6 . The friend who always gets jealous instead of congratulating you. - <p> I have a friend who is never happy for me when good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just gets jealous and weird . Its not cool . Friends are supposed to support each other through bad AND good . I 've stopped really being friends with her because it bugs me . If you 're that self-absorbed , I do n't  have time for it . <p> 7 .

Your friends boyfriend who is not nice to you. - <p> If you do n't  like your friends BF , but he s nice to you , you should fake nice for your friend . But if he s mean to you ? Different story . You 're not obligated to be nice to a rude person just because he s with your friend . <p> 11 .

But if they ALWAYS make plans and NEVER follow through on them , then bye . Why deal with that ? They obviously do n't  respect your time . <p> 13 . The hookup who treated you like crap. - <p> Ive been nice to hookups who have treated me terribly because I do n't  want to come off as " crazy " and I want to look more mature . But you know what ? No . Do n't  be nice to a guy who broke your heart for fun if he does n't  deserve it . <p> 14 . Your brother or sister , if they 're really mean to you. - <p> Again : family is important , but do n't  let siblings take advantage of you all the time . You 're a person ! <p> 15 .

If it does n't  make you uncomfortable to show affection , then who am I to dictate your life ? Love is a nice thing ! <p> That said , there are lines where the amount that people are uncomfortable outweighs the happiness you cause , and in many instances , it is worth being aware of that . I 'm talking that when you 're just trying to watch a TV show , and your sister and her boyfriend are basically making out on top of each other on the couch . You both share this space , but you feel like you are intruding on a private moment . Not fair ! <p> So what can you do if people are PDA-ing right up in your face ?

Let 's take a look . <p> If you freak out at the PDA couple , it could seem like you 're overreacting ( even if your points are valid ) and they may be less likely to be taken seriously . Go in with a cool head . You do n't  want to ban your friends from ever being around you . That 's a little over the top . You just need to come up with a solution , and that means you have to <p> Guess what ? If you do n't  say anything , they are never going to know you feel uncomfortable . Yeah , maybe they should get that making out all over your couch while you are third wheeling makes you feel weird , but sometimes love makes people act silly .

Then you 're both kind of on even " offending " footing and you lose your ability to act like the annoyed party . <p> Instead of just conveying how disgusted you are , have a real person-to-person conversation . Say that you are being made to feel like you are a burden , which is n't fair because its not like you 're intruding on anything behind closed doors . People may not even realize their PDA is making you uncomfortable , so being honest ( but mature ) is important when it comes with how to deal . <p> The things about PDA that bother you may not even just be the actual physical stuff .

Figure out what kind of affection does n't  make you uncomfortable its not like you 're someone who wants to live in a world where everyone suppresses love ! Sometimes little bits of PDA ( like Andrew and Emma ! ) can be cute . Its okay though if you feel like watching their tongues smash each other is not cute . Figure out where your lines are so that you and the couple can hopefully reach an understanding . <p> It takes two to tango ( and to PDA ) , so if your friend is making out right in front of you , do n't  skip over her and start getting mad only at her lip-locking partner . Actually , considering you know your friend better , she is probably the one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow trying to devise a plan to keep this other person away in order to keep the PDA at bay . <p> If their PDA makes you uncomfortable , it is unwise to now try and increase your PDA with a partner in an attempt to make them feel more uncomfortable . This escalating PDA war will not end well . The method to addressing PDA is to not introduce more PDA . <p> Okay , its not like they own the space , but sometimes it is just better to remove yourself from the situation . Rather than keep getting mad , take a little bit of a breather to get away from the PDA . I know this is n't the fun answer , but sometimes its the only one that is going to work in the moment . Who knows maybe its just a one-time thing or a phase and soon your shared space will be back to being PDA-free . <p> How do you feel when other couples show PDA in front of you ?

But it actually might just be making things worse . Wearing pantyliners all the time may cause yeast infections . According to one doctor , " pantyliners cause a low-grade irritation that can decrease the skin 's immunity . When our defenses go down , we get more symptomatic .

Wearing a pair of synthetic , lacy , fun underwear is n't going to automatically give you an infection , but it will definitely contribute to giving you one . Try to find cotton underwear , since they breathe and give you more air down there . Remember , yeast likes to grow in environments where there is little air . <h> The Wrong Laundry Detergent <p> If you remember what I said about scented soaps being bad for your vaginal area , then this one makes sense .

It 's hard to avoid sugar , but doctors say it 's the worst in the morning , so try to avoid too much sugar in the AM . <h> Certain Antibiotics <p> If your doctor gives you an antibiotic because you 're sick , make sure you start eating a lot of yogurt - antibiotics can cause yeast infections pretty quickly , and some are worse than others . Antibiotics make the vaginal environment less acidic , which encourages yeast overgrowth . To combat this , you can eat yogurt , which has natural ingredients that can balance things out .

In response to the burgeoning recognition of the pre-teen girl demographic , magazine publishers catered to these girls with magazines like GL and Discovery Girls .

Not exactly . Honestly , the answer is a lot more simple than that : The Internet . With teens getting their pop culture and lifestyle tips on all sorts of different websites , it 's been difficult for the print magazine industry to remain relevant . It 's also worth noting that most of the teen magazines that are still thriving in print--like Seventeen and Teen Vogue--have a solid online presence .

She was one of the most important people in my life , and I had no idea how to handle her death . <p> I was exposed to death pretty early in my life , but Macys death was the first time I lost someone so close and so young .

I made my mom buy them for me at the store , I hid them in the depths of my handbags so that no one would see them , and I kept all of my questions to myself , leaving me confused and panicked most of the time . <p> So , I get it . We all have at least one tampon question that were embarrassed to ask someone else , and its a good idea to turn to the Internet rather than to constantly stress about it . If you have a question you think is totally weird , rest assured : its not , and someone else has already asked it and I 'm here to help . Here are the answers to 12 of your most embarrassing questions about tampons , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do You Have To Change Your Tampon Every Time You Poop ? <p> While a tampon obviously does n't go into the same hole that poop or urine comes out of , it 's still very close to that whole area , so leaving one in while doing your business can seem a little tricky . What if the string gets in the way of things ? Will it create some sort of infection ? Or is it just gross to not change your tampon after going to the bathroom ? Is it fine to do it if you pee , but not if you poop ? These are very important questions that have run through our minds at least once . Well , Buzzfeed has answers . They asked two doctors if you have to change your tampon every time you do number two , and the answer was : it 's up to you . One doctor says that if fecal matter or urine gets on the string you should change it , but if you do n't , it 's not the biggest deal in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You Use A Tampon For Discharge ? <p> If you deal with a lot of discharge on a daily basis , even when you 're not on your period , you might be wondering if you can use a tampon to take care of it . It seems like a good option : the tampon would make sure the discharge does n't get on your underwear , and keep things neat . However , you should n't do this . Even if it may seem like there 's a lot going on down there , there most likely is not enough liquid to make using a tampon a comfortable or pleasant option . You also may end up leaving the tampon in for too long , which puts you at risk for infection . <p> So the answer is : no . Do n't do this . If you have a lot of discharge and it 's making you uncomfortable , use panty liners . They 're super light and comfortable , and they 'll take care of things better than a tampon would . <h> Can Tampons Stretch Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about something , anything , stretching out their vay-jay-jay . Stop worrying . There is no scientific evidence that says that a tampon will stretch out your vagina , where you 're using regular size or super large . Your vagina is meant to stretch out when it has to , and then to go back down to size when it can . That 's how it works ! <h> Is It Normal To Have A Hard Time Using A Tampon At First ? <p> A lot of you girls write in saying that you 've never used a tampon , and you ca n't use one : it 's too hard to get in , it wo n't work , you 're too tight . A lot of these emails are laced with obvious panic , and the question , " Am I weird ? " The answer : no , you 're not weird . It 's completely normal to have trouble using a tampon the first time , and it 's something many girls struggle with . If you 're freaking out , relax .

This is not okay . When used correctly , a tampon should not feel uncomfortable or painful . In fact , you should n't feel it at all . If your tampon hurts , it 's not in right or it 's not the right size . When you use a tampon , make sure to really put it in as much as you can before releasing it . If it 's too " low , " it will feel like it might fall out . If your tampon is painful , you might be using one that is too large - try a smaller size . <p> Source : ShutterStock <h> Is Leakage Normal ? <p> Although not AS common as some other issues , complaining about leakage even when using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls deal with . Some girls say that even when they change their tampon very often , they still leak out . Some other girls say that even if the tampon is dry , it leaks out . <p> Here 's the deal : if your tampon gets full very quickly and is leaking out , that probably means you have a heavy flow , and you may need to try larger or more absorbent tampons . Go for the Super tampons over the Regular ones . If you 're leaking blood even if the tampon is fairly dry , try using a different brand and kind of tampon . You can also try using panty liners as well as the tampon . Or , you might want to try something different altogether , like a menstrual cup or pads . <p> Source ; ShutterStock <h> Can A Tampon Get Lost Inside Of You ? <p> The good news : a tampon can not get lost inside of you . Your down there area is n't a bottomless pit that will suck your tampon into your body and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't find the string .

This might not be the most pleasant thing you 'll ever do , but you WILL find it and be able to pull it out . If you leave it in there , you 're putting yourself at risk for an infection , so please do n't consider that option . <h> Does Using A Tampon Mean You 're Not A Virgin ? <p> When I was younger , I used to hear girls say things like , " Oh , she uses a tampon ? That means she 's not a virgin . " It was this silly myth that only girls who had had sex could use tampons , because they had already had something in there . That 's absurd . Using tampons does not mean you 're not a virgin . A tampon and a penis are not the same thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tampon break your hymen , and if so , what does that mean ? A tampon will more than likely not break your hymen , unless you really shove it in there hard . And if it does , it does n't mean anything except that it broke your hymen . Breaking your hymen is not a big deal , I promise . <h> Can You Wear A Tampon Overnight ? <p> You may have heard at some point that you should n't wear tampons overnight because you 're putting yourself at risk for TSS . Do n't worry ; unless you 're sleeping for 10-15 hours , you should be okay . Tampons can be used for up to 8 hours , and since this is an average night 's sleep ( more than average for a lot of people , unfortunately ) , it 's fine to use a tampon while you 're sleeping . If you think you 're going to sleep significantly longer than 8 hours , do n't use a tampon . The one other thing I would say is that if you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tampon while sleeping - or you might want to use a backup pad . Overnight , you may leak on your underwear , through your PJ pants , and onto your sheets . Not fun . <h> Is It Possible To Put A Tampon In The Wrong Hole ? <p> In case you did n't realize , you have three holes down there : the urethra ( where you pee out of ) , the anus , and your vagina ( where the tampon goes ) . Putting your tampon into the wrong hole is not impossible , but it is highly unlikely and not something you should stress about . Your urethra is a very small hole , and your chances of fitting a tampon in there are slim to none . I also doubt you 're going to be sticking something into your anus thinking it 's your vagina .

This is totally up to you . A lot of girls swear by plastic applicators , a lot of girls like cardboard because they 're better for the environment . Personally , I think plastic applicators are a lot more comfortable to use .

I think the US size is 32AA ( I 'm not from there ) and I do n't  fill it out . Its the smallest one I can find . I use push-up , but only because its more comfortable ( there is really nothing to push ) . I started wearing bras when I was 12 , right before I turned 13 , and I still have the same ones , and I still do n't  fill them out . I do n't  want to wear just a soft " top " or a sport bra though , they 're extremely uncomfortable ( I wear push-up for a reason ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is n't even that they 're small ; they 're also still the shape of breast that just started to grow , you know when they 're all soft , pointy , kinda " pyramid " -shaped with soft , bright nipples .

Maybe scour the internet too and search for bras especially for the smaller chest size , they are widely available and you 'll get a better variety with colour , pattern and style <p> sara <p> Dude do some exercise .. u will get a bigger chest in like 2 weeks .. search for nowloss and u will find a lot of good exercise Im 36DD GD LUCKK G <p> Laura <p> I have been fitted for a bra when I was about 16 years old .

But I do notice a difference at different shops <p> Julie <p> Yeah a lot of times each store carries a different brand of bras so the sizing is different . My best advice is to either stick with the same brand or to try and get sized at each store . That has happened to me before and at first I was also confused . <p> Ren <p> I think that 's so stupid ! You should be able to get the exact same size everywhere ! <p> CrazyRedneckKid <p> i have never been fitted so i 'm not really sure what size i amany way i can do that without goin into some place where they fit them ? <p> Julie <p> Yeah if you search how to size my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need a measuring tape . Good luck ! <p> here 's a really common cause of bra bands feeling too tight : the cup is too small , sits on top of your boobs rather than on your ribcage , and that makes the whole bra feel tighter . Everyone , before you get bigger bands , make sure the cup really is the right size you might even need to go down in the band !

And with the hundreds and thousands of options that are out there , it can be really difficult to figure out what you should be buying and exactly how much money you should be shelling out . <p> High-end makeup stores like Sephora or department stores like Bloomingdales can make it seem like spending a lot of money on makeup is essential . Advertisements can cause us to re-think our $5 eyeliner for the $35 option does the extra money really mean its better ?

Please never spend this much on mascara ; it 's not worth it . First of all , you use mascara way too often to spend so much money on it - for the amount of times it gets replaced , it 's crazy to go really expensive ! Second , when it comes to mascara , what really matters is the wand . Some people swear by using one wand with any kind of mascara out there . Either way , you do n't need to spend a lot . Maybelline 's Great Lash mascara has is a cult favorite that constantly wins beauty awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great . <h> Liquid Eyeliner <p> Liquid eyeliner is another one of those items that , if you use it a lot , runs out pretty quickly . Therefore , it 's silly to spend a lot of money on it . Plus , I 've personally tested out expensive liquid eyeliners that really do n't work that great and I was left feeling very sad about my money situation . Revlon makes this excellent liquid eyeliner that is super easy to use and lasts for a very long time . <h> Lipstick <p> There are thousands of lipstick options out there , and choosing the right one for you is overwhelming . The good news is that you do n't have to spend $50 on designer lipstick to get to the good stuff . In fact , I 've heard of a lot of people who spend a lot on lipstick and really regret it . I mean , you definitely can - I swear by Urban Decay 's lipstick , which is about $30 - but you do n't have to . Revlon makes this Super Lustrous lipstick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear people raving about it all the time . And it 's under $10 ! <h> Concealer Stick <p> In my other post on makeup to splurge on , I wrote that concealer is worth the extra money . And it definitely can be , especially if you have sensitive skin , or you have difficulty finding the correct shade for you . But I recently discovered this L'Oreal concealer stick , and I knew I had to write about it . This little concealer stick is seriously incredible . It 's creamy , it does n't dry out your skin , there are so many different color options , and it 's easy to use and carry around . Plus , it really covers up blemishes and imperfections . I do n't know where I would be without it . <h> Pencil Eyeliner <p> If you wear pencil eyeliner every day , than you know how quickly it runs out . Eyeliner needs to be replaced so much that it 's silly to spend a lot of money on it . Plus , most drugstore brands work just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rimmel makes a particularly great option that is less than $5 . You ca n't beat that ! <h> Lip Balm <p> There are some lip balms out there that cost more than $20 , and while they do work great , you absolutely do n't have to spend that much to make your lips feel softer and less chapped . I swear by Maybelline 's BabyLips . These little guys are AMAZING . They are the best . <h> Eyebrow Products <p> There are plenty of expensive eyebrow products out there that work great . And if you 're looking to do some serious work on your brows and to really transform them , I do suggest spending a little more . But if your brows are more low-maintenance and you do n't need to do a lot to them , then save your money . Cheap eyeshadow in the correct shade for your coloring can be used as brow powder . Our editor Caitlin sometimes just uses a clean mascara wand and a little hairspray to keep her brows in place . <h> Highlighter <p> Unless you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlighter often enough to justify spending a lot of money on it .

It gives you a subtle glow without being overwhelming . And it 's less than $10 ! <h> Nail Polish <p> There are a lot of designer nail polishes out there that cost more than $30 . That 's crazy ! Yes , the bottle is cool , but do you really need to spend all that money on a bottle of nail polish ? No . You 're basically just paying for the name . While I would n't suggest spending $2 on nail polish ( the really cheap stuff , like under $5 , tends to chip fast and not have great color ) , I would say you do n't need to spend more than $7-$12 . Essie , Sally Hansen , and O.P.I. all make excellent nail polish , and none of is more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant shades that last a long time . <h> Makeup Brushes <p> There was once a time when spending a lot of money on makeup brushes was totally necessary . Great quality makeup brushes were once only available if you were willing to spend over $20 on them - and we all know that good quality makeup brushes are totally worth it . But then Sonia Kashuk for Target came along , and with it , makeup brushes that were affordable and work just as great as the pricey options . I love Sonia Kashuk brushes . Not only are they nice to look at , they also work so well . This little pack is less than $25 ! That 's less than the price of one brush from Sephora.

Unless you have some super sneaky way of listening in on all of our serious conversations and arguments , or you can read our minds , then you have no idea what is actually going on in my relationship . Ever heard the saying do n't  judge a book by its cover ? Well , do n't  judge my boyfriend ( or relationship ) unless you really know every side to every story . Sure , I might complain to my friends about when me and my BF fight , but its normal for a girl to rant more about that than to gush about when her guy is being wonderful . Even I admit that my versions of the story can be a little one-sided when Im annoyed . This especially applies to people I barely know or tell anything to : stop judging ! <p> I 'm HAPPY ! Is n't that all that matters ? ! <p> 2 . You want me to be happy , right ? If my boyfriend makes me happy ( and he does ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change that ? Just because you might not like him does n't  mean he s not a good guy . Listen , if I was calling up my BFF crying every day telling her how miserable my boyfriend makes me , then I would definitely expect her to tell me to snap out of it and dump him . But if Im happy with the way things are , that 's all that matters when it comes down to it , its my life and not yours . No matter how bad it looks on paper ( tell people you 're re-dating your ex even if theyve never met him in their lives , they will cringe and act like you 're stupid ) , it could be something that is actually really making me smile . And if you 're my real friend , you 'll just be happy that I 'm happy . <p> 3 . You have better things to do with your life . Seriously , you do . Trust me . Worry about your own boyfriend/crush/lack of a love life instead of mine . That might sound a little harsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time focusing on what other people are doing . Its just not healthy . <p> Is it really worth fighting over ? <p> 4 . Its probably hurting our friendship . If every time I bring up my boyfriends name to you is followed by a not-so-subtle eye-roll , I 'm going to stop talking to you about him . And if I 'm going to stop talking to you about one of the biggest things in my life , then I 'm probably going to stop feeling as close to you as I was before . Its not that I 'm choosing my boyfriend over you , but I do n't  want a friend who is going to criticize all of my relationship choices . In fact , I can guarantee you that no one wants a friend that does that . <p> 5 . Nobodys relationship is perfect . I 'm almost positive that you have gotten flack for dating people before . And if you have n't yet , you will at some point . So do n't  be a hypocrite ! Your friends might have hated your last BF , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every couple fights , and every couple has problems . Me and my boyfriends issues might seem totally weird to you , but its something we need to work out on our own without your input . <p> Like I said before , there are certain times that you do need to butt into your friends relationship if you have proof that her guy is treating her really badly , abusing her in some way , or cheating on her , then you should absolutely speak up . But if you just do n't  agree with her relationship choice , or you just do n't  like her boyfriend , than there 's no need for you to get involved . <p> So please , for the sake of our friendship , stop butting into my relationship . <p> I guess its because I 'm just now hitting the age when boyfriends become a big part of every day life and I guess I 'm also an overprotective friend , but what I 'm reading here is that I cant have an opinion on my friends boyfriend ? Now I do n't  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date the guy as much as she wants , but this post basically says I should sacrifice my happiness for hers , which I 'll do to a certain extent , but yes , if I do n't  like her boyfriend I wont want to hear about him and yes I 'd say we 've grown apart because I ca n't be around her boyfriend and they 're always together and if your relationship is going to be such a big part of your life ( which it should be if its a serious relationship ) then you shouldnt be surprised when the other people in your life have opinions on it . It affects them too . Am I supposed to just continue lying through my teeth to assure my friend that I like her boyfriend ? Because that does n't  sound like a good friend to me . But then again , I guess my tactic of just avoiding that huge chunk of her life altogether probably is n't the best solution either . But I honestly do n't  know what else to do . Sorry , this comment turned into more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently told me that he &amp; some of my friends do n't  like my boyfriend &amp; are distancing themselves from me because of it . I think its childish &amp; very un friend like to do . Also he was berating me with negative comments &amp; opinions that I obviously do n't  care to hear <p> Adriana <p> I am sixteen years old and my boyfriend is seventeen , turning eighteen on decenmber 22 . I have a very different relationship compared to others considering the fact that Ive known him for nine months but I have never had the chance to actually meet him . I did meet him on a stupid online chat place when I was with my friend but when we first saw each other it was just crazy the way we just looked at each other . Once I saw his smile I suddenly just wanted to talk to him and I wanted to know evreything about him .. so relating to the topic lol I had given him my email and that night he had sent me a messege . We talked back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 months I had given him my number . We talked more .. I soon had broken my phone and I had no way of contacting him . So I started to use my Step dads phone at night and I would use my moms laptop to skype with him . My mom noticed one day that I could n't stop smiling and she had asked me why ? I wanted to tell her the truth so I told her that I was talking to a guy that lives thousands of miles away in Virginia = well she did n't  take it so good lol and she started to ask me all these damn STUPID questions and just telling me that I do n't  know him and that he could me a old man ? ? ? lol even though he s clearly not because I have skyped with him . She told me that I could n't talk to him anymore . So for her to just get off my butt I told her that I stopped . Until one morning I had put my step dads phone back before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone record but my boyfriend had text me back even though I told him not to ! ! -- well I guess my step dad texted him and said to leave me alone and that if he finds out that were still talking then he s going to punch in the eye lol So till this day I am still talking to my baby but Its been a BIG secret I have a secret phone that I 've been texting him with : p and I 'm still skyping with him . I really wish they could just understand . Soon they are just going to have to deal with it because I 'm planing on telling them . I do n't  want to hide it anymore . I am the happiest I have ever been &lt;33333 I really wish I had the money to suprise him for his birthday ! ! OMG ! ! That would be amazing ! I ca n't wait to send him his present though = no one should be involved in your relationship basically if your happy then your happy and no one should tell you other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell my parants In a few weeks <p> Mallows <p> My bf and I have been dating awhile behind closed doors my mum does n't  like him she think his a no good loser but he a hard worker who faild and is tryin but she do n't  care she does n't  want me with him and I love him what can I do <p> Julie <p> my boyfriend is a year younger than me and i feel happier around him than my douchebag ex who was older than me haha <p> strawberrykitty <p> AMEN , sista ! <p> I wish my parents werent so cripplingly " old-fashioned " and they could just COOL IT ! They spy on me all the time , they demand my Facebook password or otherwise deny me of internet access , all so they can make sure that he is always on my blocklist . They truly hate him so much that they forced me to block him and under no circumstances is he to be removed from my blocklist . WTF ? ! ? And it all started in the December of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy secret that he had eaten me out , and she stopped at nothing to break us up . I am seventeen , going on eighteen . Not five . I 'm a virgin and I 'm proud of it , but a restraining order ? Wha .. ? ! ? I love this guy so much , he asked me to marry him and I said yes . He has schizophrenia but that does n't  make him a bad person at all . Actually , he can be one of the sweetest people you will ever meet . I LOVE HIM . We took a little break when he visited his mom for a few months out of state , but when he came back home everything was great . Last summer we started talking again and set up a date to see each other . The night before that day , we stayed up all night together on Skype until 3 a.m. and I never expected my mom to manifest from the shadows of my room and .. yeah . It was n't pretty , and I ended up crying myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that we would never hear from each other again . She involved the police , she got all of his information ( phone number , etc. ) and even drove down to the local plaza that the teens in my city hang out together and found him .. I can only imagine what happened there , but she probably did n't  do any justice to my reputation . I even found a note to him in her car telling him to " Let me go " because he would ruin my senior year and all of this total insanity . I was furious when I read that I was supposedly hell-bent on getting married and blah blah blah . WOW , Mom . I love you , but your stalkerish tendencies do n't  help my fame . I 'm turning 18 and I WILL be with him because I love him .. I just wish things could be normal ! ! <p> strawberrykitty <p> After that one night he and I both agreed not to communicate AT ALLLL until my 18th birthday ( July 31 ) . I cant wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few select Facebook friends who need to see this ! ! ! URGHHH ! ! ! ! : /

I personally like mineral powder foundation I specifically use Bare Escentuals BareMinerals Power Foundation , and I love it .

And we know that things like cigarette smoke , salty foods , and the wrong makeup product can make things really tough for our face . <p> But there are so many more things that are good for your skin that you 're probably not even paying attention to ! I mean , yes , you have to follow the basic commandments above , but there are other things you need to keep in mind as well that are n't  so obvious .

Sex can boost your immune system , which helps minimize inflammation , and over time that can help with signs of aging . The hormones sex releases in your body help fight breakouts and also hydrate your skin . Oh , and do n't forget about that wonderful rosy glow it will give you . <h> Vodka <p> Who would have ever thought that vodka could do anything to help your skin ? But it can ! If you mix one part vodka with three parts water , it can be great as a pore minimizer . It works as a toner , and an antiseptic for wounds . <h> Sweat <p> A lot of people assume that sweat is terrible for your skin because they think it causes breakouts . This can be true , if you wear tight-fitting sweaty clothes for a long period of time without washing . But a little sweat wo n't hurt you - in fact , it can even be beneficial . Sweat can open up your pores and release dirty , and basically forces your skin to work properly . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you break out . Good news : that is just a myth . Dark chocolate can moisturize your skin and increase blood flow , which can make your skin more resistant to sun damage .

But yogurt makes for a great DIY face mask ingredient because it moisturizes and reduces the appearance of pores . <h> Cold Shower <p> A cold shower may not be the most pleasant thing in the world , but it 's better for your skin than a very hot shower . But do n't worry , you do n't have to be standing under freezing cold water for 20 minutes in order for this to work . Take your usual hot shower , but a minute or two before you get out , switch the water to cold and finish off with a chilly rinse .

The right kind of oil is actually so great for your skin , even if it feels very uncomfortable and slick . The right oils will break down and dissolve dirt , leaving skin moisturized and soft . <h> Mint <p> Fresh mint offers a great source of sallicylic acid , which can be found in so many over-the-counter acne medications .

@@45901489 @5901489/ <p> I still remember the first time I discovered flat irons . I was 13-years-old , and I was just getting into that feeling of wanting to do something different with my hair . My mom bought me a flat iron , and I spent the next several years of my life straightening my naturally wavy hair into oblivion . I was obsessed . I straightened my hair every day , sometimes more than once . If I saw one kink , it made me crazy . I bought straightening products , and even went so far as to get a Brazilian straightening treatment done . I loved straight hair . <p> Then sometime around my college years , straight hair stopped being so popular , and natural waves became the " it " hairstyle . Suddenly , embracing my natural texture was cool ! As I stopped depending on my flat iron so much , I realized just how damage I had been doing to my hair . It was dry , frizzy , and totally fried . <p> For the last few years , I 've almost stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron , and if I do , its just to touch something up . I 'm actually a little afraid of it , because I work really hard on having healthy hair , and I do n't  want a little flat iron to ruin that . <p> The moral of the story is this : flat irons really can mess up your hair , especially if you 're not using it correctly . Making these mistakes could mean the difference between smooth , silky locks , and fried ones . You can use a flat iron without ruining your hair you just need to learn how to do it . Here are 12 flat iron mistakes you never realized you were making when straightening your hair : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Pulling It Down <p> The issue with overly-straightened hair is that it often falls flat ... and not in a good way . Even the straightest and silkiest of locks look better with a little bit of volume . If you pull your hair and straightener down when you 're straightening , it leaves your hair flat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives you a boost of volume . <h> Not Cleaning It <p> How many times have you thought about cleaning your flat iron ? I would bet not that many . With all of the product in your hair , from conditioner to heat protectant spray to hairspray , it leaves a build-up on the flat iron . After a while , this build-up coats the flat iron , making it snag and pull on your hair . Ouch ! You can buy cleaner specifically made for your flat iron , but really you can just use warm water and some rubbing alcohol . <h> Not Sectioning Your Hair <p> How many times have you grabbed your flat iron , then grabbed random pieces of your hair to straighten until it all looked good ? I would bet a lot . Sectioning your hair is important - not only will it keep your hair healthier , but it will also leave it looking better . When you section hair , you 're guaranteeing that you wo n't be straightening sections that are too thick . You 'll also reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . You should really try not to go over any piece of hair more than once . <h> Using The Wrong Shampoo and Conditioner <p> There is no miracle shampoo or conditioner out there that will make your curly hair magically straight . But there is shampoo and conditioner specifically for smooth , straight strands . If you want straight hair , do n't buy a random shampoo - buy a smoothing option , like this Tresemme Keratin treatment . It will make a difference in your result . <h> Not Letting Your Hair Cool <p> If you 're planning on doing something with your new straightened hair , like pulling it back , make sure you let it set first . Cool air sets straight hair , so let it relax for a few minutes on it 's own before you pull it back . <h> Using A Giant Iron <p> You might think that a large flat iron is better because it will straighten more hair at once ... but you 're actually better off with a flat iron that is no wider than 1 inch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as close to your roots , leaving them looking out of place . <h> Making The Setting Too High <p> Ask most girls who straighten their hair , and they 'll tell you that they crank the setting up to the highest heat possible . Hey , even I 'm guilty . It 's tempting to make the setting that high , because it works faster . But you should n't . Even professional stylists say it 's not necessary and should n't be an option . <h> Making The Setting Too Low <p> At the same time , making the setting too low is also bad . If you put your setting down to the lowest possible , assuming that it will damage your hair less , you may end up damaging it even more . Because it 's so low , you 'll probably end up straightening one piece many times to get it where you want it . Your best bet is to go medium to medium-high , and work slowly . <h> Not Brushing It Enough First <p> Once you section out your hair , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each section of hair before using the flat iron on it . This will get rid of kinks and knots , making straightening that much easier and reducing the amount of times you 'll have to go over it . <h> Letting It Steam or Sizzle <p> If you ever hear your hair under your flat iron sizzle or see steam rising from it , stop immediately . This is terrible for your hair ! It also means that your hair is n't dry enough yet . I know a girl who used to flat iron her wet hair all the time . It 's a horrible thing to do to your strands . Make sure your hair is completely dry before you flat iron it . <h> Not Using A Heat Protectant <p> A lot of people neglect heat protectant products , assuming that it 's just a marketing scheme to make money and that they 're fine without it . That 's not true ! A heat protectant does exactly what it sounds like - it protects your hair from harsh heat . It will also make your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going <p> Sometimes when we 're in a rush , we might start only straightening little parts of pieces of hair that look wavy . Do n't do this .

According to Kim Kardashian ( and a lot of other hair stylists and celebrities out there ) , its going a few days without washing it . By now , this news is n't very new . Weve been hearing for months about the " No Poo " movement , and weve all heard the advice to cut down on the amount of times we wash our hair . <p> But has anyone actually done it ? <p> I have , and I have to tell you guys , it really does work . Washing your hair every day , or even more than two times a week , is not the best way to get good hair . Not washing it is ! Since I started washing my hair only twice a week ( maybe three times if I did something extra ) , my hair has been shinier , healthier , less frizzy , and has even grown faster . Its amazing ! <p> I tell a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " Ugh , I cant go that long without washing my hair . " Some people confuse washing their hair with showering ( which , by the way , you do n't  need to do every day either ) . Some people think that not washing your hair makes it dirty or gross .

Here are 10 reasons you should n't wash your hair every day : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> It Will Make Your Mornings Easier <p> Showering in the morning adds so much time onto your getting ready routine - not only do you have to add in time for the actual shower , you need more time to dry your hair . If you 're not washing your hair , that cuts out a big chunk of time . Dirty hair is so easy to style that you can just put it up , or spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and go . Who does n't want easier mornings that let them sleep later ? <h> Dirty Hair Is Best For Braids <p> Braids are the best , but they 're almost impossible to pull off when your hair is fresh and clean . Clean hair that has just been washed is super soft and does n't hold very well - the opposite of what you need for a good braid . When your hair is dirty , your braid will look amazing . It will stay in place while allowing you to pull on it , making it look thicker and more awesome . <h> It Will Save You Time and Energy <p> Not only will not washing your hair save you time , it also saves you energy . You wont have to sit there , holding a hair dryer to your head waiting for your hair to dry . You wo n't have to worry about it drying weirdly . It 's just a big time-saver . <h> Natural Texture Is The Prettiest <p> Embracing your natural texture is the best thing you can do for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to death every single day , you 're literally killing your hair . And if you have straight hair you 're constantly curling , you 're also killing it . I 'm not saying you ca n't heat style your hair anymore , but embracing your natural texture is so good for your hair . And when it 's dirty , that natural texture is more likely to shine through . When I 've gone two or three days without washing my hair , it develops this perfect wave/curl thing that I ca n't achieve with a hot tool . <h> It Keeps Hair Healthier <p> Washing your hair too often is bad for your hair , and this is a fact . Too much shampoo will strip your hair of it 's natural oils , leaving it frizzier and more dry . Not washing it let 's the natural oils do their thing , leaving your hair shinier and healthier . You 're also probably less likely to use a hair dryer on your hair , and cutting down on heat is always good for your hair . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , you 're probably always searching for ways to make your color last as long as possible . You should know that washing it too often is one of the worst things you can do . Every time you wash your hair , even with a color-safe option , you 're dulling your hair . <h> It Makes Hair Shinier <h> You Get To Use Dry Shampoo <p> Dry shampoo is my favorite hair product on this planet . It gives you amazing texture , it makes your hair look clean when it 's not , it gives a boost of volume , and it keeps hair in place . It just makes your hair look so great . Once you find a good one , you can literally do no wrong with dry shampoo . If you feel like your hair is too greasy , use dry shampoo to soak it up . You 'll immediately be refreshed . <h> It Saves You Money <p> You 'd be surprised at how much money you spend on hair products when you wash your hair daily - shampoo , conditioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing so much , you drastically cut down on the amount of product you 're using , letting them last longer . <h> Dirty Hair is Easier To Style <p> In general , dirty hair is so much easier to style .

It works the best for updos because it holds . It 's just more simple to work with .

Right now , my color is a mix of light brown and dark blonde , with light blonde highlights . But my plan is to go blonde completely , a la my hair idol Nina Agdal . <p> Why have I been so slow with this whole process ? Well , for one thing , I 'm scared of making such a big change .

Thank me later . 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Cut Down On Washing Your Hair <p> You should n't shampoo your hair too often no matter what color hair you have , but if you 're bleaching it , you should be even more careful . Buy yourself a shower cap so you can wash your body , and start going about three days without shampooing your hair . If it starts too look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only shampoo my hair about twice a week , and it definitely feels better . Dry shampoo is a miracle , and I love this one by Garnier . It gives you volume , does n't leave behind any residue , smells good , and leaves my hair looking like I just got a fresh blowout . <h> Use Deep Conditioner Once A Week <p> Bleaching your hair makes it way more dry and brittle , and the only way to reverse those effects is to give your hair more moisture . Instead of relying on regular conditioner , start using deep conditioner at least once a week . I 've found that using deep conditioner more often than that leaves my hair feeling greasy and weighed down , but some people do it every three days - it depends on your hair type . I love this one by L'Oreal . I put it on in the shower , leave it for three-five minutes , and then wash it out . It leaves my hair feeling so soft . <h> Stop Using So Much Heat On Your Hair <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Styling with heat is bad for any kind of hair , especially bleached hair . Try to avoid using your blow dryer , flat iron or curling iron as much as possible . Start letting your hair dry on it 's own as often as you can . Putting too much heat on your hair is going to fry it even more , and leave it super damaged . My sister bleaches her hair , and uses her flat iron like crazy - things got so bad that her hair actually stopped growing for a few years . Try to avoid that ! <h> Start Using A Heat Protectant Spray <p> As a girl with wavy , sometimes unruly hair , I understand that sometimes you need to use a blow dryer , flat iron or curling wand . If you 're going to use heat styling , you absolutely must use a heat protectant spray . I love this Vidal Sassoon heat protectant and shine spray . It smells really good , and leaves my hair looking shinier - plus , I know it 's protecting it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use hot tools for your hair is what I do : I blow dry my roots for a minute or two , then let the ends of my hair dry on their own . Then I touch things up just a little bit with a flat iron or curling wand . If you have the time , this is a much better option . <h> Pay Attention To Your Split Ends <p> Dry , bleached hair almost always equals lots of split ends . And while at least a few split ends are unavoidable , you should n't ignore them completely . Buy a product to try to prevent them - I 've heard a lot of good things about this Aussie one , and I 'm going to buy it this weekend . <h> Use Leave-In Conditioner After Every Shower <p> Like I 've said a few times , getting blonde hair means more brittle , weak locks . That means you need to be extra careful with your hair , especially when it 's wet . Do n't just rip a comb through wet hair . Use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ) when it 's wet , and then brush through your hair gently ... this will give your hair more moisture and untangle any knots . <h> Protect Your Hair From The Sun <p> Dry , bleached hair should not be in the sun unprotected ... that 's a recipe for more damage . Find products that promise UV protection . If you 're going to be in the sun a lot , start wearing hats or even pretty scarves . I spend a lot of time at the beach during the summer , so I know I 'm going to have a hard time this year , but I 'm going to buy products to try to make sure I prevent any damage I can . <h> Use An Overnight Mask At Least Twice A Month <p> Deep conditioning once or twice a week is n't exactly enough moisture for your newly bleached hair . You should also be using overnight hair masks about once a week - or if you do n't have time , at least try for twice a month . I love this L'Oreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to less breakage and split ends . I smooth this over my dry hair at night before bed , and it instantly soaks in . It does n't feel heavy or smear on your pillow . I mean , I would n't go out with this in my hair , but I do n't think anyone would . In the morning , you wash it out in the shower . All the work happens while you 're sleeping ! <h> Invest In A Good Oil <p> Hair oils can really change your life . Just a little drop of a good hair oil can make your locks look shinier , feel softer , and just become generally healthier . I am obsessed with Josie Maran 's Light Argan Oil and I use it every day . It does n't weigh my hair down , but it does make it feel and look better . Plus , you can also use this on your skin . It 's expensive , but you do n't need a lot of it each day , so one little bottle could last you a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been using for a full year ! <h> Get Regular Trims <p> Remember when we were talking about split ends before ? Well , you need regular haircuts or trims in order to keep those in check . Getting a trim on a regular basis ensures that you 're getting rid of the dead hair and leaving room for your more healthy hair . Trims also help your hair grow faster and leave your locks looking great . Totally worth the time . <p> Ive been dying my hair for 5 years now or so ..

Any advice ? <p> Jordan <p> If you use a semi permanent dye it will actually improve the condition of your hair instead of damaging it . The color may fade after a month or so ( depending on how often you wash and how harsh your shampoo is ) , but because its a semi permanent you can easily reapply the color on your own and not have to go to a salon . <p> Actually , my sisters hair really did stop growing for a few years . Why would I make that up ? It may not happen to everyone , but that does n't  mean it does n't  happen to some people . <p> Ashy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hair ( When people say all ofyour hair will break off or youll become bald , they simply have no idea what they 're talking about . ) I do my bleach myself to dye it colors like blue , purple , red etc , and I 've bleached my hair about 6 times in the past 3 months . Just recently , I bleached my hair two times for 60 minutes each with 40 volume peroxide , and my hair is a lot easier to maintaind styles a lot better . <p> Maybe I was just blessed with a nice hair type <p> Lilly <p> Actually the more you bleach , use hair spray , dye , and heat curling/straightening your hair will be easier to work with then when it is healthy . That does n't  mean that trying to take care for you hair is a waste of time . It is really good to do a Olive oil/ coconut oil hair mask on it to help . Healthy hair does not hold hair styles that good at all .

Well , I 've accepted the fact that there are some people out there who would probably call me basic . And guess what ? I really do n't  care . <p> I understand what basic means according to the Internet : a white girl who likes cliche things that " every other white girl " likes . Things get tricky because a lot of people use the term basic as an insult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is uninteresting , boring , just like everyone else , and devoid of personality . When that happens , I get pissed . I mean come on : just because a girl likes popular things , she 's boring ? That sounds so judgmental and rude . <p> As writer Jennifer Wright said in a recent Cosmopolitan- article on the subject : " Liking something popular does n't  make you lame . Discounting someone for having those same interests does . " And its true . I love everything Buzzfeed says basic girls like . If you 're going to scoff at me for that , go ahead . Honestly , I think you 're the one whos lame . <p> Rather than fight the label , I 've decided to embrace it . First of all , I know a lot of the stuff out there about basic girls is just a joke , even if it does rub some people the wrong way . Second of all , I 'm not ashamed to like what I like ! And if that makes you call me basic , than whatever . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on something as superficial as that , go for it . <p> Not convinced that you should embrace the term rather than yell at everyone for using it ? Here are 10 reasons why Im proud to be basic . Or maybe not proud , but just accepting . <p> 1 . Lauren Conrad is my celebrity idol. - Allure magazine called Lauren Conrad out for being basic over the summer , and Ive seen many people online call her " the queen of basic bitches . " Um , okay ? I love Lauren Conrad and I always will . Yes , she started out as a reality star , but she has been so successful since then . She has her own popular website ( LaurenConrad.com ) , manages the site The Little Market , has published eight books , has two fashion lines ( one for Kohls , one called Paper Crown ) , and has steadily managed her public image . I find her to be really inspiring . If Lauren is considered a basic bitch , then sign me up ! <p> 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liking anything pumpkin spice is so basic . Okay , then I guess being basic means you eat or drink delicious things . Because pumpkin spice is really yummy , and since its only available a few months out of the year , you better believe I 'm going to enjoy it while its around . <p> 3 . Uggs are really comfortable. - I get it , Uggs are like the fashion icon of being a basic white girl . That 's fine by me , because they 're incredibly comfy . I do n't  wear them everyday , but I wear them in the snow and my feet stay warm and cozy . I 'm not ashamed ! <p> 4 . Cliche Instagram photos are fun ! - I know its really cool to be so over brunch photos and pictures of leaves or the sunset , but I guess that just means I 'm not that cool , because I like those things . I think they 're fun to look at , and I like posting them . Besides , I 've never not done something just because other people do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start now ? <p> 5 . I like embracing seasons , so what ? - Maybe I 'm a weirdo , but I love embracing different seasons . If enjoying fall makes me basic , then so be it . Fall is probably my favorite time of the year , and I 'm enjoying myself . <p> 6 . Doing cutesy things with friends is fun. - Yeah , I love gossiping with my best friends . Yes , we totally planned a Friendsgiving this year and yes , we are definitely going to have so much fun and take tons of loving photos . Yes , we have a name for our group ( were the Fab Five , so were SUPER original , guys ) . Yes , we realize were so cliche . No , we do n't  care . <p> 7 . I do n't  think there 's anything wrong with liking the same things other people like. - What is the big deal about liking the same things other people like ? ! Why does that make someone less cool ? Are you telling me that I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one has ever heard of ? Or because I buy clothing with labels instead of exclusively thrifting ? I mean , if that 's what you think , you 're entitled to your own opinion . But I do n't  mind being labeled as someone who likes popular things , because I do n't  think there 's anything wrong with that . <p> 8 . I can still be my own person despite what I like. - I think there 's this idea that basic girls only like things because they are following a trend , or because they think it will make them interesting . Maybe some girls do that , but I 'm not one of them . I know that , despite the fact that I love a good pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks and a flannel shirt , I 'm still me . To be honest , I care more about my opinion of myself than your opinion of me . So if you want to call me basic , you can , I just do n't  care . <p> 9 . While you 're underestimating me , I 'm probably doing something cool. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on what I like , because then I get to turn around and surprise them . I love seeing the shocked expressions on peoples faces when I do something they did n't  think I was capable of . Its fun ! <p> 10 . At the end of the day , I really do n't  care what other people think about what I like. - What it comes down to is this : I do n't  care if you think I 'm basic . I like what I like , and if you want to put a label on me and say I 'm basic , that 's fine . You can say I 'm boring and uninteresting I do n't  think I am , so whatever . I cant control what other people think , and I 'm not trying to . <p> So , I guess the cats out of the bag : I 'm totally basic . Now I 'm going to go buy a Starbucks pumpkin spice latte so that I can take Snapchats with my cat while I watch New Girl and text my friends about our brunch plans . Bye !

I like guys who have a great taste in music , are interested in politics and current events and have an interesting sense of style . <p> But racial preference ? - When it comes to who I find attractive ? Nope , do n't  have one and its usually pretty gross when people do . Unfortunately , that 's one of my primary concerns when it comes to dating or- even developing crushes on people . <p> I end up wondering if there is a point of liking somebody at all if that guy wont even consider me as a viable dating option because of my race . My funny personality , unique style and awesome taste in music could all be on point , but my race could be a deal breaker . <p> Before any of you assume that I 'm just on my deluded , angry black girl soap box , please know that what I 'm saying is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dating , - black women and Asian men are considered the least desirable , especially in interracial relationships . But even for black women seeking black men , black women are less likely to receive messages than other races . Uh , yikes . <p> Plenty of people would n't necessarily admit to this prejudice and the ones who would- probably do n't  even consider their preferences racist . Well , newsflash : It is . <p> Really , dude ? All of the black girls in the world who look completely different from each other in every imaginable wayand you 've decided that none of them are attractive ? <p> Right . Okay . <p> Guys like that are definitely ones to avoid . Who knows what else they could be shallow about ? <p> By the way , this is n't just a problem for black girls ! I know that there are Asian women , Latina women , Native American women , etc who have the same worry . And its a crappy worry to have ! Why cant I just worry about what some guy thinks of the zit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with ? - I already know I do n't  fit the ideal standard of beauty . Im reminded of that enough whenever I open a magazine , watch television or try to find my color at the drug store among 50 shades of white and one or two chalky shades of brown . I do n't  need to be reminded of it even more when it comes to romance . <p> Frankly , there 's always going to be something fishy about people deciding that an entire race of people are n't  attractive . Of course , this is a claim that people of all races make and it is problematic no matter what . But let 's be real : This sentiment is a lot more loaded and harmful when it is directed towards people who are n't  white . <p> Yeah , there are going to be people who might say that they are n't  attracted to white girls , but before anybody starts crying a river , let 's not get it twisted : When it comes to race , being white is still the ideal . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of beauty as a society . Look up the phrase " beautiful woman " in Google Images and see what kind of diversity photos you find . Consider the fact that people with darker skin use harmful bleaches on their skin to try and become lighter . Think about the fact that white women dominate runways of fashion shows . Consider all of these things and more and you 'll understand that , at the end of the day , our mainstream society sees whiteness as attractive . <p> I 'm proud of who I am and I love my skin color . Despite the struggles and concerns I encounter regularly because of it , I would n't change it for the world . But wowI just wish that guys I 'd potentially want to date would love it , too . <p> This guy I had a crush on since elementary recently started dating the new white chick . He flirts with practically everybody except the black and Latina(me) girls . I have always been self conscious about my skin color so when they started dating , i took it pretty bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white guy then you should n't find it weird for him to like his own race . Regardless of the race of the guy you ca n't force attraction . Get over it ! <p> unknown <p> I 'm dealing with something a little different . To begin I 'm an attractive black woman . I can not go anywhere without being hit on by all races by the way . Now to my point . My black boyfriend is twice my age but he looks great . BUT I 'm pretty sure from his history he s attracted to white or lighter skinned women . I 'm pretty sure we wont make it because of this . I 'm way too pretty to be feeling insecure about myself cause this man is attracted to lighter skin ! Lol . Look love u and let other people have their own inner self hatred issues . <p> Melina <p> Hi there , I just want to say that I am an attractive black girl living in London . I have lived here for 10 years and in that time 90% of the guys I have dated have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things did n't  work out because of my race . When I go to bars , I get chatted up by white guys all the time . In most social settings I am approached by white guys . My last serious relationship was with a white upper class British guy . But he did n't  marry me . Maybe race played a part ? I do n't  know . But I know we spoke about it in the beginning and he said race did n't  bother him and in fact he is open to all races . I am open to all races too so I seek out open minded people who are like me . I think that 's the keybe yourself and be open . True love does n't  worry about these things . If you 're a feisty black womanas long as you do n't  offend peoplebe yourself- be authentic . Let your soul shinedont worry about what 's on the outside . <p> By the way Nordic/Germanic guys looooove black girls . When I went to munich with my best friend we were hounded ! ! <p> My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white friend got no attention at all . <p> So sometimes the issue could be that what is beautiful in one part of the world is n't beautiful elsewhere .

That is to say , I find most to be combative , prone to getting fat after a certain age and too dramatic to be around for any length of time . I prefer white and east asian women ( Chinese , Korean , Japanese ) over the dark skinned women of the world ( Indian , Middle Eastern , Latino ) . I do n't  owe anybody an explanation , plenty of white women will only date black men . Most black women prefer black guys . Attractions is what it is . Deal with it . <p> John <p> I do n't  feel an attraction for black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that black women are unattractive . It is not necessarily conditioning through the media standards of beauty . There are women of other races that I found attractive and they do n't  fit the blonde haired , blue eyed media standard . This is something that I just thought to myself and I have tried to see within myself why black women are unappealing . I do n't  have an issue with dark skin . There are indian women , latin women , middle eastern women , and south east asian women that all have complected skin . I find these women attractive . I still do not feel an attraction light skinned or biracial black women . It is not necessarily the hair . Not all black women have that afro that grows upwards . Moreover , I still find women of other races attractive when they tie their hair up . It is not attitude or behavior because not all women behave the same . I have come to the conclusion that I just cant pinpoint why I am not attracted to them . It is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and they reply by saying " I do n't  know , there is just something about them " . I feel that way but the opposite with black women . In the case of some men , it is because they just do n't  want black children .

@@45901494 @5901494/ <h> 10 Reasons Why Your Crush Disappeared <p> A few years ago , I started hanging out with this guy I met through a mutual friend . We hit it off immediately and got along really well . He was funny and sweet , and seemed really excited to talk and hang out with me . For over a month , we talked almost every day and hung out a bunch of times . Things seemed to be going well , and I was really stoked about it . Then , out of nowhere , he disappeared . <p> He blew off our plans one night , then stopped answering my texts , stopped trying to get in touch , and basically just slipped out my life . He was n't into social media , so it was n't even like a could stalk his Facebook or Instagram . I had no idea why he had just stopped speaking to me out of nowhere , and I was even more confused when he texted me a month later asking to hang out like nothing had happened . WTF ? ! By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I did n't  care about this dude , so I told him off and moved past it . But the whole thing really made me angry . <p> Having a guy pull the vanishing act on you is n't just hurtful and confusing its also embarrassing . I hated having to explain to my friends that he had just cut me out of his life . I felt like I had done something wrong , but I did n't  know what it was . But you know what ? I know I 'm not alone this has happened to too many girls . If you 're in this situation , here are 10 reasons why your crush disappeared into thin air : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> He 's A Player <p> It 's totally possible that he was juggling a few girls at once , and he started paying attention to some of the other people other than you . Maybe he 's sending a message that you 're not the only thing on his mind - he 's got other stuff going on too . Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off . <h> He Was n't Ready For A Commitment <p> If things were moving fast or were staring to move in the direction of a relationship before he disappeared , it 's possible that he got scared at the idea of settling down and committing . Instead of telling you that , he just bolted . This is really common and happens too often . <h> He Met Someone Else <p> As much as it sucks to think about , it 's totally possible that he met someone he likes more than you . He could have started talking to that person , realized he did n't want to mess it up by having someone else in the picture , and ditched you without really thinking about it . Or he could have been talking to this person all along , and just made things serious with her . <h> Something Freaked Him Out <p> I 'm not saying you did something wrong to make him act this way ( his behavior is n't your fault ) , I 'm just saying that maybe you inadvertently did something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comment about the future that freaked him out or did something to make him angry or feel hurt . He might not know how to express his feelings about that , so instead , he just ran away from them . <h> He Lost Interest Or Just Gave Up <p> Sometimes the spark between two people fades away sooner rather than later . It 's possible that this guy liked you at first , then realized you were n't really compatible and lost interest . Or , and this might be hard to hear , maybe he was never that into it , but was trying to give it a shot - when he realized it was n't worth it , he ditched . <h> He Just Wants To Be Friends <p> This happens a lot : a guy realizes that he likes hanging out with a girl , but just as friends and nothing more . He does n't know how to say that , so instead , he backs off to send a message . When he thinks the girl is over it , he 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is n't the right way to handle that situation at all , but it is possible . <h> He Was Too Busy and Did n't Want To Make Time For You <p> Sometimes life gets the best of us , and we have to put one priority over another . It 's totally possible that this guy got super busy with school , work , his other friends , etc. and had to put his dating life on hold . Should he have told you that ? Yes . But that does n't mean it might not be the reason . <h> He Wanted To Avoid Confrontation <p> The disappearing act comes down to three things . One : he wanted to avoid confrontation . This guy is obviously unable to discuss his feelings or what he wants , meaning he 's probably pretty emotionally unavailable . Confrontation is necessary for any relationship to work , so if he ca n't do even a simple thing like be honest about how he feels , he 's not worth your time . <h> He 's Not Into You <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to is this third explanation : he 's just not that into you . If a guy really likes you , he will work through any other obstacle to be with you . He wo n't be scared of commitment because he 'll like you so much he 'll want to commit to you . He wo n't be dating any other people . He wo n't be freaked out by things enough to run away . He wo n't ignore you or avoid you if he really does like you . That 's all it comes down to .

Being an introvert and being shy are two different things that often get confused as the same thing because they 're similar in some ways . For most of my life , I did n't  realize this either I thought being an introvert way another word for being shy . It was n't until recently that I really understood what it means to have an introverted personality. - While being shy is about being scared to talk to people or being nervous to be in social situations , being an introvert is more about simply not feeling a need to talk to others or be in very social situations .

Even though it was a while ago , I still remember it like it was yesterday . Senior year was my favorite year of high school . I was comfortable , the pressure was off , and I was able to enjoy myself . It was the only time I thought I might actually like high school . <p> That 's because senior year is great ! What 's not so great is hearing the same cliche phrases and questions come out of everyones mouths whenever they hear that you 're in 12th grade . Wouldnt it be easier if you could just hold a press conference for everyone you know so you could talk about this stuff once and then never again ? Unfortunately , that will never happen . So here are 15 things every high school senior is sick of hearing . Sorry , guys . I feel your pain . <p> 1 . Where are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign with the answer and wear it around your neck , because this is all you will be asked until September . <p> ALL OF THESE .

Granted its only 4 people and we all still live in the same town , but college is not going to make you lose your best friend . Yes , there will be new people in your life and you might not have as much time as you used to to hang out with your old friends , but if the friendship really matters to you , you 'll make it work . <p> Sarah <p> Definitely tired of people asking me what my major is going to be .

@@45901500 @5901500/ <h> The Dupe Test : NARS Orgasm Vs . Drugstore Brands Under $15 <p> I love makeup so much , but I really hate the price of high-end brands . I 'm usually willing to spend a little more on something that I know is going to work . Most of the time though , I 'd rather save and use something cheaper that works just as well . The good thing is , a lot of high-end brands have product dupes that are way more affordable . <p> NARS Orgasm blush is a cult favorite . Its hailed as a blush that flatters everyone , regardless of skin tone . I have to say , Ive seen Orgasm on many people , and it always looks good . I 'm a big fan of it myself , but I really cant justify spending $30 on blush . We set out to find the best dupe for this cult product by testing six drugstore options that are all under $15 . I based my opinions on pigmentation , staying power , price and closeness in color to Orgasm . Click through below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's start with a clean slate ! Here I am with just some BB Cream and concealer , no blush . <h> NARS Orgasm <p> Orgasm is supposed to be an all-flattering shade on every skin tone . It 's a peachy pink with a little shimmer . <h> NARS Orgasm Swatch <p> Orgasm is pretty pigmented , which it should be for a $30 price tag . I will say that you do get a large amount of blush for the price , and you only need a little so it does last for a while . Here 's a closeup look of Orgasm on skin . <h> NARS Orgasm Breakdown <p> Pigmentation : 5 <p> Staying power : 4 <p> Price : 2 <p> Overall , I love this shade and think it 's subtle yet also flattering . It feels great and stays for pretty much the whole day . However , I hate the price . <h> Milani Baked Blush in Dolce Pink <p> Dolce Pink is a pretty well-known dupe for NARS Orgasm in the makeup community . You can see up close that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also already appealing with a $7.49 price tag . <h> Milani Baked Blush in Dolce Pink Swatch <p> Next to Orgasm , you can see that Dolce Pink really is similar . It 's got the same peachy pink tone and contains shimmer . <h> Milani Baked Blush in Dolce Pink Breakdown <p> Pigmentation : 5 <p> Staying power : 3 <p> Price : 5 <p> Color comparison : 5 <p> This is a great dupe ! It 's just as pigmented as Orgasm , although it does n't have the staying power that NARS does . But I think at about 1/4 the cost , it 's an amazing choice . <h> Milani Baked Blush in Luminoso <p> Luminoso is another Milani dupe of Orgasm . Right away , I noticed it 's more peachy than pink and lacks a noticeable shimmer . The price is still great at $7.49 . <h> Milani Baked Blush in Luminoso Swatch <p> On the skin , you can tell that Luminoso is definitely similar to Orgasm but not as close of a dupe as Dolce Pink . <h> Milani Baked Blush in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 <p> Price : 5 <p> Color comparison : 3 <p> Luminoso is n't as close of a dupe for Orgasm . It 's a pretty color , and it 's a great blush for a great price . However , it does n't match the color of Orgasm enough to call it a dupe . <h> elf Blush in Tickled Pink <p> e.l.f . is known for it 's super affordable products and at first glance , Tickled Pink looks like a good match for NARS Orgasm at 1/10 the price . A $3.00 dupe for Orgasm would definitely be a winner . <h> elf Blush in Tickled Pink Swatch <p> So ... you can barely see Tickled Pink . Like at all . Boooo ! <h> elf Blush in Tickled Pink Breakdown <p> Pigmentation : 1 <p> Staying power : 1 <p> Price : 5 <p> Color comparison : 1 <p> I was so disappointed in Tickled Pink . Up close , it looked like a pretty good match . When I swatched it , it hardly showed up at all . Once I put it on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> NYX Blush in Pinched <p> Pinched is way more pink than Orgasm and does n't have any shimmery bits , but I think when applied to skin it might appear lighter . It 's only $5.00 so that 's really appealing . <h> NYX Blush in Pinched Swatch <p> You can see my swatch of NYX on the far left . It 's definitely pink and a little darker than I expected . Not really a close match . <h> NYX Blush in Pinched Breakdown <p> Pigmentation : 3 <p> Staying power : 2 <p> Price : 5 <p> Color comparison : 2 <p> Pinched is n't really a dupe for Orgasm , but it is a decent color . The price is awesome , but it does require a heavy hand to get the pigmentation you want . And unfortunately , this blush does n't last throughout the day . <h> Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush in Peach Satin <p> This Maybelline shade looks peachy enough but slightly more pink . It definitely does n't have any shimmer , but it 's only $6.63 so that 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely be different . <h> Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush in Peach Satin Swatch <p> Peach Satin is definitely peachy . It 's a little darker than Orgasm and lacks the shimmer , but it 's a nice shade ! <h> Maybelline Dream Bouncy Blush in Peach Satin Breakdown <p> Pigmentation : 4 <p> Staying power : 4 <p> Price : 5 <p> Color comparison : 3 <p> This blush is definitely a good option , but I would n't really call it a dupe . If it had some shimmer , I think it could pass . However , it 's a solid blush for a low price and decent staying power . <h> Revlon PhotoReady Cream Blush in Pinched <p> This blush looks super orange/peachy up close . It looks like a cream blush , but it also looks kind of slick which tells me it might be kind of light . It 's slightly more expensive for a drugstore brand at $10.39 . <h> Revlon PhotoReady Cream Blush in Pinched Swatch <p> This blush looks very similar to the peachy tones in Orgasm but has 0 shimmer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pigmentation : 4 <p> Staying power : 3 <p> Price : 3 <p> Color comparison : 3 <p> If this blush had shimmer in it , I think it would be a pretty good dupe . It does n't last as long as I hoped though . <h> Winner : Milani Baked Blush in Dolce Pink <p> This is literally the same shade as Orgasm . While it does n't last as long as NARS , it still has good staying power and is pretty pigmented . You really ca n't beat it for the price . NARS lists Orgasm at .16 oz and Milani lists Dolce Pink at .14 oz so you are getting a tiny bit less , but really it 's not a big deal for the color match . <p> What do you think about NARS Orgasm ? Do you use it ? Do you know of any other dupes ? What do you want us to test next ? Tell us in the comments ! 
@@45901501 @5901501/ <h> 10 Signs Your Boyfriend Is Too Jealous <p> A little bit of jealousy is normal in every relationship . Its hard to find someone who never , ever gets jealous , not even once in a while , and that 's okay . But there is definitely such a thing as too much jealousy , and that can absolutely jeopardize your relationship . When someone gets too jealous , they also become controlling and possessive . Both behaviors can easily lead to an abusive relationship , but even if they do n't  go that far , they can certainly lead to a lot of fighting and unhappiness . <p> How do you know if your boyfriend is way too jealous or just jealous enough ? It can be hard to figure out , especially because most guys wont come out and say they 're jealous . Theyll try to beat around the bush and act like they do n't  care , which makes you second guess yourself . Ive been there , girl . So , here are 10 signs that your boyfriend is too jealous . I 'm not saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you definitely should do something about this . 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> He Does n't Like You Talking To Any Other Guys At All <p> Just because you 're in a relationship does n't mean the opposite sex does n't exist . It 's understandable for your boyfriend to get upset if you 're flirting with another guy , but it 's not okay for him to get angry about you just casually chatting with another guy . Your boyfriend should trust you enough to talk to other dudes without thinking there is something else going on . <h> He Always Accuses You Of Flirting With Other People <p> If your boyfriend accuses you of flirting with every guy you talk to , that 's not okay . A guy who is too jealous will read into everything , whether it 's the smile you gave a barista or the conversation you were having with a guy you 've been friends with for years . That 's not cool . Again , you 're allowed to talk to the opposite sex even if you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something else . <h> He Gets Mad When You Do n't Text Back Fast Enough <p> I once dated a dude who got annoyed when I did n't answer his texts fast enough . He would send question marks until I answered , and if I did n't answer for a while , he would give me some annoyed response . I knew I had to end things when I ignored his text while having dinner with my brother and he called me 15 times in a matter of 30 minutes . 15 times ! That 's insane . This is not okay behavior . Your boyfriend should understand that you ca n't always answer a text right away without thinking you 're doing something shady . <h> He Monitors What You Do On Social Media <p> Remember AIM ? Yeah , well that same guy from before pulled something weird there too . I once put up an away message saying " At Nick 's soccer game " ( Nick is my cousin ) . This dude left me a ton of IMs saying , " Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Um WTF ? " It was so annoying and really made me angry . If your boyfriend does stuff like this - questions any one who writes on your wall or leaves a comment - he 's too jealous . He should n't be watching everything you do online . <h> He Grills You About Everything You Do <p> Does he ask you questions about every single detail of your day when he talks to you ? Does he want to know about every moment after you go hang out with your friends ? Does he ask you to repeat stories , accuse you of lying , or act like you 're keeping something from him ? If so , he 's too jealous . It 's one thing to ask how someone 's day went - it 's an entirely other thing to ask for a play-by-play . He 's trying to keep track of you . <h> He Gets Mad If You Do n't Call Right away <p> What does your boyfriend do if he asks you to call him when you get home and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to ? Does he flip out and start a huge argument with you , accusing you of lying and demanding to know where you were ? If so , he 's too jealous . That 's not normal behavior . <h> He 's Really Suspicious Of Your Friends <p> A boyfriend who is too jealous will always be really weird about your friends , even if he has no real to be . My ex-boyfriend was very jealous and hated when I hung out with my single friends . He did n't want them to " influence " me , which is ridiculous ! A BF who is n't too jealous will give you girl time without acting like you 're doing something shady . <h> He Gets Mad At You About Things You Wear <p> What you wear is your choice - no one else 's . Your boyfriend does n't have the right to tell you what you can and can not wear , whether it 's revealing or not . If he trusted you , he would be okay with you wearing whatever you wanted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never believes what you say and always accuses you of lying despite the fact that you 've never given him a reason to feel this way , he 's too jealous . He 's obviously carrying something else around with him and is taking it out on you - or he just has a very controlling personality . Either way , he needs to learn to trust you and give you a chance , or things will never work . <h> You 've Caught Him Going Through Your Phone <p> No one should ever go through your stuff , even if that person is your boyfriend . Snooping through text messages or recent calls is n't normal couple behavior - it 's wrong and invasive . If your BF feels like he has to check up on you , that means he does n't trust you .

@@45901503 @5901503/ <h> 8 Terrible Things You Did n't  Know Binge-Watching Was Doing To You <p> Binge-watching is a favorite activity of mine . As someone who 's constantly busy and running around , I really enjoy a short period of time where I can zone out and focus on just one thing . I also happen to love television so binge-watching is great for someone like me . <p> Last weekend , I watched all of Orphan Black ( please watch it ) in two days and barely left my bed . It was amazing . Netflix just revealed they 're putting ALL of Gilmore Girls up on October 1st , and were already planning our weekend binges ! There 's nothing I 'd love to do more than spend two weeks watching Gilmore Girls 24/7 . But you have to be careful when it comes to binge-watching because it has some not-so-great side effects : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> It Increases Sedentary Behavior <p> It 's no secret that watching television is a sedentary activity . According to the Journal of the American Heart Association , binge-watching is a gateway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M.P.H. said , " Television viewing is a major sedentary behavior and there is an increasing trend toward all types of sedentary behaviors . " He also added , " As the population ages , sedentary behaviors will become more prevalent , especially watching television , and this poses an additional burden on the increased health problems related to aging . " So if you 're a binge-watcher , it 's important to balance that out with physical activity . Get moving and get some blood circulating to your legs at least ! 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Ruins Your Good Mood <p> When you watch TV , you 're relaxing . Even with high-intensity shows , your brain does n't really have to think . Watching TV makes your brain switch from the left to right hemisphere , which releases endorphins , hence the relaxation . Then when you stop watching TV , your brain switches back , allowing you to resume your usual daily activities . Apparently , if you watch TV for too long , your brain gets confused . You 're relaxing and releasing all these endorphins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad because your brain has been feeling great for a long period of time . 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Suppresses Your Problems <p> Counselor Monica McCue thinks that binge-watching is actually a way for people to escape their lives in an unhealthy way . She says , " If a person is experiencing underlying issues and suppressing them with binge-watching , it can negatively impact their health and ability to function . " I know when I went through my breakup earlier this year , I binge-watched show after show because I was so depressed . I was doing things like going to therapy and stuff , but whenever I was alone I was watching a show for hours at a time . In hindsight , I should have gotten out and done things . On the other hand , it helped me zone out on something so I was n't focusing on how depressed I was . I think this could go either way . 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Ruins Your Self-Esteem <p> Yikes ! Binge-watching can also lower your self-esteem . Carol Lieberman , M.D. said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite characters and start to live vicariously through them instead of living their own dreams . " If you think about it , this makes a lot of sense . You 're focusing on someone else 's life for hours at a time and are n't actually doing anything in your own life . 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Makes You Slack On Personal Hygiene <p> This is pretty gross and also something I can relate to . I 'm a very clean person , but sometimes if I 'm in a binge-watching black hole and wo n't see anyone for days , I 'll slack on changing out of my pajamas . According to this infographic from Miner &amp; Co Studio , binge-watchers are twice as likely to skip showers than non-bingers . Ew. 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Ruins Your Social Life <p> Binge-watching can also really impact your social life in a negative way . I can totally attest to this . I turned down an invitation to go to a party with some friends last week so I could stay home and finish Orphan Black . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get so hooked on what you 're watching that you 'll give up anything to find out what happens . 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Causes You To Oversleep <p> Binge-watchers are also notorious for staying up late to finish the next episode . You know how it goes , especially if you 're on Netflix . That little box pops up and is all " The next episode will begin in 15 seconds " and you 're all " OK GREAT LET 'S DO THIS ALL NIGHT ! " Apparently , binge-watchers oversleep twice as much as those who do n't binge . Binge-watchers generally just start neglecting important things like eating , sleeping and being actual people . 28676 @qwx438676 <h> It Makes You Sad When You Have Nothing Left To Watch <p> Perhaps the worst thing about binge-watching is that you run out of things to watch . So you finished Breaking Bad , Game of Thrones , Homeland , Parks &amp; Rec , Orphan Black , Entourage , etc . Binge-watchers watch everything they want to watch and feel like they lost a friend when they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll end up moving on to some weird show you did n't even want to watch in the first place , but you 're out of pliable options .

Tell us in the comments ! <p> I totally relate to most of this . I watch an entire anime series over a weekend , or a week depending on how much episodes there are ; but then I do n't  watch a series for about two or three months so I think it balances .

I was in tears and could n't believe it . I knew he had struggled with addiction and more recently depression , but that does n't  make his death any less shocking . <p> I 've opened up about my battle with anxietyand am happy to discuss that . I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and get anxious about all kinds of things . I get anxious on the subway and when I feel like I cant breathe . I get anxious in bad weather . I get anxious when Im stressed , which is very often . Sometimes I have trouble getting out of my apartment on really bad days . <p> Ive been going back and forth on the topic of medication with my therapist . The fact is that I 'm managing my anxiety the best I can , and although its incredibly difficult , I am doing it . I think I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to focus on managing my anxiety without it . <p> I 'm tired of hiding it . I 'm not ashamed by my mental health problems . They 're just deeply personal . However , I realized that hiding my illnesses wont make them go away . Being open about them might help someone else , so I 'm going to tell you all about it . <p> A lot of times anxiety and depression go hand-in-hand . Anxiety can prohibit you from doing things because it convinces you that you 're in danger or that something is wrong . It can cause you to turn down the simplest things like watching a movie with your friends because there 's a voice telling you that if you go outside , something bad will happen . The restrictions that anxiety puts on you can lead to depression . More often than not , people that are diagnosed with depression or anxiety are also diagnosed with the other . <p> Depression and anxiety both run in my family . I 've seen my loved ones and many friends struggle with these illnesses for so long and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " would ever face the same trials . But I am . <p> Ive been battling my anxiety for quite some time , although for years I did n't  realize that I was . It makes sense since I 've been through a lot of traumatic life events . I witnessed death at a young age , dealt with the attempted suicide of my best friend , lost another best friend , almost died several times and survived a tornado . My life has been filled with high-impact situations that have caused me to be anxious about almost everything . <p> After my friend Macy passed away , I was definitely depressed . I was n't eating or sleeping . I did n't  want to get out of bed . I shut myself off . That was the first time I went to therapy , but I hated my therapist and did n't  continue . That depression was situational , which is very common when it comes to loss . At a certain point , I was told I had to get it together . So I did and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about death around that time . <p> After my biggest near-death experience , I was depressed . But everyone , including my therapist at college , was telling me that I had been blessed with this second chance and could n't waste it . Instead of processing and taking time to deal with what happened to me , I pushed forward and pretended that I was fine . I , of course , was not fine . My anxiety was controlling me at that point , but I chalked it up to school stress and kept going . I started taking things out on my then-boyfriend , family and friends . <p> At the end of my junior year of college , our town was hit with an EF-4 tornado that took out pretty much everything . After that , I started seeing a new therapist at home because I was a wreck . I was diagnosed with PSTD and was learning how to cope with my anxiety . But no one was helping me cope with my depression . I myself refused to think or admit that Ive been struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When people describe me , theyll probably tell you that I 'm always smiling . I 'm friendly and talkative and will make you feel sparkly on the inside . I love hearing that , but I also feel a bit like a fraud because I do n't  feel sparkly on the inside . <p> For the better part of a year , I 've been really struggling with my anxiety . I was using my previous relationship as a Band-Aid to mask my problems and put my focus on something else . When my relationship abruptly ended in January , I lost it and felt the pull of everything I had been avoiding . My anxiety had spun out of control and flung me into a black hole of depression . <p> I was afraid to be alone because I had these voices in my head telling me that I was n't good enough . That my boyfriend dumped me because I was n't worth it , that I did something wrong , that there was something the matter with me . I could n't look at myself in the mirror because all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forehead . I was feeling so much pain that had been building . I had suppressed so many negative feelings and thoughts for such a long time because I was always the person who had it together and who was positive . I hit my breaking point and couldnt do it anymore . <p> I was n't sleeping so I was taking an over-the-counter medication . I felt so helpless and dark and wanted nothing more than for all of it to go away . I thought to myself that I could just take the entire bottle and then I would n't wake up and I would n't feel anything . That thought scared the crap out of me . I called my brother and told him I was scared and that I was afraid to leave myself alone . He talked me down , reminded me that thoughts are just thoughts and made me promise that I would n't do anything . I have anxiety about disappointing people and breaking promises , so I went to bed . <p> The next morning , I dragged myself unwillingly out of bed because I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the street because half of me wasnt paying attention and the other half just did n't  care . When I made it to the subway , my brain told me that if I just fell in , it would n't matter . I did n't  matter . <p> The thing about depression that people who do n't  have it do n't  understand is that you have no control over what your brain is telling you to do . You have a happy , healthy brain that does n't  tell you how horrible you are or that you 're better off dead . J.K. Rowlingexplained that Dementors were inspired by her experience with depression , " Its so difficult to describe depression to someone who 's never been there , because its not sadness . I know sadness . Sadness is to cry and to feel . But its that cold absence of feeling " that really hollowed-out feeling . That 's what Dementors are . " <p> Depression is an emptiness that paralyzes you and sucks all the happiness out . And sometimes you reach the point , like I did , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million times . The best way I can explain how depression makes you think is like how that necklace horcrux talked to Ron Weasley . It told him he was nothing , that he would never measure up to Harry Potter , that he was worthless . That 's what depression tells you , and you have no control over it . <p> I was so fortunate to be educated about depression because so many people I know have been affected by it . I logically know that I do n't  want to hurt myself . I went home , got back into therapy and am taking the steps I need to manage what I 'm dealing with . I am okay . I have good days and great days . I get out of bed and go to work and hang out with my friends . But I also have bad days . I have days when I do n't  want to do anything and when my anxiety controls me . I have days when I hear depression telling me that I 'm not enough , but I know that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are NOT alone . Even the happiest people in the world on the outside , like me and like Robin Williams , can be dealing with the worst possible things . You do n't  ever know what someones life is like on the inside . If you take one glance at my internet life , youd think there was nothing wrong . But you do n't  know me on the day to day just like you do n't  know anyone else . <p> If you 're feeling depressed , know that its not your fault . You are not alone . You are wonderful and wanted . You are enough . And you should talk to someone . Talk to me , talk to a friend , talk to someone at the other end of the phone ( call 1-800-273-8255 ) or a chat line . You can get through it . I 'm getting through it every day . <p> Hi , I just wanted to say thank you so much for writing this article . Its a huge comfort to know that I 'm not alone . I cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But again , thank you so much for sharing . <p> Anna <p> Thank you so much for this article . I 've struggled with depression since I was 13 and I am 24 now , I was heavily bullied at high school and then college too , its very difficult to stop those negative thoughts in your head ! it makes you feel so weighted and worthless , but there is hope , never give up and know that you are not worthless , or stupid or ugly or strange or unable . you tell those nasty thoughts to suck it ! you are worth it . you are able . <p> Emily <p> Thanks for writing this . I 've struggled with depression since I was 14 and I 'm 20 now . I also have anxiety and OCD . When I experienced my first depressive episode I was hospitalized because of severe self-injury that took many different forms ; I 'm still battling that addiction . I still struggle with perfectionism as well . I use a combination of therapy , medication , and lifestyle choices to battle my mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if I make the right choices and take care of myself , I can manage it and survive okay . I have n't experienced any trauma or near-death experiences , but my issues are mainly caused by genetics . I 'm pretty open about my mental health problems and will speak about it if it comes up in conversation ; I see no point in hiding it , and besides , I have scars and such so its pretty obvious anyway . <p> chantal <p> Thank you for this article . Its 3am but I think I 'm going to e-mail my therapist to start seeing her again . Its true , you always seem so cheerful and upbeat in articles . One of the problems of dealing with depression is that if you act happy people just assume that you are but they do n't  see that its almost not an option not to act happy . Its not " normal " to not smile a lot and seem fine . If someone asks you how you 're doing you just tell them you 're great . No one wants to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its uncomfortable . If anything good comes from Robin Williams death , I hope its a bigger awareness and acceptance of mental health issues . I 've already seen many articles addressing it . And yes , I can relate to all of those feelings you described . My best friend died too . Actually , he killed himself 3 weeks ago . I just transferred to a new university and will be starting soon and while I 'm excited about that I 'm also really scared . Scared that I 'll get majorly depressed again and fail . I know my best friend would want me to succeed but sometimes its just hard to get out of bed because all I can think about is him and a big part of me is missing . I want to make friends at this new school but I also have social anxiety and every single interaction is a little draining . I tried to convince myself that I could deal with it on my own but maybe that 's not the case . <p> As for taking medication , I 'm on zoloft right now . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt like I was finally a normal person who did n't  have to feel like crap all the time . I danced and sang along to every song and felt on top of the world . After the first month I got used to the effects and it became normal . I felt fine . I rarely cry though . Like even if I want to sometimes I just cant . Its a little creepy because it basically blocks all those horrible feelings that you 're used to or at least greatly diminishes them . I guess it just increases your overall " normal " mood . You never reach the lowest lows of depression like you did before . You can be sad but you bounce back pretty quickly . Overall I 'd recommend it but I understand if you 'd rather keep it natural . Again , thanks for this article = <p> Olivia <p> Thank you so much for opening up about this Caitlin . I can totally relate , I have social anxiety , generalized anxiety , and depression and nobody except my parents and my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more about it now because you 're right , its nothing to be ashamed of . Bonus points for the Harry Potter references by the way . <p> Strong <p> Thanks Caitlin , for writing this . I 'm sure itll help a lot of people . I suffer from depression myself as well as self harming . I can totally relate to this . I know what it feels like to think you 're a waste of space . I do n't  know exactly what causes my depression but I have problems with my family as well as living in a country where there was a horrific civil war . I 'm doing my best to fight my illness . I know things will get better soon . I hope you stay strong too . Take care . <p> Annalise <p> I was diagnosed with OCD in Fourth Grade at the age of 9 . OCD stands for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder . I lived a fairly normal life with rare occurrences of much trouble , until one day I went to the nurses office and was sent home with head lice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed my life forever . I am no longer afraid of getting head lice , but I had to constantly wash my hair and use lice treatments on my hair even though I 've only had it once in my life . I would never share hair products , I would n't sleepover at friends houses , etc . When I was going into my sophomore year of high school , I was diagnosed with Seasonal Affect Depression . Basically , I only experience depression like symptoms in the winter . I live in a four season place , so only one season out of the four I experience living hell . Like you said , people who do n't  have depression do n't  understand what its like . They think they can " cheer you up " or " make it go away " , when in reality nothing can take your mind off of your inner demons . It really sucks . There 's no other way to put it . It flat out sucks . <p> I am so sorry for everything that you have to go through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As someone who has similar thoughts , it especially scares me . Just keep on keeping on and smile through the pain . There is nothing wrong with getting help . DEPRESSION SUCKS , so let 's kick its ass !

He is cool and cute and sweet and funny , but he sleeps around with a lot of girls . A week after we met , we agreed to just hook up and not catch feelings , but I think I like him . He 's sending mixed signals though . He calls me Baby and Babe and we text a lot ( not as much anymore cause he 's a couple hours away working for the summer ) and he has kissed me in front of our friends before too . He acts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignore me sometimes . And sometimes after sex he just takes me home and we do n't just hangout or talk as much anymore . Its becoming less and less about - just sex . How can I fix this ? And how can I get him to actually like me ? From Faith <p> Hi Faith , <p> First , I want to state that you ca n't force him to like you . Changing anything about yourself in order to get anyone to like you is a no-no . You are who you are , and either he likes the real you or he- does n't  . Second , guys are very literal about everything , so if you- agreed to be just hook up buddies , that 's all he 's going to think of you as , someone he hooks up with . This- doesnt- mean that he- doesnt- like you , but he could just like you because you guys are hooking up , nothing more . Since you know you have feelings for him , I think- you should talk to him about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go two ways : he could tell you that he likes you as more than a hook up too and you guys could develop a relationship , or he could want to just stay hookup friends . Either way , talking to him about it is going to be your best bet ! <p> - <p> Does He Like Me Or Not ? <p> I had a guy who became my friend . He is the one that made me his friend . He smiles wen he sees me , always stares at me , but sometimes whenever he sees me around him , he tries to stay out of my sight Is he into me or not ? From Anonymous <p> Hi Anonymous , <p> I 'm not sure what you mean by " he made me his friend . " Hopefully you are friends with him because you like him as a person and like spending time with him . As far as the staring and not staring part , he might like you and just does not know how to act when he sees you . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talking to girls they like as we are with the guys we like . It 's nerve racking for everyone . My best advice would be to spend some more time with him and see more of how he acts . He might just want to be friends or he might want to be more , but you wo n't find out until you get to know him a little bit better . <p> He Sent Me A Picture Of His Penis Does That Mean He Likes Me ? <p> This guy and I have been going to school together for four years now , and we only just started talking last week . We flirt a lot on Snapchat and texting . One day , he said " send me a picture of your legs , " and I did not really pay any attention , and he then said " what picture do you want me to send ? " So , jokingly I said " d " for , well you know what I mean . Well , I was n't expecting anything because we do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a picture of him masturbating in front of the camera close up . To be honest I was pretty shocked , but I kind of liked the guy before all of the penis pictures . What do I do ? Does he like me or is he just being one of those stupid boys ? From Rachel <p> Hey Rachel , <p> To start off , all men are obsessed with their penises . Seriously , they love showing it off to anyone who will look , especially through texts and Snapchats . So in that sense , yes , he is " just being a stupid boy . " Also , he probably did n't  know you were joking when you asked for that picture he probably thought you really wanted it ! If you 're not comfortable with that , you can tell him to stop , but for the future , do n't  joke around in that way with someone you do n't  know very well . So , does his sexting mean he likes you ? Its hard to tell . A lot of guys will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want naked pictures . The next time he texts you , ask if he wants to hang out ( not in one of your bedrooms ) . If he wants to go on a date , that 's a good sign . If all he wants is some more pics , that could mean he s only interested in hooking up . <p> He Always Stares At Me Does He Like Me ? <p> Every time I stare at this guy , I catch him staring at me too , but then he looks away quickly . Some of his friends say that he does n't  like me anymore ( he used to like me ) , but I do n't  believe them because he s always staring at me . Does he like me or not ? From Amy <p> Hi Amy , <p> Staring boys are super annoying . You ca n't tell if they " like like " you , if they just think you 're pretty , or if they 're not actually looking at you at all . All scenarios are confusing . He could like you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings . They would rather stare at you from across the room instead of just telling you . I would try and make a joke out of it with him . Tell him , when he 's alone , not in front of his friends , that- youve- caught him staring and ask what 's the deal ? Be super nice- about it and see what he says . He could very well like you , and is just too shy to say anything . <p> - <p> I Told Him He Liked Me , But He Did n't  Say He Liked Me Back <p> I told a guy I like him over text and he replied that he kind of already knew and he was n't sure exactly what to say , and then he said thank you for being honest . He is really flirty in person and over texts , so I mean , I did n't  just tell him because there were no signs he liked me back . So does he like me and he s too shy to say ? Is he not sure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From Hope <p> Hi Hope , <p> You started off on the right foot . Letting someone know you like them is half the battle , so a high five to you for being upfront with him ! While its possible that he likes you back , to be honest , it does n't  sound too promising . If a guy likes a girl , hell probably say more than " thank you " when she confesses her feelings for him . When he said he was n't sure what to say back , that could have been his way of nicely rejecting you . If you 're super confused , just ask him what the deal is . If he does n't  give a yes or a no the next time , move on . He s clearly confused . <p> Hi , so I 'm 15 turning 16 in September , and a few weeks ago , I was at this party thing with maybe 7 friends .. No big deal , it was fun . But this guy who I went to school with was there .. And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently started talking like Talking talking , and we sent pics back and forth a few times . And it got late so we all decided to play manhunt .. XD .. Good idea right ? Well after a few rounds some people went home so it was just me and the guy on a team He hid with me and he asked " Can I try something , and promise you wont freak out " I said sure , and he kissed me .. A round or two after that we were hiding again , and things got intense We did n't  have sex .. But it was close , and I was so happy , I thought " oh my goodness .. He finally likes me " so the next day over Facebook , I talk to him .. And I bring up what we did .. And he said " Do n't  worry were still friends " Does this mean he just wants to be friends with benefits ? And if so What do I do ? I want a relationship with him .. But after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hey. ! So , its kind of complicated My ex boyfriend and I , after a few months of breaking up , decided to become Friends with Benefits , I 'm a virgin and I do n't  really want to have sex with him Anyway , he s always asking me for sexy pictures and its just plain annoying Sometimes hell be all sweet , but most of the time he s just asking for that kind of stuff . He calls me Babe , and sometimes I 'm under the impression that he still has feelings for me Should I just call this deal quits ? ?

If you are afraid of the word boner or cant read the word without laughing , then I suggest you stop reading now because I am going to use it a lot . I remember my first experience with a boner . It was gym class during 6th grade , and one of my fellow students had one . I could n't stop staring at it . SO many questions amassed in my head . " What is that ? " " Why is that happening ?

But , most guys describe it as a pleasurable feeling where he becomes really aware of his penis . It really depends on the situation when a guy gets a boner .

If a guy sees something that he is attracted to in a sexual way this can cause a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply thinking about any sexual situation . Also , the weather .

They have just as many hormones raging through their bodies as we do . So the slightest thing can give a guy a boner . The wind blowing a certain way . A subtle touch . Seeing a person they are attracted to . Really anything ! As guys get older they can control their boners better because they recognize the signs that they are about to get one . But , even older guys still say they get boners sometimes for no reason . <h> What Is Morning Wood ? <p> This is a slang term for having an erection in the morning . Most guys become aroused in their sleep multiple times a night without knowing . Sometimes the erection will still be there when they wake up . Thus causing them to be hard in the morning . <p> Again , every guy is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeout session and gets excited , giving him a boner .

You can ask any guy , sometimes they get boners when they are not physically or mentally stimulated and it can be really embarrassing . Usually , a boner will go away on its own in a couple minutes by a guy doing different tricks to calm his body down . Blue balls are a term that guys use when they are sexually stimulated and then denied release .

Even though I 'm highly skeptical , there 's always the off-chance that something is going to work . It usually does n't  hurt too much to try something out . I tried a baking soda blackhead remover . I tried Visine to make blemishes go away . Ill try just about anything , including putting Advil Liqui-Gel on my zits . <p> Fortunately , since I switched to more natural skin care methods , my skin has significantly cleared up significantly and stayed fairly clear . I 've also been oil pulling , which has made a huge difference in my skin and overall health and well-being . That said , I 'm still getting breakouts here and there . Sometimes I just get a few pesky , super red blemishes . That 's where Advil comes in . I 'm testing out the hack that says Advil Liqui-Gels can cure zits basically overnight . Let 's see how it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clean Skin <p> Wash your face and apply your favorite moisturizer . <h> Pinpoint Your Spots <p> I 've got a little bugger starting on my forehead so I 'm going to see if this helps preventing zits from forming . <h> And This One <p> I 've also got a small blemish on my chin that is a little red so I 'm going to see how Advil works on this guy too . <h> You Need : Advil Liqui-Gels <p> They look like this .

However , this is a GREAT option in a pinch ! If you 're out of your spot treatment or you notice a zit that appears suddenly and all you have is Advil , this will work . I think layering it with another spot treatment would actually be better because Advil 's main job is to be an anti-inflammatory . This will reduce swelling , especially for large or cystic blemishes .

When you 're seriously dating someone , you will inevitably need to make some sacrifices for them . This means sometimes doing things you do n't  exactly want to do that you know will make your partner happy . But its important to keep in mind that a relationship is also a two-way street you shouldnt be the only one making sacrifices . Your partner needs to make them as well . <p> In case you do n't  believe me , a recent study confirms that sacrifices are important in any relationship . Research found that people who are willing to make sacrifices are more satisfied with their relationships , while those who are n't  are less satisfied . This makes a lot of sense . Two selfish people dating equals disaster . <p> This does n't  mean you need to sacrifice everything .

I know that , for me , when I started dating someone after years of being single , this was hard . Suddenly , I did n't have as much time for reading , binge watching TV shows or napping as I used to . It took a while to adjust , but I 've finally got a good schedule down . Seriously dating someone means sacrificing some of your time for them . Of course , you should still keep some alone time scheduled for yourself . Not everything should be about your partner ! But you will definitely have less of it than before . And if you 're not going to sacrifice that , well ... it 's going to be really difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't Really Want To See <p> Sometimes , when you 're dating someone , you have to do things you do n't really want to do . You have to do some of these things because they make your partner happy . That does n't mean sexual things you 're not interested in or anything that makes you uncomfortable . It just means that sometimes you have to let him pick the movie , and agree to watch it even if it would n't have been your first choice . It means sometimes you have to let him pick where you 're going for dinner , even if you 're not exactly thrilled with that restaurant choice . And all of THAT means that he has to do the same for you . It should be a give and take type of deal . <h> Dealing When He 's In A Bad Mood Sometimes <p> A relationship means that you sometimes will have to deal with your partner 's crappy mood ( just like he 'll sometimes have to deal with yours ) . Even if he 's being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him after he 's had a really bad day - and you 'll have to support him and try to make him feel better . Is that annoying ?

Now , if he gets in a bad mood that involves him verbally or physically abusing you - you should never put up with that . I 'm just talking about dealing with a little bit of attitude here . <h> Some Of Your Friend Time <p> Remember what I said about losing some of your alone time ? Yeah , well you 're going to lose some of your friend time too . A relationship comes out of nowhere and takes up a lot of time , so other things get pushed back . This absolutely does not mean you should ditch your friends . You should definitely still make time for them and talk to them .

A little bit of harmless flirting once in a while is just that ... harmless . But no more serious flirting with guys who actually like you or trying to get with you . Would you like if your boyfriend was doing that behind your back ? Probably not . So do n't do it to him . <h> Always Getting Exactly What You Want <p> When you 're in a relationship , things can never be just about you . It does n't work that way . This means that sometimes you 'll have to sacrifice getting exactly what you want . You ca n't always win every single argument . You ca n't force him to do all of the things that you want to do without ever compromising to do things he wants to do . You ca n't always have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move on .

Yeah , get rid of that . It 's 2014 . You need to pay for stuff too . Being in a relationship can get expensive if your dates all involve dinner and movies , or things like that . Be willing to sacrifice some of your hard-earned dollars to pay for dinner sometimes or to buy his movie ticket once in a while . Again , this should be give and take . <h> Things That Make Him Very Uncomfortable <p> This one is tricky , but basically , you should probably sacrifice doing things that make him uncomfortable . In the end , though , you also need to focus on what makes you happy . Do n't give up things you really do n't want to do without for this guy . That will only make you bitter and angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex ? Try to make things work - but if this new guy is important to you , you may need to give that up .

Check out everything you need to know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . <p> Okay , what exactly is twerking ? <p> Twerking is a dance move that involves a whole lot of rhythmic shaking and thrusting of your butt . <p> Well yeah , but how do you do it ? <p> Before we get started you need to know that twerking is more than just shaking your butt . Anybody could move some of their butt muscles around , but twerking is a little more advanced than that . There are a few different types of twerking styles , but the standard move is as follows : <p> 1 ) Get into a squatting position , as if you 're about to sit in a chair . Make sure your legs are pretty wide apart and your toes are pointed outwards . <p> 2 ) Put your hands on your hips . Place your thumbs on your butt bone and press to help move your hips forward . Pull back with your fingers on your hip bones to move your hips backwards . Hands and fingers are important for this dance , yall ! <p> 3 ) For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Use that hands on your hips to help guide your booty in the right direction . <p> Feel free to squat lower or even put your hands on your knees for a little more leverage . <p> Does it look like it does in the videos ? Probably not because twerking is surprisingly difficult to master . For some of yal , your butt just wo n't want to shake that way . But hey , maybe practice makes perfect . Once you master the standard twerk , you should be able to twerk with your hands on the ground or even twerk against the wall , but do n't  jump the gun , girl . Slow and steady wins the racealso , you do n't  want to break your neck trying to " make it clap " while you 're doing a handstand . That 's not a good way to go . <p> The date of its origin is unknown but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is mostly performed by women during ceremonies ; fun way to turn up , right ? Well , in the 90s , that traditional dance got a bit of an update .

This new dance craze became so popular that in 1998 the government of Ivory Coast banned the dance from public . <p> While this was going on , the bounce music scene in New Orleans was also flourishing . What 's bounce ? A type of hip hop that has a lot of call-and-response elements to it , which is basically like interaction between the performer and the audience . In this case it is sort of like the DJ yellin " hey " and the crowd yelling " ho " back !

But it definitely took nearly 20 years for the dance to become a household name . In that time span , Yin Yang Twins came out with a song called " Whistle While You Twurk " in 2000 and Beyonce mentioned twerking in her song " Check On It " in 2005 . By 2011 a group of girls came out with Twerk Team videos that youve probably seen at least once . Oh , and in 2012 , Diplo and Nicky Da B came out with an amazing video for the song " Express Yourself " which highlights the New Orleans bounce scene and , yes , a ton of twerking . <p> Of course , twerking did n't  become a massive household name until our friend Miley Cyrus started twerking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great at it ?

Why is twerking suddenly seen as cultural appropriation or whatever ? - <p> here 's why twerking became a big deal : Twerking was initially a dance movement that was largely popular in hip hop circles . Of course , these circles are predominantly black . Once they were put out into the mainstream , they were suddenly on the radar of everyone , especially white people . Suddenly , twerking was known as the big ghetto dance craze that trampy black chicks loved . Suddenly , it was n't dance with a whole lot of hip hop history attached to it ; it became some slutty dance coined by black people because , wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " like shaking your butt , apparently . <p> So people of the mainstreamread , whiteculture took a dance movement with history to it and , in the opinion of some folks , degraded it to something of mocking . Just think about Taylor Swifts " haha I cant do this dance move " schtick when she tried to twerk in her video for " Shake It Off . " Things like that are- why some people were upset , especially when it came to Mileys video for " We Ca n't Stop " last year ; sure , it got some flack but many saw Mileys moves as edgy and harmless ; sex positive even . Meanwhile Beyonce or even a random black chick up in the club doing the same thing may be seen as singlehandedly degrading women everywhere , leaving people to write think pieces about how Beyonce ca n't be a feminist . - Sup , double standards ?

Woof . <p> This might sound petty and cherry picking , but context is everything , yall . When there 's a history of mainstream culture taking things that were popular in niche groupsthis case being black onesand turning them into a spectacle of mockery , disdain and double standards , people are guaranteed to get a little ticked off ! And its pretty understandable . <p> So , what ? White people cant twerk now without it being racist ? <p> No , no , no , its a little more complicated than that . Anyone can try to twerk and it does n't  matter what you look like ! But its important to realize that its a dance that can either be silly and fun or loaded with negative implications depending on how someone goes about it . <p> Twerking is so disgusting though . <p> That 's exactly what people said when people stared to dance closely together at formal gatherings .

If you do this , you 'll start stressing before you even know any other information . Get to know the situation before you decide it 's a bad one . Give things time and see what happens before you jump to conclusions . <h> Decide If You Want To Trust Him or Not <p> Trust is a big part of this situation . If you do n't trust your boyfriend , you 're never going to feel okay with him being close with other females . But if you do trust him , you 'll be able to accept it more .

But ultimately , you still need to trust him . <h> Get To Know Her Instead of Avoiding Her <p> Your first instinct may be to avoid this girl , and the entire friendship , as much as possible . It might be to be mean to her to show her who 's dealing with , and to give her a sign that she needs to back off . This is definitely the wrong way to go about this situation . Being mean to this girl is only going to make her defensive ... and then if his best friend does n't like you , she 's probably going to say something to him , which will make you look bad . Instead of trying to act tough , get to know her . Hang out with the two of them and show an interest in their friendship . Figure out what she 's all about . Get a feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can decide how you really feel about her . <h> Become Friends With Her Yourself <p> If you get to know her and you actually think she 's pretty cool , why not become friends with her yourself ? That way , things will be less awkward . I 'm not saying you should make her your bestie and steal her from your BF . But there 's nothing wrong with becoming really friendly with her . It will make things a whole lot easier . Plus , having a BF with a girl BFF has benefits . You can talk to her about the problems between you two , and she can talk to him about it in a different way than his guy friends would . <h> Do n't Try To Be Manipulative <p> Do n't take your cues from movies or TV shows by trying to do something evil to break these two apart . That 's immature , and it will also probably backfire . Putting all of your energy into taking this friendship down is a waste of your time . Do n't spread lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like her . <h> Be Honest With Your Boyfriend <p> It 's really important for you to talk to your boyfriend about this stuff . If his relationship with this girl makes you uncomfortable , you need to tell him . Do n't pretend nothing is happening , because then you ca n't expect him to ever know how you feel about it . Without being confrontational or angry , tell him that you 're a little nervous about him spending alone time with another woman . Ask questions about their friendship to find out more about it . Show him that you care about him and your relationship , and make it clear that you 're not trying to push her out of his life ... you just want to be honest about your feelings . <h> Tell Him Specific Things That Bother You <p> If their friendship is really bugging you , have another conversation with your boyfriend . This time , make sure you tell him the specific things that bother you rather than just saying something like , " I do n't like you being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will just make you look jealous and insecure , and will make him defensive . If you have concrete examples of things , you 're more likely to get somewhere .

I 'd feel more comfortable if you did n't have so much alone time with her . " Or , " I do n't like how you text her so much when we 're hanging out . That 's our time , and I do n't think that 's fair . " Be willing to compromise and talk things out . <h> No Ultimatums Unless Absolutely Necessary <p> Never give your boyfriend an ultimatum like " it 's her or me " unless you want a big fight ... or breakup . Ultimatums are a really bad idea in any relationship , because they leave no room for compromise . If you make him choose , there 's a chance he might choose her out of principle , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you REALLY feel like something is going on between them .

@@45901536 @5901536/ <h> 10 Tips On How To Deal With Facial Hair As A Girl <p> Let me tell you guys a ( sort of embarrassing ) story : A few weeks ago , I was cuddling with my boyfriend , when he jokingly poked the area right above my upper lip and said in a teasing voice , " Oooh , looks like someone is growing a mustache ! " Even though I knew he was playing around with me ( I had just spent the last few minutes joking about a pimple he had ) , I immediately leapt out of the bed and ran to the mirror so that I could examine every inch of my upper lip for a mustache . <p> What did I find ? A whole bunch of fine , blonde baby hairs that , while once invisible , were now glaringly obvious to me . " OMG ! " I shrieked , horrified . " You 're right ! ! What do I do ? ! ? " My boyfriend told me to calm down because he was just kidding , but in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my " mustache . " Whenever I was doing my makeup , I would become distracted by those stupid little blonde hairs , and by the time I was done , I had myself convinced that I needed to start shaving . I forced my mom to check it out at least once a day , begging her to tell me if it was obvious to everyone that I was walking around this way . Every time , her response was the same , " Stop being so silly , Jessica . We all have little hairs there . I did n't  even notice those until you showed me . " <p> Even though I knew I was being ridiculous and superficial , I just could n't get it off my mind . So finally , I did something about it . During a routine Brazilian wax appointment , I made the random and completely spur of the moment decision to wax my upper lip . I had been getting the hair ripped out of my vay-jay-jay for months now I figured it could n't really hurt that bad , right ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly painful maybe even more painful than a Brazilian . I left the appointment teary-eyed , trying to hide my red upper lip area but it was worth it . A few hours later , I happily admired my smooth upper lip area . No mustache hairs to be seen ! <p> Except no one noticed this drastic change . Seriously . Not even my boyfriend . I guess my mom and boyfriend were all right when they said I was just being dramatic . <p> I still get my upper lip waxed once in a while , mainly because I drive myself crazy . But this whole thing has taught me something big : facial hair on a woman really is n't that big of a deal . In fact , you 're probably one of the only people who notice it ! <p> But if you 're like me , and you want to do something about it , this is for you . You can leave your facial hair alone if you 're fine with it ( more power to you ! ) , but you also have the option to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here are- 10 tips on how to deal with facial hair as a girl : 28677 @qwx438677 <p> Next 28674 @qwx438674 <h> Do n't Panic ! <p> Do n't freak out over a little facial hair the way I did . It 's not worth it ! As I said , even though I was obsessed with my peach fuzz , no one else ever even noticed it . Chances are , no ones notices yours . And if they do ? Who cares ! Everyone has body hair , and women are definitely not immune to facial hair ( although it sometimes seems like something that only happens to dudes ) . Do n't make yourself feel like you 're weird or anything like that . I promise you , you 're not . <h> Avoid Shaving <p> Shaving is a great option when it comes to body hair removal ... but I do n't think it 's too great for your face . First of all , shaving is not a permanent solution , since it does n't pull the root of your hair out - so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly . Second , shaving can easily result in irritation , cuts , and ingrown hairs , especially on a sensitive area like your face . I would n't attempt to shave off baby hairs on your upper lip or peach fuzz on your cheeks . That 's kind of asking for disaster . <h> Try Tweezing Certain Areas <p> If you only have some stray hairs that are really bothering you , you can just try tweezing . Tweezing should n't be super painful , but the bad thing is that it ca n't be done all over your face . It 's perfect for your eyebrows or even your nose , but tweezing baby hairs on your upper lip or cheeks will take way too much time and will hurt way too much . Stick with tweezing if you 're just trying to clean up a little bit , otherwise go for a different method . <h> Find An At-Home Kit To Use Yourself <p> Not ready to make an appointment with a professional ? No worries , there are a lot of at-home options you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips that work well for your eyebrow or upper lip area . These are painful , but the pain wo n't last very long . They 're really easy to use , and when done correctly , they work . However , they will leave your skin red for a little while , and waxing can always cause ingrown hairs . You should also note that waxing yourself is considerably harder than having someone do it for you . <h> Consider Waxing ... <p> If none of the above options seem particularly pleasant , consider going to a professional waxer . Like I already explained , I 've had my upper lip area waxed . I 'm not going to lie , it definitely hurts . And waxing always carries the risk of ingrown hairs , irritation , or an allergic reaction . But while it may hurt for a few minutes , the pain does n't last forever , and waxing is great for keeping hair away for up to a few weeks . <h> ... Or Threading ... <p> Not into the idea of hot wax ripping hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is exactly what it sounds like - removing hair with thread . It 's commonly done on eyebrows , but it can be used on your lip and face as well . Threading will leave your skin super smooth , it 's not too painful , and results last a few weeks . It 's better for your skin than waxing , and devotees say it looks better too . It 's best to leave this to professionals , though . Do n't try it at home ! <h> ... Or Sugaring ... <p> Sugaring is another method of hair removal that is growing increasingly popular . It 's a Middle Eastern method that involves combining sugar and other ingredients into a paste that is applied to your hair and then whisked away - with the body hair . You can find a professional to do this , or you can buy a kit to do it at home . Most people say that sugaring is much less painful than waxing . The cons ? It can be tricky to do it exactly right , and if you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Hair Removal Cream ... <p> If you want an option that is not painful at all , and requires little effort , go for a prescription cream like Vaniqa that stops hair from growing before it appears . You would have to go to a doctor to get this cream , and the other downside is that it only works when you 're using it - meaning that once you stop using the cream , everything will go back to the way it was before . <h> ... Or Laser Hair Removal <p> A really permanent option for those that are serious about getting rid of facial hair is laser hair removal . Laser hair removal is less painful than waxing , and results can be permanent after a few sessions . Laser hair removal works on lighter hair , but it 's best for darker , coarse hairs . Sounds great , right ? Right ... except it can get pretty expensive . Only consider this option if you have very annoying facial hair that you want to get rid of for good . Otherwise , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think It 's Hormonal <p> If your facial hair recently popped up seemingly out of nowhere , and it wo n't go away , you can always consider seeing a doctor . Sometimes , it can be a result of hormonal changes . Taking a hormone treatment or a birth control pill may help with your facial hair . <p> My facial hair is seriously out of control I started to wax when I was 10 now I 'm 15 learned the threading technique I use it over my upper lip . The thing is Im considering laser hair removal after a couple of years I 'm afraid of skin problems after that : ( ( what can I do to permanently remove it ! ! ? ? <p> Anne <p> My family is hairylike embarrassing hairy . Plus I have to get treated with steroid based meds for a life long skin condition which encourages even more hair growth !

You just leave it on for five minutes and then take it off with a wash cloth . I do it about once a month and it shows incredible results and is painless . <p> Olivia <p> So I read that bit where you said waxing hurts . Honestly , I never go to salons to get my hair waxed . I do it myself . Its a lot less painful becuase you know what you 're going to do . It just takes a bit of courage on the first go . My hair is really dark and I got a bit of a " moustache " too . All i did was buy waxing strips ( lol at Coles ) and boom . Gone the next day . It was super easy and once you do it the first time you probably wo n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you wax . Same goes for legs . <p> Jasmine <p> Why is n't being confident one of the tips ? Having facial hair is completely natural and while giving tips on how to remove it you could also try to encourage girls to love what they have rather than having to change themselves from their natural state . Us girls can choose to remove our bodily hair , or decide to keep it there . But this article made it seem like the only way to react to facial hair was to try removing it but that 's not the only reaction all girls may have . <p> Archana <p> I shave my face with a razor that does n't  have a block of moisture/shaving cream on either end of it . I find that shaving works fine for my face , if you have the patience to flatten out and examine your upper lip for a good five minutes . Just be sure to keep your face wet , and put some shaving cream/oil on it !

I started becoming self conscious about it once I got to middle school . One day , my mom and I were at the mall and we saw someone getting her eyebrows threaded and the results were phenomenal . I decided to try it and the forest had been cut down to size and looked maintained ! Threading is definitely the way to go for eyebrows . It is a tad painful but I 've noticed that the more Ive gotten it done , the less it hurts . Waxing eventually stretches out the skin ( or at least that 's what I 've been told ) so I try to avoid it . Threading is fast , has amazing results , and lasts a long time Well , for me it does . <p> Lissa <p> Waxing your upper lip does n't  hurt at all , at least for me . You just need to remove the wax quickly , all at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best option is bleaching , it takes about 20 min , it does n't  hurt at all , and its cheap . it turns the color of the peach fuzz into the exact same color as ur skin . this method is more efficient for people with darker hair . be careful to choose a bleach that does n't  irritate ur skin . before applying to a sensitive area like your face , try a sample on ur hand or somewhere else like that just to make sure that you are not allergic to it . Sally Hansen makes the best brand for this , and you can find it at a drugstore , or target . just look for a box that says " facial bleaching kit "

Luckily , Clare took to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sexism on her sister 's blog and her story has received international attention . <h> Denied Entry For Daring To Have Breasts <p> In 2013 , Brittany Minder was kicked out of prom for exposing too much cleavage . According to her school 's dress code , strapless dresses were allowed as long as they did n't expose cleavage , lower back or midriff . But as a woman with ample breasts , it was nearly impossible to rock the strapless dress of her dreams and totally hide her cleavage . Minder was forced to cover up with a shawl but she left early due to self-consciousness . Sure , she could have worn a different dress , but not everyone can control their cleavage and not everyone is showing off their cleavage for sexual reasons ! <h> Banned For Being Lesbians <p> If there 's one thing that schools hate more than leggings , it 's LGBTQ students daring to attend prom together . In 2012 , Hope Decker and Tiffany Wright were barred from attending this Catholic school 's prom because their union did n't comply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home , however , the pair decided to have their own prom in the parking lot with their friends .

The school believed it was unacceptable for someone they considered male to dress in that manner . Well , the ACLU got involved and Zamazal was allowed to wear her dress . It 's awesome that this story has a happy ending , but it 's tough to imagine how common this story must be for trans high school students across the country . <h> Banned For Wanting To Take Her GF To Prom <p> In 2010 , Constance McMillen was barred from taking her girlfriend to prom . The ACLU filed a lawsuit against the school on McMillen 's behalf , which led to the school banning prom all together ! Instead , the school encouraged parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student body attended . Of course , McMillen was n't invited .

Yeah , pants . The prom did n't even have a dress code ! Instead of letting her have a good time at prom in the attire she was most comfortable wearing , the school effectively punished her for not dressy " girly " enough . Ridiculous . <h> Banned Because She Did n't Have A Date <p> You know , as disgusting as body shaming and homophobia is , it still comes as no surprise when these hateful forces factor into someone 's termination from prom .

Be who you want to be and date who you want to date . <p> Musical <p> The Catholic church only says that gays cant get married in the church , Pope John Paul II says basically as long as their chaste like all other un-married couples their fine . If any catholic says otherwise , they most likely do n't  study catechism to well . <p> virgo96 <p> these things are ridiculous .

Probably partly because only students who go to the school are allowed to go but even those who do have boy/girlfriends at the same school tend to go as a group with their friends . Prom is seen to be more of a friend occasion than a relationship one we do n't  have corsages or that sort of thing either .

The moral of the story is you cant live your life for someone else , you must love and let love rule no matter the race of the object of your affection . <p> Brodie <p> Yes ! I really like a mixed boy and I 'm white and my brother is totally racist ! Im scared to tell my mom I like him ..

I have to hide it from them because i 'm not allowed to date and they would hate him . But its cool i guess because were in this long distance relationship .

@@45901540 @5901540/ <h> 20 Style Tips On How To Wear Thigh-High Socks <p> Its official : thigh-high socks are back , and may even be here to stay . When I was a kid , I associated high socks with my very strict Catholic school , since they were part of my uniform . In high school , I could n't think of thigh-high socks without conjuring up images of Clueless , my favorite 90s movie . But for the last few years , thigh-high socks have come back into style in a major way , and now the only thing that comes to mind when I think of them are really cute outfits . <p> Even though they seem easy to wear , thigh-high socks can be a little bit intimidating , especially for someone who 's never worn them before . Last year , I bought a pair of black knit thigh-high socks , and wore them once . With a plain black dress . Every time I put them on , I felt like they either looked weird on me . Basically , I was really self-conscious . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking amazing , I 'm ready to give this another try . Here are 20 style tips on how to wear thigh-high socks : <p> 1 . Go for a very boho-chic look with a loose , bohemian dress and a cute hat. - <p> Just wanted to point out that Number 9 features printed tights/nylons , not OTKs <p> Lyndsay <p> I 'm really sorry , but I ca n't help but noticing how you guys write tons of body-confidence posts and how being a " big girl " is n't something to be ashamed about . BUT whenever you make outfit posts it always only featuring really skinny/slim girls , apart from its directly targeted towards " big girls " . <p> Hailey <p> I love thigh high socks so much , but seeing as I 'm a little bigger in the thigh region , I do n't  think that I would be able to pull them off . Maybe if I lose a little weight 
@@45901541 @5901541/ <p> For reasons I do n't  quite understand , the latest weird celebrity trend has been about stars Photoshopping their own Instagram photos . No one was that surprised when Kim Kardashian was caught doing it , but everyone is having trouble accepting the fact that Beyonce has been caught not once , but at least three times . <p> What are celebrities doing doctoring their own photos ? ! Do n't  they complain when they get Photoshopped against their will in magazines ? Are n't  they constantly speaking out against the unrealistic standards set for women in Hollywood ? Why would they turn around and Photoshop their own pictures on something like Instagram , a site that is supposed to give us a more intimate , unfiltered ( well , sort of ) look into their lives ? I do n't  get it ! <p> Its easy to hear this and say its just the media blowing things out of proportion , but actually , its not . There is hard evidence that all of these photos have been retouched , from side-by-sides with the unedited version to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see inspiring celebrities like Beyonce ( or whoever handles her Instagram ) continue to Photoshop photos of themselves . It definitely sends the wrong message to all of their younger fans , who are n't  afraid to call them out on it although many of these celebs have n't responded to any of the Photoshop claims . <p> Its also really sad that these celebrities feel like they have to do this . If they are touching up their own photos , it shows how insecure they must feel in their own bodies and that really bums me out . No one should feel so unhappy with themselves that they want to alter what they look like on a social media website . It makes me want to give them a hug ! It stinks that Hollywood as an industry is so unforgiving that even someone as untouchable as Beyonce is constantly changing how she looks on a computer . <p> So , who 's been doing it the most ? Here are 16 times celebrities have been caught Photoshopping their Instagram pictures : <p> This is the third time we 've caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this earlier this week , but its since been deleted . Check out the way the line on the staircase does n't  line up . Do n't  believe me ? Look at the reflection of the same line its straight there . It seems like someone was obviously trying to adjust her thighs , although I 'm really not sure why . Bey has great legs ! <p> 2 . Beyonce <p> Check out the iPhone and wine glass see how they 're both curved and warped ? Its a clear sign that Beyonce was probably touching up her thigh again . <p> This was the first time we all caught Beyonce in the middle of an Instagram Photoshop scandal . A lot of fans did n't  want to believe it , but come on : look at her thigh ! This was a messy Photoshop job . You can see a pattern here every touched up photo involves her legs . Its actually pretty sad to consider this trend . <p> 4 . Kim Kardashian <p> This photo of Kim might look perfectly normal here but look at the next side-by-side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like she may have slimmed down her hips a little bit . <p> 5 . Kim Kardashian <p> Wow , I did n't  know doors could curve like that ! JK , they usually do n't  . This warped door is a sign that she must have nipped in her waist . <p> 6 . Kim Kardashian <p> There 's that weird curved door again ! It looks like Kim tried touching up her stomach area and maybe her chest and thigh . <p> This has to be Kims weirdest Photoshop job . She posted the picture on the right as a #tbt ( where , even more upsetting , she commented about how upset she was that her body did n't  look like that anymore ) . Its an old photo , but that did n't  stop Kim from allegedly working on it . As Perez points out , it looks like she made her butt look bigger , slimmed down her thigh , nipped in her stomach and waist , cut down her nose , and made her boobs look larger . She also flipped the photo . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older sister , Kylie posted this Photoshopped shot of herself in a bikini . This is REALLY messy you can clearly the pixelation around her legs . She quickly deleted it and replaced it with the below image , but the Internet never forgets and now it serves as a sad side-by-side . <p> See ? There 's a clear difference between her legs in these images . <p> 9 . Miranda Kerr <p> Miranda was first caught when she posted the photo on the right . Fans quickly noticed that it was a doctored image from the original , on the left . Look how much tinier her waist is ! Miranda commented on this , saying she had found the photo on a fan site and did n't  even realize it was different . I would believe it , if the next two photos did n't  also happen <p> 10 . Miranda Kerr <p> Notice how the bookcase in this photo curves in on the side like that . It looks like Miranda or someone else might have tried adjusting her butt , hips or leg . <p> 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , and you 'll see that the lines on the rug are curving in towards her body . This is a sign that she may have tried slimming down her legs or hips again . So unnecessary ! ! <p> 12 . Britney Spears <p> Some people claim that Britney drew on her abs in this photo . Its possible , but we really do n't  have proof of that , so no one knows for sure . <p> 13 . Peaches Geldof <p> Before she passed away , Peaches shared this photo on her Instagram where she obviously tried adjusting her arm . The counter in the back is seriously warped . <p> 14 . Peaches Geldof <p> She later posted another shot from the same day where it looks like she may have adjusted things again . Check out the way the sidewalk is curved . <p> While this is n't the most positive article , I 'm not surprised celebrities Photoshop their photos . Its a very common thing . Its just when they do n't  DO it right I mean , some of these photos do n't  need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but these celebrities feel so insecure and they feel the need to make their waist thinner . I mean , look at #9 ! She has no need to Photoshop that one . Her stomach is perfect as it is . Its natural . Its just depressing that they feel like this is required . Sometimes it is the photographer . But I think they should be proud of their body , because not everyone is perfect . <p> Addie savage <p> Ok did no one else notice that the second one of Miranda was just her copied and pasted onto another photo ? ! It was n't just that the rug lines curved but someone literally took her from another picture and just slapped her on to that one . <p> John Doe <p> This shows that women who clearly have fantastic bodies still feel ashamed , something I will never understand . I mean , Kim looks great and always has , so why touch up your photos ? I 'm not denying her the right , its her choice after all , I just do n't  understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology and not just lump every kind of digital image manipulation under the blanket term " Photoshopping " . This technique is what people in the photography and retouching industry call " liquifying " and yes , while it is usually done with Photoshop , there are many other uses for Photoshop other than touching up models and making women " feel bad about themselves " ! <p> Willow <p> Not only did I not appreciate the message I got from this article , but I 'm also really bothered by the fact the author felt it was appropriate to mock someone who recently passed away for something as trivial as posting photo-shopped pictures to Instagram . Its blatantly disrespectful ; not only is it disrespectful to Peaches Gedolf , but her family as well . Let sleeping dogs lie and show some respect for the dead . <p> Willow <p> Geldof , excuse my error . <p> Jessica Booth <p> I did n't  mock Peaches in any way ? <p> Jade : ) <p> yhe Britney Spears one she had drawn abs because it was a show . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drain you out and if you do n't  contour you just look like a blob <p> Jessica Booth <p> I mean , you do n't  HAVE to draw on abs on anyone just because you 're on a show . What 's the big deal about someone not having ab muscles ? <p> Jen <p> Kylie Jenners legs do n't  look any different to me beside the pixelation and I honestly feel that she deleted and trip loaded because she put an effect on the photo that caused pixelation and then noticed so went with no effect . This is just so sad and you can say that you 're just feeling sad for them but it really in shaming them for wanting to look different and that 's wrong <p> Jessica Booth <p> Um , I hate to tell you , but there is no " effect " or filter that puts pixelation around your legs . <p> Ashlee <p> Its not that she used an effect that caused it to be pixilated . Its that she uploaded it on Instagram and when the photo uploaded it lost quality because she failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Use High-Quality Image Processing " under " Advanced Features " check-marked as " ON . " <p> It pixilated about 50% of the photos I would upload ages ago before a QUICK Google search told me how to fix the issue . <p> Out of all of these , Kylie Jenners is definitely NOT altered in any way . Do n't  who she is , but that shit ai n't  altered . <p> Jessica Booth <p> It DEFINITELY is , though . <p> Ashlee <p> Also , I actually would n't even call that pixilation . Its that when the photo was compressed , the edges on *everything* in the photo are wonky because its aliased . <p> For example , look at the bars along the floor in the background , and the large black side of the mirror on the left-hand side of the photo . ALL aliased. 
@@45901542 @5901542/ <h> I 'm So Over Selfies ! <p> Seriously , I really , reallydont like selfies . I think the selfie and the act of taking a selfie- has- completely brainwashed people from living in the moment . This is defiantly an aggravated post about how upset I am over the selfie culture , and why I believe that it is time to take a step back from the camera . But before you get mad at me for this opinion , hear me out. - <p> The saying " Wait , let me take a selfie ! " is something that we all hear on a daily basis . Waiting for the bus : " *snap* " duck face . " Laying on the beach *snap* " happy face . " Waiting in line for coffee *snap* " ugly , I need coffee face . " Ahhh ! What is with cataloging every emotion we feel and sending pictures to people that , sorry to say , do n't  care ? ! Any of this sound familiar ? <p> Now , I 'm not saying that Ive never taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been out with friends and squeezed into a frame to capture a moment . Or if I 've created an amazing smokey eye and want to show it off , I send a quick Snapchat . What I am totally against is being so enamored with taking photos of yourself that you completely miss the world and everything that is going on all around you . <p> There are so many examples to prove my point . First , this very popular video of a girl that 's so engrossed with taking pictures of herself that she has no clue that she is being made fun of . If you really look at this video , it is actually really sad and scary . I just can not imagine being so bored in a car that I would take a bunch pictures of myself , rather than have a conversation . Some of my best memories as a child happened in cars , on road trips with my family or friends . <p> Second example , the countless social media feeds that have only pictures of people doing absolutely nothing , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting at your desk ? Selfie . Eating a bowl of cereal ? Selfie. - It makes no sense ! - I do n't  care what they 're doing ! And do n't  even get me started on out-of-place selfies . Like taking one when you 're getting pulled over . Or at a really serious event like a funeral . Come on people ! That is so messed up on some many levels . <p> Our culture is so obsessed with taking pictures of ourselves that it has become second nature to us . We do n't  blink an eye when some celebrities have 4,000+ pictures of themselves with pouty lips and messed up hair , doing nothing . Or another celebrity , I wont mention names , who decided to publish a book with 352 pictures of herself . And we can all purchase the book for the low price of $19.99 Is this real life ? I just can not deal with the amount of crazy this makes me feel . <p> I feel so sad that the selfie has become so important to young girls today . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we view ourselves science even agrees . One study said that " psychiatrists are beginning to consider the compulsion to take selfies as a serious mental health problem . " Constantly needing the validation of others to make us feel better is not good . The amount of likes , comments , reblogs has no correlation to who you are as a person or how beautiful you are inside or out . I really want to stress this because being so concerned about how you are perceived by others is not good . And selfies are a major catalyst to this issue . <p> I want to start a challenge . Go out and do something or absolutely nothing without taking a selfie . Go for a walk outside without smiling into a camera . Hang out at home with friends without a selfie captioned " chillin . " Do absolutely nothing without taking a selfie . Just be in the moment . Read a book or a magazine . Go on a Tumblr binge , watch 5 hours of Scandal. - Do whatever it is you want to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> I want to say that I do n't  think there is anything wrong with taking a couple of selfies here and there . When you and your friends are having a great time , sure ! If your super excited that you just aced a test ! Yea take a selfie . But do n't  feel the constant need to document everything that you are doing . <p> I partly agree on this . I agree that selfies can be annoying especially with the duck faces although it can make girl have higher self esteem which some certainly need . I hate when girls fish for compliments though . Alot of girls do n't  realise how anoying they sound when they are fishing for compliments . A ton of guys find it unnatractive which does n't  help a girl . <p> caitlin <p> I agree 100% percent with this ! ! I used to go on social media like Instagram and chat to my friends but then what I realised is all they would post would be selfies saying " ugh i 'm so ugly , why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they really thought they were ugly ( which they are not ) they would n't have posted it . Its disturbing our time together as well , whenever we go somewhere , barely 5 minutes goes by without them stopping , taking out their phone and saying " Wait a sec , just got ta take a selfie " . Even when I was in class and we were all revising for a test , people were secretly taking selfies ! ! I honestly think my generation is becoming Generation Selfie <p> levi <p> If this is n't satire i feel so ashamed of this website you guys finally hit rock bottom . Girls PLEASE do n't  listen to this article , take as many selfies as you want , it will be amazing to look at them in the future , and it is n't hurting anyone at all , and it makes you feel good and that 's ok . Its possible to go out and have fun while also snapping a few pics , its possible to be in a long car ride and take a selfie at a stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you think you look good , share your beauty with your friends and if they are a real friend they wo n't complain about how annoying selfies are , they will appreciate your beauty . <p> anon <p> Nope . Most people find selfies highly annoying , and studies show that people who take selfies are more likely to have mental issues . Stable people do n't  go around snapping pictures of themselves all the time . <p> jade <p> Never let anyone same you for taking a picture of yourself . Like , I have very bad self esteem , no self confidence so when I take a good picture of myself , I feel awesome . And this is the same for a lot of people . Nothing wrong with a little self love ! And alsotheyre just pictures . Chill . <p> Karolina <p> Oh ya , Oh look at the girl its so embarrassing and ugly when she feels good about herself and feels confident enough to share that . No one should be judged by their appearance , but in a society where women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selfie , that 's a huge middle finger to the rest of the world . I personally like living in the moment , but getting coffee , getting on the bus , you are not living . Who are you to judge how a girl wants to spend her time . Maybe taking a selfie is living in the moment . I 'm young , I 'm pretty , I feel greaaaat . God forbid they desire validation from others that they look good . Who are you to judge how many selfies a girl should take ? Stop making people feel bad about the things they do that do n't  hurt anybody but make them feel good . Write an article about how girls should stop making fun of other girls for the way they look , maybe then they wo n't feel the need to take a selfie in search for validation , self-esteem , or a chance to feel good about themselves . Even celebrities struggle with this . It is not an act of egotism , its an f you to the people who tell them they 're not good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the article but the complaining about not wanting to know what others are doing every minute of the day : if you do n't  wan na know , then do n't  look or do n't  go on social media ! Its that simple . <p> Also , yes , selfies can lower the self-esteem of people ( girls and guys alike ) , but to be honest , the lowering of self-esteem is not solely from selfies . There are a ton of other factors that go into that . In fact , taking selfies can be uplifting for people . <p> Studies may be accurate most of the time , but there are a lot of flawed studies that do n't  take in other factors and put it into the results
