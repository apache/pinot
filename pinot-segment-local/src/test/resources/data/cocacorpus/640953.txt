About a premium RTW line from the Italian bespoke shoemaker Roberto Ugolini , about the new Swedish budget brand Morjas , and about a new EU-Japan free trade agreement , which will eventually eliminate customs duties on shoes . <p> The world of classic shoes contains many different terms , and in some cases they are mixed together . Especially for those who have recently started to be interested in the subject , it can be complicated to understand the difference , or not mix up things . Here are explanations of some of the different terms that are often mixed up . <p> I have visited quite a few factories that produce Goodyear welted shoes , and although its often nice places , it always strikes me that they are relatively small factories , much smaller than many might think . In the Crockett &amp; Jones factory in Northampton , on the other hand , I 'm almost overwhelmed by the large , well-trimmed production . <p> The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is shoe interested people get to learn early , since the properties are superior to plastic when it comes to allowing- the shoes to dry properly- ( although the woods ability to absorb moisture often is exaggerated , its more about it not clogging against the leather in the same way as plastic ) . An alternative material for shoe trees is leather , which- these above are made in . <p> I do n't  know how many times Ive heard or read things like " the shoes hurt like hell- for a week , but now they are really comfortable . " Classic quality- shoes , which are more or less entirely made in leather , should n't be used fully directly , both the shoes and especially the feet will feel much better if they are broken in carefully . <p> Often when the Japanese do things they do it properly . That also goes for shoe care products , where ambitious- Boot Black offers an impressive arsenal of different types of products for all types of shoe care you can think of .

Its not unusual that they are- quite inaccessible and anonymous . TYE Shoemaker , however , have the record in this category . The address points to a location in the middle of Tokyos shoe district Asakusa , even on Google Maps TYE Shoemaker is officially exposed here . But I go back and forth on the street , look into the windows , ask people I meet , not even the small shoe factory opposite what 's supposed to be the right address can help- me . Eventually I get hold of Tsuyoshi Ohno on the phone , one half of TYE Shoemaker , and he goes out on the street to meet me . Out of one of the doors I stood and pondered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I follow him up a narrow staircase to the second floor , where a relatively large workshop is located . here 's a small sofa and coffee table in front of some shelves with some sample shoes , both mens and womens footwear , to the left there is a work area with focus on upper making , to the right a part which focus on- last making and bottom making . The second part of the company , Yohei Shiwamura , stands and makes coffee . We sit down in the leather couch and in a- bit struggling English the interview is conducted . Both are very kind and slightly timid persons , people you instantly feel comfortable around . <p> Beautiful shoes . <p> A wall in the workshop . <p> Yohei Shiwamura to the left , Tsyoshi Ohno to the right . Together they form TYE Shoemaker . <p> Guild of Crafts , founded by Chihiro Yamaguchi , was one of the first brands- in the new wave of Japanese bespoke- shoemaking , which began 15-20 years ago . Tsyoshi Ohno joined there early on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just over 15 years ago . I loved shoes , and the opportunity to work with them in such a direct way attracted me , Tsyosho says . First he learned bottom making and also went as an apprentice as- that at- Guild of Crafts for some time before he started training- lastmaking as well . To the school came Yohei Shiwamura , who had learned a lot about shoemaking by himself before . When they made a shoe together , they realized that they worked well together and had a common view of shoes . They decided to join forces and start a shoe brand together . <p> Womens model that is quite characteristic of TYE . Hand welted front- with a wood pegged waist . <p> High womens boots . <p> Last work . <p> TYE Shoemaker was founded nearly seven years ago .

It has also affected the kind of shoes that TYE do , which is a very interesting mix of old , classic European style and modern fashion emphasized things with a Japanese touch . Its neat , elegant , often daring . Here in the workshop , they have only a few samples , more is at ICHO. - Tsyoshi Ohno is not particularly fond of showcasing the samples he has here , as most were made six or seven years ago and he feels he has developed a lot since then . When I see these shoes I just see all the errors I made . There is this problem with- sample shoes , that- its usually when you start- off that you have the time and opportunity to do them , but then you are often less good . Later on- you will hopefully have so much work that you have a hard time to make new samples , so the samples are n't  always making the manufacturer justice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of the finished or nearly finished shoes they have in the workshop is higher than the sample shoes ( even if they are far from bad ) , and its something I recognize from many other bespoke makers as well , especially the smaller players who quite early in their- career starts their- own brand . <p> Sample single monk shoe , one of those Tsyosho Ohno is not particularly happy with . <p> Very neat heel on this . <p> Bottom of- another shoe with a bevelled waist and a naturally colored sole . <p> Tsyoshi Ohno does the lastmaking and the bottom work , Yohei Shiwamura des the closing , the pattern making they both do . The division of labor has looked like this- right from the start , and they do everything themselves , even if Tsyoshis wife does some leather accessories for them . She has a background as a closer at among others Clematis Ginza but is now saddler of the famous bag and accessory manufacturer Ortus .

The waiting time- is about a year now , including a fitting with a test shoe . If more fittings are needed it may take a little longer . Should we take more customers the waiting times wouldve become even longer , which may not be desirable . Weve talked about taking up an apprentice , well see how it goes , Yohei Shiwamura says . They are happy that it has worked so well as it has for them. - Because the competition is fierce . There 's really too many bespoke shoemakers in Japan today . Many small and new has a tough time . Its not even certain that its enough to be really good . But for customers its an advantage , they have much to choose from and the competition means that we must always keep a good level of quality , Tsyoshi says . <p> Tools for bottom making . <p> Fittingskor tested by its customers . <p> The fact that they are located in Asakusa they experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's stimulating and practical , they can easily get hold of different shoe parts .

Fortunately Yoheis wife works as a shoe designer and is employed by several- major footwear brands that work internationally , and she is at the leather fair Lineapelle each season , so she can help them get good stuff , and they also have an agency in Asakusa they work with . A couple bespoke- shoes from TYE Shoemaker starts at around G2 700- ( 328,000 yen ) , including lasted shoe trees . In other words , they are like many others in Japan relatively well priced compared to- many in Europe . Which they work very hard for . We love shoes , this is our hobby .

It was a great atmosphere during the day , and both exhibitors , partners and visitors was very pleased . here 's a summary of the day with a lot of pictures . <p> Me ( Jesper Ingevaldsson of Shoegazing ) and Justin FitzPatrick of the Shoe Snob started talking about doing a super trunk in London about 1,5 years ago . The Shoegazing Super Trunk Show in Stockholm had been a great success , and to make an even bigger version in sort of the capital of classic shoes was something that both of us was tempted to try doing . Last fall we started working with it more properly , and its been a lot of work since then to get this done . Its always great when all efforts have been worthwhile , which really is the feeling after this weekend . <p> Around 800 visitors came during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fukudas new RTW range , which will be available through The Sabot . Pictures by me and : Milad Abedi <p> It was a steady stream of people coming into the doors of the Music Room in the middle of Mayfair , talking to each other , talking to the exhibitors , and of course looking at a lot of shoes . 11 exhibitors , Italian- Barbanera , Carlos Santos/Skoaktiebolaget , Caulaincourt , Hiro Yanagimachi , J. FitzPatrick Footwear , Norman Vilalta , Ramon Cuberta , Stefano Bemer , The Sabot ( Meccariello , Yohei Fukuda ) , - Vass- and- Yanko/Skolyx . What was great to see was that there were people at all tables- during large parts of the day . All these brands are n't  available to buy in England , and many was keen to have a closer look all these makers of fine shoes . The event was made possible thanks to our main partner- Saphir , - who showed and sold a wide range of their shoe care products at their table , and the partners- Carl Friedrik displayed their Italian made leather bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they produce . <p> Skov+rdsprodukter hos Saphir . <p> Ramon Cuberta measuring a customer . <p> Skor fr+n japanske Hiro Yanagimachi . <p> One of the highlights of the event was the first World Championship in Shoe Shining , organized in collaboration with Saphir . Three finalists had been qualified , Pete Bultitude from England , Anders Ericson from Sweden , and the Japanese Yuya Hasegawa . They had 20 minutes to polish a Loake 1880 Aldwych tan as beautiful as possible . A big crowd followed the competition , and the contestants all achieved an impressive result for having such a short time to work on the shoe . The jury consisted of me , Justin FitzPatrick , Filip Hallerfelt , Scandinavian Agent for Loake , and Marc Moura , President of Avel who makes Saphir shoe care products . After some discussions we came to the unanimous decision that the first world champion would be Yuya Hasegawa . He was very happy to win the title , shoe care products from Saphir and the Loake Aldwych pair . Yuya runs three shoe shining bars in Japan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidently has gained him some great skills . <p> To round of the day a panel discussion about the future for classic mens shows was held . In the panel were- Tony Gaziano , co-founder Gaziano &amp; Girling , Chris Than , Store Manager- Crockett &amp; Jones 69 Jermyn Street , - Sarah Nelson , co-owner A Fine Pair of Shoes . Unfortunately- Simon Crompton of Permanent Style couldnt come , so I chaired the session instead . Also at this time a large crowd followed the session , and several questions came in from the audience . It was an interesting talk , where all members of the panel had a positive view of the future for the industry , though there are challenges like the increasing leather prices . <p> Tony Gaziano , Sarah Nelson and Chris Tan during the panel discussion . <p> A lot of people in the audience . <p> What I was maybe most happy about was the fact that the super trunk became such a great meeting place for shoe people both from England and other parts of the world , both people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as with shoe nerds and just " regular " people . As an example towards the end of the day many employees from the West End bespoke shoemaking firms , freelance makers and the international exhibitors working with bespoke gathered up in the venue and had a great time talking , discussing and learning from each other . Even for the domestic bespoke shoemakers its quite rare to meet each other in larger numbers like this , and many kept on long into the night after the event in pubs and cocktail bars . Its also what most people commented on , the fact that it was such a great gathering of people , as well as of course of great shoes . We hope that the London Super Trunk Show will return . <p> For those who ca n't wait for that , the " original " super trunk show in Stockholm will be held on Saturday September 2 . Albeit a bit smaller , its also a very nice event for those into classic mens shoes . A lot more info soon .

First up is a report from my visit to Clematis Ginza , the alias for Keitaro Takano who is one of relatively few completely Japanese schooled bespoke makers . <p> Ginza is Tokyos main shopping district , where the main streets are lined with the- logos of the luxury brands on their stores window displays and where several large department store houses , and the smaller streets is packed with other stores which usually also belong to some sort of high-end segment . A bit- on the outskirts of this is Clematis Ginza has its workshop . On the second floor ( in Tokyo many shops , restaurants and other activities are one or several stories up or down ) in a building with a- yellow brick facade . You- step into the showroom with a green carpet and one side is covered with sample shoes on lighted shelves . Directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the- showroom is no larger than perhaps 40 m2 . <p> Clematis premises in the outskirts of Ginza . <p> Keitaro Takano and Chiemi Chiba in the Clematis showroom . <p> The workshop space , which they several times excused for being messy , at least according to them . <p> Keitaro Takano . <p> Chiemi Chiba . <p> Here I 'm greated- by Keitaro Takano , the man behind the brand- Clematis , and the clicker- and closer Chiemi Chiba . Keitaro doesnt- speak English , but Chiemi can decently so she translates for us . Keitaro Takano is actually one of relatively few of all the 50+ bespoke- makers- active- in Japan who are schooled in the home country . Otherwise , most received their training and passed as apprentices in England or Italy , or when the market have become- well established in Japan one- go as an apprentice there at- someone who has been in England or Italy . But Keitaro Takanos master , Nobuyoshi Seki , is one of only a few old Japanese bespoke makers . When Keitaro joined him in 2000 , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guild of Craft and maybe someone more of all of the new wave of bespoke- shoemakers in Japan- who had started up their business . I learned a lot from- Nobuyoshi Seki , both the craft course , but also to understand the soul of the shoe . At the same time it was tough , Seki was a hard person and- at least initially I was a little bit afraid . He was very strict , but the better I got , the nicer he were , Keitaro Takano says . Keitaro was a number of years at Seki , he also worked shorter periods for some of the other bespoke- shoemakers- who started to establish themselves- in Japan , before he in 2008 started up his own brand Clematis ( the name comes from a flower ) . Then he had already managed to make a bit of a name for himself , so it went quite- fast to start up a customer base . <p> Bespoke samples . <p> Gorgeous lazy mans in alligator leather . <p> Relatively classic semi brogues but with tassel laces and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clematis has his base- in the small Japanese school that has existed have made- his shoes to stick out- against many of the other European-trained colleagues in Japan . They have their own character . This- has also been a clear ambition for- Keitaro . I wanted to do something new , something of my own . Obviously the foundation is- classic models and so on , but I often try to take things in- in its own direction . I also like the interaction with the customers , how you take your own base and meet their wishes , and create something beautiful for that customer , he says . Keitaros lasts are a bit- special in shape , which reminds some of Eastern European manufacturers more elegant lasts , and the models often have sweeping curves of stitches and decorations . The soles are often different types of plant-inspired decor and the heels have- a characteristic leaf shaped piece of rubber . Its hard to put your finger on it , but the shoes really have a Japanese feel to them . And - the level of craftmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean- hand-sewn sole stitches- made with a so-called stitch prick that gives a distinct and more alive mark than a fudge wheel , and he often puts a- small channel in the edge of the sole as nice and quite unique- decoration . Its easy to understand why Clematis is highly regarded by the Japanese bespoke clients . <p> An in many ways characteristic Clematis shoe , with a classic base but with curvy pattern and a last that 's very much Clematis . <p> Beautiful bottom . <p> Close-up of the waist . <p> A heel with straight edges . <p> Relatively high spi ( stitch-per-inch ) where you can also see the decoration channel on the sole edge . <p> The first period- with Clematis Keitaro , as is often the case for Japanese bespoke shoemakers starting up , worked from a workshop in the home . He then slowly worked his way up , could move into these premises , hired Chiemi Chiba as a closer , and- just recently- also launched a Ready to Wear collection . They are made by a small Japanese firm called Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Keitaro Takano . Its shoes in the premium segment , but with a competitive price tag one have to say , which is often the case for Japanese-made shoes . They are priced- at around G650- ( about 85,000 yen ) . From February they will be sold in the Japanese department store Isetan Mens shoe department . In the workshop production Keitaro and Chiemi make about 60 pairs of shoes a year . Clematis offers two different types of orders . Semi-bespoke/Made To Measure where they make minor corrections to standard lasts , and you may choose from the standard models Clematis has , though some pattern changes can also be made . And full bespoke , which means one or more fittings with test shoes and produce a completely individual last , - and where model is entirely free to choose . Both variants can be selected to be done- with machine stitched sole stitch , - so-called 90% handmade , or completely handmade . The price for the semi-bespoke 90% handmade starting at G1300 ( 170,000 yen ) up to full bespoke that is entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Prices are excluding VAT at 11% , but international customers can deduct VAT on the spot . <p> Eventually Keitaro Takano is hoping to be able to grow with some additional employees in the workshop , while RTW shoes can hopefully sell reasonable well . I would also like to do trunk shows in Europe in the future , it would have been great to try and meet that market too . <p> A quarter brogue from the new RTW range . Note the two-colored laces which Clematis calls Blooming Laces . <p> Sligthly tapered waists . <p> Nice sole which also has the leaf-shaped rubber piece on the heel . <p> Another RTW model in shrunken calf . <p> The complete RTW range , with the models made by Joe Works on the two bottom rows , and another range with casual loafers above them which have been around for a while . At top some womens bespoke samples . <p> A better view of the womens shoes . <p> Back on the mens shoe shelf , with- different- bespoke samples . <p> Faded patina . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Pastel colored lizard leather . <p> More sample shoes . <p> Another cleaner sole treatment . <p> Clematis has n't  too many European or American clients , so when I visited he made sure to have my feet measured and let me try on some fitting shoes on his standard last . 
@@109465343 @4865343/ <h> In depth The tools importance <p> 2016-12-28 <p> Just like the fact that good machines are extremely important for shoe factories are good tools of great importance for the bespoke- shoemakers . Tools of high quality makes the work more easy , and in some cases- the tools are crucial to how well an operation can be performed . <p> All bespoke shoemakers that I 've visited over the years have always been showing some extra glow in their- eyes when they get to talk about their tools . There are often interesting stories about how they managed to get over their big favorites . The majority of the tools used by todays bespoke shoemakers are old vintage tools , inherited and sold on for decades after decades . These are usually of much better quality than new tools . Its not necessarily because you ca n't make- as good tools today , its more due to- the fact that the market has been so small that few good producers are- engaged in making new tools . Meanwhile , the demand for tools has exploded now that the interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also want to make their own shoes , both on a professional level or as a hobby . Due to this old tools can go for several hundred euros- on Ebay or other market places or forums . <p> Panel with tools of the Japanese bespoke shoemaker Eiji Murata , aka Main dOr . <p> The Swedish bespoke shoemaker- Janne Melkersson uses a plough- to remove the excess of the insole . Its also used , for example , on the top of the heel edge later on . <p> This is one of the reasons that a bespoke shoemaker- needs to have so many different tools , a- tool is in many cases limited to do something specific to a specific type of shoe . We can take an edge iron for example , such is done for a specific thickness of the midsole , as soon as you make a thinner or thicker sole you need to have another edge iron . And that the tools are of great quality are partly- important to simplify things for the shoemaker , to make his or her job easier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really good pincher- that provides full control during the lasting , when the upper is pulled over the last . Partly to make the shoemaker able to do an as good a job as possible . Again we can- take the waist iron which- Yohei Fukudas brother has made , - allowing a sharp angle and a thin edge of the- waist which is very- elegant . Its of course required a lot of the shoemaker- here too , like a tight and narrow-made blind welt at the waist , but then its this kind of tool that enables him or her to make the edge really elegant and pretty . I know a Japanese bespoke- shoemaker who bought waist irons of- Fukudas brother , he has recently started up his business and was a bit- disappointed since he already had produced his sample shoes with a different kind of waist iron- that was n't as good and did the edge as nicely . <p> The tools from Yohei Fukudas brother again , replicas of vintage- tools Yohei had , the image can be enlarged . In the picture below you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Picture : Yohei Fukuda <p> Not easy- to capture on picture , - but the waist edge is very thin , not least on the inside of the waist , partly thanks to a great waist iron . <p> Yohei Fukudas shelf with tools . <p> Sharp knives that are easy to work with is very important , here 's a Japanese shoemaking knife which is- pushed forward , used in Hiro Yanagimachis workshop . <p> A good awl that suits the shoemakers way to sew and the materials they- use facilitates the work of the stitching much . Here Daniel Wegan of Gaziano &amp; Girling stitches a welt seam- on a shoe . 
@@109465344 @4865344/ <h> Report Gaziano &amp; Girling bespoke , part 2 <p> 2015-09-23 <p> So here 's the second- part of the series about the making of a pair bespoke shoes from Gaziano &amp; Girling that I 've ordered . Now its about the process since the measuring session , when the first version of the lasts are made , the pattern has been developed and test shoes have been manufactured , which I then tried on at a first fitting . <p> Daniel Wegan , head of Gaziano &amp; Girlings- bespoke- department- where he is employed as a last- maker but he also do making in the- evenings and weekends , began by ordering a MH71- last- in UK10 F-width ( extra wide , E is the standard at G&amp;G ) in wood from their supplier Springline . It is the size I have on the- RTW shoes of the company , and although in many ways it does not fit me that well , it is of course logical to begin with it , now that its an MH71-shape I want- for my- shoes . Then Daniel according to the measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material on the last to correct its fit and do personal lasts for me . As most people know even in- full bespoke nowadays its very unusual to take a block of wood and start carving out a last- from scratch ( even if its something Daniel also can do and are doing- occasionally ) , but almost always you have a last which you start from , a base last . He then- rasp and sand them down where it needs to be removed material , and put on so-called " fitting pieces " where- leather is glued to the wood and- sanded and shaped where it needs to be built up . All the time you go back and compare to the different measurements , - outlines , and so on . <p> here 's the base lasts directly from the last factory . <p> Here Daniel has started to convert the lasts to fit me . If you start from the left you see a roughly cut out leather piece which then is glued in place , on the inside of the other last you have a leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the outside of that you have a fitting piece that is finished . <p> When the first versions of the lasts are finished Gaziano &amp; Girling make a test shoe which to a relatively large extent is- similar to the final shoe . The shoe is made in the same- model and patterns that the customer has ordered , and they are more or less made to- the same standard of construction as- all their RTW shoes , with leather heel stiffener , Goodyear welted- and so on , but with low quality leather and- some cheap rubber soles- etc . They see- the test shoes as a good opportunity for the companys bespoke- trainees- to practice- on various components , and it also gives the customer a better idea of the final result if one actually makes a test shoe- that is in many respects similar to what is- ordered . The shoes Im having made for me- is a pair of austerity brogues . I had specified some small- differences on the middle part of the wing on the vamp than how it is made on- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this pattern he discussed it with me during the process . A quite amusing- exchange of photos and descriptions were sent between us- before he got things the way- I wanted it . <p> This is the first version of the front part of the pattern that Daniel made . He had made the middle part a bit elongated compared to Connaught , but had n't  gotten the curves the way I wanted it . <p> I sent him this picture with the modification drawn out . <p> Daniel tried again <p> I corrected him again <p> and finally he got things the way I wanted it to be . <p> Daniel Wegan was part of- the Shoegazing Super Trunk Show last Saturday , and on the Friday before he visited the store- Skoaktiebolaget- who sell the brand and also acts as- agent for Gaziano &amp; Girling in Sweden , and then we took the opportunity to get the fitting done . Daniel says that he is always a bit nervous- before a first fitting session , since- he has no idea how good or bad he has interpreted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes- the fit ans so on . What is clear right away when I put on the test shoes is that they are too tight especially for the pinky- toes , where it pinches quite much . Daniel says that he usually makes it a little small- here- for the first fitting- because its easier to determine how much you should add , rather than to risk making it to big and then need to- assess how much space it- is inside the shoe , although this time it might have been a bit too small . <p> He pinches and feel at different points on the shoes , and draw with a pen in different ways to mark out what to do where . At- the same time I tell him how I experience it all , and except that- they are too tight in the front they already fit pretty well around the arch and heel , although it needs to be taken in a bit in the arch of the left shoe , and the area just behind the inner ball needs to- be trimmed- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I have some hallux valgus problem and it must not press the " bump " ) . After I 'd been wearing the shoes- and walked around in them in the store for a while , I also feel that we need to add some small fitting pieces to the- heels where I have had some problems with calluses earlier which I obviously want to avoid coming back . <p> Daniel Wegan with some nerves ahead of the first fitting session . <p> On the feet . <p> Here you can see that they are snug over the pinky toe area where it pushes out a bit . <p> Daniel pinches and feel on your feet to help determine what corrections needs to be made . It uses a shorter heel stiffener , like on RTW , than for finished bespoke shoes- to feel and see clearly how they follow the arch , and also to see how the creasing develops. - To interpret creases on the- test the shoes are part of the procedure to know what- corrections needs to be made to the fit . <p> Everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then its time for the most spectacular moment during the fitting , when Daniel cut up parts of the shoes . As I mentioned in the first post about G&amp;G bespoke Daniel tries to gather as much information as he can on each order , and although not all is used in the production of each pair he learns of it and are slowly but surely getting a larger and broader knowledge base about as many different aspects as possible . To cut holes into the shoes are made to provide an improved image of how the space looks- at- selected parts . Because when you make bespoke shoes its basically about getting as little space- as possible everywhere , without them- becoming too tight and uncomfortable , to put things short . For example , Daniel noted when he cut up the heels that- he could make- the backs of the insoles slightly- smaller , since- there was some unnecessary space there , the heel can of course still be equal only that he moves up the back of the- so-called feather edge , the lower edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to seriously begin to approach a really good fit . In order to have more space for the little toes , we talked about that he will probably add some also on the inside of the lasts , maybe- actually most there , to so to speak move my feet over to that side- and have more space- at- the outside . Then a new pair of test shoes will be made . In almost all cases he does at least two fittings , the first often means that you will find a lot that needs to be corrected , but after the second there will hopefully be just minor things that needs to be changed before the lasts- are done- and the real shoes are being manufactured . Most likely , he will only send the new test shoes to me so I can assess and provide my opinion of them , plus take pictures , which should be sufficient . Now , however , it will not be as fast between the parts , so the next and final part in this series of articles is- likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the knife . <p> Voil+ . As you can see the toe stiffener is made of celastic , which is plastic impregnated fabric . This is basically used on all factory made RTW shoes . Its the material in the heel stiffeners that differs between price and quality ranges . <p> And here they use leather heel stiffeners that are really thick ( same as for RTW as mentioned ) which are very hard to cut through . Only difference for this stiffeners that are used for RTW is that they do n't  go as far forward at the arch . <p> Time to put them on again . <p> Here you can see that the insoles goes a bit too far back at the heels , so that there is unnecessary space . <p> On the finished shoes Daniel Wegan will make reinforcement pieces in leather that goes all the way from the heel- to the toe stiffener , at least on the inside of the shoes . This will then be hollowed out at the outer ball area to give some extra relief for my hallux valgus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Still- there are relatively few in Japan and around the world who know much about him . Meet Eiji Murata , the man behind the brand Main-dOr . <p> After riding the train half an hour from central Tokyo , taken a taxi and traveled another 15 minutes , I step out on a tiny little street with low buildings , without a person as far as I can- see ( which is rare over here ) . I 'm in Chiba , part of the Greater Tokyo area but technically a separate city , located by the Tokyo Bays northeast corner . On a glass door theres- a small sign saying " Bespoke Shoemaker Main-dOr " . Here inside you find first- a reception and showroom , behind this the workshop in two parts that are actually relatively spacious for being for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style blogger Daisuke Yamashita , who kindly joined me to act as interpreter , welcome- and ask us to settle down in the brown leather chairs and sofa available in the sparsely decorated showroom , and then go to put on some Japanese tea . In a big old glass cabinet behind me stands some 15 sample shoes , some of the most delicate creations I 've ever seen . <p> Display cabinet with sample shoes . <p> A wingtip- on a last with a slightly chiseled toe . <p> Eiji Murata . <p> Eiji Murata is 42 years old and grew up here in Chiba . His father was a pattern maker at a shoe factory in the Asakusa district of Tokyo , which today houses a large- amount of mainly small manufacturers of various kinds of shoes , and even some factories . Also his big brother early on started working within the shoe industry . To talk- about shoes and care about shoes have been a natural part of my childhood , Eiji Murata says . So after school , it was natural that he sought out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no active bespoke- shoemakers- in Japan , so that wasnt- really on the map for- Eiji to- be doing . Instead , he started at The Esperanza Institute of Footwear Design and Technique , one of no less than three big- shoe design and shoemaking schools- in Tokyo , and- while studying he worked extra on a factory that manufactured womens footwear . At the school Chihiro Yamaguchi held design courses , and- over- 15 years ago he founded Guild of Crafts , one of the more well known bespoke- shoe brands- in Japan and one of the pioneers of the great revival this area has had in the country . I was very inspired by what Chihiro Yamaguchi and his colleagues did , and realized that working with handmade bespoke- shoes- also- was what I wanted to do . <p> So that- was what he took aim towards . He joined a small shoemaking education in Shinden outside of Tokyo , called Kagami Shoemaking School founded by the same Fusao Kagami who also developed a system for measuring up feet which is well known- Japan- ( which on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He learned a lot while being there , and practiced a lot on his- own . After that , about 12 years ago , he founded his brand- Main-dOr . And I was lucky , because one of my first customers was a man who was good friends with some of those who ran the Japanese mens style magazine Mens Ex . They made a small article about his order from- me , and through this I- then directly made a customer base , Eiji Murata says . <p> The article in Mens Ex , who helped in the start of the Main-dOr . <p> Fantastic fiddle waist . <p> Midbrown semi brogue in profile . <p> Ever since then , 12 years ago , the shoemaking- itself has only been a part of his employment . Around the same time he also started teaching at the school where he started , at Esperanza , where he held technical courses . Some periods there have been more teaching , some a little less , today he teaches- one-two days a week . <p> When it comes to- Main-dOr Eiji Murata @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fitting shoes , closing , making , finishing everything . Even in Japan , where bespoke- brands- often are smaller operations than in Europe , at least the closing is- done by a specialist . A- lot has to do with the fact that I want to have control over the entire process . But yes , closing- is the part that I still am a little nervous about when doing , Eiji Murata says . He always makes two pairs of fitting shoes- for all customers . Both are hand welted- and made as the final shoe up to the sole and heel , which are only glued on , since- that part really does n't  affect how the shoes are perceived fit-wise . First test shoe is a little simpler , and tested only a little shorter at spot , so Eiji can see how they fit and get feedback from the customer . The second fitting shoe- have a proper sole and heel , and are sent to the customer who wears them for a time to really get an idea of the fit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second review of the fit . Then the final pair is produced . And the delivery time is very long , it takes about six months between each fitting and the final pair to be made . So 18 months in total . Cause- the- production is very small , both because he always does two fittings and that he works as part-time teachers , but also since- he puts a lot of time on each order . A total of somewhere around 150 hours , with all the steps included , making the starting price of about G2 600- ( 290 000 yen ) may be regarded as quite reasonable . Previously it was only Japanese customers , nowadays some are- international , about 20% . He only makes about 15 pairs a year . <p> This is how- the first test- shoes looks , with a simple- sole and a simple version of the pattern commissioned made- without any brogueing etc . <p> The second fitting shoe- is more properly done in the same leather ( but poorer parts ) and- exactly- the pattern ordered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both fitting shoes- are hand welted to be accurate in how the fit is experienced , but the outsole is just- cemented . <p> Eiji Murata in the workshop . <p> I saw a pair of shoes from Main-dOr for the first time a few years ago , - on picture in- a topic on Japanese shoes StyleForum . I was immediately fascinated . What struck me first was the elegant lasts- and the shine , both on the shoe and the soles , then I looked closer and saw the extremely high level it seemed to be on the craftmanship . I have since tried to find as much pictures and info as possible of the brand- and Eiji Murata , and although some- appeared every now and then , as at for example the- Japanese style site Boq and in some other contexts , its surprisingly little one can- find . One explanation is that he does not have its own website or are active in any social media at all . Firstly , I 'm very bad at modern technology , old craft is more my thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for that , Eiji says . As I now stand here in Chiba opening the door to the display cabinet , the shoes really are as amazing as they are perceived in pictures , or even better . There 's a very high level of the finish of the details , the shoes are perceived as almost zealously made , with heavily built-up- waists , in some cases hand-sewn sole stitches at 18 spi ( stitches per inch ) , and sophisticated details like how- upper part of the heel is elevated and surrounds the upper . The style is not old classic British , such as Marquess , or Italian like- Spigola , or Japanese as Clematis . If anything , they are more British in a way , but I think they have their- own character , their- own style . And Eiji Muratas shoes are those that makes you more impressed the more you look , instead of the opposite which otherwise can often be the case , that they look great at first glance but the more you look the more flaws you discover . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Several of sample shoes . <p> Different stitch density on the sole stitch . 18 spi , 16 spi , 14- spi . <p> Close-up on the elevated top heel- and marked transition from the waist . <p> Eiji Murata shows us the workshop in the back with several different workplaces depending on the manufacturing operations . Its neat and organized , as often in Japanese workshops , only the desk where he makes the design can be classified as a bit messy . He has been here for a couple of- years , and appreciate- the relatively large space . Previously- he had the workshop in his home in Tokyo , which was much smaller and more cramped . Now he has moved out to- Chiba again , within walking distance to the workshop . Eiji is perceived as one of the most dedicated people Ive met in the shoe business , one that truly lives to make shoes . He sees it as a privilege to be working with the best thing he knows , and have no problem to spend- a huge amount of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven days a week . Just on some holidays , he is- off . I ask if he has n't  thought about stop- teaching , and focus completely on the shoemaking . Well , sure , making shoes is my passion , its what I love . With teaching- I feel that I have a responsibility . A responsibility to spread the knwoledge- I had the opportunity to learn , make sure that the craftsmanship will live on , live on in the right way . As mentioned , for Eiji Muratas shoes more than just a profession . <p> Lovely with contrasting sole stitch . <p> here 's a bevelled waist with full black piano gloss finish . <p> From another angle . <p> Workbench for lasting and making . <p> Panel with tools . <p> Pliers . <p> Lasts . <p> Material . <p> Uppers waiting to be lasted .

@@109465346 @4865346/ <h> Review Orbans Oxford Soho Dark brown <p> 2017-02-19 <p> The French brand Orbans is an interesting new actor with a some nice- lasts and models and a low price tag of $150 it has- made a big impressions since it launched 1,5 years ago . And in my eyes Orbans is one of the most affordable brands in the market for classic quality shoes today . Why its like that I go through in this review . <p> Behind Orbans is Marcos Fernandez Cabezas , a well-known name in the industry . He has a background as a designer and in the management of- the French classic shoe brands- Bowen and Emling , and has since started- Markowski as well as- Septieme Largeur , both now well-established and reputable brands in their respective domain . Its just Septieme Largeur whose shoes are located in the upper part of the budget segment that he is still working with of the ones above , and last fall he started as a new venture with a brand in the lower budget segment . Main competitors on the domestic market- is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world- its probably- mostly- with Meermin they are being compared . The shoes are manufactured in Spain in the shoe region Almansa , and all shoes are Goodyear welted except a few Blake stitched- loafers . They also have a- small womens collection of Goodyear welted models . The fact that- an experienced man as Marcos Fernandez is involved in Orbans makes it likely that it will be a brand- to reckon with . <p> Clean black adelaide . <p> Order method Orbans is , - like Septieme Largeur , only sold directly to customers , through their- own store in the eastern part of central Paris and through their- online store , available in French and English . The direct to customer approach makes the brand a little less available , particularly in terms of physical stores , but allows them- to keep prices down . The selection of models is quite large and consists almost exclusively of the quite classic models , almost all at least in a couple of different leather choices and some are in addition made on two different lasts- and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main lasts , - the classic round 544 and 944 which is elongated with a- more pointed toe , for boots the main last is 584 last- which is a bit of a mix of the two shoe lasts . <p> Orbans models with rubber sole , this is a custom variant , where the sole and heel stuck together in one . Perhaps not the most elegant , but they should be extremely comfortable . <p> And its especially the prices that made many look curiously at the newcomer Orbans . Low shoes costs G 150 , boots G 175 , the Blake stitched loafer models is between $90-125 . Shipping- international costs G 19 . The website is functional and contains all the necessary basic information about the products , size guide , etc. , but its nothing special . Unfortunately the product images are a bit lackluster and does n't  make the shoes justice . In some cases , however , they have a picture of the shoe in a different environment than the studio and they are often better . <p> Orbans version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoes <p> Oxford Soho is as the name suggests an oxford with an adelaide pattern , a bit more discreet with just one row of small holes and without a medallion . Six pairs of eyelets . They are made on the 944 last , which has a relatively pointed toe , dark brown in full grain leather . Single leather sole with open channel . They are delivered in a brown shoe box with a polish loth . <p> Quite dainty and elegant shoes . <p> As apparent the toe is quite long and pointed . <p> Like many French brands Orbans are sometimes using six pairs of eyelets . <p> Construction and materials <p> To be shoes for $150- its- good specifications Orbans shoes have . The smooth leather used is from the renowned French tanneries Du Puy and Annonay , the suede- is from British Charles F. Stead . Of course , relatively much of the hides are used when it comes to shoes in this price range , but my pairs leather absolutely have a good level of quality , in terms of the price- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they- saved on is the finishing part with burnishing , shoe polish , etc. , they are not treated much at all , so its recommended to polish them with a few coats of cream and perhaps- polish when they are new . They are Goodyear welted , with an open channel in the sole and a single leather sole . They are well balanced . Since Ive only used the shoes about 10 times this far , and several of them inside during days at the office , its difficult to say much about the durability of the sole , but most of the leather soles of shoes for- less than G300 , sometimes significantly more than that , is not overly tough , and this probably applies also for Orbans . <p> Clean leather soles with open channel . <p> Simple and clean , but well accomplished . <p> A pair of pictures of what the shoes look like today after about 10 wears . <p> Another " action-image . " <p> Toe and heel stiffeners are as usual on cheaper shoes in celastic ( plastic impregnated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the outer toe box so some creases will end up inside the cap , nothing wrong at all but know some some reason is a little sensitive for this . The shoes are simply made without significant features , square waist , straight sole edges without fudge wheel , no heel decoration , etc . The sole is totally clean. - Things are , however , well made . Sure , you can find some small errors- here and there , but nothing major , the shoes are stable and well-made . Its not a bad approach Orbans have- where they remove all unnecessary extras to reduce production time and thus the cost , using good- materials and build a good , really affordable- quality shoe . <p> Fit <p> The 944 last is one of the two main shoe lasts- Orbans use , a reasonably stylish last with an elongated toe . Maybe a bit- too long and pointy for some , its a matter of taste . The fit is relatively True to Size , maybe slightly on the small side . I have the size UK10,5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loake Capital , which is a big last , in size UK10 . The instep is normal , arch support- okay for RTW , heel fit at least for me just fine and keeps the foot nicely in place . <p> The 944 last is elongated and elegant , but fairly standard fit-wise . <p> Size UK10,5 fits , for a RTW shoe , relatively well on my feet . <p> Close-up . <p> What is nice is that Orbans shoes are relatively comfortable right from the start , which is not always the case with cheaper Goodyear welted shoes . The sole is not too hard , and after a few days the uppers softened nicely . To breakt these shoes in went for me actually faster than what most factory-made Goodyear welted shoes do , even though it has celastic heel stiffenerswhich my sensitive heels otherwise quite often have problems with . <p> Summary <p> Getting Goodyear welted shoes of the caliber that Orbans , which are manufactured in Europe , for $150 is quite- impressive . Thanks to the straight-made shoes with no frills , good cooperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the customer business model , Orbans has succeeded . No one can perform miracles , add two to three times as much , you- likely will get better shoes , but this is clearly some- of the most bang for the buck you get- on the shoe market today .

The story of these and pictures of several of them in todays post . <p> The quality of factory-made shoes was very high around 1900 , and many of the most skilled craftsmen worked for the factories , either as employees or freelance . Crockett &amp; Jones factory was one of the big- ones also at that time , and ahead- of a major international craftsmanship exhibition in Turin , Italy , 1911 , they decided to make an effort to showcase its level . A small series of shoes made by hand , with the best leather they could get ( at this time , quality of material was generally much better than it is today ) , made by- their best at the various moments . In other words , they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but showed what they were capable of . <p> The sole on the shoe above . <p> Most of the shoes made for the exhibition stand on the shelves in the showroom located in the factory building in Northampton .

It was awarded first prize in one of the exhibitions competition classes . Those who impressed me most though were a pair of classic classic oxford shoes with small details like rounded gimping and wider spacing between seams etc . The handmade sole stitches are tight and very neatly made , waist and heel clinically performed , and so on .

@@109465348 @4865348/ <h> In depth Disassembly of shoes <p> 2016-08-28 <p> Continuing on the theme of what distinguishes shoes in different price ranges , this time in a proper in-depth manner . Together with the shoemakers and cobblers at Skomakeri Fram+t in Stockholm- shoes from Loake , Carmina and Paolo Scafora have been taken apart completely to the smallest detail to look at how and what they are made of . <p> The shoes in question are donated by the reader Anders Nordqvist just for this purpose . These are a pair of- Loake 1880 double munk shoes- which costs about G310 , a pair of Carmina plain cap toe oxfords located at around- G390 , and a pair of penny loafers from Paolo Scafora for about G850 . The first two are Goodyear welted , the latter- hand welted- with a machine made- sole stitch . All are very well used- and- worn . Below they are picked apart piece by piece , and I describe in the captions what we see . The idea was that I would have sawn the other shoe of each pair in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , hopefully its enough image material ( unfortunately the picture quality is lower than normal , since- I had computer problem and just had the- low-resolution copies of the photos left ) below to provide a good understanding of the different shoe construction anyway . <p> +sa Rasmussen , bespoke shoemaker and cobbler , and the other owner of the place . <p> We begin with a look at the shoes to be disassembled ( here thus the sibling to those Skomakeri Fram+t took care of ) . From the left : Loake 1880 , Carmina , Paolo Scafora . Reservations for the fact that the brands could have made changes in the choice of material and production since these shoes were made , in any direction , since they are all a few years old . <p> As apparent here , the Loake and Carmina shoes were very worn . The Scafora pair has also been used a lot , but was in a bit- better condition . All shoes have uppers made in full grain calf leather . <p> Note that the upper on the Carmina shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cracked in the creasing . <p> The shoes from Loake and Carmina had both replaced heels- and equipped with a rubber topy . For- your info , Loake use an open channel sole , Carmina as Scafora to the right have soles with a closed channel . <p> Here the heel of the Loake shoe- has been pulled off . As you can see the sole stitch goes- just back to where the heel starts , a so-called 270- sole stitch ( 360 - if it goes all the way around ) , and then the heel is only secured with nails . Those who stand out have been hammered in from the inside , those where you only see the nail head is hammered- in from underneath . Since the sole part under the heel has n't  been sanded the glue did n't  stick too hard , so it was pretty easy to pull off . <p> The base of the heel on the Carmina shoe . Carminas shoe had less- nails and more glue than the Loake shoe . <p> The Scafora heel on its way off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paolo Scafora . Here you can see that Loake shoe in- the heel area is smoother und non-sanded , while the other two shoes have sanded the soles here , which facilitated the good adhesion of the heel . <p> Rubber foam under the sock liner of the Loake shoe . <p> Carmina instead use a material called poron , a relatively expensive material which is pretty good and that will mimic a foot pad in how it falters . <p> Paolo Scafora has a bit- smaller , thinner piece of rubber foam , which was covered with a thicker leather- sock liner . <p> Loakes heel and lining sock with cushioning . Loake had leather upper and lower parts- of the heel base , but had saved money by using leather board- ( leather dust pressed together with glue ) in the heel lifts in the middle . Heel lifts in leather board- is n't as good as leather , and when it is built of different materials it come off easier and the pieced wear different with time . <p> Put in a- picture of the non-dissected- Loake shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two leather board lifts- in the middle . <p> Carmina had leather throughout the whole heel , which is positive . <p> Here you can see how much better it looks with a heel in all leather , even if this also is very worn . <p> Paolo Scafora also used the only leather lifts in its heel . <p> Time to break further into the shoes . <p> Here you can see how the nail from the inside and outside meet . Also the upper- is usually nailed to the insole- in the heel area on RTW shoes . These are Paolo Scaforas shoes , and here it is possible that they hit the nail by hand , otherwise machines are used for this in the larger factories- . <p> The shank- on the Loake shoe . Factory-made shoes usually use a form of complete package for the strengthening of the waist , with a shank-support in metal , plastic or wood thats- embedded in leather or like here in a cardboard materials , and- the whole piece is fitted in a simple manner . The- cardboard is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A thick layer of cork paste is used to fill the cavity that becomes due to the gemming , which is the- canvas strip that is glued to the insole and to which the Goodyear- welt- stitching is sewn . Its a mixture of cork and glue- which is- smeared over the surface to be covered . <p> Although Carmina use a similar type of shank support in the waist , with the metal embedded in the cardboard on one side and on the other side leather board . Here you can also see some of the relatively tight- sole stitch that- remains on the welt . All shoes here have machine made sole stitches , made with a- Rapid machine as its also called , which makes- so-called lock-stitch where every stitch is locked separately . It reduces the risk that the entire seam comes loose- even if , for example , you grind down the front of the toe or something like that . <p> The cork filling on- Carmina . Just like with Loake a thick layer of cork paste . <p> Paolo Scaforas shoes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shoe is significantly less since you stitch the welt seam- directly into the insole in a carved out holdfast , you do n't  use a build-up like the canvas rib . Scafora is using a thinner cork plate cut out to fit into the hollow space that is here . A hand welted- shoe becomes more compact , and often feels- more flexible and easier to- break in . <p> Scaforas cork was a pretty rough variant , more common is to use a tighter cork like- this plate that Skomakeri Fram+t- has in their shoes . <p> An overview of the shoes when the outsole had come off . You do n't  see it too good- here , but Scafora also had a metall shank , but a clean one fitted alone , so to speak . One thing that Carina and +sa noted was that Carmina sewn the sole stitch into the welt stitching- at the shoes toe and broke the welt- seam there . Carmina had drenched thread- quite- firmly in adhesives , however , so- despite this and that there are chain stitch it still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Time to pull off the welts . When sewing a welt seam- with a Goodyear machine its making- a so called chain stitch . A major disadvantage of such is that it does not lock each stitch individually , so if it comes looset somewhere there is a risk that the entire seam fails . Carina Eneroth calls it potato bag-stitching , here she does it similar as- when you open such a bag , taking hold of a part of the thread and pull so everything opens easily . Loake and also Carmina had left metal rivets from the lasting , when the upper is fastened to the insole before stitched to the insole , the disadvantage of this is that a cobbler can ruin the tools in the event of a repair . <p> When hand welting you- lock each stitch individually , so here they have to cut off the stitches- to get it to release . <p> Loakes welt and seam . All manufacturers use proper welts made of leather . <p> Carina and +sa felt that Loakes thread for the welt stitching was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thread was- almost only- fiber , a loose and pretty bad- thread . <p> Paolo Scafora is using linen thread that was nicely- twisted , however , it was quite a little wax so- it- was quite easily untwisted . <p> Loakes uppers . Here they had made the lining- in two pieces , and then sewed it- together in- the middle where they- stitched right through the upper leather as well . This is quite unusual , probably done since its quicker to do so , but decreases the flexibility of the vamp- during lasting . <p> Loakes relatively thin insole , its leather , but only a few millimeters thick. - You can also see how- high the edge becomes when using the canvas rib for the- Goodyear construction . <p> Carminas lining leather is made of more parts than Loake and Paolo Scaforas , but here they have as- recommended stitched the whole lining separately and then closed it- together with the upper . <p> The Scafora shoe town apart . <p> The shoes lining was sewn in principle in a single large part , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left quite a lot of the upper left at the bottom edge . <p> Overview of the insoles , from left : Loake , Carmina , Paolo Scafora . Loakes as mentioned- very thin , approximately 2 mm , Carminas slightly thicker but still relatively thin , about 3 mm , while Scafora with the hand welted construction where you sew- in the insole i using a thick leather insole of good quality , about 4-5 mm . Carmina and Scafora definitely had vegetable tanned soles , Loake they were a bit unsure of and did n't  to say for certain. - Looks like- chrome tanned , but when they burned- the sole it did n't  react the way- chrome-tanned leather usually do , but possibly- its- combination of vegetable and chrome tanned . Carmina had much left of the grain , the top part of the leather , so to speak , which is not to be recommended for an insole- since it can crack , which is evident here . <p> The upper opened up , here you see the- heel stiffener- on Loakes shoe is made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is fabric is soaked in plastic , and when heated it becomes soft and malleable , and then solidifies . Cheap and easy in production . The big downside of the material is that it is does n't  mold to the feet- more than very limited , therefore , the stiffener must fit ones feet pretty well for it to be really comfortable . Its quite- sustainable , but if thermoplastic is cracked , you cant do anything , then its destroyed . <p> Also the toe stiffener- is made of celastic . A toe stiffener- doesnt- need not conform the same way as a heel , and therefore it is not something that goes out over the function in the same way . Virtually all factory-made shoes from Loake up to Gaziano &amp; Girling Deco or Edward Green Top Drawer uses celastic- toe stiffeners . <p> Carmina uses leather board for the heel stiffener . Its a little more difficult to work with than celastic since- it must be pre-shaped , - and also a bit less durable ( therefore particularly important to use shoehorn with shoes with- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it can conform a bit to the- wearers feet , thus providing better conditions for a good fit in the heel . Here I 've actually been told by a retailer- of Carmina that they were- using celastic for the heel stiffeners , this was not the case at least when this shoe was produced , and have a hard time thinking they changed it for the worse . <p> Toe stiffener of celastic on Carmina , which as mentioned above is standard . <p> All the shoes are firmly reinforced between the linings and uppers . This is primarily done with different reinforcements tape- and textile- glued on , but also- with leather reinforcements in some cases , though- not on Loake or- Carmina . The aim is to help the shoe to retain its shape even after long use . Would a shoe just having the upper and the lining leather , it would likely be more- flimsy , stretch much and lose its- shape easier with time . Depending on how the leather is and how you want the shoe to stretch one can use different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , so it becomes rigid lengthwise but gives a little stretch sideways . Textile fabric also helps to reduce creasing on the uppers , - since it- strengthens- the leather . I know that Ive previously thought that the use of textile was slightly negative , but in recent years I 've learned that this is not the case . <p> Paolo Scaforas shoes are also in this area built a bit- more like traditional bespoke shoes than factory-made shoes , with real leather stiffeners- not only in the heel , but also in the toe . Really- impressive one have to say . Leather stiffeners- molds to the wearer , and may indeed be a little more sensitive than the plastic ones but if a leather stiffener- is bent or deformed , you can just soak it all and shape it right back ( preferably on the original last ) , leather is a living material , unlike thermoplastic and leather board . Leather stiffeners- must be installed entirely by hand and requires hand lasting of the upper. - Here you can also see that Scafora strengthened not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides . <p> We end with overview pictures of the disassembled shoes and its parts . Here Loakes shoe . The order of the sections were a bit strange , it was late in the evening- and a little stressful , but the sole furthest to the left- is- the insole , the right one the outsole . <p> Another angle . <p> Loakes shank is clear from rust . <p> Heel parts and outsole . <p> The Carmina shoe parts . <p> Here you see to the left of the half-hearted thread used for stitching the welt . <p> <p> Worth noting is that the metal shank had rusted . <p> So finally an overview of the parts that been the Paolo Scafora shoe . Also here the insole is to the left of the two soles . The two pieces of leather on each side of the vamp is the reinforcement pieces who were placed on the sides of the shoe , made of the same material as the vamp , only bad pieces of it . <p> Another angle . <p> Its the welt seam that remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Welt and shank . <p> The upper part of the outsole is what 's shown here . <p> The leather stiffeners- on Scafora-shoes are soaked in a sort of leather reinforcing paste- that goes into the leather and makes it hard and stable , and also attaches it to the upper and lining . <p> To make a quick summary when it comes to these three pairs , its quite clear that you get what you pay for . There was really nothing that seriously surprised Carina , +sa or- me , when taking into account- our previous knowledge about the brands and what they cost . There were some small surprises , like the fact that Carmina had leather board heel stiffeners , mostly because I heard different though , because its quite reasonable in terms of the price range . That Scafora had toe stiffeners in- leather surprised a bit as well , had thought they would use celastic . But otherwise they- were done- generally in the way you would expect . In a way Paolo Scafora , being hand welted in a very small factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most are Goodyear welted , and hence in some ways more similar to Loake and Carmina , but- things like thicker insoles ( than cheaper Goodyear welted shoes at least ) - and leather heel stiffeners youll- find on most of those shoes as well . <p> Many thanks to Anders Nordqvist who donated his shoes for- this , and Carina Eneroth and +sa Rasmussen at Skomakeri Fram+t who spent a number of hours of work to fight the shoes apart and go through what they found . Well see if there are more shoes from other manufacturers disassembled- in the future . <h> 7 comments <p> " Carmina had much left of the grain , the top part of the leather , so to speak , which is not to be recommended for an insole since it can crack , which is evident here . " <p> Excellent article ! ! . What do you mean here ? . The insole leather is not good quality ? . Just one of my pairs of such a brand has the insole slighty cracked after several years of wear . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be interesting to know Carmina-s insoles supplier . Thanks and congrats ! ! . <p> Rafael : Thanks for the kind words ! On an insole you should sand off the top layer , the grain , since its more sensitive and prone to cracking . The insole leather can be fine , but if you do n't  sand down the top layer it can crack anyway . It could be that the insole manufacturer did a poor job on just some insoles like these , and sand off more on most of what they produce . You can see that the top grain is left due to the slight shine of the top of the insole . I do n't  know who they buy their insoles from . <p> Thanks for your reply and solution for the issue . Is it possible that the insole of Carmina comes with a front sockliner ? . It seems that from the pics . I am asking you this because I think all the models I own from them ( some of them more than 10 years old and with extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1/4 or 2/4 ) . I have just one pair with a slightly cracked insole where it bends and I will sand down a bit that area . Cheers <p> Rafeael : I did n't  mean that you should do it , it should be made in the manufacturing process ( although I guess it might be possible to sand it down a bit yourself afterwards as well ) . The sock liner is removed , its only at the back part , you see it in the pics above . <p> Great article . Well done . Maybe the summary could have drawn out more conclusions regarding the durability , merits or otherwise of the two constructions compared . All three pairs seem to be heavily worn judging by the condition of the uppers and in all cases I guess that it could be said that both construction methods have provided sufficient durability given the life of the upper leather . I would really have been interested to see a Blake rapid construction included .

@@109465350 @4865350/ <p> A pic from the newly opened factory in 1934 , with Eugene and his wife Madeleine Heschung in the middle . Picture : Heschung <p> Heschung is just like several other major French brands good at retaining its history and quality level , but at the same time- flirt- towards- a more fashion-oriented clientele and have a design and communication that " ordinary people " appreciate , not only shoe nerds . Its a bit- fascinating to see how for example Heschung , Bowen , John Lobb Paris , Berluti and others in France are all capable of pulling off this balancing act , while other countries brands , where the Churchs/Prada combo is a good example- ( outside Italy that is ) , have a much harder time to succeed with this . <p> Ordering <p> Its of course in France where the brand has its main market , but they also have distributors in many other places around the world , and several prestigious stores such as United Arrows in Tokyo , Barneys in New York and Wilkes Bashford in San Francisco sell- Heschung .

The difference from a Goodyear- welted shoe- is that these here you fold the welt outwards , you turn it around , revers it , and sew what corresponds to the welt seam so it becomes visible from the outside- instead of hidden under the inside of the shoe . The seam still performs the same function as a welt stitch , namely holding together the welt , the upper and the insole , but its made on the side of the shoe instead of the inside . The picture below explains it a bit further : <p> Reverse welt illustration from a Japanese book . <p> There is a bit of a jungle what the difference is between Reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so on , different manufacturers sometimes call the same thing different names , but generally all of the above are built on the same principle where the major- difference is if you- use a welt- or fold out the- upper leather . One advantage of the reverse welt , and likely the reason why Heschung choose it on their sturdier- models ( they also make shoes with Goodyear welt- and lighter versions with blake construction ) is that you get less material to be jammed- together under the shoe at the edge , allowing you to make a double soled- shoe that will be a bit more flexible and softer than a- welted one . <p> Close-up of the reverse welt , where you also can see how the leather fibres goes along the shoe if you look closely . <p> The heel is made in the same piece of rubber as the sole , a bit like an EVA sole , which has its pros and cons . <p> Close-up of the sole . <p> The aniline coloured leather is from the local tannery Haas mentioned above ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is less processed than many other calf leather which gives it a bit more rustic feel that fits well with this type of shoe .

The shoes are solidly built , although it is not exactly a lot of- finesse , but its probably not quite what you 're looking for if you buy one of these models anyway . Heschungs own rubber sole provides good grip even when wet , snowy or icy . The color of it quickly became little pale- however , like pale gray-brown or something , and since its so thick it affects- the look a bit , I think . <p> Fit <p> Given the thick- double- rubber sole I was prepared for a really tough shoe that would require many hours before- were worn in properly .

What I like most ( you did n't  mention it ) is the very comfortable shoe tongue which is made like a cushion and not just an ordinary single piece of leather .

I look forward to another 7 years from them at least ? Just waiting anxiously to see how good they will look after some renovation at the Heschung factory . 
@@109465351 @4865351/ <h> Picture special Comparison between Yohei Fukuda and Marquess <p> 2016-09-25 <p> Yohei Fukuda and Marquess/Shoji Kawaguchi are two of the most well renowned bespoke shoemakers in Japan ( and in the world , for that matter ) , who have a lot of similarities between them . here 's a nerdy but hopefully interesting comparison between them and their versions of a faux full brogue . <p> The pair from Yohei Fukuda are mine , and the Marquess pair belongs to Stefan Ravnanger who works at Skomaker Dagestad in Oslo . We often see these close-ups etc on new shoes , not that often on used ones , which in my opinion adds an extra dimension ( after all this is how the shoes look IRL , they are only new once ) . Yohei and Shoji They both have trained in England , they have a thing for English shoes from the first half of the 1900s , and they have a very high quality in the making . They are also good friends . <p> Stefan and I have very similar feet ( mine are just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relevant . Both are faux full brogues , both chiseled toes , my Yohei Fukudas in a burgundy aniline calf ( do n't  remember if its vintage Ilcea or Zonta , we were discussing both ) , the Marquess are in dark brown vintage Freudenberg calf . Of course some has do with our different feet and the specifications , and they can do stuff very differently from here , but overall both Stefan and I have used the house style specs , so to speak . Below some thoughts , facts and some very subjective comments . <p> From this angle the last shapes are very similar . Marquess to the left , Fukuda to the right . Also in the profile view seen on top their quite alike . <p> Quite sharp chisel on the sides on both shoes . <p> From this angle the lasts are more different . Marquess to the left- has a longer and wider toe , while the Fukudas are more angled inwards a bit more narrow toe . They could maybe be a couple of millimeters longer IMO , but overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you see one of the more obvious differences , the fact that Marquess ( now to the right ) has a seamless heel and hence makes his faux full brogue in two pieces of leather , while Yohei has a back seam and makes the model with three leather pieces . The heel shapes are very similar , they are quite straight on the in- and outside while they tapper at the back ( see next pic ) . Marquess heel is slightly narrower though , mainly due to the fact that he cuts the heel extremely close , closest I 've ever seen . The Fukudas are very tightly cut as well , but the Marquess another mm or so even tighter . <p> Pattern wise Yoheis back counter goes a little bit higher and shorter . The closing is phenomenal on both shoes . Marquess has a bit thinner heel lifts , but the shape of the heels are as mentioned above very similar . <p> Shoji/Marquess ( now to the left again ) has a tighter trimmed sole edge , and also a bit higher SPI of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 on Yoheis shoe . Note that Yohei does 12 spi as well , you usually choose between 10 and 12 ) . I think Yoheis welt is a bit cleaner executed though , maybe a bit due to the fact that its wider and a bit easier to work with . it looks more distinct in its shapes . This is Yoheis medium sole edge , one can choose to trim it tighter or have it wider , more Italian styled . <p> So , a look at the underside . Both shoes have very slim waists . Yohei ( to the left ) has a bit more curved and shorter inside of the waist shape ( Stefans and mine heel to ball length are very similar , so this is directly comparable ) . Both use quite small rubber top pieces , that are very angled ( too much angled for me at least , I wear down the leather on the inside of the rubber piece quite a lot ) . Both have sunken lulu metal toe plates . <p> Marquess ( to the right ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bevelled and a fiddle waist . Both waists are blind welted , and on the inside they are very thin towards the edge . The shoes from Yohei even more so , its hard to capture on picture but its very thin out towards the inside waist edge . <p> Both makers use a braided reinforcement stitch at the bottom of the lacing opening . Old school stuff , not necessarily any improvement functional wise , but it adds a bit extra touch to things . The leather on Yoheis shoes is nice , but have to say that the vintage Freudenberg really is something extra , so supple and rich . <p> here 's an interesting feature on the Marquess shoe to the right , where you can see how it has an unlined tongue which is skived very thin towards the edges . Super clean work . 
@@109465352 @4865352/ <h> Report from the Shoegazing Super Trunk Show 2016 <p> 2016-09-15 <p> Amazingly enough the interest continues to be- huge- for the super trunk , this was obvious this- Saturday when the third edition was held at Scandic Anglais in Stockholm . 900 visitors , 170 pairs of shoes were sold or ordered for a value of approximately G63 000 , and then usually a bunch of orders are placed the coming weeks now- afterwards as well , and there was a- number of briefcases , accessories and shoe care products to add to that . Here is a summary of the day with lots of pictures and also films from the scene- programme . <p> The number of visitors was as large as last year , while there was few- more pairs of shoes sold but at a bit- lower value . When we saw that the onslaught was great during the day one began to dream to reach the symbolicly big 1000 visitors , but its obviously difficult to be disappointed- with 900 . The feedback we have received has almost exclusively been positive as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , input we organizers appreciate greatly . We were once again back in the part of Stockholm that 's called +stermalm , like the first year , and in many ways its an ideal location with many other interesting shoe shops and menswear stores- nearby , which many who had travelled- took the opportunity to also visit during the day . The premises were more or less the same size as last year , but we had placed the scene directly outside the exhibition hall this time and more as part of the bar and lounge area , which felt just right , it was a good number- people in the audience- at all scene happenings . <p> 900 people came to the event <p> and had a closer look at hundreds of shoes . Pictures in the article taken by me and Milad Abedi . <p> Once again we started with a- VIP opening for 150 pre-registered visitors , in order to spread out the visitors a bit , and although it was very busy and pretty hot in the exhibition hall of perhaps a couple of hours after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like it worked out pretty well throughout the day . Popular- Meermin had three people this year , which enabled them to serve visitors even better than before , although there still were a long line at some points it seem managable . They had a very large number of shoes with them , including some of its ongoing group-MTO models , and- as usual they sold very well . The other major visitor agnet- is the Hungarian brand- Vass , , whose completely handmade shoes have become very popular in Sweden , partly thanks to the super trunk that provides an excellent opportunity to try out ones- size in their different lasts , and maybe even find what your after on site . Vass showed , among other things , a new shade of the mottled museum calf leather , medium brown walnut , which many visitors were really positive about . <p> A bit extra- exciting was the fact that we had- Roberto Ugolini- in place , who has made the two of Vass- most popular lasts- U and F. The- kinship with especially the U last- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had with them , and most of the models were very- Italian with wider sole edges and often quite daring model variants.Skolyx showed a large amount- of models from the Spanish brand Yanko , and had a little more structured testing with numbers and so on . There were many of you visitors who were happy to see and try Yanko , and a lot of shoes were sold during the day . The shoes from Japanese- Hiro Yanagimachi- - was probably the most impressive ones for the visitors , with its extremely high level of craftmanship . Among other things , there were several Swedish- cobblers- who said it was the finest shoes theyve ever seen .

They have over the years been at the forefront in many areas regarding- classic shoes and have had a great significance for the fact that Japan today is the country that drives the development of the industry . <p> On a visit to Japan in general , and Tokyo in particular , you can see a lot of domestic brands and stores of course , but its also very internationalized where the giants from the West can be seen everywhere , and also- smaller brand of all kinds are easier to find in- Tokyo than in many European capitals . Its also the fact- when it comes to classic shoes , but this was very different just a few decades ago . 1979 Keiichi Fukada was the first in Japan to import European quality shoes . First he only had an agent business , but in 1991 he opened the World Footwear Gallery , WFG , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store is still housed , although they have expanded several times since then . Back then- the retail space was- very small , and the shoes were sparsely exhibited on display , a bit like in an art gallery , hence the name .

In the 90s they also started selling Japanese shoes , and so it has slowly grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jingumae today is on two floors with more than 250 models from over 20 different manufacturers . It also offers womens shoes , and upstairs one find workshops of FG Trente who runs the- brand Floriwonne , a patina artist which has its own shoe range- and also collaborates with for example Ann Bespoke , plus Seiji McCarthy who this- year started up his bespoke shoe- business . To provide workshop space to new actors have been done for many years , - for example- as Hiro Yanagimachi sat here the first few years after he started in 1999 . For them its great to have our store as an- arena , and it also an added value for us and our customers . A win-win , Fukada says . They also regularly host trunk shows with other bespoke shoemakers and craftsmen , mainly- domestic ones . <p> Since the start of this millenium- the interest in classic shoes has exploded in Japan . Isetan has opened its giant shoe department , many other stores are established , and new bespoke shoemakers pop up- all the time . Also for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the large main store , they have two smaller stores in Ginza and Koicho . Head of all the stores are Ryosuke Hidaka , a man with a huge amount of knowledge about shoes , it feels like you could sit and talk shoes for weeks with him without getting tired . Of course- we want to make money , but- the main thing will always be that- we have a great passion for shoes . Its what drives us , says Ryosuke Hidaka . Its also this feeling that pervades WFG , in everything from when talking with Hidaka , Fukada or any of the staff to the selection of shoes and the stores furnishings . Its far from the quite- sterile rows of shoes at- Isetan for example . Here is the decor quite- wild with many different kinds of shelves , cabinets and tables , where the shoes are lined up in a varied way around the store , interspersed with accessories and more .

The shoes are around 60 000 yen ( about G550 ) , which is extremely affordable , not least the build quality is on par with many European premium brands , Hidaka says . Another player they sell well and are very satisfied with is the Italian brand Bollini . A small manufacturer with three employees in the outskirts of Milan , which makes shoes in the mid-price segment with fine finishing . In general , the Japanese are quite- restrained when it comes to classic shoes .

Their previous top range- Loake 1880 has been very popular , a line with only full-grain leather- today priced at about G300 , where the price also helped to make them relatively accessible . Now they launch a completely new top range , 1880 Export Grade , which start selling- on November 4 in Loakes own stores in England , and then in late at selected retailers around the world .

@@109465363 @4865363/ <h> Buying tip Churchs Crown Collection <p> This- spring the British brand Churchs launched a new premium range , supposedly to compete- with Edward Green , John Lobb Paris and Gaziano &amp; Girling . Here is a closer look at the Crown Collection . <p> The famous shoe company- Churchs has been a controversial subject among shoe nerds- ever since the Italian luxury company Prada bought the brand a number of years ago . Everything from the fact that the brand now just makes shit- to that its just as good as before has been proclaimed . My view is- that the brands Northampton produced Custom Grade footwear is basically what they have always been , but that the problem was partly that for some ranges theyve- chosen shortcuts ( moved production from England , changed construction methods , etc ) without telling about it and also that theyve put all development focus on more fashion-oriented models and left- the classic side a bit- neglected . One exception was the Heritage Line , an attempt at a new premium range- that was launched a few years ago- which- was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to access and was not considered to be particularly affordable . Selling shoes at over G1 000- without a closed channel- sole for example is a clear failure one might think . <p> Crown Collection cap toes . <p> Now the brand makes a new approach- on the premium front with the Crown Collection . From the start , it is now a larger number of models included , several interpretations of classics such as the mandatory plain cap toe oxford , a full brogue and double monk shoe , but also a few- more special models . For example , a wingtip double monk and my favorite which is a wholecut oxford with a decoration stich made on the inside of the leather where one hand sew a so called skin-stich , midway through the skin , which otherwise mostly Italians are up to . Most come in several- different shades , the- colors have a nice depth , clearly a more elaborate finish than the usual Custom Grade shoes . The level of craftmanship of the Crown Collection is high , with relatively narrow- bevelled- waists and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soles . The sole stitch is also hidden in a channel on top of the welt here . Leather quality seem really good . <p> Nice underneath . <p> Wholecut with handmade decoration stitch . <p> Crown Collection models are made in two different lasts , 148 and 149 . Both with a rounder toe shape where 149 is slightly narrower almond-shaped , and both are longer and neater- in shape than Churchs standard- lasts. - I experienced the fit when I tried them to be fairly standard in size , - perhaps with a slightly lower instep . Prices for Crown Collection models are at- -1 000 , a- bit more- for the model with hand-sewn decoration stitch . Price wise , thus on a par with or above its British premium competitors . If Crown Collection will stand up well against them remains to be seen , its certainly nice to see that Churchs now seem to- make a proper go for it- at least . <p> Lovely punched wholecut , with six pairs of eyelets instead of the more common five . <h> 1 comment <p> hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double monk , and wingtrip double monk shoe , and crown collection cap toes ? because its seams difficult to found a exact price an your web . best regards Melhan

The VIP opening with a number of pre-registered visitors the first 1.5 hours helped to spread out the crowd , and although there was some congestion at mid day when it was as most people there was still enough space to make it manageable . Especially at- Meermins and Vass tables- it was sometimes crowded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked much better this year . It- was a really great atmosphere all day and evening , and we have received very positive feedback from both visitors and exhibitors . There are of course a lot that one- can still improve , we who organizes the event me and the Shoegazing forum moderators Roland Olsson Joakim Berggren and Adrien Combier Hogg learn things- all the time . <p> The large exhibition hall was packed with shoes , plus a lot of other nice things . Meermin was just like last year the big crowd-puller- with the greatest amount of people- in front of its- table during the day . This year they brought about 150 pairs of shoes , including most of the companys ongoing group-MTOs which consisted of a lot of really interesting boots . Portuguese Carlos Santos was one of the newcomers , and there were a number of- visitors who said they were a really nice surprise . They had with them a bunch of models from their- standard range- and people had the opportunity to try out the sizes and place orders .

It has been developed by Mr. Vass- himself in the workshop , with U as a starting point , and is very reminiscent of Saint Crispins chiseled- last- with a pronounced edge on the top of the toe ( this is not one of the lasts that a British lastmaker have- worked with , where the aim is to develop a last that is- between- U and F ) .

For example , one can use the impregnating spray indoors . The series received very positive feedback from many visitors , not least the- fragrance of the products that are often more reminiscent of shampoo than the traditional turpentine scent that usually is associated with shoe care stuff . Partners were the menswear store- Spiga 3 and the bag- and accessory manufacturer Oppermann London . Spiga had unfortunately not had time to get their- fall collection from the popular Italian suit- manufacturer Gabo Napoli , but- had brought some classic blue jackets and suits from the brand so people could try out their sizes . In addition to that they had some garments and accessories , where especially the very nice jumpers in cashmere from Italian Fioroni- stood out .

@@109465368 @4865368/ <h> Review Meermin 101482 Tan Country Calf <p> 2015-10-11 <p> The Spanish brand Meermin has been grown rapidly- since they launched their brand in the European and US market a few years ago . They sell- Asian manufactured shoes with- great designs direct to customers , which means very affordable prices . here 's a review of a model from their basic Classic- collection . <p> Meermin is a Mallorca-based company , driven by a branch- of the famous shoe family- Albaladejo , who also owns Carmina . But Meermin and Carmina has nothing more in common than the fact that the people behind them are related to each other . Meermin started up their business back in the beginning of the 21th century , but in the beginning they only sold to the Japanese market through retailer . Some- years ago they started up the business for the rest of the world , and this time they work only with direct sales . At first they only sold through their store in Madrid and soon took orders via mail , and the word spread fast through among other channels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown explosively and today is clearly one of the hottest producers on the classic shoe market . <p> Meermins shoes are manufactured in China in a factory where the- Albaladejo family for several years has been working hard to teach the Chinese in traditional footwear production . The finish is then made in Spain , probably because they want to be able to put a Made in Spain stamp on them , a process which may be discussed . But even if the production in China- is n't something that Meermin advertises , its not something- they ever tried to keep secret . <p> Meermins standard- Classic collection ( price G160/about- $185 ) is Goodyear welted with- a bit- cheaper materials , for example they use split suedefor this line and the heel stiffeners are made of thermoplastic , - - while the top line Linea Maestro ( G 260/about $300 ) are hand welted and- hand lasted with leather board heel stiffeners and in the case of suede its reverse calf . All of which is quite unusual in this price range , especially the fact that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct sales strategy that allow them to have these prices . Meermin also some Norvegese stitched shoes and some made of Japanese shell cordovan . <p> Somethin Meermin has worked very succesful with is their image building , much thanks to their work in social media . Picture : Meermin <p> Ordering <p> As mentioned- Meermin can either be purchased in their store in Madrid , or ordered through their website . For questions they have service over mail . Because of the massive pressures on Meermin and its staff , they literally get many hundreds of e-mails every day , there are some who feel that they have to wait long for a response to queries , and sometimes do not get a response at all . Be patient , and e-mail again if it has gone as long as a few weeks . Hopefully Meermin will have the possibility to recruit new customer service personnel soon to solve this issue . <p> Meermin has struggled with long delivery times in recent years , something that partly has been solved with their change to another type of MTOs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have something they gall Group Made to Order-models on their website , where they continuously offer special make ups of different sorts , both made to Classic and Linea Maestro standard , which then are pre-ordered from a number of participants and when enough has ordered its put into production . A quite clever way to do more specific make-ups , and it has proven to work well and several other brands has followed this model . <p> Their group MTO section on the website . <p> When it comes to their regular stock they still have the problem that all models are shown as in stock in all sizes all the time , when it sometimes is not and have to be manufactured and therefore have alonger waiting time of usually one sometimes two months in general . If they are in stock , delivery time are often within one or two weeks . They also are working hard to improve the quality control , which from time to time fails and shoes with defects are shipped out to customers . Meermin has probably grown a bit too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and solve problems continuously to in time have a very solid working business model and customer service . <p> General info about the shoes <p> Meermins shoes are delivered in a brown box with only one shoe bag in the same color . Its a pity that they only send one- bag , then the whole point of a protective case- disappears if one is to have both shoes together . You could almost ignore- the bag completely . <p> The model with the quite unsexy name 101482 is a quarter brogue in grain leather and a double rubber- sole - which makes a sturdy shoe , while the oxford model and the relatively slim last- makes it still is reasonably elegant . Its a shoe great for late spring , early autumn or rainy summer days . - Personally I definitely would have preferred single rubber soles , it would have fit the shoe even better and it would have- made them even- more suited to their purpose . <p> The review was first made on the Swedish version of Shoegazing a while back , so this model is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last is a classic round last , quite English in style . As you may notice on this picture there is a slight color variation between the two shoes . Not something I care too much about though , since its hardly noticable especially when worn . <p> Construction and materials <p> The model I received from Meermin is from their Classic collection , hence its- Goodyear- welted . There is no doubt that its a budget- shoe. - Overall , they feel okay in- building quality , but there are some flaws like a couple of- crooked seams , a- mark in the leather and such things , but nothing remarkable that one can not count on for a couple of cheap benchmade shoes . The double sole Meermin have had difficulty to make the- edge of the sole closely cut- in the arch area , - so it looks a bit rough and not to neat to be honest . Another deficiency ( which , however , applies to virtually all budget shoes and also some manufacturers which is more expensive ) is that they use plastic in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that in the next paragraph about the fit . <p> The upper leather is absolutely of good quality for shoes at this- price . Anyone who is expecting any miracles will be disappointed , it shows the use of some poorer parts of the leather , for example , the quarters . The scotch grain embossing is nice , and it feels like the shoes can withstand some rough conditions- reasonably well . The sole is a copy of a Dainite sole , which reportedly will wear a bit faster than the original , but nothing I have noticed yet . The shoes are also well balanced , with the sole touching the ground even when the whole heel section- is on the ground- ( even though I know the significance of this is debated ) . <p> From the back . One can see that the surface of the grain leather has been smoothed out at some spots , probably to them being handled in different situations in the factory . Not something that 's a big deal in my opinion though . <p> Meermins own copies of Dainite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing that sticks out for benchmade shoes in the lower price ranges . <p> Here you can see how the sole edge is n't too neatly done in the arch area . <p> Fit <p> The Hiro last is- at the same time- elegant and- traditional , with a rounded toe and with fairly sharp lines . A bit similar to for example Vass- F last or Crockett &amp; Jones 236 . The shoes I have isin size UK10 which is usually- my standard size , and I would say that the shoes are relatively " true to size " , to use a somewhat vague expression . They were initially a little tight over the ball area , where the foot is at its widest . It stretched- after a few uses though . <p> Where- I had the most problems fit-wise was- the heel . As mentioned- they have a plastic heel stiffener , - and whenthe shape does n't  fit the heel well from the beginning it becomes- a problem since it does n't  - mold to the feet the same way as a leather heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended relatively well into the arch , which is unusual as this type of cheaper- shoes . For me , it provided a- nice- support . <p> Something many experienced is that Meermins shoes are very hard in the beginning , and take their time to go. - Except for the heel which I 've already mentioned I cant say that I felt that they were too hard really , at least not for a double soled shoe , but of course they needed some time to break in . <p> Compared to Loake Aldwych on the Capital last , which is the reference shoe for fit here on Shoegazing , - Hiro- is smaller a bit smaller overall- than the Capital last , although the overall fit characteristics are quite similar. - For example both have a bit roomy heel areas and normal instep . <p> The Hiro last is relatively normal in fit , maybe just a tad narrow in the toe area . <p> A size comparison with some other more or less classic round lasts . From the left : Vass F , Loake Capital , Meermin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Meermin 101482 Tan Country Calf is undoubtedly a good budget- quality shoe , which is very affordable . However , one should not expect any miracles , they have their flaws , but to expect perfection for the 160 euros- are just naive . The Linea Maestro line is although a bit more expensive , to my experience also overall nicer and might be worth the price . If one is to make a comparison with other manufacturers , something that is always- asked for , I would say that they are roughly equal in quality to for example Loake 1880 or Herring Classic ( manufactured by Loake and Barker ) . Those examples are all more expensive though , so Meermins business model with production in China and direct sales means that you get a lot for your money . Even though Meermin have- had their- share of problems they still established themselves as a major player in the budget quality shoe market , and if they get a hold of all these issues they really are a player to count on for the future . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn like 10-15 times . <h> 24 comments <p> I 'm just concerned that the " Free Test Pair " they sent you may be of a higher quality than normal ? .

I both buy shoes which are reviewed and reveice free pairs for reviews . Of course it could be that brands check the shoes a bit extra before sending them to someone who will review them , but its not like they make special review shoes or anything . And of course Ive handled and also owned other Meermin shoes except this pair , and nothing that has gotten me to change how I feel about them . <p> When I receive shoes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open with it and let readers have that info with them . And towards the brands I always tell them that even if they have given me the shoes , I will write whatever I feel about them , also criticism if that 's the case ( which as you can see I have some towards the pair above as well ) . I always try to be as objective as possible , and if I would praise something and write somethingthat was n't correct it would backlash at me when people tried the products themselves with a completely different picture . If you as a reader do n't  want to trust my reviews though , that 's of course up to you . <p> Hi Shoegazingblog . I do trust the honesty in your reviews but being cynical I 'm not 100% certain I trust the companys sending you the free products . In this case as you say you 've seen and handled other Meermin Shoes and I 'm not saying they 've sent you anything other than a " normal " pair of shoes but I 'm sure some suppliers would double check the quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are going to review them on your blog . I 've reviewed a number of " Fine Dining " restaurants on TripAdvisor but never tell the restaurant I 'll be doing a review . As you say obtaining a free pair allows you to test more brands . I do n't  mean to sound doubtful or distrusting , keep up the good work . Carl . <p> Excellent , thoughtful review . I was familiar with the Meermin brand but learned so much about them from your post . Thanks for taking the time to educate your readers ; I know more about what to look for in a shoe after reading this review . <p> Carl : I understand what you mean . I do n't  think though that there can be too much of a difference between a shoe being checked before a review and what most customers get . Also , thanks for your kind words ! <p> Rafael : Thanks ! That 's not true , a bit of a shame that the store personnel say that . They are made in their Chinese factory , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made in China . <p> Rafael : I 'm not sure exactly what is done in Spain , but since they refer to it as " finishing " I do n't  think its any of the making , which includes stitching on outsoles and putting on heels . Its probably only applicing color and polishing things up , maybe sole edge finishing and putting in the sock liner , things like that , which is done in Spain . <p> I bought a pair of Meermins DARK BROWN CALF shoes this autumn . They are as pretty as uncomfortable . After having wearing them for half a day I had to leave the office because my heels were literally bleeding . I then went to a shoe shop to soften the shoes back heel . They were surprised of how stiff the leather was . I wrote to Meermin-s customer service to share my experience , sent them a picture , and kindly asked them to get a refund or replacement . They answered me with a template email refusing to refund . If you want quality shoes and want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I bought a pair of Meermins Oxford shoes this autumn . They are as pretty but extremely painful to wear . Customer Service is also poor . They answer with template email and no signature . If you want quality shoes and want to avoid feet injuries , I would recommend to look elsewhere . <p> Al : Sorry to hear that you werent pleased with your pair . Meermins Classic line are known to have quite hard heel stiffeners , although I did n't  experience it that bad . I understand that you would like to have your money back , but at the same time I understand that Meermin ca n't accept that if there is nothing faulty with the shoes , if they have been worn . Hard heel stiffeners is not a factory error or anything like that . <p> I have had a big issue with the customer service at Meermin . They take forever to respond , and do n't  take anything seriously . Worst customer service I have ever experienced . Any ideas how to solve this ? <p> RK : I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of e-mails everyday and are lacking the staff to answer them all properly , unfortunately . Maybe you can call their Madrid store and see if you can get some answers to anything more specific from them . <p> Excellent Review ! You mentioned that they had questionable customer service . My only issue with Meermin has been their customer service . I have been emailing them for over three months and have still not heard back . I sent them a pair for exchange because they sent me the wrong shoe , and I am very worried and annoyed , as I have made the payment already , but have not received anything . You seem to know Meermin well , is there anything I can do ? <p> This is a HORRIBLE company . They sent me defective shoes and I sent them the pictures of defects and asked for replacement . They said they would arrange for pickup and replacement . Its been more than a week and they neither arrange for pickup nor reply my email . I have also communicated via facebook with no luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defective shoes . BEWARE OF MEERMIN ! <p> S : I understand your frustration , but hopefully it will be solved soon . They are very few in the company compared to what people think , and struggle with keep up with the customer service . It might therefore take longer than a week to solve a thing like that . 
@@109465369 @4865369/ <h> Guide Shoe trees <p> When it comes to maximizing the life of your- shoes , there are three cornerstones : shoe care , shoe trees and rest . In this post I go through lots- of info regarding one of these : the shoe trees . <p> As most people know , shoe trees are used primarily to help the shoes to retain- their shape , and to contribute to let the shoes dry . The latter- mainly- if the blocks are made of wood , which they certainly should be. - But its- not as important that they are of cedar wood , as many seem to believe , any- wood has decent- absorbency and other common types of wood to the shoe trees are birch and maple . The main advantage of cedar is the pleasant aroma it spreads . What wood does is to absorb some moist , but the main thing really is that it let 's the leather breath while having the correct shape , most moist goes out on the outside , so to speak . Plastic trees of course do n't  absorb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pores in the lining leather which is quite bad in the long run . Just picture yourself putting a plastic bag against your skin and keeping it there for hours. - However , what is important is that the wood isnt- coated , then its- absorption capacity is taken away , - if they are stained however , its no problem , and sometimes it can be hard to tell the difference . Ask the sales person if you have any doubts . <p> When you use the trees , make sure to put them in straight away , since its when the shoes are warm and very moist that the leather will shrink as most . Let the trees stay in the resting shoes for at least 24 hours . After the shoes are completely dry , the leather wont change shape in the same way if you remove the trees , its when the leather is drying that it wants to contract itself . Its of course always good to have shoe trees in all shoes , but its not necessary , if you only have one pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used , that makes a very big difference compared to not using trees at all . <p> If you dont- use shoe trees , no matter how good the quality of the shoes are , in time- they will look awful- anyway. - Below a picture which is a striking evidence of this : <p> Shoes from John Lobb that is n't more than a year old when the pic is taken , with heavy creases in the cordovan leather due to not using shoe trees . Picture : Ebay <p> Different types of shoe trees <p> There are many different types of trees , that work in slightly different ways and in many cases are different good for your shoes . Here are a few examples . <p> <p> From the left : 1 . Spiral trees- in- wood . Possibly better than not using trees- at all , but since- this type of tree makes- the pressure on the shoe vertical instead of horizontal they risk to damage and deform the shoe . 2 . Shoe tree where the toe is divided into two equal parts , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the heel does not get help- to retain the shape . 3 . Shoe tree where the toe is divided into two equal parts , and with a large- heel . A disadvantage is that this type of tree- can not follow the shoe form further up towards the end of the tongue . 4 . Shoe tree where the toe part is divided into a large solid part and one smaller . Fill up large parts of the shoe well , a con being that the small part sometimes can miss-shape the upper especially at its back part . 5 . Lasted- shoe trees . Trees that are shaped exactly the same as the lasts the shoes are- built on , which has the advantage that the shoe will retain its original shape much better than with trees- that are not adapted to the shoe . <p> <p> 6 . Non-lasted full shoe trees . Trees that are similar to nr. 4 but with a full piece of wood for the front part . Works very well especially if they are similar in shape to the last of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> 7 . Hinged shoe trees . Here a hinge is used instead of the more common smaller spring parts . Typically only used for lasted shoe trees , since the fit needs to be very good for them to work well . Picture : Herring Shoes <p> <p> 8 . Tree-piece shoe trees. - This is the- Rolls Royce of the shoe trees , which is common among bespoke manufacturers , and basically does not exist in other than lasted versions . The advantage of these is that they fill- out the entire- shoe , all the way- to the top of the tongue . Picture : Claymoors List <p> <p> 9 . Hollow shoe trees . If the ones above are the Rolls Royces , these might be called the Ferraris . Can only be hinged , so normally only lasted ones , and they probably require the highest amount of craftmanship . Pros is that they are good in helping the shoes to dry , since the moist can go through the thin amount of wood out in the air . <p> <p> 10 . Boot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to work better with boots . To be frank these are rarely especially good , since the ankle part often does n't  fill out the boots ankles at all anyway , and the most important part to retain the shape will always be the lower parts of the shoes and to flatten the sole . <p> Straighten out- the sole <p> The shoe trees task when it comes to restoring the shape of the shoe is partly to- directly push out creasesby reasonably well by filling- the shoes front parts , but most- important is that the- trees should- straighten- out- the sole of the shoe . Both for the sole to not be bent upwards , something that is common with time , and that when the sole is stretched it- also fold out- the creases indirectly , so to speak , and the shoes regains its original shape . Its therefore important to check how the shoe trees you are- buying are- shaped in front so that they have a good shape- that flatten- the shoes you will use them for ( of course it is relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start and is not similarly in need of " flat " shoe trees ) . <p> An example of a tree that wont straighten out the sole properly , since the toe is shaped way too much upwards . <p> This shoe tree is much better shaped , where the bottom is relatively flat and it will push down the toe area in a good way . <p> To illustrate the difference when using the trees above , this is the first one where you can see how the toe stays high above the ground . <p> here 's the second tree , and the toe is here pushed down into its original state . A difference of about a centimeter , so picture how different the shoes will look if you use the different trees for several years . <p> Shape of the heel <p> Another element that is important is that the heel has a good shape . As mentioned above , it is preferable that the block will fill the- heel as well , but it should not- be too large so that it miss-shapes it. - It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you look at the heel its shaped like a drop , being quite narrow in the upper part. - Heres a tree which is quite big in the upper part . <p> here 's the shoe with a tree which has more of a drop shape , and you can see the difference in the upper area . Both trees are more or less similar in width further down , its the top that 's shaped different . 
@@109465370 @4865370/ <h> Italigente Uncovered nr. 5 <p> 2016-06-22 <p> Time again- for an insight into the work of the Swedish-Italian shoe brand Italigente . Today more about the cooperation with the Sweden- National Football Team who wears- Italigentes shoes to their suit outfit now under Euro 2016 , a look at how the new models that you readers provided input on looks- in its final form , and- a closer look at the new thin rubber sole . <p> The shoes for the Swedish national team <p> Last time the- Sweden- National Football Team- were qualifified for a big championship in Poland and Ukraine four years ago Italigente also delivered shoes for them . Then it was the light brown model Venezia Castagna who sat on the players feet and a matching belt around their waists , but the journey- to have them- there was not without problems . The week before the agreed delivery there was an earthquake in Modena , and the roof of the factory that made the buckles of the belt collapsed . So there we stood with the shoes , but without- belts . Luckily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make new buckles . But time was short . And sending belts retrospectively to Ukraine is no logistical treat . After some long days and late nights all belts were made ready on- June 5 , departure to Kiev was planned for June 6 after lunch with the Swedish Football Associations ( SvFF ) own plane from Bromma . Since June 6 is the National Day in Sweden and public Holiday , there was no opportunity to send the belts by UPS or DHL . Magnus Ericson , the founder of Italigente and current CEO of Skofabriken Kavat who owns the brand today , had promised the national team that the belts would be delivered on time , so he met up Alessandro Zoni in Italy late in the evening on June 5 , flew himself up to the Scandic Park in Stockholm , and delivered 56 belts in a sports bag . Players had already put on- their suits , pulled on the matching belt , stepped out of the hotel and onto the bus for departure to Bromma . <p> The first football shoe . <p> A side- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ royal wedding between the Swedish Crown Princess Victoria and Prince Daniel in June 19 , 2010 , where the Royal Court had ordered 14 pairs of shoes from- Italigente . Three days before the wedding they called from the Royal Court and wondered where the shoes were They were supposed to be delivered the week before , so things- became- quite nervous . After some research it was discovered that the shoes had- been standing at the UPS storage center in Marche because of a wrong barcode . Magnus Ericson had to make a personal pledge that the shoes would be delivered at Drottningholms castle before 14:00 June 17 , the day after . How it would be sorted- was not crystal clear . It ended with one of the employees from the factory in Marche flew up with the shoes in a bag . Magnus borrowed shoe boxes from- one of Italigentes retailers , met up the factory worker at the airport , and in the parking lot they packed- the shoes in each box , labeled them , packed them into the car and drove out to Drottningholm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal guwards , they passed the barrier and drove into the castle courtyard where eunuchs Tony Carlzon met up and received- the shoes . All breathed a sigh of relief and the celebrations could begin . Today Italigentes patent shoe- Prince is- sold under the brand Oscar Jacobson . <p> Prince Carl-Philip to the left and Prince Daniel to the right during the latters wedding day , both wearing patent leather shoes from Italigente . Picture : Peter Segemark , Nordiska museet <p> The reason why the Swedish Football Association has shoes from Italigente is named Marcus Allback . The Players Coach of the National Team has a big- style and clothing interest . For suits they are sponsored by the Swedish brand Cavaliere , but on the shoe side they have- no partner in the same- way . So , before Euro 2012 Marcus contacted- Magnus Ericson and inquired about the possibility to buy shoes from them . They were pleased back then , not least sthe fact that- Italigentes shoes are quite soft and comfortable right from the start was appreciated by the players and their expensively insured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the 90s- they had been forced- to cut off the heel of the dress shoes- when it was apparent that several players had sore feet . So from the management of SvFF they now make sure that the shoes will not affect the players feet . Some of the players have since 2012 also continued to buy shoes from Italigente , which is a good rating . They therefore came back this year when the team once- again had qualified for a- championship and needed to have dress- shoes to all players and- staff. - Italigente is not a sponsor of the team , the company is way- too small to be able to afford that , so- they buy the shoes of us , though- at a discounted price . Since we are not a sponsor , we can not avail ourselves of the- SvFF- logo and cant use players and so on in marketing in the same way that the sponsors can . This year we chose in consultation with Marcus Allb+ck the dark brown version of the same model as last time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on- the soft- chiseled 29- last . We also developed a belt in dark brown leather with the Parma-based company Giorgi Zoni , and delivered dark blue socks from Bresciani . <p> Venezia Caffe and the matching belt . <p> Altogether there were about 50 cpairs of Venezia Caffe that- SvFF ordered , and for a while we had - to together with some shoe interested guys here in Gothenburg polish up a proper spit shine on all- shoes , and take an epic picture of all 50 pairs of identical high shined shoes . Since- our production with the Marini family in Montegranaro is relatively limited , it was tight enough deliver the shoes on time this time too , so we never had time to do any- shining- operation . Maybe next time . <p> An article on the Swedish menswear site Manolo about the Sweden National Football Teams dress outfit , with three of the players dressed up . Picture : Manolo <p> Finished split toe derbies and adelaide <p> You who read these earlier Italigente Uncovered posts- have been eligible to vote and provide input on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the favorites that we chose to go ahead with were- launched a few weeks ago . One of them is a- new version of our split toe derby , named Biella II Mogano . New designs from its predecessor with whole quarters , and now- on the- new classic round- 15 last- in a- hand-painted brown shade , and with our own developed city-rubber sole ( more about this below ) . As you may have read , there was little challenge to get to the sole as we wanted it , but now the model is finally here , and well received . As more retailers than expected took it in , and it has already sold some online , its already empty in some sizes , but some- are still available , and we expect a restock- in August . <p> Biella II Mogano <p> The other new model is- a completely new model , an adelaide called Bari Cammello in medium brown suede from the Italian tannery Opera . Also- here there were some challenges to get- the pattern the way- we wanted it , the recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vamp that was too short , but finally we got it . It is made in the same rlast- 15 as the Biella , but with a single chestnut tanned leather sole from Italian Volpi , - closed channel and bevelled- waist . It feels nice to have a suede shoe in Italigentes range again , something that has been requested . <p> Bari Cammello . <p> We have also taken back last years estimated summer visitor , the espadrilles Riccione in blue and off-white . A really comfortable summer shoe , which is a more well-made espadrilles than the standard ones are , this- has an- insole made entirely of leather , reinforced toe and heel , naturally dyed stretch fabric and- natural- rubber sole , which means that they will last- more than just a summer . <p> Riccione Bianco . <p> Then there was also the idea that there would be two Bologna-sewn penny loafers launched this this summer . Here , however , we unfortunately encountered some problems- when to get the Bologna construction exactly the way we- wanted it , and when the time became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . The plan instead is to make it for- next summer . Things- like this can happen , you must adapt . <p> New rubber sole <p> Today Italigente use two different sole types , our chestnut tanned leather soles who are really durable , somewhere in between a standard leather sole and oak bark tanned soles from for example J. Rendenbach or Baker , and studded rubber soles ( similar to Dainite soles ) . We wanted to add a new type of sole in between these , a thin rubber sole which looks exactly like a leather sole , but is better in wet conditions . These soles are often called city soles , examples of them are Wensum or the R1 sole used by Edward Green . <p> The Margom factory . <p> Some of the hundreds of different rubber soles they offer . <p> The right one in this pic is the one we went with finally , although with a modified thickness . <p> Together with the rubber sole- manufacturer Margom , based in Civitanova Marche a short drive from Montegranaro where Italigentes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different soles , and after discussions with Margom we went with a sole with a little bit of texture and a rubber that is a great compromise between hard wearing and good grip . The sole they had was 5 mm thick , we wanted it at 4 mm so this- has- now been- made exclusively for Italigente . The same material is- used for- the bottom heel piece .

@@109465373 @4865373/ <h> Italigente Uncovered nr. 4 <p> 2015-12-15 <p> Been a while since last time , but now once again an insight into the work of the Swedish-Italian shoe brand Italigente . Today , among other things , about where we landed when it comes to the- upcoming news in the range where you readers have been involved and have given input , about- the first addition in the entry line Italigente Basic , and about the fact- that I 'm from the 1th of January- will start working for Kavat- and Italigente full time . <p> Model development <p> In the- previous Italigente Uncovered article we had- a vote on which model you thought we should make- for the upcoming- seasons . It gave a pretty clear result where two models for our ordinary Blake/Rapdid sewn collection and one- model- for- summer was clearly the most popular ones , and therefore we have now moved on with- these . The biggest favorite of yours was an adelaide in polo suede , on the new classic round last 15 with single leather soles . It will be released in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First sample of the adelaide in mid brown suede . <p> We are not completely satisfied with the design , - the vamp- has become a bit too short , so we shall correct- this- to the final model . It should also have the narrower variant of the waist , which this- sample shoe does n't  have . Otherwise , it feels really promising . <p> The second model in the regular collection was a so-called Plain Toe Blucher in medium brown grain leather on the heavier- 08 last , with double rubber soles and storm welt . A bit like a little sibling to the boot Viterbo Torrone , and this- will be released for- the autumn next year . Here is a sample of it : <p> PTB in grain leather with the shade Torrone . <p> This one- we are satisfied with , there 's really nothing- that needs to be corrected . The only consideration I have is regarding the leather . Kavat- ( a Swedish shoe brand , who owns Italigente ) has an eco labeled- grain leather called Eco Performance ( EP ) who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resistant . Magnus Ericson , the founder of Italigente and CEO of Kavat has talked about the possibility of using the leather also - forItaligente . Something I thought more recently , after my wife and I got into a real shower- in Gothenburg last week , and- the advantages of this leather became very obvious . Illustrated below : <p> Just after I came inside . The water stays on top , and the shoes are just treated with regular shoe cream and polish . <p> here 's a comparison with my wifes Loake in a regular smooth leather , after they both have been dried off . The EP leather is basically completely dry , while the regular leather is soaked , you can see some stains of the original color on the shaft . <p> The grain leather that the- PTB- sample is- made of is a very fine leather , but it does not have the characteristics that the- EP leather has . The EP leather might crease- a- bit more and its harder to get the same shine on it that you can still get with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult choice . If you have comments and input you are more than welcome to write them in the comment field below . <p> Regarding the summer shoe for next year , many of you liked the idea of a penny loafer in suede . Therefore we moved on with and make a penny for two mocha shades , but instead of Blake stitched which was the plan from the- beginning well- do it with a Bologna construction . Its a- bit- more complicated construction method- that in many ways is even better for this purpose- since- the shoes will be just as slim and light but becomes even more pliable- and comfortable . On Bologna you make the vamp like a sock , and then- with a Blake seam you stitch on the outsole . <p> One of the penny loafer samples . This sand coloured suede is one , the other will be a dark green suede version . We will remove the heel counter and replace it with a regular centre seam in the back , otherwise the final version will look like this . <p> We- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubber sole on the model Biella II Mogano . The idea was that it would- be ready- already this- fall , but instead it will be releases this spring . There are some details that- we still would like to change , but this is how the- latest sample shoe looks : <p> Biella II Mogano , a second sample . <p> The sole from below . <p> Premiere for- Italigente Classic <p> As you who read the previous Italigente Uncovered artivle- know , we wanted to make a cheaper entry-level series with some different base models . We started looking at doing it in the Balkans , where we made contact with a small factory in Serbia . Unfortunately it was very slow with deliveries , and what- was meant to be an affordable- shoe for the high school graduates etc- was not finished until this fall . So we have taken a time out in the partnership with them , however , we did bring home a series of black plain cap toe oxfords to give it a try .

@@109465374 @4865374/ <h> Picture special The difference between Goodyear welted and hand welted <p> 2015-12-02 <p> A classic topic of discussion is the difference between Goodyear welted and hand welted shoes , and the function and importance it has . Usually- the- sustainability in terms of numbers resoles- and so on is highlighted as- the main difference , and there is of course a difference there , but in most cases there 's nothing that affects- the actual life for- the owner . There are many other aspects of the difference between the construction types that in my eyes are- more interesting , and here I highlight- several of these in the form of a series of pictures that compare shoes from Gaziano &amp; Girling and Hiro Yanagimachi . <p> A canvas rib- is glued on the insole to a- Gaziano &amp; Girling Deco shoe . Its in this rib the Goodyear welt seam is then sewn in . The solution is known as gemming . <p> To note- here is the thickness of the insole , which on Goodyear welted shoes tend to be around 3-4 mm approximately . Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will make a rather large cavity in the shoe that needs to be filled , the rib is usually about 5-7 mm high . <p> Here we have an insole- on a Made to Order shoe from Hiro Yanagimachi , made to the same standard as their bespoke- shoes . The insoles are cut from a larger piece of leather , which is usually- the shoulder of cattle , which have good fiber composition to withstand- sewing in a lip in it . The thickness of this type of insole is usually about 8-10 mm , which is more than twice as thick as an insole for Goodyear welted shoes . <p> On a hand welted shoe you cut out a lip- of the thick insole , which the welt- seam is then sewn in ( there are exceptions with soles where the lip are pre-cut- which- some " factory-made " hand welted shoes use ) . <p> Here- the welt is- attached to the upper leather and the canvas rib with a chain stitch sewn with a- Goodyear machine , and you can see here also a heel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the piece of leather that is to build the fiddle waist . <p> The large cavity is filled with- a mass consisting of cork and glue . It is relatively porous and collapses more and more over time , which means that it often is replaced when the shoe is resoled . <p> Here are welt is sewn on with a hand seam , which is a kind of " lock stitch " where every stitch can hold- separately . Here you can also see that the cavity on shoes with this construction method becomes very small , it is only a few millimeters high . <p> Hiro Yanagimachi cut out pieces from a thin cork plate that is placed under the forefoot and in the back- are a- shank and leather pieces to build up the waist . Cork plate also is compressed- some with time , but more limited , and it can then remain unchanged throughout the life of the shoe so the footprint is quite persistent , so to say , in both the insole and filling . Pictures : Hiro Yanagimachi <p> The sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sole on the finished shoe by Hiro Yanagimachi . Both are excellent , and you cant see from the outside the quite large differences inside . <p> Goodyear welting- is an excellent method of construction , no doubt about it , but it is produced and adapted for mass production , not to do as- good shoes as possible , quite frankly . The thick insole , the compact construction without large voids and so forth on the hand welted- shoes are things that are considered " objectively better " . For the sake of making a point- I have taken shoes that are similar in price range , Gaziano &amp; Girlings regular series is about- G1 200 for- RTW ( Deco costs , however , around G2200 , then- MTO including lasted shoe trees ) . Hiro Yanagimachis hand welted MTO start at about G1 300- in Japan ( lasted shoe trees about G230- extra ) . <p> The idea is to show reasonably factual differences between the construction types . There are also other aspects that distinguish the two methods , for example- that things are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welts bought in large rolls- and you have pre-built heels , while a workshop likeHiro Yanagimachi cut out the welts- themselves from- leather hides and build heels layer by layer on each shoe , and although there in many- cases is a big difference when it comes to craftmanship the impact on function etc is rather small plus it is not necessarily associated with it Goodyear or hand welting , therefore , I do not mention it closer in this post . For your information , there will be more pictures from the production of Hiro Yanagimachis shoes- in a buyers guide published soon .

Recently released , however , the book Master Shoemakers The Art and Soul of Bespoke Shoes by Gary Tok . Shoegazing read it . Also tips on a post I made Manolo why quality shoes really cost that much . <p> Master Shoemakers , subtitled The Art and Soul of Bespoke Shoes , is a large , heavy coffee table book with a gorgeous- frontpage which in my opinion makes itself at its best without the protective paper , with its minimalistic style with the centered medallion . Very beautiful just as decoration . But it is of course more than that . When I read the books foreword , written by Ethan Newton who runs the haberdasher- Brycelands in Tokyo and previously co-founded The Armoury in Hong Kong , and the authors own introduction , I got a little worried . Its okay , written texts , but to me they are more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts have much thought behind them , feels like they are mostly there to be there . Fortunately , my worries- quickly disappears as I continue . <p> Shoes from Benjamin Klemann in Hamburg . <p> Gary Tok is a businessman from Hong Kong , who- has had an- interest in classical style for many years . In 2010 he ordered his first pair of bespoke- shoes from the Japanese Hidetaka Fukaya , aka Il Micio , based in Florence . Tok- realized the lack of a book written in English about these different bespoke shoemakers around Europe , and decided to do it himself . So for a few years , when he had an opportunity he visited bespoke shoemakers- and interviewed and photographed , to assemble Master Shoemakers . <p> Old shoe from Foster &amp; Son which is- cut open to show its different parts . <p> Included in- the book are Anthony Delos ( visited before he went to Berluti ) , Hidetaka Fukaya , Dimitri Gomez , G.J Cleverley , Stefano Bemer ( before he passed away in 2012 ) , Benjamin Klemann , Foster &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ugolini and Gaziano &amp; Girling . A good selection of styles and countries , although personally I might have preferred the a bit secret John Lobb Paris instead of one of the many Florence-based ones , but its mostly a matter of taste , and its of course impossible to include- everyone . The book is divided into sections for each bespoke- shoemaker , with about fifteen spreads for each and they all- consists of a short story about the cobbler , the rest is images , sometimes from their workshops , but above all focus is on the shoes . Overall , the quality of photos is very nice and you get a good picture of the- style and craftsmanship of each shoemaker . The texts are also nice and much more thoughtful and rewarding than the introductory texts . Most places you in an environment that is the bespoke shoemakers workshop , and often its these texts that works best , where the presence brings added value and a greater sense of the people he meets . Since- the stories are relatively short , they become rather summarising- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a bit of a shame as the shoe nerd I am , but I understand the concept of a coffee table book that should be reasonably accessible and attractive . <p> Large nice pictures is the main focus of the book . Here on shoes from Anthony Delos . <p> Master Shoemakers is an expensive book , it costs about G140 , which is its biggest minus since it makes it less accessible . Its a shame , because its a nice introduction to the many talented European bespoke shoemakers , a well-made book that gives a good understanding of what bespokeshoemaking means and of the- beautiful creations it may create .

Shoegazing have met him . <p> Fredrik Blindheim is from Oslo , Norway , where he have worked in several different parts of classic mens fashion , including for brands like Ralph Lauren , Salvatore Ferragamo and Ferner Jacobsen . He was then involved in building up the high-end store H++yers first flagship store for mens fashion , and worked there as Store Manager and buyer . Among the large range- of brands they worked with Edward Green was one , and he got to know its CEO and owner Hillary Freeman . During the winter 2014-2015 Fredrik moved to London for a girl , without really having any idea what he would do in his new home- country . He applied for some different jobs in the fashion area- without any luck , until one day when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greens flagship store . He went in and said hi , started talking , and it turned out that they needed a replacement for their former Sales Manager Christopher Gumbs . A week later I was employed . It truly was a classic case of being in the " right place at the right time " , Fredrik Blindheim says . <p> Edward Green trunk show shoes . <p> Although Fredrik had an interest in shoes and greater knowledge than the average person , it has been very much to learn on the new job . The company is also in a relatively expansive period , with a newly launched online shop of their own and an increasing number of retailers around the world . Its intense , and I travel a lot to visit customers and host trunk shows around the world . But it suits me well , I like that you get to meet so many people , Fredrik says . <p> While the brand- is on offense- in several areas Edward Green has for a time had some problems with some elements of quality control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the fact- that we have had a new supplier of some leather , and the way we 've done burnishing on the shoes has n't  really worked , it has in some cases become- small cracks in the finish . There has been some work to find the right way to burnish this leather , Fredrik Blindheim says . <p> Black austerity brogue . <p> When it comes to the development side of the shoes they have launched several new lasts the past years , and since they- also have kept many of the older lasts the brand today has a very voluminous range of lasts that their shoes are made on . Its- bit good , a bit- bad . Good- since- customers have a lot of options , bad- as it can be a bit difficult to navigate among all these options . Otherwise- its mainly on the more casual side the brand- grows , with more alternative colors , boots , unlined models and so on . <p> An unlined Edward Green Dover . <p> Blue grain high boot with buckles . <p> Another major discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have start using leveled prices worldwide . Previously , it was primarily to dealers in Europe that- sell relatively cheap to the US since they have been able to deduct the often higher VAT in countries here and had a strong dollar to play with . Most retailers have a understanding of this development , while of course there are customers who are disappointed that they cant buy Edward Green shoes at much lower prices than at home anymore . I still think that in the long run everyone will benefit from equal competition . Otherwise the risk is that it some markets loose a lot of retailers , and when it comes to shoes in this price range , its still preferable to relatively easily have the opportunity to try out and experience the shoes in reality , says Fredrik Blindheim. 
@@109465377 @4865377/ <h> The tip Sunken rubber toe taps <p> 2016-01-28 <p> The toe on the front of the sole always down faster than the rest of the sole , and for some who take big steps , the wear can be- quite dramatically . Here a tip about sunken rubber toe taps which is a good solution to prevent this from happening . <p> The natural solution for most people with this problem ( who want to keep the leather sole and do n't  want to cover it with a rubber topy ) is to attach an external metal toe tap . Sunken metall taps are quite- rare since- you in most cases need to have them attached- directly in the factory . Surface taps- naturally gives a really good protection , but personally I 'm not too- fond of it . I think they are uncomfortable when walking , and they it can look a bit so-so if they are seen from the side from above , it can be dangerous when- walking in stairs or on the hard floor , and the shoes ca n't be used indoors on parquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three pairs to the left have had them installed in the workshop , the others are attached by a cobbler . <p> My first pair of shoes with flush rubber toe taps were a pair from the Hungarian maker Vass . Like many other manufacturers Vass do n't  want to put on sunken- metal taps on- shoes with single leather soles since the screws easily can- go through the whole sole out on top , so they just do the- rubber version on these . After trying this , I quickly realized that it is a very good solution . The feeling is just like walking with leather soles , they can hardly be seen at all , and the durability is still really good. - For me the regular procedure nowadays is that I walk with the shoes for a while and wear down the toe , go to the cobbler and have sunken rubber toe taps installed , go with the shoes for a longer period , and then both the toe tap and the middle of the sole are often in about the same time span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I have also had sunken rubber toe taps installed by- cobblers on several pairs . It does n't  have to be done- when they are brand new , you can wear them for- some time , just make sure that there still are- some margin to the welt so that the cobbler will be able to grind it evenly without having to risk to also sand down the welt . Most skilled cobblers can do this- procedure , even if its something that is n't too common ( in fact , all the cobblers I asked had never done it before ) . Price wise , it costs between G20 and G45 . Usually they have to sand- down the sole stitch , - but since todays glue is so hard and the seam is also locked in every stitch for the rest of the sole its this nothing that weakens the shoe . And if the cobbler does n't  understand what you mean , just show this blog post as a guide . <p> A comparison of three different versions of the sunken rubber toe tap . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the workshop , and with the dark sole edge its hardly visible . The John Lobb pair in the middle has a very thin rubber piece inserted by a cobbler , the pair from Jan Kielman to the right have a thicker one . <p> The Vass shoe seen from the side . Neat and functional . <p> Very thin one , hardly visible . Might wear down a bit faster though . As you can see there 's no brass pins , since the sole is so thin the cobbler did n't  want to attach those . Todays cement is so good that they will stick . <p> Thicker version . For me who likes a low toe spring ( height of the toe from the ground ) toe taps are great since they keep down the wear here , and makes the tip keeping closer to the ground .

@@109465380 @4865380/ <h> In depth Properties of unlined shoes <p> 2016-12-16 <p> At the moment there 's bit of a- craze for unlined shoes going on , not only- when it comes to light summer loafers , but also other models . Unlined has some nice benefits , but also brings with it several disadvantages that one should be aware of when buying . here 's a walktthrough of the properties of an unlined shoe . <p> The standard in classic quality shoes is that they are fully lined with leather . When we talk about unlined shoes in this area they are seldom made completely without leather lining , the heel area and the stiffener there is always lined and it is often leather lining along the top edge at the opening to provide stability and protection . Sometimes the entire rear section is lined , approximately up to the tongue , while the vamp- is left unlined . <p> We start with the good- properties , the advantages . An unlined shoe is softer and often feels more comfortable right from the start . They will also be airier and cooler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often more comfortable with a slightly roughened flesh side or grain side ( if its reversed calf suede ) than usual leather lining , which can have a tendency to " stick " a little bit to the skin . That 's why the shoe type also traditionally have been used mainly for light summer loafers , that 's what its properties are best suited for . For models where you want a relaxed , casual feel of the shoe , it can also work- well with unlined . <p> A bit summery unlined leafers- from Gaziano &amp; Girling , made of suede with scotch grain embossing . <p> So if we go over to the disadvantages , there 's one very- important one , and its the fact that- the lifespan of an unlined shoe will be shorter than a standard leather lined . There is a big difference between just having a thin layer of leather compared to- when you have a layer of lining leather plus usually different reinforcements between the uppers and lining . The former will inevitably wear down and break- faster . Unlined shoes also lose their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one usually uses chrome-tanned leather uppers for shoes , for those who walk in the shoes- without socks there is a risk of chrome allergy symptoms .

In summary , its good for those buying- unlined shoes to be aware of the characteristics of such a shoe , also to know how to best use them . <p> That one does n't  line shoes doesnt- necessarily- mean that one want to cut costs , although its generally a bit cheaper to make an unlined shoe than a lined one . Fabric lined shoes- is another thing , using textile canvas often then in the front half of the shoe , is- exclusively about cutting costs , there are really no benefits , although some manufacturers claim that it would be cooler with fabric lining . But it does not transport moisture away in the same way as leather , starts to smell and get dirty , and is guaranteed to break- faster , more like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year started producing an unlined version of the split toe model Dover .

Their suede brush is made with dense hairs of phosphor bronze , and is simply an amazing product . <p> FACTS : Product : Suede brush with bristles in phosphor bronze Brand : Edoya Price : About G25- if purchased from Edoya in Japan ( 3 240 yen ) , in Europe about G80- ( -60 ) As for the offer of suede brushes , there are basically two available variants : those with a bit harder- brass bristles ( sometimes with horsehair or softer bristles around the brass ) , and rubber brushes . The first ones - many people experience as too hard and tears in the suede , while the latter usually have problems raising the fibers of the suede properly . This brush from Edoya is a third variant , which in my mind is superior to both of the others . Ill soon closer explain why . <p> The company Edoya was founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the first centuries of its existence primarily focused on making paint brushes , but during the last quarter has diversified and moved on to more focus on brushes for clothing and shoe care , hair and makeup brushes , toothbrushes and more .

They have a wide selection of shoe care bushes , with bristles from different breeds and different parts of the horse , from pig , goat and other animals . In principle it goes from quite- rough brushes which is used to get rid off dirt from- coarse leather , in several steps to super soft brushes made- to rub up the final gloss . <p> The handle is also very nicely made . <p> And then they have this suede brush , which as mentioned- is made of phosphor bronze . It is an alloy consisting of in round figures 90% copper , 9,5% tin and 0,5% phosphorous .

The bristles are much softer than usual brass brushes , you can easily brush on sensitive parts of your- own skin . But still , the function equivalent to a brass brush when it comes to lifting the fibers . It is a delight to work with it on the shoes , it feels very- gentle but still has vitality enough to lift the fibers in the manner sought by a suede brush . I have discarded all my other suede brushes now , this is the only one I use . Price wise , I would say that it really is too cheap when purchased by Edoya in Japan , in Europe and the US it will cost a lot more , partly because of customs duties etc , but I personally would still say that it is worth the money . Edoya is sold in for example the British online store Exquisite Trimmings and the Oslo cobbler Skomaker Dagestad- ( Edit : Apparently Dagestad are sold out of their brushes , and since Edoya do n't  want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exquisite Trimmings sell theirs for the high price is that they paid the full store price for them , and then had to apply their margins to it ) .

However , its a shoe type that goes far back in time , here 's a review of its history . <p> There is no dating of when the monk shoe was invented , but it was established on a wider front in Europe during the High Middle Ages ( ca. 1000-1350 BC ) when the monks , who earlier mostly had worn sandals , started using the model a lot . Hence , the name . The monks used it merely as a work shoe , since it protected more and was more comfortable to work in than sandals , and the buckle or buckles ( yes even at that time there were double monk shoes ) made it look quite alike- their traditionally worn sandals . <p> A typical variant of how the model that the monks in the Middle Ages wore , and hence- is the original model of the monk shoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoe from the 1300s . <p> Here in the Middle Ages there were many different variations of the monk shoe , the most common was partly a more sandal-like variant where there was a toe cap but then opened up and with a strap that went over the ankle and fastened with a metal buckle on the outside . The variation that mainly survived to our days are like a cross between clasped sandals and what we today call a derby , with a part that is attached to the shoes tongue and where on strap or two straps goes into buckles that lock the shoe . The model worked fine to do with the turn-sewn construction method that was standard at the time . <p> James Bond may have made- the double monk- boot highlighted- again after Daniel Graig wore it in the last two films , but already in the 1400s they wore- variants of it .

The hype- that has existed and in many respects still is existing of- the double monk shoe usually is said to have been started by Alexander McQueen and Yves Saint Laurent , while others suggest that the Italian style icon and the store owner Lino Ieuluzzi who- have worn it frequently for some time- has- been one of the reasons . <p> The formality level of the monk shoe is debated , and also differs depending on where in the world you are . Normally you categorize the monk shoe as less formal than oxfords but more formal than derbys . Not least , a black single monk strap without brogeuing etc are considered relatively formal in England , for example , and there its ofthen used with- a dark suit in at the office . In some cases however its believed that monk shoes , especially double monks , are less formal than derbys . What 's true is a matter of interpretation , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaner the pattern is the more formal it is . <p> This type of clean black single monk strap is relatively formal in for example England .

@@109465384 @4865384/ <h> Report Gaziano &amp; Girling bespoke , part 4 <p> 2017-03-27 <p> Time for the penultimate installment in the series that follows the process and the production of a pair of bespoke- shoes from Gaziano &amp; Girling . This part follows the production of the final pair , I myself spent a week in Northampton to document it all . <p> It was almost a year ago that I made the order of a pair- of bespoke austerity brogues from Gaziano &amp; Girling in their store on Savile Row ( read about it in part 1 here ) , then I had a first fitting in Stockholm at Skoaktiebolaget ( read part 2 here ) , and at the second fitting only minor changes was left to do on the lasts ( read- part 3 here ) . After that I actually had a first real shoe made but with machine stitched rubber sole , since- I was in great need of such a shoe we chose to male it before the completion of the original order . So that way , you could say that I had three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small things to change , especially that they were somewhat tight for the- pinky toes , and also there was some air just behind the ball of the foot at on the underside , plus that I wanted the toe a bit less assymetric . <p> The pair- with rubber soles that became the first real shoe was a so-called swan neck oxford . Here the upper has been lasted . <p> The sole of these attached , which was done with a machine since it works much better for rubber soles . <p> The finished pair . <p> But since its- the austerity brogues we follow in this article series , its what we continue to do , and as mentioned- I spent last week in Kettering , Northampton , to follow the Swede Daniel Wegans work with the production of the final shoes . Daniel is the head of their bespoke department , he is the lastmaker , but also does a majority of the brands making on his " spare time " . It was obviously partly to be able to make a nice- post here on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and learn more for myself . I have spent- a week with the Swedish bespoke shoemaker- Janne Melkersson for his course in shoemaking , which was extremely rewarding and whetted the appetite . As mentioned before , its not at all about that I should learn to make shoes , I 'm just interested to learn as much as possible about how its done . Since I documented the process of the production very thoroughly when I visited Janne in two very long blog posts ( only available on the Swedish version unfortunately , part 1 here and part 2 here , will likely be translated in the future ) , it will be a bit- less detailed this time- with focus on pictures . <p> As I wrote after the visit to Janne what once again hits me is the enormous number of steps required to make a handmade pair of shoes , not least the constant preparation of different parts , which take much time and fascinates . For example sewing the welt- by hand is done in a bit over an hour- for both shoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the inside of the shoe takes almost as long , and according to Daniel its in many ways much more essential that this part is really well made than the welt seam . To give an example . <p> I made record of the actual time when Daniel ( or anyone else , the clicker and closer in this case ) actually worked with the shoes . A total of approximately 40 hours concrete working hours were spent . This is the time forsolely - the completion of the final shoe , work on measuring- my feet and taking the order , lastmaking , production of the first fitting shoes , fitting , correction of the lasts and repetition of this procedure for a second fitting takes even longer . Daniel estimates- that for my shoes this has taken about 60 hours , thus making the total production time when someone actually worked with the shoes in any form ( not counting all the time they rest for various drying step etc ) is a total of 100 hours . As- comparison Gaziano &amp; Girling has calculated- that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes in the factory , when they are actually holding them , and do anything by hand or in any of all the machines , for a pair is about 35-40 minutes . Its of course not entirely fair to make such a comparison ( for example , lasts for RTW are already produced , the machines used are incredibly expensive , all staff , rental of premises , logistics , plus lots of other expenses included in the cost of a pair of factory-made shoes must also be taken into account ) , but in any case its safe to say that its not unreasonable that this type of bespoke shoes have- a high price . <p> This is- also why I left out a lot of details of the process in this walkthrough . To show exactly how much work is actually done is difficult , and would likely also become quite boring , since its , for example , repetitive rounds where material is cut or grounded away , it would be too tedious to show- everything . Nevertheless , its over 130 images to thresh out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoy ! <p> The final lasts , which had been modified slightly after the swan neck oxford shoes . <p> Since the pattern was- modified after the last fitting it needs to be tested properly . here 's a first version made only with two pieces of leather sewn together and the pattern marked out . <p> Time then start cutting out the pattern pieces to be used . Daniel Wegan use thin cardboard for this . <p> All parts of the pattern . <p> A proper test of the pattern is then made , where the uppers are made of- scrap leather . You want to be 100% sure that the pattern is perfect before you start with the final pair , so there 's little- risk that you have- to dispose- the real upper . <p> All parts again , this time in scrap leather . <p> The pieces are skived- down at- the edges and glued together before they are sewn together on the sewing machine . An opportunity for Daniel Wegan to practice a bit on upper stitching ( a- part of shoemaking which he has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested on the last . It turned out that it needed to be corrected a bit , since- the lacing appeared to end up being a tad- off-center- on the last . Therefore a new test of the- pattern was made in exactly the same way as now described , but- we skip that in this walkthrough . <p> When the pattern design is completely finished the production of the final pair is started . Now we are in the cutting room- where the clicker inspects hides to find a really good one . <p> Then the skin is carefully examined and all marks and scratches is marked out , so that these can be avoided when the parts are cut . <p> The parts of a shoe ( minus the tongue ) deployed in the best way . Its this part above that is- the complicated work for a clicker , to make the best use of the leather , the cutting of the parts- is not as complicated at all . With my shoes the clicker- only cut the parts roughly , then- Daniel made the real cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always want to get the cut as straight as possible , which requires a good flow of how you move the blade and how you are moving the parts when its bigger turns or- similar . <p> First the edges that will overlap each other is thinned out towards the edges on a skiving machine . Daniel Wegan feel that the result is- smoother and better being made by the machine than when its done entirely by hand . <p> Machine skived . <p> The skiving is improved , however , by hand afterwards in the places where its needed . <p> Now the parts are handed over to Gaziano &amp; Girlings Head- Closer , Kay . First she paint the edges with the leather dye , since the leather as apparent above is not dyed through and- to paint now is the best way to ensure that the edges are covered properly . Subsequently , the parts are put together one after another , first with glue which makes it easier to stitch , then with the sewing machine , and various reinforcements are fitted . Here its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attached . <p> At the sewing machine . I chose a- double row of stitches but without gimping ( the jagged edges that are common on shoes with brogueing ) , and since- I was there in person now I could also choose things like what kind of reinforcement to be made- at the opening , where I chose piping , and how much it would show . <p> Uppers finished closing . Daniel Wegan specs the uppers for the bespoke shoes different than the companys RTW shoes . For example , less fabric reinforcements is used at this stage , instead he puts in leather reinforcements later on , and the tape out at the edges is to give strength for when the- upper is being lasted . <p> The liner is on the bespoke shoes- generally made of one piece of leather , to minimize edges inside the shoe . However , that makes it a bit- trickier to fit in . <p> Here the lining is stitched to the upper , which is always what the seam in the top of the opening is for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the facings , while being kept at the heel area since its good to have to work with later on when the shoes are being lasted . <p> The shoes will- have a dark brown patina , and to avoid smearing of the lining- the tongue is- painted before the closing . <p> The uppers are- finished . The tongue is sewn just in the lining , also with a seam on the side a bit up to prevent it from moving . The dark spot- that 's visible at the bottom of the tongue on the lining is the- reinforcement stitches where the ends are burned away- so that they wont cause discomfort . <p> Now the- upper leather is sprayed with a mixture of water and softener , to spare the leather as much as possible during the lasting . <p> Daniel Wegan is lasting the upper . In the background is Andreas Reijers , the second Swede at- Gaziano &amp; Girlings bespoke department . <p> This lasting is- only on a provisional basis to ensure that the uppers- really fit and to let them- shaped a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the last at an earlier stage , the thick vegetable tanned leather is soaked completely and trimmed- roughly , attached and left to dry on the last to- gain the correct shape . <p> The- edges are trimmed closer . <p> Now the holdfast will be cut out , to which the welt seam will be made . First the- outside is prepared . <p> Then the inside . Since the plan is to make a relatively narrow waist- the holdwast is very tight at the waist area . Since a blind welt also will be made at the waist , it in itself means that the welt needs to be placed further in since its going to be covered by the outsole . <p> Daniel then make mark for each hole , - extra carefully at the toe , which is the weakest- point . Then he- takes an awl and pre-punch the holes . <p> The next step is to prepare the heel stiffeners . Large leather pieces , the same material as the insole , - is split , skived , rasped , glassed and sanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is one almost finished- while the other is just cut out . The stiffeners will go from the outside all the way through- the arch on the inside , almost up to the inner ball of the foot . Its about twice as long as regular- heel stiffeners for RTW shoes . <p> Tested on the last . <p> The heel stiffeners are brushed with paste , which is also brushed- between the upper and lining , then the stiffener is set in place . <p> Next- lasting is definitive , so to speak , so now the last is powdered to easier slide out when the shoe is finished . <p> First- Daniel last the back temporary , since- he knows that the stiffener tends to slide down a bit , then he releases the nails , fix the stiffener- and makes the final lasting . When the paste dries the stiffener hardens . Here you can see how what was left of the lining is- used to have something to- easily pull in when placing the upper . <p> Lasted a first round . The- leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folds remaining , and when its done- perfectly there will be a tighter line of nails than it is here . <p> Now- time for the front part of the shoe . Heres what will become the toe stiffeners , which will be prepared in a similar way as the heel stiffeners . <p> Here the lining is already lasted , now- the toe stiffener is pulled in place , its- pasted on- the inside . <p> The fibers of the stiffeners is compressed . You want- it to be strong and durable , while still being thin . At this time- the stiffener- is still damp , to help the lasting , - and the shoe will now rest a bit to let the stiffener dry before the upper is lasted . <p> When the stiffener- is dry its sanded to adhere better with the paste . <p> A clever tool to verify that the toe shape match between the shoes . Its used both when the last- is made , and now whe the toe stiffeners is put in place to ensure that they are equally thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tool is pressed onto one toe , then turned and compared on- the other , and any differences can be corrected . Eye measurements are not completely reliable , and- with the toes you want to be absolutely sure that they are correct . <p> Side backers is- made of a thinner leather than the stiffeners . Its a tedious process to get them- nicely thinned out towards the- edges and - the surface right so it adheres well , everything so that they should n't be visible on the finished shoe . <p> Being put in place ( it will be trimmed more ) . <p> Now the stiffener is pasted on outside and its time to last the upper as well properly here in the toe . Daniel Wegan tape the back part of the stiffener for it not to come- paste there , this means that the transition from the toe stiffener- becomes softer and there is less risk that- it pinches here . <p> Creases worked away during lasting . <p> When the whole shoe now is lasted its again left to dry a bit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flush with the last since the last has a concave shape here . Therefore a leather strip is stretched over this part to press the upper to the last . <p> Time for the welt seam . The material for the welts is split down to become a bit- thinner . <p> Two welts are cut out and prepared- in various ways. - Here a small channel where stitch will be is carved out . <p> The extra- leather is cut away for it to be clean and neat before the welt stitching is made . <p> A mark is made on where on the outside the awl to should come up , to help for the seam to become- neat and tidy . <p> Before the hand welting process the shoe is covered by a protective plastic , both to protect from- tools that will now begin to work on the outside of the shoe in a different ways , and also against splashes of paint and wax that will later be used on the sole and heel edge . Before the wrapping the shoe is washed clean with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to sit and fester under the plastic . <p> Daniel Wegan uses a linen thread for the welt stitch , where eight thinner threads are- twisted together using pitch , so that it becomes strong and durable . The pitch also makes the thread stick- very well , and not likely to come loose- even after years of strain . <p> Hand welting . As mentioned , the toe is the most sensitive since the stitches- becomes quite tight here , therefore its reinforced with an intertwined thread on the inside of the holdfast in this area . Although Daniel made holes in advance its necessary to use the awl to get the needles through in a good way . As needles he s using fishing line . <p> When the welt- is attached- its trimmed closer to - the upper . As apparent first a pencil is used to mark it . At the waist , the part that will be- hidden by the sole when a blind welt is made , Daniel is cutting of much more of the welt . <p> The welt hammered even . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back the same type of stitch as elsewhere is used only without the welt . Note how little of the edge that is left at the waist , but its well enough to sew the sole stitch here . Since- the stitches will be hidden under the outsole it- does n't  need to be especially tight and neat here . <p> In order not to have any unnecessary cavities the- back of the holdfast is filled with a thin strip- of leather . <p> The shank- that will make the waist stable is usually made of metal or wood , sometimes leather . For different reasons Daniel Wegan prefers metal , but a drawback is that if it comes loose a bit it can start to- creak . To avoid this , the shank is taped before being cemented in place <p> Shank cemented and the a first part of leather covering it is to be made , this will also strenghten the waist further and enhance the bevelled shape . Daniel is drawing with chalk on the shoe to mark where the first piece of leather will be located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalk and bashed a bit , so he can easily see the area to be cut out . <p> Here the piece is cut out and provisory in place . At the front its the skived down- for a seamless transition . <p> Another piece of leather is fitted , a little shorter one , here its was rasped and then grounded to the desired shape . When the waist is so slim , it would- look weird- if it would also be built up very high , so the- bevel we choosed to do is a bit more restrained . <p> As bottom filling- Gaziano &amp; Girling use felt for bespoke shoes . The options that are usually used are either felt or cork plate , in certain cases , leather , which all have different advantages and disadvantages ( cork paste- that is most common in RTW shoes are not so common on hand welted bespoke ) . <p> The entire bottom filling is done . <p> Now for the outsole . Gaziano &amp; Girling use oak bark tanned- soles from the- British tannery Baker . Before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The sole is also prepared in various ways before the attachment . At the waist its thinned out quite firmly towards the edges . <p> The thickness is controlled . <p> The soles are glued , on the edges and in the back a- synthetic neoprene that 's very strong is used . In the middle under the felt where it is not the same need for very high adhesion , a bit- less strong rubber based adhesive is used . It makes it a little easier to resole them . Note also that the outer edges of the back are not glued all . <p> As in almost all cases both surfaces to be assembled are cemented . <p> When the sole is fitted its hammered and pressed firmly . Here the waist is worked on to also get it shaped nicely . <p> A cut along the edges at the waist is made since- Daniel Wegan will use waist iron which is quite- sharply angled , so the waist is very thin towards the edges . <p> In the back at the heel area wooden pegs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two metal nails in the middle has just been placed there for keeping the sole in place- when it was attached , they will be removed . <p> Now its time for the sole stitch which attach the- welt and the outsole . An extra protective tape is placed along the edge . <p> The welt is marked where the stitches should be with a fudge wheel . I want , even though the shoes are pretty big , to have a quite tight sole stitch . The fudge wheel used is made for- 12 spi ( stitches per inch ) . <p> Daniel then marks- exactly where the stitches is to be made , it is easier to get a smooth straight stitch- this way . <p> Throughout the process the knives used are sharpened frequently . Good , sharp knives are a necessity . <p> The flap that will hide the sole stitch- is cut up . <p> The channel for where the sole stitch will be is carved out . <p> Here the sole stitch at the waist is made . As apparent its very tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible is to be made . Daniel here makes the holes- from below to avoid getting marks from- the awl in the upper , which- is common when a tight blind welt is made . As mentioned the seam does n't  need to be as precise since its going to be hidden , therefore it works to punch from below . <p> At the front , however , the awl goes in from above , and here 's the seam is considerably tighter . <p> In order to avoid the formation of folds when the flap is- put down over the channel its pressed first without glue , and will remain so for a while . <p> Neat stitching . <p> Now the flap is turned up again , glued with- the strong neoprene glue and then- flattened out again . <p> Pressed and hammered out . <p> Gentle hits with the back of the hammer- compresses the edges . <p> Sole edges trimmed . <p> The split lift which will- form the base of the heel is prepared . <p> Fitted on the shoe . <p> The heel is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed to make the heel- on the outside as straight and neat as possible . <p> Also the outer part of the heel is- compressed with the hammer to make it harder . Its made quite gently though , and overall Daniel use very little force in the making of the shoes . He does things smooth , soft and repeatedly , this way its easier to see what happens and do n't  make any mistakes . <p> Another thing that is made constantly- during the manufacturing process is that the shoes are compared with each other to be made completely identical.When the heels are f+rdigbyggda they may be under pressure overnight . Daniel Wegan based tabs with adhesive , it is less durable than glue but gives no white stripes , because he prefers it . However , used strong neoprenlimmet of the pieces at the bottom , then they must sit properly . <p> The- top piece in rubber is attached . <p> When the heels are built- they are put under pressure overnight . Daniel Wegan builds the heel with paste , its not as strong as- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers it . However , the strong neoprene glue is used for the top pieces , since they must sit very tight . Each layer is also nailed . <p> The day after , its time to tidy it all up. - Here he marks where the heel is going to end . <p> With a stitch prick he presses down between each stitch to tighten the sea further . <p> Then again with fudge wheel . <p> Trimming . <p> The waist iron shapes the edges at the waist . <p> Here you can see how sharp the angle is on the waist iron . <p> The shoeis at this stage- completely built , its just cosmetics remaining . <p> The bottom of the heel is glassed and sanded down , since you want to remove the outer part of the grain that would otherwise easily- crack . <p> I choose Gaziano &amp; Girlings standard decoration nail pattern in the heel , five . They are hammered in a bit , the- head is cut off , then sanded smooth and hammered in the fully . <p> An iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges . <p> The edges are rubbed with soap . To go over the edges with this means that the fibers are compressed and any irregularities emerge and can be corrected in time . It also makes the irons slide easier . <p> Rubbing , rubbing . <p> Edge ironing of the sole edge . This is a little wider than the final edge iron to be used , since an upper rimwill be made later and then the will sole edge will be slightly thinner . <p> The outer portion of the grain is glassed away from the sole . <p> A scraper for access below- the breast of the heel . <p> Sanded . <p> The sole is taped with masking tape to protect the edges when stained , and also when- the patina will be made . <p> Sole edge dye is brushed on . <p> The paint is heated in with hot irons . <p> The rim on top of the welt edge is carved out . With the last edge iron it will be highlighted further . <p> Wax is rubbed- on , also- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this layer . Turpentine for everything to dissolve easily and go into the leather . <p> Heated in . <p> Also the top of the welt is waxed and a hot fudge wheel run over it . The wax is not just for aesthetics , it also protects . <p> Now- time for the slightly thinner edge iron- where you on the left side here can see how it is made in two stages . <p> The end result if done right looks like this. - This small detail gives a neater impression of the sole edge , and is relatively difficult to do well . <p> Here are the decoration on the heel , the series of small strokes that nearly all classic shoes have . <p> The protective plastic cover is cut off . Its made with a heated knife , - both to easily cut off the plastic but also for the part remaining on the shoe to shrink in a bit and disappear . <p> Clean upper , even if it is light in color , thanks to- the protective plastic . <p> Neus Benavent is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Savile Row in London , and is also doing much of their patina . She will paint my shoes in a dark brown patina they call Canyon . First- she 's always testing the color on the inside back of one of the shoes , to see how the leather reacts . Its also left to dry a bit so she can determine- the leathers characteristics . <p> here 's the first base layer is nearly done . <p> A further base layer is made before this step when the shading is done and they start to get their final hue . All the time very little color on the brush is used , which is n't even dipped into the paint but only takes dye- from a paper towel as which has brushed it- on there . Its painted - with small quick strokes . <p> When the patina is is done the tape is taken off from the sole and the neutral sole finish- I want is to be done . Its treated with a cream called gum which gives a hard , semi-gloss , neutral surface . <p> A dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , for a neater transition between the edges and the sole . <p> Then the shoes are polished with cream and wax polish . The lasts are pulled , - a sock liner inserted , and also- sunken toe taps- are installed . After that the shoe are finished . <p> In a week or so the last post in this series will be published , with an extensive photo cavalcade of the finished shoes and a summary of it all .

With a price tag of G200 its an interesting alternative in- the lower price range of quality shoes . <p> Herrstil- started their venture with their own- shoes- last spring with a campaign on Kickstarter ( which I wrote about in this post ) . It was hugely successful , the campaign got in a total of about- G7 500- and over 400 pairs of shoes was pre-ordered . The problem with this was that the small factory in Vietnam that was their partner had a hard time- producing- all the shoes ordered , plus as all the pairs- that Herrstil- wanted to make for the proper- launch of more models etc on their site , which the Kickstarter campaign would be the start of . Therefore , during the summer they changed the factory so that the shoes now launched are manufactured on a larger factory in India . Its still the same last , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good arch support , and with the same specifications such asleather board heel stiffeners and slightly bevelled waist . The leather will not come from the Russian tannery- as with the- Kickstarter-made shoes , but now from an Indian tannery in the same city as the factory , which is of much- higher standard than many other tanneries in the country . The leather used is a fine crust leather from smaller calves with a very tight grain . The brown leather is still painted by hand but in a more thorough process , which should make the color last longer . <p> Full brogue , one of the new models now being launched . <p> The models being launched were some part of the Kickstarter campaign , these are an adelaide , a semi brogue and a plain cap toe oxford . All these are available in dark brown and black leather , the former two also in medium brown suede . In addition they 're also releasing several new models , a full brogue , a chukka and a chelsea boot . Most of them are available in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above but also in some cases cognac colored leather and dark brown suede . The boots have a version of Dainite rubber soles . The price of the low shoes is about G200 ( 1 999 SEK ) , the boots will cost around G240 ( 2 399 SEK ) . Most models are available in- stock now , a few will arrive- in the next few weeks . I 've tried the first round with the Kickstarter shoes made in Vietnam , I found them as having a good quality- for the price , and I will also get- home a pair from the new factory , which will then be reviewed here on Shoegazing later on . 
@@109465387 @4865387/ <h> Report Il Micio / Hidetaka Fukaya <p> 2016-07-06 <p> In the central parts of the shoemaking city- Florence the self-willed- Japanese Hidetaka Fukaya , aka Il Micio , has his showroom . He makes shoes with a very special look and is not afraid to experiment wildly . Shoegazing has- paid him a visit . <p> Hidetaka Fukaya began his career in the shoe world under- Shigetaro Matsuda at a shoe designer school- in the Japanese city Nagoya . In the early 00s he left Japan to develop himself further , and ended up in Italy and Sienna with bespoke shoemaker Alessandro Stella , - well established but quite unknown for- big masses . Here- Fukaya joined as an apprentice for three years . The most common is then that you start to work for some of the more established of the Italians , or to return home to Japan to start your- own business there . Hidetaka Fukaya instead in 2005 opened up his own workshop in Florence , known for its craft tradition and with a relatively large number of bespoke shoemakers in the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often very special creations under the name Il Micio , the cat . <p> The showroom . <p> Shelf with bespoke samples . <p> Single monks in some unusual colours of alligator leather . <p> Today Hidetaka Fukaya has a showroom north of the Arno River that goes- through Florence , quite centrally located . Fukaya is wearing a white relatively dirty artist coat , on the tip of the nose is a pair of thick black glasses . Around the showroom are various cat sculptures , different accessories which he also manufactures are on display , and then there 's a high shelf with around 20 bespoke samples . At the top stands his most famous work , a light brown wholecut made on a last- that looks like taken out of a Salvador Dali painting . Most who see it- often reacts saying that- its ugly and weird . This is really not relevant , its a shoe that is designed to challenge the aesthetic and the craftsmanship . The latter is what impresses me the most , to do this kind of shoe is very difficult . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice craftmanship . <p> Most of Hidetaka Fukayas other shoes are characterized by his- particular style , with long , pointed and quite flat lasts- and often special designs and leather choices . As often when looking at sample shoes meant for display the- level of craftsmanship is a bit mixed , one can almost see which of them were made early in his career , and which are later works , when they reached a higher level . Overall , however , it is really nicely made shoes , delicate in its design and whether you appreciate the look or not , you cant get away from its special character .

@@109465393 @4865393/ <h> The tip Stretch shoes yourself <p> 2016-09-01 <p> The subject of stretching shoes- has been featured several- times here on the blog , its really the only way to make- small shoes larger . here 's a tip on how to take care of the shoe stretching yourself . <p> As- most people know the common way to stretch shoes is to have a cobbler put the shoes in a stretching machine- pushing out the shoes in the places where they are too small . The stretching lasts- are- increased gradually , and the leather is treated with moisturizing agents to handle the stress better . However , in some cases when it comes to shoes that are- a bit too small at- only one or a few specific places , - a DIY shoe stretching can be a- good alternative . <p> These shoes from Gaziano &amp; Girling squeezed a little bump in the big toe on the right foot . It was resolved with its own variant of loading only at that particular point . <p> If you look closely at the picture you see to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly at the inner part of the vamp , compared to- the left shoe . The following describes how I went about it . This is something I came up with myself and tried on a pair of shoes with successful results , and since then I do it every now and then on shoes that needs slight modifications to fit . Here I will show the procedur for- two pairs of shoes that were too tight over the right foots big toe lump , a place I 'm extra sensitive to since I have- a so-called juvenile hallux valgus , and a pair where it squeezed a bit- on the pinky- toes . In other words- the fit was okay at the time , and the very fact that it has only been a minor correction that had to be made was why I tried this own way to stretch the shoes . In addition , the cobblers stretching machine can- be somewhat limited when it comes to stretching only at a specific location , then this kind of homemade solution offers a bit more precision . <p> What 's needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits- well in the shoe to be stretched ( especially important is that they sit tight in the specific area that you want to stretch ) , Compeed or similar plasters made for sore feet ( you have- different sizes to choose from ) , and any so-called felt- rings ( which are used to reduce pressure on corns ) . The latter two are available at- any pharmacy at- the podiatry shelf . It can also be useful to- moisture the area to be stretched , both inside and outside , either with a leather lotion or with stretching spray , which softens the leather a bit , before you insert the modified- shoe trees <p> At the pharmacy you will find felt rings and plasters , which works great if you want to modify a pair of shoe trees a little bit to push out the shoes in a certain place . <p> And this shows how I made such an extension on the shoe trees for- the shoes that where tight against- the little toes . <p> What you do is simply to build up a bulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the felt rings and its smaller- central parts in- the bottom if its a greater size- to be built , and then put plasters on top of it , or just build with plasters . If you want to stretch them quite a bit , it may be an idea to start a bit smaller , and then expand it over time once- the leather already has been stretched a bit . In contrast to the stronger stretching method- made by a cobbler , this is a method that- requires- a bit more time . You- simply let the shoes sit with the trees- with this self-developed distance attached , and over time the leather will give . For me , it has taken a few- of days- before you noticed a difference , but I have since kept the bulges on for several months and finally the shoe is pretty settled- at the critical place , and they fit quite comfortably without pressing any longer . That said , this is , something that should only be used for minor corrections of the fit at some individual places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit to the- cobbler will always be the best option . <p> S0me more pictures to show how I have done this. - Heres- the store Skoaktiebolagets own trees , which fits very good and tight in Gaziano &amp; Girlings shoes , and thus works well for this method . Here I 've only used a few blister plasters for the build-up .. <p> Another angle than the image shown at the top , where you can also see that the bulging part of the shoe to the left at the- outside ball area . <p> A pair of- Vass on the F last , where I 've had the same problem as with the shoes from G&amp;G , which pressed against the inner ball . Here I used a felt ring , two small central parts felt rings that work well for this purpose , as well as a thicker plasters . In the picture , they just turned on , when put in the shoes and been there awhile pressed felt rings together and the bulge will not be quite as strong as it looks here . <p> A picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little bulge on the right shoe- on the inside . <p> Finally the rumble with my Vass double Monks on the U-last , here 's the lasted shoe trees after I 've put on felt pieces and plasters at the pinky toe area . <p> A top view where you can see if you look closely- that it just below the toe cap on the outside of the shoe , its- pushed out a little bit of bulge from the shoe trees . When you do this kind of attachments on the trees- they become a bit- trickier to get out , since chafing patches of rubber material means increased- friction . Wiggling it a bit and the shoe trees usually comes out- pretty easy though , and I have not had any major problems with this .

@@109465395 @4865395/ <h> In depth RTW and fit <p> 2016-03-26 <p> Good fit is the single most important feature- of a shoe , even so , a lot of people wear shoes that fits- quite bad . Its , to generalize a bit , usually because of a- combination of a lack of knowledge about how a shoe should fit and due to the fact that Ready to Wear shoes are built to fit as many feet as possible . here 's a walkthrough of common- problems regarding fit that one usually see . <p> When industrialization and the McKay and Goodyear machines enabled the mass production of shoes a hundred years ago or so , shoes- became- cheaper and more available . Mass production means , however , that you make- generic lasts which is- designed so that they can work for many peoples feet as possible and are also adjusted to current- aesthetic preferences . This complicates the chance to- find shoes that are really good in fit . The next major revolutionary change occurred with the Internet , and the ability to buy shoes at a distance ( some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of todays- e-commerce business ) . Suddenly , customers- had no opportunity to try the shoes before purchasing , and didnt- get help from a person who knows how a shoe should fit ( although there has been a decline in this matter , where shoe shop staff often are poorly educated , and more focused on selling shoes than selling shoes that fit well ) . This has meant that more and more people walk around with shoes that are a bad fit . <p> To receive help from a knowledgeable person when trying on shoes is the best way to find a good fitting RTW shoe . Picture : Permenent Style <p> The most common mistake is something we learn already in our childhood , when a shoe fit is measured by pressing the- shoes front to know how much space you have in front of your shoes . Its an extremely gross simplification of measuring the fit of a shoe , and in adulthood where the shoes are not growing anymore and toe shapes- are very different it really is quite- irrelevant , although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard designed to- last . But the measure that really matters when it comes to length is the distance of the heel to the ball- ( the shoe widest point ) . A shoes flex point , where its made to be bent , - should- be in the same place as the ball of the foot , where the foot is made to be bent . To put it simple , - the widest point of the foot should be placed at the widest point of the shoe . How much space you have in front of the toe then depends on the type of shoe and its toe shape . A long narrow last with a pointed toe may have four to five centimeters , a blunt Budapester last just one centimeter , and both could- still be the correct length-wise . <p> When it comes to width , its a problem that more and more manufacturers now only offer lasts in a single width , or have a limited number of models in other widths . Back in the days- it was standard to have maybe five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some who are good , Allen Edmonds is one example , JM Weston another , Churchs is still fairly good , plus a few more , but they are exceptions ) , but the efficiency and the need to cut production costs have made the offerings of different widths smaller and smaller . This means that the chance to find a shoe that is correct in both length and width is smaller today . Another problem is that width often is- measured ( as mentioned before on this blog ) - the wrong way , when you use the measurement of how broad the foot is at the widest point , a two dimensional measurement . Sure , it can provide guidance , but the correct way is to measure the circumference of the foots widest point , this is where a lasts- width is measured . <p> A shoe with too much space over the ball , which makes for a lot of excessive leather which digs into the foot ( bad image quality I know , but hope you get an idea anyway ) . Picture : Styleforum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly conclude that the instruments used to both guide for net orders- and in physical stores are inadequate . Most often one measures only the length , and if one also takes width its almost always only just how broad the foot is , not the girth . Just think how one often is measured in a shoe store , where the standard is to have a form of calipers to measure the foot length . That 's it . A cobbler can have a plate that measure both feet , and how broad- they are . This can serve as initial guidance and then a skilled person can then determine how well the shoe fits once tried on , but a person who only has those measurements to- go on does not have a lot on their- feet ( pun intended ) to find a shoe that fits . However , with a Brannock instrument that measures the heel to ball length- and a tape measure you can - find out quite a lot about a foot . <p> Instep and arch is a little more complicated to explain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instep- is basically the upper part of the foot between the ball- and the ankle . One can have a high , low or normal instep , to simplify things a bit . Generally it aligns with the arch , those with a- high instep also have a high arch , while a person with low instep- has flat feet . Its logic in a sense , the- bones and muscles of a foot are in a certain way in everyones feet , and then it can be placed at different heights , but relations between them are usually- the same . The most common way to determine if the shoes instep is good for ones feet are , especially when it comes to oxfords , that you look at how the laces are closed . If its a large or small gap between the lace opening . Now we are there again , certainly , it can give some guidance and an extreme in any direction is not good , but otherwise its quite- irrelevant . As an example one can have a- " moderate " gap of half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the lower part- of the instep and therefore its not right for that persons- feet . This goes together with where- the shoes flex point is , in that example , its likely that the shoes flex point is further back than the foot . <p> If you have a very high instep a derby often works better than an oxford when it comes to fit . In fact , the various shoe types- once been developed to satisfy two different foot types , Oxfords for people with lower instep and derbys for those with high insteps . Then with time we have developed cultural and aesthetical principles , such as the norm that oxfords are more formal than derbys . An oxford and derby in the same last and- the same size and width can fit differently . A monk shoe can differ , not to mention- a loafer . And it can vary between different types of leather , between suede and smooth leather of course , but also different thickness of the smooth leather can affect and so on . As an example , cordovan leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to being damaged by stretching , which makes the fit a little looser . But then cordovan does- not stretch as much as calf , creating additional parameters to consider . <p> As for the arch , this is one of the main areas of concern when it comes to Ready to Wear shoes . It simply is difficult to make a last- that fits a wide range of feet . Therefore manufacturers almost always choose the easy way , and leave some extra space at the arch of the foot so that- those with lower instep- and thus flatter feet are able to comfortably wear the shoes , with the result that it does not really becomes really- good for anyone . For me who have a- bit higher instep than normal its very common with the- space- inside the shoe at the arch , which generates a lot of unnecessary creasing . Its not that its uncomfortable in a sense , but the leather creases unnecessarily and the- foot is not given proper support . Its most important with proper arch support for those who have a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arch , its important with good- support to avoid that the foot will start to drop . When doing bespoke- shoes- the design of the arch is one of the most important and time-consuming in manufacturing , and this is usually what a customer that only have worn RTW before reacts most about when they first put on a pair of shoes made for ones own feet . <p> here 's my pair of Gaziano &amp; Girling Cambridge , which are relatively comfortable and all , but look at the inside of the left foot and you can see how the arch of the shoe does n't  follow my foot at all . <p> One aspect worth mentioning is that the most important thing is of course to have a- shoe that is comfortable and is comfortable to walk in . Its number one when it comes to fit . Secondly its about having- a shoe that does not have too much leather somewhere , which- does not affect the comfort in the same way but has significance for how the shoe will age . Unnecessary space- allows more creases- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also correlate , one such example is when there is too much volume in the shoe at the ball , which means that there is an excess of leather that has no place else to go than the gather up- and press down on the foot and make it pinch at the root of the big toe , as you can- see in the picture above . <p> Next fit aspect to address is the shoes opening , in short the hole where you place- the foot . It should be- tightened evenly around the foot without gaps . Gaps do that there might be glitches , and again , unnecessary folds . However if the heel is loose it- often has to do with whether the instep is right or not in the shoe , rather than if you have a narrow heel . And a shoe is always hard in the beginning , especially Goodyear welted and even more if it has double soles .

I am wondering for a first time high-quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted ( i.e. can only buy online ) , how do you recommend arriving at a reasonably comfortable first choice ? I have become wiser after a few purchases , but I remember starting off without a clue . Now , I have several other men asking me how , and I do n't  have a lot of practical advice . Originally , I sent my foot length/width measurements to various companies asking for help , and was told repeatedly that they were not able to make recommendations based on those measurements . So I just scratched my head , used a Google converter to get a rough estimate of my shoe size , and hoped for the best . About 4 pairs of shoes later , I am finally wising up . For someone who is buying online , what 's the best tip(s) you can offer ? Thank you ! <p> Johnatan : My best suggestion is to always have an exchange calculated into ones time frame and budget of a purchase . And to be ready to choose another last/model/brand if it does n't  work . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's good in fit . The problem is often that we want the new shoes NOW , but if you look into the fact that you 'll probably wear your new purchase for many years , a few weeks or months waiting time to achieve a good result is often worth it . Apart from this , knowing which size you wear in different brands , getting to know your feet in this sence , it always helps , which you have experienced . I 'd say there 's no really working shortcuts unfortunately . <p> Hello Jesper , I have the same problem you are describing where the leather is pinching my toes when walking and bending the feet on one of my shoes . Will this go away or should i return the shoes ? I really love them , they fit perfectly expect just this problem . thanks for any advice

Here are explanations of some of the different terms that are often mixed up . <p> The article- series that followed all parts of the process of ordering- a pair of bespoke shoes- from Gaziano &amp; Girling , from the measuring up through several fittings to the production of the final shoes . here 's a summary and many pictures of the finished goodies . <p> A tight sole stitch is not something that necessarily makes the shoe better from a purely qualitative point of view , but a very sparse ones looks quite dull , and a very tight hand-sewn one such as the one in the picture is impressive craftsmanship . <p> To do anything extra big or tiny has for some reason always interested people .

As expected , the competition was really hard , but we 've got a winner of the shoe care package from- Springyard Shoe Therapy with a value of over G1100 , and a winner of the shoe cream- and polish from the same brand . <p> More than 15 people tried- to sort out the differences between the shoes on the various image pairs were ( and then about another 50 people signed up for the newsletter , which is really great . Of course you can continue to register for that , form is available below ) . Some answered only some of them , but most had given answers to all five questions . Here I sequentially go through the answers to the questions , and hopefully you can learn something out of it , and maybe it can also provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same does not always need to be . What- you should- look for was some more or less significative construction or finishing detail that distinguishes the- shoes on or- around the sole . If you missed the event but still want to guess yourself the first post can be found here . <p> We begin with the picture pair no. 1 . It was - a pair of shoes from Saint Crispins , and also a pair of shoes from Maftei , where the top of the- welt- was what you- should look closely at . Several of you contestants were close at giving the correct answer , but actually no one was completely right . Saint Crispins sews the sole stitch with machine , - but it was as I wrote in the last post not what you should look for , but the fact that they first have stitched the sole stitch and then rolled over it with a fudge wheel to get to the decorative markings . One can see- that its only decoration on the dimples- not following even with the stitches , which I marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> The stitches and the markings from the fudge wheel are n't  even , just done for decoration . Picture : Manolo <p> The idea of a fudge wheel is that when you sew by hand you choose a wheel with the distance you want the stitch to be , heats the tool and then drag it over the edge to get marks for stitches . After the stitches are done you run the wheel over the welt again in the same manner , to push down the stitches and further improve the look . What- Saint Crispins is doing here , and what virtually all factory-made shoes using fudge wheel does , is to imitate this mainly for the sake of appearance . <p> On the other picture there was a shoe from Maftei : <p> Here you can see how the markings look different . <p> Maftei does n't  use a fudge wheel , but a so-called stitch prick . Its a tool with a flat tip , - almost like a large flat screwdriver , which one makes the markings with one by one . Its- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course very much more time consuming than just making decorative patterning with a fudge wheel ) and has the advantage of pressing the stitches even more , and really pulls them in further , even if it in a way may be easier than using a fudge wheel on top of the stitches again when it is immediately evident if you miss the markings made before . You can also use fudge wheel before stitches , and after stitching go over with a stitch prick . You can see that- Maftei just used a stitch prick by the fact that the- markings both go so close to the upper , which can be difficult with a fudge wheel , that the markings are so defined , and that the slots are a bit biased and not sticking straight out , so to speak , plus does n't  keep- exactly the same angle all along the edge . <p> Two different versions of stitch pricks . They are curved to easier access closer to the upper . Picture : DW Frommer II/Styleforum <p> Many of you were considering- the fudge wheel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pin-point that they did not use a fudge wheel but- a stitch- prick . <p> We proceed with picture pair no. 2 . This was obviously- an easier question , several- of you contestants had the right answer here . It was about how waists are built , where two variants of what is popularly called- fiddle waists were displayed . here 's the first picture : <p> The shoes from- Cheaneys Imperial range . <p> These- waisst arent- built up all the way into the heel area , but as you can see- the ridge- flattens out before the heel base . This is done since- you otherwise need to build the heel by hand , at least in part , the layers closest to the sole need to be built around the built-up from the- fiddle waist . Almost all RTW manufacturers use pre-built heels , including premium brands like Gaziano &amp; Girling and Edward Green , then it needs to be flat in the entire heel- area before it is attached . Here is a picture that shows how Cheaney makes this waist , a ready-made leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front part of the waist . Picture : Cheaney <p> Next shoe was from Paolo Scafora : <p> A different waist . Picture : Noveporte <p> This is still what is commonly referred to a fiddle waist where your the ridge- is more marked , but here as you- can see the build-up go all the way into the heel base . Here they have built the heel by- hand with the first- layers being- wreaths around the build-up- before it is covered up and flat heel lifts are attached . Again , its more time consuming to do it this way , but also the function that a fiddle waist may have , to give extra stability , becomes much more evident- when the shoe is built like this . On a shoe with a waist like- Cheaneys above it at most- marginally makes the waist stronger , its more about appearance . A heel like- Paolo Scaforas looks like this when being made , compared with the Cheaney image above : <p> Layers of in this case cork builds up the waist here , and it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlaced <p> We move on to the third image pair , where it was the edges of two waists to be examined . The first shoe was from Antonio Meccariellos top- range- Aurum , and looked like this : <p> What Meccariello does- is to place the seam a little deeper into welt- and then push up the welt- and the sole edge over- the stitches so that they are more or less hidden . It can get quite nice , and its very common among both more sophisticated RTW brands and even among bespoke makers . Here you can see it a little more clearly made on a shoe for his cheaper Argentum line : <p> This is what it looks like after Antonio has pushed up the edge against the upper . Its usually done by hammering and pressing the shaft of the hammer against it . <p> He lifts the edge a bit to show the sole stitch . Pictures : Meccariello <p> This method is , once- again , a simplification of the more difficult method used to hide the seam , called a- blind welt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the other image : <p> here 's a blind welt waist . <p> Here you let a- wider piece of the sole be retained and then you turn it over the welt- and conceals both that and the seam . A relatively advanced method that more or less requires a hand sewn sole stitch- to put it really close to the upper- ( also Meccariellos sole stitch- above is stitched by hand though ) . The reason I used- this particular image above is that this appears slightly clearer since- it has become a bit rough- where the folded sole- piece- meets the welt- at the end of the waist . <p> At the lower part of the sole edge here you can see the part of the sole that sticks out , which later will be folded over the welt . Picture : Hiro Yanagimachi <p> Some of you had written the- right answer on this question . Some also believed that Hiro Yanagimachi used the method I described that Meccariello does , maybe since if you look really close at Meccariellos shoe you can see a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two different sole bottoms- that should be examined , where the difference was the different ways to make a closed channel for the sole stitch . The first was from Italigente who- uses insoles with an already pre-cut channel , who enters from the side of the sole . Therefore , the sole is completely flat underneath and you cant see the- channel . <p> A very well hidden channel . <p> On this pic you can see how it looks when this type of sole goes through the manufacturing : <p> The pre-cut flap is opened . Here you have soles in different sizes and the flap goes a long way into the sole to make it work for many different shoes . <p> The advantage of this kind of closed channel- is of course that- its smooth and tidy , the downside is that they may go up a little easier if you for instance kick to the edge of the sole , then the opening of the- channel- is located on the edge . <p> On the other picture was a shoe from Carmina , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the edge . One can see it glued together at the arrows below : <p> These type of- channels are in factories often made by machine , but otherwise it is cut up by hand . Here the channel is- a bit- more visible , but depending on the angle from which you cut the channel it can hold together- a bit better . This question was a little harder than I thought , even if some of you were correct , I would have thought that more people would pick it . <p> The last question however no one gave the correct answer for . Suppose you had missed the important part that it would also look at the finish . Many guessed different variations of how broad the sole edge was , other on- in differences in the toe spring- ( which may be said not anything to do with design or finish of the sole area ) , and more . But its imply about a small detail on the heel of each shoe . We start by looking at the first picture in the enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Picture : Crownhill Shoes <p> And picture two , of a Loake Aldwych shoe : <p> Now if you look really close at this pic you should be able to spot it . Its about finishing <p> The heel of the Crownhill shoe is completely clean , just sanded and painted , they have not done anything more than that . On Loake , however , theyve made a decorative pattern- and drawn a wheel that makes- small vertical marks along the entire upper part of the heel . A very small detail , but the fact is that it is a clear majority of all the classic shoes that has this . Go through your own shoe collection abd you 'll see , probably at least 80% of your shoes has this type of decoration . Personally I- actually react pretty much on a shoe like Crownhills , I think- it looks a little bare , empty . But its so clear that one are so accustomed to it to be a decoration there . <p> Then we have the hindsight of the competition , so over to whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent in your answers . As I already mentioned no one had all questions correct , both to question 1 and 5 , no one gave the correct answer to . There were a few who had three right , and of them there was one that was closer to give the correct answer to question no. 1 , and therefore I appointed him to be the winner .

I was just wanting to give another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bespoke shoemaker , I was far more concerned about the stitching on the vamp/quarters than the lack of detail on the heel = Having the outer row of stitching drift and break out the edge of the leather , then overcorrect and nearly crash into the inner row = If I was the advertising manager for Crownhill , I 'd never have used that shoe as a promo example . I hope it was n't the best they could find . The Loake Aldwych shoe , on the other hand has very precise , neat stitching in the photo and instills more confidence in their ( hopefully ) overall approach to quality .

One of them are- Shell Cordovan , named after the product they are specialized in , based in the Tuscany , Italy . <p> Shell Cordovan is a family owned business that has existed since the 80s , in the small community of Santa Croce which houses many different kinds of tanneries . Its ideally located along the river Arno- about halfway towards the Ligurian Sea from Florence . The environment is extremely important for a tannery , it would probably not be possible to move Shell Cordovan elsewhere . The water , the air , the bark from the forests around here , its all important ingredients for the end result , Maxim Bobrikov says , International Sales Manager at the company . Shell Cordovan has always exclusively worked with horsehides , with the main focus being on cordovan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes called horse front ) from the horses back and culatta who also is from the horses rump , but the outer grain part . As I 've written- earlier here on the blog- one thing that is special about shell cordovan is that its essentially a muscle , the membrane below the outer grain portion of the skin , giving it its special character . <p> Raw horse hides ready to start the treatment to become cordovan and avancorpo . <p> One of the drums in the tannery . <p> Hides- drying . <p> Later in the tanning process . <p> Here the dye has been applied , and the final finish remains . <p> So a finished skin from Shell Cordovan , in the shade Cranberry . <p> Shell Cordovan has for many years sold a lot of their- cordovan to domestic and European shoe manufacturers , but also exported- to Japan , USA and Canada . In recent years- as mentioned the- interest in cordovan has increased- enormously , not least from shoe manufacturers , which means that it is increasingly difficult for many smaller players to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds largest supplier of the leather type . Although Shell Cordovan also sells to some bigger players its- now mainly the smaller producers they are targeting now in order to grow further , with a business model that makes it easy to buy small quantities and with a good , close- service . Its one of our strengths , we are easy- and flexible to work with , both in terms of purchasing but also in what we offer for the product , Maxim Bobrikov says . <p> Shoes in two different shades of cordovan from Shell Cordovan , made by the Russian brand Migliori . Picture : Migliori <p> The supply of cordovan from the tannery is relatively wide . The largest part is- of course the usual cordovan-skin , an oval portion of one side of the horses but- which is- big as a hall carpet , from- Shell Cordovan you can also get it in different thicknesses . They offer a special variant called Double Shell which is both cordovan- parts linked- together with an interconnecting part that runs over the horses tail . A skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest from for example belt manufacturers who want to avoid having to splice the pieces to get- the full length . This is one of the- fascinating things- with cordovan leather , that its so special . For example , there 's only certain kinds of horses breed whose hides are suitable for making cordovan , we get them mainly from Poland , where we have good contacts , and to some extent from Venezuela . But even then , its many skins that you have to- give up to make cordovan from during the course of the process , when for various reasons you find that the skin is not suitable , - Maxim says . <p> The special double shell hides . <p> Shell Cordovans skins are a bit cheaper than Horweens , they- cost around G58/sq . Feet . Just as Horweens cordovan ( and basically all other cordovan tanneries in Italy , Poland , Japan and Argentina , where most of them are based ) the tanning process is completely vegetable , and about 100 different steps are reviewed before they are ready cordovan-hides . Shell Cordovans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the Cordovan layer , the muscle membrane , is almost twice as thick . Its a bit more- dry in nature , but they have- recently started to use more oils and waxes in the final treatment which makes it approach the character Horweens hides has . And many shoe manufacturers appreciate their- hides and think that they are suitable for footwear , not least for the chunkier shoe styles . Shell Cordovan is still a very small tannery , but the ambition is to continue the journey that now has begun . We can and want to- grow . And when we get the production up we will also be able to reduce prices further , hoping to- make cordovan more accessible and give more people the opportunity to own products in the material . <h> You may also like <h> 4 comments <p> Thank you very much for this post !

@@109465404 @4865404/ <h> In depth Feet changes <p> 2016-02-28 <p> I often talk about that fit is the single most important thing when it comes to shoes . An aggravating factor when it comes to this topic is that our feet are in constant change , they change the size through the years , from season to season , and even during the day . here 's a little more about this fact . <p> Our feet are in many ways one of the body parts that are exposed to the toughest strain . Large parts of the day they carry up all our weight , we walk and stand , we run and bang them in hard things . Day after day , month after month , year after year . There 's no ones- feet that look the same when you 're 70 years as they did when you were 50 or when you were 25 . Most feet becomes flatter and wider , but not always so much larger in circumference , which is important to distinguish . The feet are also affected by our weight , which many including myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet also does in almost all cases , they simply become fatter . Similarly they reduces in size with weight loss . <p> All these circumstances can make- shoes that once fit- really good become quite bad in fit a few years later . And over time , its not unusual that you- actually get to start buying shoes in a size other than you 're used to . I have , for example , gone up- from a standard size EU44/UK10 a couple of years ago to EU45/UK10,5 as standard , although in some cases it can work with to go up in the width- instead . This of course collaborates- with the fact that I in the same period went from size 50/150 to 54/154 when it comes to jackets- and suits . <p> Shoes that once fits good that can become a bad fit with the feet changing over time is not unusual . Top picture : Irysching <p> The climate also affects the size of our feet . As a generalization , they are smaller- during the cold winter months while they swell during the hot summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear comfortable during winter , spring and autumn can be experienced as really tight on a hot summer day , so tight that you get pain when you use- them . I usually have a few pairs that quite simply gets put away when its summer , they are simply too tight , so there is no point in squeezing the feet into them . <p> But its not only over time that the feet vary in size and shape . During a- day , a lot happens . Generally , your feet swell during the day- and are a bit larger in size- in the evening when you come home after work and used the- feet for a whole day , which led to blood and fluid accumulated in them to a greater extent . But also what you do affects them . If you lay- down and rest an hour the feet will shrink . If you go up and down stairs or visit- the gym or go out running they swell . Likewise they collect a lot of fluid when traveling , which is- why many have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight began is hardly able to put on- when you land . These shifts during the day is obviously the- most difficult to adapt to , but what you can do is to try to be a bit predictive- and for example if you know you 're doing something that feet often swell of- you choose some shoes that are more spacious . That its for- bespoke shoemakers is ideal that customers- use test shoes for a few days is partly because of the fact that you want to see- how the shoes feel even with fluctuations , not only in one fixed size so- to say . Likewise , there are many who prefer to take measurements later in the day , for the customer to have a little more swollen feet so you do n't  measure when they are at a minimum in size . <p> Overall , its about listening to how it feels , and then customize the conditions to that . Sometimes its easy to opt out some shoes at some situations , sometimes its necessary to make modifications at your cobbler , sometimes it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit anymore , and so on .

A reflection on why its like this in- todays post . <p> I write a lot here on Shoegazing about how one can , and should , adapt the fit of RTW shoes in terms of various minor or major interventions so that they fit as good as possible . Here is another such tip on how to give more or less space at the instep , and the best part is that it takes a minute to fix and all you need is your shoelaces . <p> One of the leading stores in the world of classic shoes for men , Leffot in New York , will open up a new store in Chicago this fall . Great news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people behind Leffot are doing things the right way . <p> It is perhaps the most famous individual kind of leather , the hides of Russian reindeer skin that divers found on the ship- Metta Catharina which sank in 1786 .

This plus info on- a new Tumblr version of Shoegazing . <p> A question that pops up- every now and then- is whether it works to mix products from different brands of shoe care products . For some reason , its something many are reluctant to do , one often buys from one brand- and then think that you have to continue with that . That 's not the case , the answer is that it is perfectly possible to mix wildly .

@@109465426 @4865426/ <p> Above all I thought I 'd highlight the fact that shoes made of leather in simple terms has the ability to stretch as much as required . We can take an example , a person buys a plain cap toe oxford- which fits- tight over the widest part of the foot- and also above the instep . Not that they are too small , but tight . They take a while to break in , but after a dozen wears the- leather that has been under pressure from the foot has stretched out and they start to get really comfortable . Then we take another person , who buys the same model of- plain cap toe oxfords , but here they are instead almost are it a bit spacious , they are not tight at all- at- the shoes widest part or- over the instep , but it was not at all possible to go down in size or so , then they were- way too tight . His shoes will maybe stretch a tiny bit , but overall keeps the size when the pressure of the foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no need to stretch . <p> Thus , the shoe can stretch different amounts depending on the carrier and what his feet does to the shoes . Leather subjected to strong pressure from the feet that are tight in the shoes will let go- much more than leather that have feet that have been okay with space and not press against it in the same way . Its a generalization and many of the aspects I highlighted in the first post on the topic still affect , but overall it holds that tight shoes will stretch more than shoes that are loose , simply . Again , an example of how you can never say that " a shoe stretches about half the size " , since- the same shoe thus can stretch very differently depending on what it is exposed . <p> I- may also be worthwhile to talk a bit about how one affects this aforementioned stretching process with- use . I advocate that one should break in shoes- gently , use them at home for short periods initially to be gentle- both against shoes and feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above , as they are subject to something entirely different when one trots around leisurely at home , sits on the sofa and so on , compared to when you walk to work , walk around town , or similar . You should therefore have with you that if the shoe is on the verge of being a bit tight at any place and- does not give in at first , it can be changed when using them properly and they get stretched and strained more . With such pairs it may be worth to a short period at the beginning , for example , wear them to work where they might be going a lot , but then change into some comfortable old pair in the office- to- not strain your feet unnecessarily , and then put on the new ones for the journey home again . An excellent intermediate step between home use and regular use if you have shoes that need to stretch a- bit- more .

@@109465432 @4865432/ <h> The tip Mix shoe care brands <p> 2016-04-30 <p> A question that pops up- every now and then- is whether it works to mix products from different brands of shoe care products . For some reason , its something many are reluctant to do , one often buys from one brand- and then think that you have to continue with that . That 's not the case , the answer is that it is perfectly possible to mix wildly . <p> One explanation for this perception may be that many are taught that- cheaper shoe care products with silicone is n't too good for the shoes , and that you should remove these products from the shoe before putting on the silicone-free natural products that are better for the leather , since- otherwise it might not go into the leathers pores thoroughly . That 's correct , and is recommended . But once you get started with the silicone-free products its fine to use another such product from any brand . <p> To put it simple one- can say that virtually all the better shoe care products , such as Saphir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains almost exactly the same thing , just different mixtures of them . There are various natural waxes and oils for care and protection , as well as some sort of solvent , usually turpentine ( oil from pine trees ) . For pigmented cream or polish some sort of dye is used , the finest products contains- natural dyes , otherwise synthetic pigments are used . <p> Shoe care products not only are similar between brands today , they have been similar over many , many years . Picture : Executive Style <p> One can think this a bit like- if you have different cans of raspberry jam or similar . It- would n't be a- problem if you would mix the two jams into one , it would still taste like- raspberry jam and work great on the pancake . It might taste a bit different , maybe even be tastier together , at least it would be guaranteed to work . Its more or less the same thing- in both jars of jam , just different recipes . <p> So do not hesitate- to try products from different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suits your way to polish a lot better and you get a good shine faster than before . And you might notice that you get a really nice tone on that brown shoe if you mix- the shoe cream from this and that manufacturer . And so on .

Its in most cases a 15% discount , in some cases even more , so for those whove had their eyes on a pair- from the British premium manufacturer- may find that the time is- now . Also tips about final sales with 50% discounts at both J. FitzPatrick Footwear and A Fine Pair of Shoes . <p> The reasons that Skoaktiebolaget- will stop selling the famous- British brand , which just about a year ago was a real big seller for the store , are several . It is partly about the fact that the store has experienced more and more problems with late deliveries , errors on shoes that came , lack of communication , and more . It has according to info from other sources- been- relatively turbulent at Edward Green for sometime , where no less than five people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly- can be part of the reason why- Sko-AB and also some other retailers experienced difficulties . At the same time it should be said that there are shops that have not noticed any problems at all . And that Skoaktiebolaget reduced its sales in EG has certainly also to do with the fact that the brand since last summer set fixed prices for the American market that also European stores must abide , so the advantageous deduction of the Swedish VAT for US customers have disappeared , plus maybe also that the group MTO opportunities which Sko-AB- made a lot of from EG has been limited . Anyway , the people behind the store felt- that they could not continue the relationship , and now they sell away the last pairs from them at discounted prices . <p> Instead of the regular price of G1 070 ( 9 900 SEK ) now the majority of shoes are down to G900 ( 8 375 SEK ) a discount of 15% . In most cases , - there 's also quite a few- sizes left . Then they have some that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , but then- there are only one size- left . Since- Edward Green relatively rarely are found on sale , it may be time to strike if you had your eye on something from them . However , already this spring a new brand will take its place on the shelves in the store . On their Instagram page you can see several teaser shots of shoes from the new brand . <p> The fact that- more and more brands and more and more retailers appear on the market for classic quality shoes is something that is positive in many ways . For example noticeable in that it becomes increasingly common with sales also in this type of shoes , and in some cases also quite good- ones . Two examples now are the US/UK/Spain " heritaged " J. FitzPatrick Footwear and the UK online store A Fine Pair of Shoes , which has mainly Alfred Sargent , both has just started nice final sales with- up to half the price on many shoes .

A reflection on why its like this in- todays post . <p> Many of those who read this blog also has a more general interest in classic- style , and if you read blogs , have Instagram and so on you will whether you like it or not follow and be a- part of the so called #menswear sphere . Exactly how one chooses to define the epithet may vary , but most agree that there is some sort of core of a number of people around the world trade representatives , store owners , buyers , journalists , bloggers , etc. that you can call the main representatives for this branch of mens fashion/mens style . They meet at the Pitti Uomo fair , show pictures of each other on social media , and other people interested in this style are both inspired by them and gush over them . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there were a dozen people in this group- of people who all had posted pictures from their latest fittings with different tailors , it struck me how extremely much rarer it is that I see the same images from shoe fittings . Here it is for many natural to buy a lot of bespoke- and Made To Measure garments from many- great companies . They often have a large part of their wardrobes made up- of them , and they regularly order new garments often from several different manufacturers at the same time . Absolutely amazing , of course , that many both the- interest and opportunity to do this . <p> On the shoe side its as mentioned a different story . There are some exceptions of " #menswear representatives " who owns bespoke- shoes , and a few more who have semi bespoke/MTM variants . But if you compare it with the clothing side its very few . Its absolutely so that these people are happy to spend money on shoes , and many are- specifically talking about their- great interest in shoes , but for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Edward Green and Gaziano &amp; Girling , or maybe- a modified last at Saint Crispins . While they at the same time spend severalt that- amount on tailored clothing . Why is this ? <p> Do n't  misinterpret me , I 'm not saying that there would be something wrong with this , I just wonder why- this is a fact . As I see it , the difference is so clear , that its more than just happens to be so . For the pricing - is roughly the same if you compare between bespoke/MTM suits and jackets with the corresponding shoe offerings , the same monetary conditions are about the same , in other words . And its not just about this #menswear clique but it goes wider than that , its just that its extra defined here I believe . <p> In a way , it should be the other way around . Like I recently- wrote in an article on the Swedish mens style site Manolo : " When it comes to shoes in a way fit is even more important than when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different way than with clothes . Somewhat simplified : if a jacket- does n't  fit perfectly in the neck , its nothing you get hurt by more than the fact that the aesthetic is not perfect , but if a shoe pinches somewhere you can have to endure pain and in the long run even get serious foot issues . " <p> The only reasonable explanation I can think of is that its- about vanity , that- appearance is in focus , to put it a- bit- better . With a tailor- made or MTM- garment you can see that the fit is good , it gives- a boost to the appearance compared to RTW clothes , this in a different way than a pair of- bespoke shoes differ from a RTW shoe in- appearance . In an appearance-fixated society , it is in many ways logical that we choose the most visible thing first . We both see it very clearly ourselves , and know that others see it clearly . Perhaps the interest of bespoke shoes will be on the rise in the future , well see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection , mr . Ingevaldsson . This question ( why so much RTW/MTM ) partially crosses with a similar one by the Snob himself , Justin Fitzpatrick : where all the many bizarre shoes on **25;89;TOOLONG are in the real world . <p> I think the problem is bifurcated . From what Ive seen in my line of work , the first problem in bespoke making is the client himself . <p> From a descriptive point of view , a suit , a blazer or a coat are quite easy to classify : even a " style illiterate " can define his personal preferences without tongue-twisting terminology . Indeed , the majority of adjustment seen can be reduced in two categories : accessorizing ( buttons , lapels , asola lucida ) or dimensioning ( lapel size , sleeve lenght et similia ) . <p> When you 're ordering a bespoke shoe , the sheer volume of possible choices can blow your brain apart . Even if every shoe model can be collocated in one of three groups ( closed lacing , open lacing , loafer ) , bespoke shoemaking is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) counts : since the shoemaker possibility are limited only by the client physiology , I WILL do everything YOU say you want . <p> Since the learning curve in shoe style is a bit steeper than the one for clothing , and since almost every client request is linked to visual aspects ( a lot of clients ask for patina , or strange colours , or grained leathers . Only a minority asks for a specific leather quality ) , a high quality MTM can satisfy almost everyone . Years ago Tony Gaziano said that , after they expanded the RTW/MTM colour and last choices , true bespoke has reduced to about a hundred pairs a year

@@109465452 @4865452/ <h> The tip Place the creases <p> 2016-03-20 <p> This is a technique that works best on cordovan- shoes , but which also can be used for normal calf leather . Its about- simply guiding the leather how to crease- by pressing two pens against it when bending the shoe for the first time . The aim is to gather the creases- to where it is intended to- be , in two lines- at the shoes flex point . <p> It is a method used by some bespokes- shoemakers- when customers come in to collect their finished shoes , which serves to- help the leather to find the right place to crease at . When it comes to bespoke shoes the fit is- also optimal , and its then that this technique- works at its best since there 's not much excess- leather which needs to fold itself up somewhere . But its also possible to use for RTW shoes , and as I said above especially on cordovan shoes which crease in a certain way. - On those you- can even smoothen out the leather and move the creases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the pens for the placement of the creases . <p> However , that 's not how it works- with calf leather , here basically the first step you take- determines how the shoes will crease , to put it harsh .

Therefore , the method of pens to guide the placement of the creases on a- completely new shoe , that has not been tried on in the store , for example , or where you yourself trudged around the apartment to see- how they feel . In other words , you need to be sure that the size is right and that these are shoes that you should keep , as the method means that you have to bend the shoe very strongly and make proper- creases- in them directly . here 's a step by step guide with photos of the process : <p> Place the pencils with a small gap between them over the so-called ball- of the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i . You should n't care too much about where the toe cap ends ( if the shoes has one ) , it varies from shoe to shoe.Like on these shoes the toe cap is quite long , longer than the internal toe stiffener , so here the creases have to be placed just behind the seam . <p> Then bend the shoes substantially , as if you would take a long step or something like that . You have to dare to bend it properly and actually create proper creases . Its for the future to do this , so you have to accept that they- become more creased- than when you just take normal steps and start using them the common way . In the picture I hold the pens with one hand to take the picture , but when you do this , hold- the pencils with both hands and keep it fixed .

Although 2016 ended with a hacked blog ( which I just now solved , that 's the reason that this post comes so late here on the English site ) , it has in many ways been a great year for Shoegazing where both the Swedish and English sites have grown , Shoegazing After Work has been standing events in several parts of the Sweden , and the- Shoegazing Super Trunk Show in Stockholm was once again a great success . Next year more exciting things will- happen , which will be revealed here- soon . <p> For the fifth consecutive year ( counting in the Swedish site , only second time on this English page ) , its time to wish everyone a Merry Christmas , as customary with a Christmas theme picture , this time on my last pair from the Japanese Yohei Fukuda . <p> We often talk about- the fact that we see a sort of a renaissance for- classic shoes nowadays , and yet another example of this is how- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is closer to art than products supposed to be worn . Its also what Christophe Corthays new interesting project Tranchet Vif is about . Also info on an upcoming contest in the next newsletter where one can win a well filled shoe care valet box from Care of Carl . <p> I 'm currently- in Japan on a reporting- trip for the blog ( that 's essentially what the money I receive from advertising on this site goes to ) , and one of the places I visited is the amazing vintage store Chart in the district- Koenji in Tokyo . Here you find hundreds of classic vintage shoes along the walls . <p> Shoes , like much else , varies in how beautiful they are depending on angle their viewed from , and it can differ- widely between different models . Some- looks best from the top , - some seen- from the front , and so on . But one- angle that makes virtually all shoes look- really nice- is straight from the side in profile . <p> I quite often are asked what distinguishes shoes in different price ranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this topic. - Here I highlight one thing I have come to think of more and more recently when I look at the shoes , and that 's how the heel so to speak flows together with the upper part . An area where you in general quite- clearly see a- difference- between- shoes in different price ranges . <p> For inspiration , in any area that- can be displayed in a picture really , Instagram is currently the largest and most important source . It also applies for the classic shoe sphere . Here are ten interesting accounts to follow . <p> The peak of the traditional shoemaking- is usually considered to be somewhere around the 1900s , when the competition was enormous , both completely handmade shoes and machine-made shoes were sold en masse , and the knowledge in- shoemaking was very great . With the increased interest in classical shoes and the spreading internet makes possible , we are now in the most competitive period in decades , which also benefits the development . One example is the effort to find new variants of material , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late as the end of the 90th century most cobblers was- basic- workshops , they- had some sales of shoe care and shoe accessories , but that was all . Today its completely different ( at least here in the Nordic countries ) . Now its the rule rather than the exception with sales of shoes , and in many cases- in really nice- store parts . Above is one example from- Davidsons Skomakeri in Uppsala , Sweden . 
@@109465500 @4865500/ <h> Shoe construction <p> Just like the fact that good machines are extremely important for shoe factories are good tools of great importance for the bespoke- shoemakers . Tools of high quality makes the work more easy , and in some cases- the tools are crucial to how well an operation can be performed . <p> How the toe is designed is perhaps the most important aesthetic- part on a shoe . With its position at the front , it is the most visible , and much of how the rest of the shoes shape is perceived by the viewer is determined by the toe . Of course there are lots of different types of toe shapes , but this is an attempt to categorise and explain some traditionally used toe shapes , - and some- overviewing- categories . I also- explained often misinterpreted expressions like chiseled . <p> In this post you will get to follow the manufacturing process and seeing the end result of my second pair from the Swedish bespokeskomakaren Janne Melkersson . For me , these are a bit extra special since- my twin brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Continuing on the theme of what distinguishes shoes in different price ranges , this time in a proper in-depth manner . Together with the shoemakers and cobblers at Skomakeri Fram+t in Stockholm- shoes from Loake , Carmina and Paolo Scafora have been taken apart completely to the smallest detail to look at how and what they are made of . <p> The- height above the ground of the tip of the toe , so called toe spring , has a large impact on the look of a shoe . A common perception is that lower toe spring- looks more exclusive , and this has done that sometimes its taken too far . This shoe is a clear example of this . <p> Hiro Yanagimachi is one of the pioneers of the new wave of Japanese bespoke shoemakers which established themselves in the last 15 years . He offers MTO , MTM/semi bespoke and full bespoke , and with a newly developed international last and planned visits to Europe- and the US , he is one of the Japanese makers who is of the most interest for us over here. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand , - with a pair of- MTO split toe derbies that I ordered as a framework . <p> Time to present the correct answers to last weeks photo contest , where you- should- find the differences in construction and finish work between five pairs of pictures with shoes from various manufacturers . As expected , the competition was really hard , but we 've got a winner of the shoe care package from- Springyard Shoe Therapy with a value of over G1100 , and a winner of the shoe cream- and polish from the same brand . <p> Time for a really nerdy contest where you have a number of images where you will find construction details that differ between different shoes . The ones who has- all or the highest number of- correct answers and who has described things- most correctly wins a really nice shoe care package- with organic products from Springyard , and also all the contestants and those who sign up for the newsletter I will now start will be included in the lottery- of a smaller kit from Springyard . <p> A machine that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the lasting- machine , which made it possible to pull the upper leather over the last- with a machine . A- part of the- shoe production- which many thought would never be able to do with a machine . <p> It is easy to believe- that welted shoes have a- bit- wider sole edge- only to have room for the sole stitch , and that there is n't more to it than that . But the fact is that a protruding sole edge- has many great- qualities , which I go through a bit- more here .

@@109465505 @4865505/ <h> The tip Control the instep with the lacing <p> 2016-05-15 <p> I write a lot here on Shoegazing about how one can , and should , adapt the fit of RTW shoes in terms of various minor or major interventions so that they fit as good as possible . Here is another such tip on how to give more or less space at the instep , and the best part is that it takes a minute to fix and all you need is your shoelaces . <p> Its simply about choosing a lacing method that either accumulate a lot of the lacing in the middle and gives more volume there , this to make it tighter- over the instep , or a lacing method that moves the laces to the side and gives more space over the instep . Its not like a shoe that is too low in the instep- suddenly fit if you do the latter , or vice versa , but you can make a noticeable difference and for the last small modifications- of the fit can be an excellent method . It should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on derbys you ca n't affect things- the same with this method- since- the- lacing is open in a completely different way . <p> Personally I 've always preferred a lacing method called Boston two-step ( also goes by the names European lacing and Ladder lacing ) . Main advantages of it is that it gives an even pressure over the instep while it is relatively easy to release and tighten . Its a lacing method that collects quite a lot of strings between the tongue and the shoes facing , thus making the instep slightly tighter . Works in most cases , and can be good to use if you feel that its a bit too much space at the instep and lacing is tight . Another method shoes usually comes supplied with is called Shoe Shop Lacing ( or Factory lacing ) which makes- almost more volume with the lacing . <p> The lacing called Boston two-step , which as you can see gathers a lot of lacing underneath in the middle . <p> Shoe shop lacing is another method with similar gathering of lacing . Pictures : Ians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more space at the instep , it may be worthwhile to try a different type of lacing . An alternative is a method called Straight bar lacing , which keeps- the laces along the sides instead of also crossed over underneath . Disadvantages of this lacing is that it does n't  tightens as evenly as Boston two-step and that at least I experience it in a bit harder to release and tighten . The advantages are that it looks really nice , especially on shoes with an even pair of eyelets , and then it also can- provide more space over the instep . I have had a shoe where the instep was- quite tight , then I laced it with this variant and it was noticeably more comfortable . In this case the shoe then stretched- so that it worked to go back to my normal lacing . If you have this problem on a shoe , it can anyway be worth trying this . <p> This lacing method called Straight bar lacing leaves more room in the middle and keeps the laces on the sides . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to cross at some point , preferably high up . Picture : Gentlemans Gazette <p> If you go on a bit with- the subject , if you look at how the eyelets are placed on a oxford shoe it sometimes- made- so that the holes are moved outwards a bit towards- the bottom . This has partly to do with the desire to get a straight symmetrical row of strings when shoes are laced up and when you- often have some gap here , but it also fills a practical function as it will not be as tight with a lot of lace parts at the bottom middle of the instep . <p> On the shoes on the top picture from Yohei Fukuda you can see how the eyelets are moved outwards towards the bottom , here on this pair from Myrqvist they go straight along the edge .

@@109465511 @4865511/ <h> In depth The protective qualities of the sole edge <p> 2015-10-21 <p> It is easy to believe- that welted shoes have a- bit- wider sole edge- only to have room for the sole stitch , and that there is n't more to it than that . But the fact is that a protruding sole edge- has many great- qualities , which I go through a bit- more here . <p> To begin with , the- wider sole edge- on welted shoes , or for that matter Blake/Rapid sewn shoes , is an excellent shock absorber . Think for a second yourself how you on a daily basis- bash the shoes in different stuff , and then think about how many times that its only the edge of the sole that gets hit . Had not the edge of the sole been there , youd slam the upper- instead , which of course is much softer and more sensitive than the hard , rugged edge of the welt- and sole . Therefore its excellent to have this " bumper " as a protective cage around the shoes . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this one from Santoni , are more inclined to have the upper being bashed into things , when there as you can see is no protruding- edge as a sort of protection . <p> It is not just bashes- that the wider edge of the sole protects against . Also- dirt and moisture from the ground have a more difficult way to get up on the as mentioned more sensitive uppers . Its very logical , that its difficult for dirt and water to get- up around a protruding edge than if it is just a more or less flat wall upwards . Of course- there will be a space for dirt to collect in the space between the welt and the upper , but also in most other types of shoes it becomes a kind of edge- between the sole and the upper . <p> Another aspect worth mentioning is how the resoling opportunities- on a- shoe with a sole stitch is affected by the width of the sole edge . Now we only talk about- welted or Blake/Rapid sewn shoes , which have an external- sole stitch- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an incredibly impressive craft when you cut edge of the sole really tight , but from an operational standpoint , - in addition to the properties mentioned above , it can also greatly complicate the resolings . Each time the sole of a shoe , you have to grind the edge of the sole uniform again , and then take a little on edge every time . If the edge of the sole i really narrow and you have to grind it down further you will eventually not have room for the sole stitch , and then you have to replace the- welt- to make a resole , which is a considerably harder- and more costly work- than a regular resoling job . <p> A very closely cut sole edge on one of my pairs from Maftei . Neat , but not always practical . <p> Hence , a tight cut sole edge- is n't necessarily something positive . And these properties are also some of the reasons that also Blake sewn- shoes quite often has a wider sole edge , not necessarily because they look- want to look like a welted or Blake/Rapid sewn shoe .

@@109465531 @4865531/ <h> News Brexits consequences on the shoe industry <p> 2016-06-25 <p> Britains voting this Thursday- to leave the EU will have- major implications both in and outside the country . As one of- the worlds leading- manufacturing countries of quality footwear Brexit- affects this industry a lot , here I briefly go through the short-term and long-term consequences of the British- exit of the EU . <p> After the vote was finished and it was official that the leave side had won , the British pound fell massively , especially against the dollar and the euro . This means that it has become cheaper to buy shoes from England . It also becomes cheaper for stores outside the UK to buy British shoes , as the pound is lower . So even if the prices may not be reduced we can expect to see- no more raises in English shoes - prices like the heavy raises- we 've seen the previous- years . This led many to cheer- in online forums yesterday , and of course it is for non-British people- who want to buy British shoes now favorable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will affect in the long run . <p> For the British shoe companies it will now- be more expensive to purchase materials . All depend on imported hides , mainly from France , Italy and Poland , and the leather prices have already rised has in recent years , now with a weak pound and- soon also import levies on businesses , these costs will increase significantly . This will then result in higher prices for the shoes , for British people it- will be a clear difference , and for international customers an even greater since stores that buy British shoes also will be applied with import duties , and there will be duty and sales tax on all private purchases . Even if one- can deduct the British VAT , prices will be significantly or very significantly increased . <p> If we take a shoe from the British brand Loakes 1880 line and having it imported to Sweden as an example ( since here I know the figures quite well , they will differ for all countries , but this can be some sort of guideline ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is about 2 500 SEK . If we ignore the- probably increased prices of shoes I mentioned , - since- its hard to tell exactly how large they will be , and just look at what it means import wise , it looks as follows . The shoe costs : -215 / approximately 2 500 SEK , which excl . VAT is- -179 / 2 083 SEK Shipping will be ( to send in the EU tend to be cheaper and quite often free today , now you can expect to have to pay shipping on most things from United Kingdom to other EU countries ) : flat rate of - 20/230 SEK In Sweden , VAT is 25% ( including the shipping cost ) : 683 SEK The duty of the shoes are high in most countries , in Sweden today its 17-18% ( only goods over 1 400 SEK avoid customs duty ) : 450 SEK In general there will also be an administration fee from the shipper , we take the Swedish postal service PostNords standard tariff as example : 100 SEK <p> Hence , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when buying online- from England , instead of the current 2 500 SEK- with free shipping , or 2 730 if we have to pay shipping . An increase of 30-40% . Hardly something to rejoice over . <p> There are other aspects of it as well . For example , there is a risk that it becomes more difficult for non-Brits to move to England and learn bespoke- shoemaking- and work within the profession there , something many people from all over the world do today . And I 've talked to footwear brands- who are- based in the UK but has its production elsewhere in Europe , which are now considering moving their businesses from England to continue to be based in the EU . Its obviously difficult establish exactly how Brexit will affect the world and the shoe world. - The fact that as- I understand it- every single English shoe brand has been strongly opposed an EU exit is in any case a signal about something .

@@109465549 @4865549/ <h> The picture Close-cut heel <p> 2016-08-24 <p> I quite often are asked what distinguishes shoes in different price ranges , and- Ive- also written a lot of posts on this topic. - Here I highlight one thing I have come to think of more and more recently when I look at the shoes , and that 's how the heel so to speak flows together with the upper part . An area where you in general quite- clearly see a- difference- between- shoes in different price ranges . <p> If you take a look at the shoes you have in the lower price segments ( and now were only talking- about thise- with a so-called 260 degrees sole stitch , those which goes all the way around the heel obviously always have a larger edge , and so it should be ) they usually have a heel that is cut relatively far out from the upper heel area , it is likely- two-three millimeters or so that goes- out , and it gives the impression that the top so to speak is placed on the heel . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these above from the Japanese Hiro Yanagimachi , - the heel is often cut very tight on the upper- providing an almost seamless transition between the parts . They flow- together in my eyes in a more harmonious way . When the heel is also little tapered- as it is above , it becomes an even smoother transition . This is of course a matter of taste whether you care about this or not , and its of course not the only thing that distinguishes different price ranges , but in addition to the more defined things like material , construction , finish , etc. , its these kinds of details which comes- with the higher price you pay . 
@@109465550 @4865550/ <h> Buyers guide Make bargains on Ebay <p> 2015-11-22 <p> For those who are interested in quality shoes Ebay can be- a real gold mine . The range of both new and second-hand shoes are huge , and the chance to make real bargains increases if you have the energy to engage a little extra . Below are some good tips . <p> Misspelled brand names It is not unusual for a seller to misspell the name of the shoe manufacturer , either just by mistake or entirely due to ignorance . This often results in the fact that far fewer find the shoes since- its very common that people are searching things by their brand name . Ebays search engine is not as smart as for example Google either , but just looking at exactly what you wrote ( if its not so that it cant find something you are looking for , then it can change to another suggestion automatically ) . Ebay also has the preselcted settings to search only in the title , so many people miss items even in cases where it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To find shoes that are misspelled , you can either go through different selection as " Formal Shoes-brown size 10 " and so on , since you 'll find them in- the list . Or , by- simply search some of the likely misspellings . For example , I have found shoes where the vendor have written " Crocket and Jones , " " Jonn Lobb " Gasiano &amp; Girling " " Gaziano and Giling " , " Edward Gren " , " Markovski " " Sutor Mantelassi " and so on . <p> An example where the seller has misspelled Crockett &amp; Jones in the auction ad . <p> Uncategorized shoes People who put up an ads on Ebay is quite often lazy , and the only requirements Ebay have when selling shoes is that you select what kind of shoe it is , shoe size and brand . All other details are optional , and if you then in their search , click on for example- " brown " all brown shoes where the seller has not bothered to click in the color disappears . So just choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browse through the long list in search of bargains . <p> Remains only ship within the country , sending there if you ask Its very common for sellers , especially when there are private individuals , to routinely click in that they only send within the country . It makes very many people from other countries fall away , and only people in the origin country of the seller are- involved in bidding . In many cases , they have no problems sending internationally , just ask . Send a message to the seller and say you are interested in bidding on the shoes , and ask if he/she- could ship to your country , and mention that you of course pay the higher shipping fee and that you like them to be shipped as a registered package . The fact that they sent by registered mail is just as safe as sending within the country , and the vast majority- are happy to to it . <p> On the French Ebay page you can find some French brand that 's only available on that site . <p> Check- local Ebay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth checking out smaller local Ebay sites , for example Ebay.it and Ebay.fr and others. - If you choose not to sell- international the ad does n't  show on- other- eBay sites than the origin site , and the number of visitors who can discover the shoes is greatly reduced . But since- many still ship internationally if you ask , you can find gems this way . If you- also for example are particularly interested in Italian shoes , its insanely much easier to find a wide selection of for example Sutor Mantellassi and other classic Italian brands on the local Ebay.it. - If you have trouble understanding the language use Chrome as a browser so you can run Google Translate on the page while you browse around , or search the eBay site through Google and select " Translate this page " . <p> Bid in the last seconds This is hardly a unique tip and applies of course not only when- purchasin shoes , but since I 've noticed that many do n't  realize that this is the best way to get the best price , I include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in any bids during the days the auction is opened , it just helps increasing the price , perhaps unnecessarily . Instead look to sit prepared with your absolute maximum bid and place it when about 15-20 seconds remain ( after all it is good to have some margin , since the computer/phone may need to think a little before the bid is placed ) . In this way any other stakeholders do n't  have time to respond to your offer before its too late , even though they might be able to go- even higher . And even if they would not go- over your maximum bid and you still would have won the auction , others do n't  have time to pull up the price unnecessarily either , so you get it as cheap as possible .

@@109465558 @4865558/ <h> Shoe care <p> I 've written about this before in other shoe care articles , that its good to let wet shoes dry lying on the side to speed up the drying process and allow the entire shoe to be aired . Recently- I became aware of what can happen if you do n't  do this , when one of my bespoke- pairs from Janne Melkersson- was used in rain and were left standing as- usual , and ended up with a proper formation of mildew on the sole . <p> Even though most- ( hopefully ) take out and put in shoe trees every- day , many people use the wrong technique when this is done , which can make it unnecessarily complicated . Here I show how this is done best to save both yourself and the shoes trouble . <p> A while back I bought this pair of Alfred Sargent Handgrade Benson to a very cheap price on Ebay . A shoe from a not too big brand like AS which looks really beaten up does n't  go for much .

It may , however , differ greatly between manufacturers how easy it is to get them shined well , and a lot has to do with how much cream and polish they received at the factory . These shoes above is a good- example , both are new and have been polished on almost exactly the same way , but the end result differs significantly . <p> A common question when winter is coming to an end is how to store your- boots and winter shoes during the summer months when they 're not in use .

Its made of leather , and without care it- dries out and looks really bad . When you put on the shoe cream- you quite easily can end up with some of it on the suede , which is not ideal . Here I let you know- how to easily get it off- if you happen- to make this mistake . <p> Like me most people use- some kind of cloth to put- on shoe cream- when they polish their shoes , and might use an application brush only for- the space between the sole edge and upper .

@@109465559 @4865559/ <h> The tip Tighten the laces properly <p> 2016-01-09 <p> Yet one of those tips that are obvious to many of you , but I 've noticed that surprisingly many still do wrong about this . Its about ensuring that you tighten the laces/buckles on the shoes properly so that the feet is held in place as they should in the shoe . <p> This is a topic I 've mentioned briefly in an earlier post for about a year and a half ago on the Swedish version of Shoegazing , but since- I started consulting for Italigente and do trunk shows and other things with them I 've helped many to try out shoes myself , and then- I have realized that its even more common than I thought , and therefore think it is worth a separate post . The lacing of shoes is a brilliant design that allows us to completely individually tighten the shoes so that they sit so well and comfortably as possible . Especially shoes with five pairs of eyelets- or more have excellent possibilities for it , but fewer are of course also functional . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in most cases you are be able to adjust them reasonably . <p> A shoe which not have the laces tighten enough , which results in space at the ankle and a foot that most likely is sliding around in the shoe . Picture : StyleForum <p> I do n't  know if this- is an illness that comes from the fact that people often are accustomed to go in different sneakers that have- fairly loosely tightened laces , preferably with a fixed knot so you can just pull off and put them on without ever have to tie them . That its a reason that- people are n't  used to tighten the laces . For it is as I mentioned- surprisingly common to not tighten- the laces enough , sometimes also- with the foot placed a bit forward in the shoe- too , so that it gets really loose and fipply when you walk in them . Its obviously not correct . <p> When you put on shoes , make sure the heel is flush with the heel stiffener , if you sit down you can lift the toes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the floor so the heel is- going back properly . Then , tighten the laces starting at the bottom and methodically work your way up to the knot , which you then tie after pulling the laces one- last time . It should of course not be so hard that the foot goes numb because youve- tightened them like a madman , but its about getting the foot completely fixed with the help of the laces , or buckles or when there is such type of shoes . A shoe with the correct fit is still comfortable , or rather become truly comfortable only when the laces are properly tightened . If you have gaps , for example in the heel or at the sides of the opening , the shoe is not properly tensioned , or fit incorrectly . Then the feet will move around in the shoe , and one can get heel slippage , which neither is desirable . So if you are aware of the fact you that you- do n't  tighten your laces enough , and not have feet fixed in the shoe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Boots should be tightened all the way up .

In- addition the MTO premium of 30% is waived this weekend during the launch , so a good opportunity- to strike if you 've been eyeing- something that 's not included in the standard range . <p> Carmina has for many years offered a MTO service through- their- dealers and in- their- own stores , and when they quite recently launched a new website they also introduced so-called group-MTOs in the same way that for example- Meermin has , where specific models are up for order for a limited period and only if a sufficient number of orders are placed the shoes are produced .

There 's not really anything new to the opportunities compared to what- they previously had with MTO from retailers and their shops , the main news is the digital packaging . <p> A lot of base models to choose from . <p> And this is admirably well done , I have to say . You- start with choosing the base model , as mentioned some 80 such exists , ranging from high boots to lightweight loafers . Then you come to a step-by-step process where you- in around ten- pages set the specifications of the shoe . One can easily jump back and forth between pages , if you want to try different things or regret something , and to the right there 's an overview where the price of the order is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select uppers materials , and it is possible to select different types of leather for the different parts of the shoes . I had the opportunity to try the service in advance , and then made a chukka with five eyelets , the model 905 .

If you make for example a full brogue or austerity brogue you can easily put together your own version of the spectator . Obviously there are many different calf leathers , both smooth , grain and suede , as well as a large selection of cordovan from the Chicago based tannery Horween , soft goatskin and exotic leather like alligator , cayman or lizard . Also there 's various options of lining leather . <p> The step-by-step process starts with the choice of upper material . <p> It then continues with the choice of last and sole . As mentioned , you cant make all models on all lasts , but its only those that are available for the model chosen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this step to ensure which last- options you have .

Carmina offers several sole options like the standard leather sole and Dainite-rubber sole , plus the- rubber variants- York , Tomir and Commando , and- also oak bark tanned- Rendenbach leather soles . You can choose single or double sole and if you like storm welt , - and also sole edge colour , type of medallion if you want it , where there are a few to choose from , plus different types of eyelets and buckles ( depending on model choice ) are offered and shoe laces . Finally , they also have a novelty compared to the MTO service through retailers , that one can also choose whether to have the initials in brass pegs- on the waist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to a summary page where you can get an overview of the choices you 've made , and what the price will be .

A chukka in burgundy cordovan on the Rain last with single Dainite sole . <p> The service is launched tomorrow when Carmina is participating in the StyleForum event The Proper Kit in New York . The regular premium for the online Customisation Service is 30% on the standard- price , but during the launch weekend so they waive the MTO fee so the- shoes are- therefore priced- like regular RTW .

There are a number of different models to choose from , and two different ttoe shapes , different colors on the uppers and soles , etc. , so there are some choices that can be made . The shoes are made with hand welting and a handmade sole stitch , with leather from the Italian tannery Conceria Incas . They use a- celastic heel counter , which in my eyes is a bit of a pity , I would have preferred heel stiffeners in leather board and maybe instead a machine made sole stich , in order to remain the same or even cheaper production cost . <p> Maybe not the most refined hand welting with quite wide stitches , but considering the price you cant expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kickstarter pay about- G335- ( $ 380 ) for the whole package above , including shipping of the scanning socks , test shoes and finished shoes , which is undeniably a very low price in terms of what is included .

Regular price then estimated to be around G490- ( $ 550 ) . Once you 've ordered a pair - your- data is saved and the same last will be used when you order new shoes . <p> Such a solution is of course something else- than traditional bespoke , and its difficult to say how well it works or the quality of the shoes without having tried it myself or heard several participants experience .

U is quite hard regarding fit , with high instep , relatively normal over the ball but with a narrow toe area .

@@109465874 @4865874/ <p> Very nice looking color ! I recently got price from Antonio of EUR 1,100 for Aurum line . Extra 150 for 3 piece shoe trees and EUR 300 for Last adjustment service in which he will make test shoes . Jesper : How does the shoe wear after using it for a few months ? Where do you see the creasing on the wholecut ? How does it compare with your Vass and Bestetti shoes ? <p> Mal Abar : Thanks ! Yeah he raised prices for all his shoes now for 2015 , will update pricing in the article . The shoes hold up great , crease as it should . Hard to compare to Bestteti or Vass , different type of shoes , different prices . Meccariello Aurum and Bestetti Novecento would probably be most fair to compare , if any . They are all good , and you will most likely be pleased with any of them
