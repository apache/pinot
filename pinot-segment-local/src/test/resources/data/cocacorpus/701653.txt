Because of the inherent danger of their work , many stonemasons formed local organizations , called lodges , to take care of sick and injured members as well as the widows and orphans of those who were killed on the job . The masons also used the lodges as places to meet , receive their pay , plan their work , train new apprentices , and socialize . <p> In 1717 , the first Grand Lodge was established in London . Within the next two decades , English Freemasonry spread throughout Europe and eventually made its way to the American colonies .

Interest earned on U.S. Treasury Securities is exempt from state and local taxes , but not Federal taxes . The government sells U.S. Treasury Securities by auction in the primary market at no fee . They can be purchased through a broker in the secondary market for a fee . Because there is almost no risk of default by the government , the return on Treasury bonds is relatively low , and a high inflation rate can erase most of the gains by reducing the value of the principal and interest payments . <p> - <p> Venture Capital ( Private Equity ) <p> Money provided by investors to startup firms and small businesses with perceived long-term growth potential .

Freemasonry enhances and strengthens the character of the individual man by providing opportunities for fellowship , charity , and education . <h> Where do the names Freemasonry , Masonry , and Free and Accepted Masons come from ? <p> Masons name comes from the occupation of their original members stonemasons who built castles and cathedrals in England and Scotland . The word " free " was added during the Middle Ages . Because stonemasons possessed knowledge and skills not found everywhere , these men had the privilege of traveling between countries . <p> Over time , many men who were not builders were drawn to the practices of Freemasonry . To encourage intellectual diversity , stonemasons began accepting men from other professions into the fraternity . These men were known as " accepted Masons . " This trend continued , and accepted members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freemasonry , " " Masonry , " and " Free and Accepted Masons " are used interchangeably to refer to the fraternity . <h> What is a lodge ? <p> Freemasonry began when stonemasons formed local organizations , called lodges , to take care of sick and injured members , as well as the families of those who were killed on the job . The masons also used the lodges as places to meet , receive their pay , plan their work , train new apprentices , and socialize . Today , this term refers both to a unit of Masons and the room or building in which they meet . There are more than 320 lodges in California and approximately 13,000 in the United States . <h> What is a grand lodge ? <p> A grand lodge is an administrative body that oversees Freemasonry in a specific geographic area , called a jurisdiction . The United States has grand lodges in all 50 states and the District of Columbia . <h> Is Freemasonry an international organization ? <p> There are about five million Masons worldwide , including almost two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All lodges follow the same principles of Freemasonry , but their activities may vary . Each grand lodge is sovereign and independent ; there is no U.S. or international governing body for Freemasonry . <h> Is Masonry a secret organization ? <p> Membership in Masonry is not a secret ; all members are free to acknowledge their membership . There is no secret about any of Masonrys aims or principles . Masonrys constitutions and rules are available to the public , and meeting locations are clearly identifiable . Like many similar organizations , some of Masonrys internal affairs , such as ceremonies , grips , and passwords , are regarded as private matters for members only . <h> What happens at a lodge meeting ? <p> There are two kinds of meetings for members . The most common is a business meeting , called a stated meeting , devoted to administrative procedures : minutes of the last meeting , discussing financial matters , voting on applications , and planning for lodge activities . The second kind of meeting is ceremonial , used for admitting new Masons and conferring degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages of Masonic membership : Entered Apprentice , Fellow Craft , and Master Mason . These stages are referred to as " degrees , " and correspond with members self-development and increased knowledge of Freemasonry . As a man completes each phase of learning , the lodge holds a ceremony to confer his degree . <p> Degree names are taken from craft guilds : In the Middle Ages , to become a stonemason , a man would first be apprenticed . As an apprentice , he learned the tools and skills of the trade . When he had proved his skills , he became a " fellow of the craft , " and when he gained exceptional ability , he was known as a " master of the craft . " <h> What is the significance of officers titles ? <p> Masonry came to America from England and many of the original English titles are still in use . These titles may sound archaic in todays society , but their meanings are simple . The master is the leader of the lodge , similar to the term president in other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same reason that the leader of first violins in an orchestra is called the concertmaster . Its simply an older term for leader . The senior and junior wardens represent the first and second vice presidents . <h> Why does Masonry use symbols ? <p> Symbols allow people to communicate quickly , and to transcend language barriers . When you see a green light or a circle with a line through it , you know what it means . Likewise , Masons use metaphors from geometry and the architecture of stonemasonry to inform their continuing pursuit of knowledge , ethics , and leadership skills . <p> To reflect their heritage , Masons wear aprons while in lodge , at certain public events , and at funerals to demonstrate their pride in the fraternity , and their lineage from stonemasons , who historically carried their tools in leather aprons . The square and compass is the most widely known symbol of Masonry : When you see the symbol on a building , you know that Masons meet there . <h> Do Masons engage in politics ? <h> Is Masonry a religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a substitute for religion . The fraternity requires its members to have a belief in a Supreme Being , but the fraternity itself is not affiliated with any religion , and men of all faiths are represented in the fraternity . Religion is not discussed at lodge meetings . <h> Why are some Masonic buildings called temples ? <p> We sometimes call a building a " temple " in the same sense that Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes called the Supreme Court a " Temple of Justice . " Most California lodges now refer to their buildings as Masonic centers . <h> What are the other Masonic organizations ? <p> A man first becomes a Mason at his local lodge . After he has been awarded the three degrees of Masonry , he may join any of the other allied Masonic organizations , each of which has a special social , educational , or philanthropic focus . The best known in the United States are the Shrine , Scottish Rite , and York Rite . <h> Can women join Masonry ? <p> There are three strands of Freemasonry in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masonry ( exclusively women ) , and mixed Masonry ( men and women ) . The Masons of California is a fraternity of men . We sponsor Masonic organizations for men , women , and youth .

Today , DeMolay International , Jobs Daughters International , and the International Order of Rainbow for Girls offer young men and women ages 10 to 21 opportunities for personal growth and community service . More information is available at masons4youth.org . <h> Are there financial commitments for Masons ? <p> There is an application fee for membership , which includes a charitable contribution to help fulfill our philanthropic mission and our obligation to aid brothers and their families in times of need .

Another is to engage their family members . <p> Chico-Leland Stanford Lodge No. 111 can testify to both tactics . When Brother Chris Teschan was still a Fellow Craft , he and his teenage son took an interest in the local DeMolay chapter . With the lodges help , the father-son duo stepped into leadership roles . <p> A year later , Chico DeMolay has doubled in size and tripled in activity . Its also provided a meaningful way for Teschan , other lodge members , and their families to get involved . <p> Teschan , now junior deacon , explains : <p> Background The Chico DeMolay chapter was formed about 50 years ago .

Now there are seven of us . One is a mother , and the rest are lodge members . <p> Raise awareness in the lodge : I get up and speak about DeMolay at every blue lodge meeting .

To survive , the lodge needed more active members . <p> A friend of mine works as a coach for business leaders . I asked her to speak to our officers on the importance of education in any organization . It boils down to this : When people are learning , they are more committed . <p> We agreed to build our lodges Masonic education program . First , we created classes for degree candidates .

For example : <p> Several past masters have spoken about the examination process . <p> I drew on my experience as a photographer and gave a presentation called " Light . " I showed some of the ways that light can be used in photography to manipulate an image or emphasize something important . We discussed it as a metaphor for how we need to carefully examine what others tell us is truth , and " find our own light , " or direction , in life . <p> A member developed two presentations out of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now what ?

But that rarely happens . Our members really like these open sessions . <p> Guest speakers Four times a year , an outside scholar leads the discussion . These nights have included : <p> The early history of Masonry by John Cooper , senior warden and past grand secretary <p> The evolution of Masonic documents by Adam Kendall and Shawn Eyer , editor of Philalethes magazine <p> Ritual through the ages by Sam Webster . <p> Special thanks : The support of these brothers has been critical to the programs success .

Members , lodges and leaders came together around an issue we as Masons care deeply about serving children and strengthening families . We can be proud to know that we 've made a huge difference in the lives of some of the most vulnerable among us . This is what it means to be a Mason .

So while Grand Lodge works on developing Web-based tools for use statewide , California lodges are fortifying their own programs . <p> Phoenix Lodge is an old lodge , founded in 1861 . But lately , we 've been going through a renaissance . We have a lot of new members . The men knocking on our doors do n't  necessarily know anybody in the lodge , or anything about Masonry .

Be a mentor . <p> Culture of learning <p> Preferred proficiency : Weve experienced a wave of Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft degree candidates who opt for the long form , and we encourage it . They get a better grasp of what the fraternity is about , as well as the esoteric value of the degree . <p> Personal statement : The basic education program asks candidates to write an essay about the personal significance of each degree . We take that seriously . All of our candidates read their essays aloud at lodge . <p> Widespread education : Our lodge makes Masonic education a priority in general . At Masonic education events , coaches and candidates pick up new information to supplement their work together . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six candidate coaches lead group sessions . <p> Greater availability : With one-on-one coaching , it can be difficult for a candidate and coach to align schedules .

It fills an important social need , and at the same time , its a learning activity not just an exercise in memorization . <p> Candidate camaraderie : If a candidate says , " I cant learn this , " he has a brother next to him saying , " Yes you can . " Many of our members become very good friends by going through the degrees together . It creates a bond . <p> The benefits <p> Candidates : Two candidates recently gave third degree proficiencies , and they were letter perfect .

This kind of education stays with you . Nothing replaces it . <p> Coaching is more than a means to a degree ; it sets the stage for a candidates entire Masonic journey . <p> Here are nine strategies to make it meaningful . <p> Assign coaches thoughtfully : To pair each candidate with the right coach , conduct interviews to determine each candidates interests , style of learning , and personality . <p> Start at the beginning : Make sure candidates are versed in the history of the fraternity , including the transition from operative to speculative Masonry .

Discuss applied Masonry with your candidates , have them discuss it with each other , and designate long-time lodge brothers to discuss it with them , too . <p> Combine candidates : Organize group study sessions with other degree candidates and coaches . <p> Involve the lodge : Encourage long-time members to give presentations at lodge .

She is the voice of the Amazon Echo , a sleek metal cylinder about the size of a paper towel roll that sits quietly in the corner of a room , waiting to be helpful . The device comes to life when you ask Alexa to turn up the lights , turn down the news , answer your trivia or any number of other useful tasks . The Amazon Echo was a top seller during the 2015 holiday season , and appeared alongside famed actor , Alec Baldwin , and football star , Dan Marino , in a Super Bowl commercial . Soon , it might be a fixture in resident apartments at the Masonic Homes of California , too and perhaps other Masonic communities after that . <p> Straight from Silicon Valley The Amazon Echo is one of the technology tools demonstrated to guests of the 2016 Masonic Communities &amp; Services Association ( MCSA ) Conference this past week . Every year , the conference gathers administrators from 33 Masonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges , from as diverse locations as Kentucky and Denver . This year , the Masonic Homes of California hosted in Berkeley , and the timing was appropriate : June is Masonic Homes Month in California . This years conference theme , innovation and technology , is appropriate too . With Silicon Valley right across the San Francisco Bay , attendees did n't  have to look far . <p> As the conference host , the Masonic Homes welcomed attendees for a tour of the Union City campus , introducing demonstrations of new tech tools that seek to improve senior care . Two model " Smart Home " apartments were unveiled living spaces retrofitted with cutting edge technology , designed to be inexpensively integrated into existing architecture . These trial Smart Homes provide a glimpse of how new technology tools may be able to work together to improve resident safety and quality of life : A sensor triggers soft floor lights when someone gets out of bed in the middle of the night . A sensor switches the living room lights off upon leaving , and back on upon return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many of these technologies have existed separately , but are only now being combined in exciting new ways . Some of the tools that the Homes demonstrated in these sample apartments are already widespread in the consumer market , but are just now being considered as solutions in senior care . The Amazon Echo is one example . Wearable devices , similar to fitness trackers like the Fitbit , which is worn around the wrist or clipped to an article of clothing , are another . By tracking health-related data like heartbeat , respiratory rate , sleep stages , and movement patterns , in the future , these tools might be able to inform Homes staff of a residents overall health , alert them to risk factors , and help guide care plans . And , by embracing the possibilities now , the Homes has an exciting chance to set some industry precedents . <p> " We have a special opportunity here in part due to our proximity to Silicon Valley , " says Michael Skaff , chief operating officer for the Masons of California . " Theres interest from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments to showcase some of their newest technology , and prove its efficacy . Its a great opportunity for public-private partnerships . Its a chance to be truly on the cutting edge . " As a result , the model Smart Home apartments will remain intact long after the MCSA Conference bringing global businesses onto the Masonic Homes campus to preview its unique services and innovative vision for senior care . <p> The care curve Of course , innovation is n't only a matter of technology . During the MCSA Conference , attendees were also introduced to a one-of-a-kind memory care program , the Masonic Homes new Compass Club . The program was developed for residents in the early stages of memory loss who can still safely live independently , but who benefit from specialized support . Its creator , Joseph Pritchard , the Homes director of memory care , describes the format as a " mobile day program " : residents continue living independently , but their days are framed by group activities throughout campus with staffers called " navigators " who assist and guide them . <p> In developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this kind of program did n't  exist elsewhere , at least not to the Homes standards . He combined best practices from traditional memory care programs which are typically geared toward assisted living residents in a confined environment and adapted them for Union City residents . The Compass Club taps into the social , physical , cognitive , emotional , spiritual , and nutritional domains of memory support . Activities range from music appreciation and art classes to ice cream socials and exercise . Because isolation is both a cause and consequence of memory loss , the program especially focuses on opportunities for social engagement . If a resident chooses to take a meal alone in her own apartment , a navigator will make a point to stop by later that day to chat for awhile . <p> The Compass Club was introduced this past winter to 20 residents , and already the Union City staff can see a difference . Before one resident started the program , she left her apartment only for dinner . She was losing weight and feeling depressed . Now she goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She paints . Although her memory occasionally fails , she is alert and attuned to the world around her . Another resident no longer insists that he should be moved to skilled nursing . When his navigator arrives in the morning , he asks , " What are we doing today ? " When he hears a song he likes , staff even catch him swaying along . <p> " By investing a little bit of money and staff , the program has changed residents lives , " Pritchard says . <p> " For more than 100 years , the Masonic Homes of California has been intentional about evolving and updating our practices , trying to set an example to others in the care industry , " says Gary Charland , the Homes executive vice president . " We always look ahead to how we can improve , so we can better serve our Masonic family . " <p> " Were ahead of the curve , " says Pritchard . " I would love for everyone else to catch up .

For example , the school wanted to build a fence around its playground . We could n't do it ourselves , but we announced that we wanted to fund the project . Without any hesitation , brothers sat down and wrote checks . <p> The individuals : Several of our members have forged a close relationship with the school administrators , and they volunteer individually as well . <p> Back-to-school supplies : A number of students show up each year without backpacks or supplies .

@@49976607 @3476607/ <p> Two of the fraternity 's major strategic priorities are to enhance the member experience and improve Masonic education . If you listen to what new members are asking for , you could fulfill both with a single lodge program . <p> That 's what happened at Temecula Catalina Island Lodge No. 524 ( aka TemCat Lodge ) . They launched an Entered Apprentice seminar last November . The response was so positive they introduced a Fellow Craft version a few months later . <p> Master Michael Coe explains : <p> Background We 're a busy lodge with a backlog of degrees . Some members have to wait three months before advancing . We want to get them involved early : in lodge activities , on committees , and attending degrees . We thought if they had a deeper understanding of the degree - if they were n't just watching passively - they 'd show up to more degree nights . The Entered Apprentice and Fellow Craft seminars were our solution . <p> The team <p> Dynamic duo : Senior Warden Anthony McLean and I led program development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize content . <p> Advisory board : We asked for feedback from a few lodge brothers with an interest in Masonic education . <p> Student becomes teacher : The seminars have given new members a great way to step into leadership roles . For both , we asked Fellow Crafts to collaborate . Would the information benefit them ? What was it missing ? They 've ended up presenting the seminars . <p> The process <p> Production time : The content for our first seminar was created gradually over time , when there was time . If you really hunkered down to do your research , you might do it in one month . <p> Choosing the material : Most topic ideas came from member feedback . We thought about what we wished wed known . We talked to Entered Apprentices and Fellow Crafts . We sent an online survey to the general membership . <p> Resources : Anything that we did n't  know already , we researched online . We pulled a lot of information from websites like freemason.org . <p> TIP : Use a free online survey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member experience and any areas in which theyd like more education . <p> Workweek or weekend ? When you pick an event day and time , know your members . Our average member is age 44 , and his weekday nights are usually packed with family obligations . To accommodate , we hold our seminars on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon . <p> Open invitation : All members are invited to all seminars . Master Masons are attending and benefiting , too . <p> Presentation topics <p> Why we 're doing this seminar <p> Brief forum : Is Masonry what you expected ? What 's been positive and negative about your experience ? How much information have you retained ? <p> Why the degree is taught the way it is <p> Overview of the long-form <p> In-depth information on degree symbols <p> Obligations , rights , and duties <p> Officers and structure of the lodge <p> Secrets , and what 's okay to talk about <p> After the presentation <p> Question-and-answer session : To wrap up , we address any remaining questions . <p> Handouts : We provide a list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved even if they 're not Master Masons . We also hand out a six-month calendar , noting family and all-member events . <p> Feedback session : Before wrapping up , we ask attendees : What did you get out of this ? Was it helpful ? After attendees leave , presenters meet and debrief . <p> TIP : Based on member feedback , we now schedule a 15-minute one-on-one with each new Entered Apprentice . We review information that 's not " taught " - for example , basic etiquette ( how to wear your apron and address the master ) and member resources ( officers , books , the Trestleboard ) . <p> Benefits Attendance is up across the board . Members are joining more committees and activities , and even at seminars , we have repeat attendees .

Most lodges do n't  have 100 plus active members . " <p> This is where , explains Yelinek , new lodges come in . " If a lodge is n't filling someones membership experience , they can , in essence , create their own member experience by developing a new lodge . This does n't  mean that the original lodge is broken or subpar but that some people might have different expectations for their membership . We want to create a system whereby lodges can operate separately but lean on each other to share strengths and fellowship opportunities for mutually beneficial events and celebrations . " <p> Part of this " leaning in , " Yelinek explains , is the ability to share spaces .

It was that moment when I learned that not all unpleasant experiences have to be reacted to in an unpleasant way . <p> As I 'm sure you may have heard from many Internet safety programs , what goes on the Web stays on the Web . Could you imagine the latest argument you had with a friend or family member being plastered all over your school halls ? How would you feel ? Probably not good .

@@49976633 @3476633/ <p> Jack McEnterfer , inspector at large , has run the ritual school at Bellflower Lodge No. 320 since 1995 . He reports on the schools tremendous popularity , its tried-and-true approaches for teaching ritual , and the importance of performing outstanding ritual . here 's a summary : <p> Background : Since 1985 , the ritual school has met every Tuesday morning from 8 a.m. until noon at Bellflower Lodge , which provides the space at no charge . The schools roster has more than 50 members from different area lodges , and at least 25 to 35 members attend every week . In fact , the school has better attendance than most lodge meetings . There are no dues and no restrictions except that you have to be a Master Mason , and you have to love ritual . <p> The weekly routine <p> Warming up : Between 8 and 9 a.m. , we just drink coffee and socialize . Before we begin practice , we do a group rendition of our traditional song , " Old Hogans Goat . " Thirty guys singing off-key is quite entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun day . <p> Group work : At the start of each meeting , we decide what we want to practice . We take requests : If a member has something coming up a degree , a funeral service well work on that . We try to involve as many people as we can , so if someone needs help on a piece that 's just one part , like a lecture or charge , two of us will work on that in the lobby while the rest practice a group ritual . <p> Staying current : The primary goal is to get members up to speed on current ritual in California . There are always adjustments being made . When I 'm not sure about something , I 'll ask the Ritual Committee or the grand lecturer . Over the years , a lot of officers coaches and about 15 inspectors have come to the school . <p> Nit-picking and polishing <p> Its tough to practice ritual by yourself . At the school , we have members that know this stuff inside and out , so there 's always someone knowledgeable to bounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : floorwork , verbage , word emphasis , and delivery . <p> The key to memorization is repetition . You do n't  need a photographic memory , you just need to be motivated to put in the work . When you see a great degree or hear a really impressive lecture , that inspires you to emulate it . All regular attendees at the school have had that experience . <p> To make your part interesting , you have to know what you 're saying . Many of the words in ritual come from old English , so their meanings and pronunciations are n't  clear . There 's probably one word per paragraph that you need to look up in a dictionary . Once you do , the whole picture comes together . <p> We critique where members pause and which words they emphasize , because that changes a lines meaning . Impressive ritual is sharp , crisp , confident , and delivered by someone who knows the meaning behind it . <p> Degree ritual is extremely important , because that 's the first thing that a candidate experiences . If the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . If its clean and impressive , then hopefully hell return and do his second degree . It costs money and time to go through the degree process , and today , there are a lot of things competing for both . We 've really got to step up to the plate and perform high quality ritual . <p> This how-to list is compiled with tips from some of the best . Members of the 2008 winning ritual team from Irvine Valley Lodge No. 671 along with Grand Lecturer Paul Hennig weigh in with time-tested techniques for learning ritual , whether its for the 2009 Ritual Competition or your lodges next degree ceremony . <p> Memorization <p> Everyone has a different style of learning , so find the method that best suits yours : visual , aural , verbal , physical , social , or solitary . <p> If you 're memorizing a long piece , learn the last paragraph first , and work backwards . When you recite the finished piece , the last paragraph will be the one that you 've recited the most , so it will be strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife looks over and sees me talking to myself . She knows Im working on ritual , " relays Paul Hennig , grand lecturer . " I 've known guys that know exactly how long it takes to drive from point A to point B because that 's the length of the piece they 're working on . If they finish before they reach point B , they know theyve forgotten something . " <p> Teamwork <p> Group practice is crucial . Designate one member of the ritual team to organize practice times and keep the team focused , excited , and committed . <p> Know more than just your own part . If the member that you 're playing up against forgets his line , you 'll be able to carry on or even prompt him . <p> Learn to trust your team . Once you do , you 'll be able to rely on their movements to cue you and theyll rely on yours , even in the heat of the moment . <p> * " In the third round of the 2008 Ritual Competition , I was playing a small part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up against any lodge , anywhere , anytime in the world , " reports John Lowe , member of the Irvine Valley Lodge ritual team that took first place last year .

If you are n't  sure of the meaning ( or pronunciation ) of a word , look it up . <p> Experiment with emphasizing different words in a sentence . Try out different places for pauses , and incorporate facial expressions and gestures . Decide which combinations best convey the rituals message . <p> Think about the meaning of your floor work , as well as your words .

From Facebook to chat rooms , from Snapchat to Instagram , how can we show respect for the people we encounter digitally and why is it important to do so ? <p> Congratulations to Lindsea Friesen of the International Order of the Rainbow for Girls , Central Coast Assembly No. 92 on providing the winning entry : <p> A Light Amidst the Darkness by Lindsea Friesen <p> Many of our social interactions occur online , from posting on Facebook and Twitter , to commenting on YouTube videos ; however , it is almost impossible to avoid seeing some form of negativity . So , how can we be a light amidst all this darkness ? To learn how to spread positivity on the Internet , we should first understand why people act with such animosity online . <p> There is a certain appeal to anonymity , either by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may believe that you can say whatever you want without consequences ; that no one will know you were the one who sent that comment . This opens up a Pandoras box of sorts : Many " negative " people would n't say half the things they post online when interacting IRL ( in real life ) , but anonymity allows them to project personal problems onto others . Being mean online can be quite cathartic and can temporarily boost self-esteem . But this feeling is short-lived , and being unkind can not only hurt the victim , but the commenter as well . Psychologists have found that those who are rude on the Internet are likely to become more aggressive in their everyday lives . Plus , having a negative outlook on life in general can considerably shorten your lifespan . <p> The solution to combatting online negativity is simple : Do n't  put up with it . If you see a rude comment or status , ignore it . If it is offensive , report it . If a person is continuously spreading negativity , block him . Negativity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is exactly that : a choice . Spread positivity instead . Before posting , ask yourself , " Could this offend someone ? " If the answer is yes , even if its just one person who may be offended , do n't  post it . And , if you see people being bullied online , reach out to them . Chances are that they feel like they are fighting a virtual battle alone . Just knowing you are there for them can give them the strength to report their problems to someone who can help . Studies have shown that more than 50 percent of teens have been a target of cyberbullying . The same study also says that half of those who are bullied do n't  reach out for help . Will you choose to be a bystander , or will you , in the words of Maya Angelou , " Be a rainbow in someone elses cloud " ?

Siminoff became a successful businessman , specializing in suit and cloak manufacturing . He joined Fidelity Lodge No. 120 in San Francisco and was so moved by the three principal tenets of Freemasonry brotherly love , relief , and truth that he donated $30,000 to the Masonic Homes for the construction of a lodge building and church .

Just 45 minutes a month eliminates wasted time at stated meetings and brings leaders closer as a team . <p> Past Master Michael Woodruff explains : <p> Background <p> Last year , our elected officers decided to meet once a month as an Executive Committee .

It can even be at Starbucks . <p> Virtual visits : If one member ca n't attend in person , we use telephone or email to keep him in the loop . <p> Tips <p> Create the agenda : We start with a blank stated meeting agenda and complete it together . We consider which items need more research or an immediate decision , and determine our collective stance . <p> Coordinate correspondence : The secretary brings any lodge correspondence .

A little heads-up goes a long way . At our Executive Committee meetings , we try to predict what new business may arise , and the best way to address it . <p> Precedent for the president : Weve found it immensely valuable to have the hall association president at these meetings .

@@49976671 @3476671/ <h> News <h> Prince Hall : A Social Reformer of Tremendous Masonic Conviction <p> This story originally appeared in the Fall 2002 issue of California Freemason . <p> For the ex-slaves living in post-Revolutionary Boston , Freemasonry offered a set of ideas that had great bearing on their identities . The Masonic values of brotherhood , universal love , and the equality implicit in " meeting on the level " could even be used to " challenge the injustices of the dominant culture . " <p> Prince Hall , an ex-slave living in Boston during the last half of the 18th century , used Freemasonry to rethink the status of African-Americans in American society and to challenge the powerful to follow suit . <p> Prince Hall was born into slavery in 1735 . After receiving his freedom in 1770 , he worked as a leather dresser in Boston . It is believed that he was one of the six black men of Massachusetts named Prince Hall listed in military records of the Revolution , and he may well have fought at Bunker Hill . A bill he sent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Boston Regiment of Artillery in April 1777 . His involvement in the Revolution led the way for his fraternal affiliation . <p> On March 6 , 1775 , Prince Hall and 14 other black men were initiated into Freemasonry . Sergeant John Batt , of the Irish Military Lodge No. 441 , conducted the work . When Brother Batts Regiment left Boston three weeks later , he gave Prince Hall a " permet " authorizing them to march on St. Johns Day and to bury their dead in a due and proper manner . <p> After nine years , on September 29 , 1784 , Prince Hall , Boston Smith , and Thomas Sanderson secured the issuance of a warrant by the Grand Lodge of England ( Moderns ) for African Lodge No. 459 . Prince Hall would serve as master of the lodge for many years . This provided Prince Hall with a public identity and a platform for speaking to the Boston community . Contemporary references to him always included his Masonic standing , often identifying him as " the grand master of the black lodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two " grand pillars of Masonry " were love to God and universal love to all mankind . For Hall , Masonrys expressed values of freedom , equality , and human dignity enabled him to formulate a means of denouncing Bostons treatment of black Americans in the years following the Revolution . In 1787 , Brother Hall and other black citizens of Boston filed a petition in the Massachusetts legislature stating that even though blacks paid the same taxes as whites , their children were not allowed to attend public schools . The petition was ignored . So in 1800 , Brother Hall opened a school for black children in his own home , thus founding Boston 's first black school . <p> Prince Hall had his greatest impact by drawing attention to Masonrys other great pillar brotherly love . Speaking as a member of an international brotherhood , he gained the moral authority to challenge the white Masonic orthodoxy of the day , simply by pointing out the inconsistencies between a fraternity that avowed equality and fraternity , yet treated blacks as inferiors . <p> When African Lodge No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts , they were refused entry into " mainstream " Freemasonry . The lodge continued to work , however , and later two other lodges were established : one in Philadelphia and one in Providence . These lodges were the source of the African Grand Lodge . <p> Prince Hall died in 1807 at the age of 72 . Later , the African Grand Lodge honored him by changing its name to Prince Hall Grand Lodge . 142508 @qwx552508

Bro . Charles Kuhn Smith or " C.K . " as he was affectionately known passed away in June , 2015 . A brave , generous , and forward thinking man , he touched a great number of lives in his lodge and in the Sierra City community . <p> Smith was a veteran of WWII . He joined the Army in 1943 and fought in the battle of Lyte Gulf , the largest battle of WWII , which took place in the Philippines . Following the war , he assisted in the Occupation Army in Hiroshima . <p> When Smith returned from his service , he joined the Pacific Phone and Telegraph Company , then purchased the Sierra City Waterworks .

He believed that Sierra Citys early Chinese immigrants were underappreciated for their efforts in building the town , and commissioned a bronze plaque to commemorate their efforts . He traveled to China to obtain a hand-engraved brick to place above the plaque , which is posted at the Kentucky Mine and Museum . <p> Yet among Smith many gifts , one in particular stood out to current Harmony Lodge Master Jerry Brzyscz . In the center of downtown Sierra City , there is a historic bell tower . It is an A-frame structure with two timbers holding a bell at the top ; at the bottom of the timbers are concrete pillars .

When he passed , I wanted to remember him for everything he had done for us . " <p> Brzyscz found the perfect way to do so . He reached out to Smith widow , Winabeth , to inquire about where Smith had obtained the memorial star for his friend , and had an identical one commissioned to honor Smith himself . The star was installed on the second pillar . <p> On May 26 the memorial star was officially dedicated at a Masonic ceremony that included 12 of the lodges 19 members ; Grand Master Perry and his and son , Nick ; and Past Grand Master John L.

Irvine Valley Lodge No. 671 in Lake Forest came up with a number of solutions , including its popular Fellowship Night . Past Master Art Salazar Jr . explains : <p> Background : Today , Irvine Valley Lodge has an enthusiastic membership of 173 . The lodge consolidated in 1997 and has spent years rebuilding , cranking out degrees , and moving members into the line . Officers started to burn out from the constant degrees , and in 2007 we realized that it was time to ease off the gas . Our focus shifted to fellowship . <p> Fellowship Night These nights are all about hanging out and bonding . It just takes some pizza , some soda , and attention to what your members want . Our lodge likes movie nights . For another lodge , it might be book club or game night . <p> Planning : I held a few planning nights before my year as master ( 2008 ) and opened them to every member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social activities , so we came up with the idea of Fellowship Night . <p> The first Fellowship Night : We watched " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " and ordered pizza . It was an unqualified success : about 35 attended , including quite a few members we had n't  seen in awhile . <p> Checking in : Last spring , I held a mid-year meeting to gather feedback . Everyone requested more Fellowship Nights . I asked Entered Apprentices how they felt about it becoming a monthly event : Would they be upset if their degree process took longer because of it ? The response was " Absolutely not " many had joined Masonry because they wanted more fellowship in their lives . After that meeting , Fellowship Night became official . <p> Programming : Every third Tuesday of the month is Fellowship Night . Every other month we do a movie with pizza and soda , and on the alternate month we do a game night , or members bring in Masonic memorabilia as a show-and-tell . <p> TIP : Open Fellowship Night to spouses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellowship Nights . Irvine Valley is planning a July Fellowship Night with a kid-friendly Disney Pixar film . <p> Mentorship and coaching Besides creating time for Fellowship Night , we think that a slower degree process makes candidate advancement more meaningful . We use a few other techniques , too . <p> Mentorship program : We started the program last October . As soon as a candidate is initiated , we assign and introduce him to his mentor . This gives him a primary contact within the lodge and creates a sense of personal accountability . <p> Degree coaching : Every degree night , candidates and mentors get together for coaching . That one-on-one time creates a strong sense of fellowship for new members . <p> All-inclusive activities For new and old members , were always thinking up ways to include the whole family . <p> Dinners : We make stated meeting dinners an extension of Fellowship Night . We bring families , and always invite prospects to come with significant others and kids . We encourage people to show up early to hang out .

We 've started organizing family events , like a picnic at Irvine Regional Park and a trip to the zoo . <p> Community events : We have a twice-annual blood drive , which is a great way for members to share Masonry with neighbors and non-Masonic friends . <p> Lodge calendar : First Tuesday is stated meeting ; second Tuesday we initiate the candidates voted in the week before ; third Tuesday is Fellowship Night . If there 's another Tuesday , we do second or third degrees , depending on our candidate backup . <p> Standing appointment : The standing initiation on the second Tuesday is important . When prospects turn in applications , we tell them to plan for the date .

But were keeping candidates engaged in activities that provide fellowship and involve their families . It does n't  matter if it takes a little longer to go from Entered Apprentice to Master Mason ; they already feel like an active member of the lodge . <p> Conduct new member orientation every month for recent initiates , even if it is just for one Entered Apprentice .

Do these differences represent a choice between quality and quantity and what are the arguments for each ? What does quality mean to the fraternity today : Does it change with the size of a lodge ?

Our old lodge building was falling down , and we were feeling kind of sorry for ourselves . When I became master in 2007 , Secretary Jerry Saville and I began building a community focus . We all realized that there 's more to being a Mason than just coming to a meeting once a month . <p> Thanks to the generosity of local patrons J. R. and Claire Smead , the lodge purchased a new building with six acres of farm land . A few of us have farming experience , so we decided to plant cherry trees . That 's grown into a major cause to fight hunger in the area . <p> Emmaleighs Cornucopia <p> How it began : In the old days there were a number of pick-your-own cherry orchards in the area , so we had the idea to plant our own . At first , it was just going to be a way to fundraise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea : After we planted the 250 cherry trees , we realized we were capable of much more . Our lodge helps with Meals on Wheels , so we knew there was a local need for food assistance . The lodge secretary and I discussed how many families in the area including Masonic families would benefit from fresh produce , not just canned food . Our lodge decided to plant a garden . <p> Answering a need : Our Eastern Star chapter volunteers at Sharing and Caring , a local non-profit that accepts food donations . They referred us to the organization . We donated 1,600 pounds to them this season our first year . We grew corn , squash , tomatoes , beans , pumpkins , and watermelons . <p> Plans for expansion : We just became a licensed California nonprofit . Were building raised beds , which minimize weeds and conserve labor and water . Weve begun fundraising for and designing a greenhouse , so we can produce fresh vegetables year-round . We need $200,000 to do it , and were on our way . <p> The inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . The garden is dedicated to Emmaleigh , the daughter of lodge master Matt Ross and his wife , Kimberly . Emmaleigh passed away earlier this year . Her memory motivates us all . <p> Team Emmaleigh <p> Secretary Jerry Saville , Brother Jimmy Gilliland , and I did most of the research and planting . Jimmy Gilliland is a retired farmer , and I grew up on my parents farm . <p> A core group of dedicated Masons and Eastern Star members maintain the gardens , and area lodges are starting to get involved . We picked produce every day during the harvest season this year . <p> A separate board was formed about two months ago to oversee Emmaleighs Cornucopia : four Tehachapi Masons and one Eastern Star member . <p> Power through partnerships The project is so successful because of support from the Masonic community and the Tehachapi area : <p> A local , non-Masonic builder has been so moved by the project that he and his seven-man crew want to donate one day a week to building the greenhouse . <p> The local Scottish Rite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very involved with the garden . <p> Masons on the California Cherry Advisory Board went out of their way to provide assistance with the orchard . <p> A Mason outside our lodge guided us through a recent application process to become a licensed California nonprofit corporation . <p> The Future Farmers of America at Tehachapi High School want to help with the greenhouse as an educational tool . <p> We have a strong relationship with all the other lodges in our county . The momentum is really building , and I keep getting phone calls from lodges offering support . <p> Community connection : The architect designing the greenhouse is so impressed , he s going to become a Mason . <p> This year , we hosted a pumpkin patch for Cummings Valley Elementary School , which 40 children attended with their parents . We plan to host other community events . <p> We contacted the central food bank and kitchen for Kern County , and asked how much they spend on produce .

@@49976703 @3476703/ <p> Past Master Joe Coppinger has been a driving force behind Moreno Valley Lodges middle school speech contest since it was first conceived 26 years ago . He reports on how the contest is organized and the long-term benefits to students . here 's a summary : <p> Background : In 1982 , the lodge decided it was time to reach out to the community and break down myths about Masonry . We wanted to start with children . Many of us had children in public schools at the time and were proud of Masonrys role in establishing the system . At the same time , we wanted to entice young people to join Masonic youth orders . Since the youth orders often started out with memory work , we decided to hold a speech contest . <p> Contest guidelines <p> Requirements : Middle school students give three to five minute speeches on a prepared theme . Judges evaluate text , delivery , and overall effort/effectiveness . <p> Theme : We ask the superintendent to select a new speech theme each year . Past themes include " What is patriotism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " What free education means to me . " <p> Contestants : Students compete within their grade level sixth , seventh , or eighth . There are several rounds of preliminary contests within the schools , concluding with district finals . There are usually about 18 finalists from the districts seven middle schools . <p> Awards : All students that make it to the district finals receive special certificates . First- , second- , and third-place winners in each grade receive medallions along with $100 , $75 , or $50 U.S. Savings Bonds . First-place winners also receive dictionary and thesaurus sets and have their names engraved on traveling trophies , which are placed on display at their schools . We started the traveling trophy in the first year , and its very popular with the students it really dangles an extra apple for them to reach for . <p> Cost : Total program cost is about $800 . <p> Community connections <p> Public relations : Were named in the newspaper and on local television as the contest sponsor , and we make a point to include the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration : The program had fallen by the wayside a few years ago .

Students are motivated to put in time at home writing and memorizing speeches . <p> The lodge : Theres a strong showing of lodge members at the finals : more than 20 usually attend .

A student who won the speech contest in both seventh and eighth grade is now teaching middle school in the same district . <p> Above and beyond In addition to the middle school speech contest , we sponsor a poster contest for kindergarten through fifth grade . The idea is to plant the seed early , then reinforce it with the middle school speech contest so kids start thinking about DeMolay , Jobs Daughters , and Rainbow for Girls .

Morgan III Prince Hall Freemasonry played an often secretive , yet militant role in the crescendo of sociopolitical conflict that led to the Civil War , as well as during its aftermath , in the period known as Reconstruction . Immediately after the Civil War , Prince Hall lodges assumed increasing relevancy and responsibility , serving as training grounds for the new phenomenon of the black elected official . Furthermore , while debates around slavery and race dominated the American political psyche , Prince Hall Masons served as active participants in nearly every facet of the abolitionist movement . By viewing the various strategies through which 19th century Prince Hall leaders operated , we can begin to understand the race consciousness that permeated the organization , born out of a sense of duty and self-respect . It may be argued that the blueprint written by Prince Hall Masons in the second half of the 19th century set a template for future civil and human rights victories that would be claimed and reclaimed throughout the 20th century . 142508 @qwx552508
