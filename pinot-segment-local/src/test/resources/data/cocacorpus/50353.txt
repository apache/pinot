They allowed it to sidestep its adversaries military advantages and deal them a near-crippling blow . Those weapons , the U-boats of the German Empire , used new technologies to blockade the British Isles and sink millions of tons of Allied shipping . Eventually , the Royal Navy prevailed , but the outcome of that battle was never a foregone conclusion . It took the development of an array of new antisubmarine technologies and tactics , as well as a massive mobilization of resources , that enabled the Allies to win this " First Battle of the Atlantic . " <p> Seventy-six years ago , the Second Battle of the Atlantic began . Again , German U-boats threatened the Allies , this time with new tactics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans had learned how to overcome the antisubmarine warfare ( ASW ) advantages of the Allies , and only by again bringing new technologies , tactics , and resources to bear did the Allies prevail . <p> During the Cold War , our ASW forces engaged in a constant cat-and-mouse game with the Soviet Unions submarines . Nuclear power , ballistic and cruise missiles , and quieter systems empowered Soviet submarines in troubling ways . To respond , the United States and its allies were forced to build greater and more effective ASW forces and continually refine their own ASW technologies and doctrine to counter the Soviets . In the shadow of nuclear deterrence , the stakes of this competition were as high as could be imagined . This was the Third Battle of the Atlantic , and , although it was not a shooting war , it showed once again that a responsive , adaptive , and forward-deployed ASW force is necessary to deter aggression against our nation and its allies . 1 <p> In the early 1990s , the end of the Cold War , the collapse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landmark essay " The End of History ? " led us to believe that our strategic rivalry with Russia and our need to stay one step ahead of Russian capabilities had faded . It has not . Once again , an effective , skilled , and technologically advanced Russian submarine force is challenging us . Russian submarines are prowling the Atlantic , testing our defenses , confronting our command of the seas , and preparing the complex underwater battlespace to give them an edge in any future conflict . Vice Admiral Clive Johnstone , Royal Navy , the head of NATOs maritime forces , noted recently that his forces report " more activity from Russian submarines than we 've seen since the days of the Cold War . " 2 Some analysts believe that even our underwater infrastructuresuch as oil rigs and telecommunications cablesmay be under threat by these new and advanced forces . Russian focus , investment , and activity in the undersea domain are now so unmistakable that even the head of the Russian Navy , Viktor Chirkov , has admitted that Russian submarine patrols have grown 50 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rubles continue to flow into the development of Russian submarine technology and the growth of that force . The father of the modern Russian submarine force , the brilliant and highly decorated design engineer Igor Spassky , admits Russian submarine forces are expanding and advancing , and that they will be a key part of the countrys arsenal for the foreseeable future . 4 <p> By 2020 , the Russian Black Sea Fleet alone will receive the equivalent of $2.4 billion of investment . 5 And these are not the submarines we faced during the Cold War . There may be fewer of them , but they are much stealthier , carry more devastating weaponry , and go on more frequent and longer deployments than before . The submarines of the Russian Federation are one of the most difficult threats the United States has faced . This threat is significant , and it is only growing in complexity and capacity . <h> Russias New Approach <p> Not only have Russias actions and capabilities increased in alarming and confrontational ways , its national-security policy is aimed at challenging the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the new Russian national security-strategy depicts the United States and NATO as threats to Russian security and accuses us of applying " political , economic , military , and information-related pressure " on Russia . 6 Thus , not only is Russia pursuing advanced military capabilities ( especially in the underwater domain ) that enable it to be a credible threat to us , it is now boldly saying that it intends to act as one . <p> An enduring objective of Russian foreign policy today is to challenge NATO and elevate Russia on the European stage once again . 7 Building on the national strategy , the new Russian maritime doctrine reorients its naval forces in a calculated and determined way . By confronting NATO at will , Russia confirms its status as a great power in the 21st century . The new maritime doctrine tells us that Russia will counter our existing ASW technologies ; challenge U.S. and NATOs maritime presence in the Atlantic as well as the Baltic , Black , and Mediterranean seas ; and expand Russian permanent presence in the Arctic and Mediterranean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap with the United States . It has created an advanced military designed to overcome our advantages and exploit our weaknessesthis is the epitome of asymmetric warfare . Nowhere is this more evident than in the maritime ( and especially underwater ) domain . Russia rapidly is building and deploying more advanced and significantly quieter attack submarines and frigates armed with the long-range Kalibr cruise missile ( including six new Kilo-class diesel-electric attack submarines destined for the Black Sea ) . 9 Not coincidentally , these are the platforms that are the most challenging for us to deal with because of their inherent stealth . As demonstrated last December by Kalibr launches into Syria from the Eastern Mediterranean , Russian leaders will use such weapons at will , without the same qualms we have about collateral damage . The clear advantage that we enjoyed in antisubmarine warfare during the Cold War is waning . 10 Russian submarines are more capable than before , and so we are again in a technological arms race with Russia . 11 <p> Russia is claiming maritime battlespace across Europe and deploying forces outside Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interceptor aircraft , air-defense systems , surface ships , and submarines now threatens all maritime forces in the Baltic , as well as our NATO allies in Lithuania , Estonia , and Latviawho no longer control even their own coastlines unless Russian leaders allow them to do so . A similar anti-access/area-denial ( A2/AD ) " fortress " was constructed in the Black Sea after Russian forces invaded Ukraine and seized Crimea . Russian forces deployed to Syria are growing steadily , and Russia has constructed military bases in the Arctic , militarizing and claiming large swaths of it , in contravention of customary international law . 12 In this way , Russia has blunted our power-projection capabilities through A2/AD and extended its influence far beyond its borders . <p> Russia now employs an " arc of steel " from the Arctic through the Baltic and down to the Black Sea . 13 Combined with extensive and frequent submarine patrols throughout the North Atlantic and Norwegian Sea , and forward-deployed forces in Syria , Russia has the capability to hold nearly all NATO maritime forces at risk . No longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost 30 years , Russia is a significant and aggressive maritime power . <p> In his extensive academic research on naval innovation , Owen R. Cote , Jr. , of the Massachusetts Institute of Technologys Strategic Studies Program has long warned of a potential " fourth battle " for control of the undersea domain . 14 It is now clear that a fourth battle is not looming , but is being waged now , across and underneath the oceans and seas that border Europe . This is not a kinetic fight . It is a struggle between Russian forces that probe for weakness , and U.S. and NATO ASW forces that protect and deter . Just like in the Cold War , the stakes are high . <h> Winning the Fourth Battle Today <p> With our allies and partners in NATO and across the globe , we present a broad and united front against any potential Russian threats . Our maritime partnerships yield a global network of navies that together form the greatest maritime force for peace ever known . NATO exercises demonstrate our unity superbly . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 ships , more than 60 aircraft , and a vast array of ground forces , demonstrated their abilities to operate together to defend the Baltic region in BALTOPS . This exercise , in its 43rd year , made it clear that the United States , NATO , and partner nations have an unwavering commitment to protect themselves by acting in concert . Similarly , Sea Breeze 2015 sent a clear signal to Russia that the United States and its allies will not back down in the Black Sea region . Eighteen ships from 11 nations ( Bulgaria , Germany , Greece , Italy , Moldova , Romania , Sweden , Turkey , Ukraine , the United Kingdom , and the United States ) demonstrated the will and ability to operate together to achieve maritime security and conduct air defense and antisubmarine warfare in the Black Sea . <p> A variety of policy and resource shifts have been enacted that signal our resolve to Russia . For example , the U.S. Navys revised Cooperative Strategy for 21st Century Seapower notes the critical importance of all-domain access and deterrence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puts the Navy on a clear path to adapt to the new global security environment . 15 But we must act now to implement such guidance before Russia provokes again . To do so , we must engage and conduct operations forward more deliberately , more strategically , and with more forethoughtand in ways that encourage responsible behavior by Russia while still deterring Russian belligerence . <p> From a diplomatic perspective , we can find areas of common interest . One of the most obvious examples is maintaining safety at sea . Despite the recent aggressive " buzzing " of the USS Donald Cook ( DDG-75 ) in the Baltic by a Russian Su-24 , the incidents-at-sea ( INCSEA ) agreements with Russia remain a heartening example of how we can still cooperate with Russia despite its leaderships adventurism . We also share a desire to defeat violent extremist organizations such as ISIS . We must be prepared to work with Russian leaders if they want to collaborate responsibly on these or other issues of mutual interest . To do so , we can and should meet with our Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international symposiums , and other forums that provide such opportunities should also be encouraged . <p> Of course , diplomacy alone is unlikely to be sufficient . To encourage responsible behavior by Russia we must engage from a position of strength , not weakness . Improving our current force posture in Europe will demonstrate our strength and thereby deter Russia from further adventurism . The first step in improving our force posture is to leverage allied navies to enhance our maritime security . We must work directly with our NATO partners to help them develop the capabilities and capacity to operate seamlessly together and with the United States , respond to contingencies , and protect key maritime infrastructure . Through combined exercises and maritime presence , a network of navies in Europe and across the globe can face Russia from a position of strength and ensure continued peace . Our part in supporting these efforts has been clearly outlined by CNO Admiral John Richardson : We must " prioritize key international partnerships through information sharing , interoperability initiatives , and combined operations and explore new opportunities for combined forward operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not stand " is more true now than it has been in many years . To preserve peace , we must unite to deter Russian aggression . <p> We also should reassess our own global force deployments and exercises . Additional submarines , ASW forces , carrier strike groups , and other assets should be rotated through Europe and used to show Russia that we can bring overwhelming force to bear if need be . We should increase our ASW exercises with our NATO allies , in both the Atlantic , Mediterranean , and elsewhere , to demonstrate that NATO can track Russian submarines at will , no matter where they are . <p> Finally , we must not lose our technological edge . More than perhaps any other warfare area , ASW requires us to stay one step ahead of Russian technologies . In the world wars , the Allies prevailed over German U-boats not by force alone , but by innovation . In the Cold War , the rise of nuclear-powered Soviet submarines required us to develop new acoustic and other technologies . Today , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must maintain an innovative edge and rapidly field new technologies if we are to prevail . 17 <p> At this time in history we would do well to remind ourselves it is better to prevent wars than to fight them . The U.S. Navy , through forward presence , power projection , and technological advantage , is the epitome of demonstrating resolve and capability in the service of war prevention . In todays world , wars can only be truly prevented in partnership and cooperation with other nations . The stronger and more resolute we and our allies and partners are together , the less likely that war will occur . And therein lies the true strength of the U.S. Navyit is not simply by maintaining our technological edge and our readiness to impose unacceptable costs on Russia should the need arise . What makes ours the worlds greatest and most effective navy is the fact that we act in concert with our NATO allies and partners . It is only in this way that we , and all like-minded allies and partners , maintain peaceby unmistakably and constantly deterring Russian aggression .

The General Board , a formal body established by the Secretary of the Navy to advise him on both strategic matters with respect to the fleet , served as the organizational nexus for the interaction between fleet design and the naval limitations imposed on the Navy by treaty during the period . Particularly important was the General Board 's role in implementing the Washington Naval Treaty that limited naval armaments after 1922 . The General Board orchestrated the efforts by the principal Naval Bureaus , the Naval War College , and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations in ensuring that the designs adopted for the warships built and modified during the period of the Washington and London Naval Treaties both met treaty requirements while attempting to meet strategic needs .

We were much slower than the English in adopting this method of propulsion for ocean vessels . In 1848 our steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had nearly caught up to our rival , whose steam tonnage then amounted to 65,921 tons engaged in the foreign trade . This growth steadily continued until 1855 , when our steam tonnage in the same trade amounted to 115,000 tons . <p> Then commenced the decline , which was slow at first , and in 1862 we had 114,000 tons . The decline in shipbuilding commenced about the same time , as is shown by the decrease in the sales to foreigners , falling from 65,000 tons in 1855 to 17,000 in i860 . Next came the war , since which our shipbuilders have been mostly employed supplying the demands of our coasting trade ; the sales to foreigners have been small , there have been built for our foreign trade but a few vessels , and these can hardly be called a paying investment to their owners . The Brazil line stopped with its subsidy . The Pacific Mail is in a most dubious condition , and the Pennsylvania line have not added to the original number of American-built vessels , but instead are using the Clyde-built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced our shipping declined rapidly ; many ships were destroyed by rebel cruisers , but many more were lost to us by whitewashing . Any flag was better than the " stars and stripes , " and from 1862 to 1865 our loss by sales , real or pretended , amounted to 824,652 tons , or more than one-fourth of all the registered tonnage of the United States at the outbreak of the war . <p> In 1861 our entire tonnage was 5,539,813 tons , and in 1880 only 4,008,035 tons , a reduction of over 26 per cent. , and this in spite of the enormous increase in our exports and imports . The following table shows the American and foreign tonnage entered at the ports of the United States from foreign countries in the following fiscal years , viz. : <p> Year <p> American tonnage <p> Foreign tonnage <p> American in excess <p> Foreign in excess <p> 1830 <p> 967,227 <p> 131,900 <p> 835,327 <p> 1860 <p> 5,921,285 <p> 2,353,911 <p> 3,567,374 <p> 1863 <p> 4,614,698 <p> 2,640,378 <p> 1,974,320 <p> 1864 <p> 3,066,434 <p> 3,471,219 <p> 404,875 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 4,711,940 <p> 12,218,365 <p> 7,506,425 <p> 1880 <p> 3,436,964 <p> 14,573,685 <p> 11,136,721 <p> The following shows the percentage of decrease in our merchant marine , including registered , enrolled and licensed vessels . In 1876 the decrease was 11.83 percent. ; in 1877,0.86 ; in 1878,0.70 ; in 1879 , 1.02 , and in 1880 it was 2.43 per cent . <p> The following is the official statement of our merchant marine on June 30th , 1880 : <p> Number of vessels registered , 2,378 <p> Number of vessels enrolled 16,410 <p> Number of vessels licensed 4,924 <p> Total number of vessels , 24,712 = 4,068,035 . <p> Of these 4717 are steamers , 132 being registered ; of the registered steamers , 44 are built of iron . Our once immense whaling fleet consists of 174 vessels=38,408 tons . <p> For the year ending June 30th , 1880 , the following is the report of vessels built : <p> Sailing vessels 460=590,571.9 tons , 1 of iron , <p> Steamers 3481=788,537.0 tons , 30 tons of iron of these eleven are ocean steamers . <p> All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged in foreign trade has greatly declined , and this in the face of an enormous increase in our exports and imports . Our commerce is very large but our carrying trade is very small . The statistics show that we first fell behind Great Britain after the successful introduction of steam , but soon overtook her again , and continued advancing until 1855 , when commenced again a slow decrease , which continued until the outbreak of the rebellion . From this time until 1865 the decline was rapid , since then there have been slight increases , but terribly small in proportion to our commerce , and in the last few years there has been a decrease , and at an increasing rate , threatening a complete extinction of our foreign carrying trade . <p> PROGRESS OF BRITISH SHIPPING . <p> The progress of British shipping affords a sharp contrast to the above , and a useful lesson may be drawn from an account of it . The number and registered tonnage of vessels remaining on the register at the end of the year 1879 were as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2,733,269 <p> Number of sailing vessels , 32,662 ; tonnage , 51729,095 <p> Total , 39,291 ; tonnage , 8,462,364 <p> The greater effectiveness of British tonnage , arising from the rapid increase of steam vessels as compared with sailing vessels , is vividly shown in the table of entries and clearances . It appears that there was an increase of 2,173,000 tons in the entries , and of 1,652,000 tons in the clearances of British ships , and an increase of 368,000 tons in the entries , and 70,000 tons in the clearances of British sailing ships at ports in the United Kingdom in one year . On the other hand , there was a decrease of 730,000 tons in the entries , and 834,000 tons in the clearances of foreign steamships at ports in the United Kingdom . The entries of British ships show an increase in tonnage of 3 per cent , and the clearances an increase of 2 per cent , over 1878 ; whereas the entries of foreign ships show a decline of over 3 per cent , and the clearances of over 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It appears that in i860 the tonnage of the British Empire was 5,710,968 ( sailing and steam ) , and the tonnage of the principal foreign maritime nations , excluding the river tonnage of the United States , was about 7,000,000 ( sailing and steam ) . Allowing a steam ton to be equal in effectiveness to about four sailing tons , the tonnage of the British Empire was equal in effectiveness to 7,211,000 tons , whilst the tonnage of foreign countries was equal in effectiveness to 8,000,000 . <p> In 1879 , however , the tonnage of the British Empire was about 8,500,000 , and the tonnage of the rest of the world was about 8,200,000 . Allowing as before for the superior effectiveness of steam tonnage , it is found that the tonnage of the British Empire is equal in effectiveness to 16,000,000 tons , whilst the tonnage of the rest of the world is equal only to about 11 or 11 + million tons . In 1860 the tonnage of the British Empire represented about 47 per cent , of the tonnage of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAUSES OF THE DECLINE : INTRODUCTION OF STEAM . <p> The first blow to our success was evidently the introduction of steam as a motive-power . The shipbuilders of Great Britain , struggling with difficulty to compete with our shipbuilders , seized upon steam as a means of advance . At first they were able to supply the workmen , while in America skilled labor was very scarce , but in ten years we had again caught up with Great Britain . But now steamship lines took the place of the old packet lines , and although more expensive to build and run , they were so much more effective as to be able to carry much greater quantities of freight for the same length of time . <p> IRON SHIPS . <p> In 1856 the second blow was felt by the growing demand for iron ships . Still this demand was not so pressing as to be injurious to our carrying trade , and in 1862 we had only lost 1000 tons . But our shipbuilders felt it severely ; the sales to foreigners declined very rapidly from 65,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English shipbuilders got a good start , as they had both plenty of skilled workmen and cheap and accessible materials . The tables were turned on our shipbuilders , and now they had greater difficulties to strive against than the British formerly had been unable to overcome . <p> THE REBELLION . <p> Now came the crushing blow to our merchant marine , the rebellion of the Southern States . Our carrying trade was still large ; we not only carried for ourselves , but for foreigners as well . Our navy was insignificant , and all its efforts were required to blockade the southern coast and to capture rebel ports . Our shipping was left unprotected , many vessels were captured , many destroyed , and large numbers changed their flag , so that the capital invested in them might be secure . Owing to this , we found at the close of the war that our foreign carrying-trade was nearly destroyed ; not only that which we formerly carried for other nations , but even our own goods were carried in foreign bottoms . When the tonnage we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the general market , the vessels were found to be behind the age ; the demand was for iron vessels ; wooden ones found it hard to find cargoes and then only at very low freights , while at the same time they were more expensive to run than iron vessels . Our shipbuilders had either been without work or engaged building vessels for the government . The building of these makeshifts was of little aid in learning the problem of iron shipbuilding . While we had been perforce idle , the British had made immense strides , and to attempt to compete with them was almost , if not quite , impossible ; also , a new building material had been introduced , mild steel was extensively used for ships , and at the end of the war we were without steel works . <p> THE NAVIGATION LAWS . <p> Now came into play with dire effect the Navigation Laws . These laws prevented the replacing of old types of vessels with new , as they forbid the American flag flying on foreign bottoms . Of these laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , to go to Turkey or Russia to find instances of legislative and administrative abuses to equal the existing laws and regulations of the United States about ships , the carrying trade , and foreign commerce . These laws have been brought to public attention again and again , but apparently with little effect in awakening popular attention , while the newspapers carry all over the country details about abuses in Ireland , Russia and South Africa . We should stop bragging about a free country , and about enlightened power of the people in a democratic republic to correct abuses , while laws remain which treat the buying , importing , and sailing of ships as pernicious , or at least doubtful and suspicious actions . " The following are the more important of these laws . <p> Section 4131 . Vessels registered pursuant to law , and no others , except such as shall be duly qualified , according to law , for carrying on the coasting trade and fisheries , or one of them , shall be deemed vessels of the United States , and entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they shall not enjoy the same longer than they shall continue to be wholly owned by citizens and to be commanded by a citizen of the United States . And officers of vessels of the United States shall in all cases be citizens of the United States . <p> Section 4132 . Vessels built within the United States , and belonging wholly to citizens thereof , and vessels which may be captured in war by citizens of the United States , and lawfully condemned as prize , or which may be adjudged to be forfeited for a breach of the laws of the United States , being wholly owned by citizens , and no others , may be registered as directed in the Title . <p> Section 4133 . No vessel shall be entitled to be registered , or , if registered , to the benefits of registry , if owned in whole or in part by any citizen of the United States who usually resides in a foreign country , during the continuance of such residence , unless , etc . <p> Section 4134 . No vessel shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , or , if registered , to the benefits of registry , if owned in whole or in part by any person naturalized in the United States , and residing for more than one year in the country from which he originated , or for more than two years in any foreign country , unless , etc . <p> Section 4135 . No vessel which has been recorded and registered as an American vessel of the United States , pursuant to law , and which was licensed or otherwise authorized to sail under any foreign flag , and to have the protection of any foreign government during the existence of the rebellion , shall be deemed or registered as a vessel of the United States , etc . <p> Section 4136 . The Secretary of the Treasury may issue a register or enrollment for any vessel built in a foreign country , whenever such vessel shall be wrecked in the United States and shall be purchased and repaired by a citizen of the United States , if it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Secretary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cost of the vessel when so repaired . <p> Section 4142 . This section contains the oath required from the owner before registration . This oath declares that everything is in conformity with the foregoing statutes . The final clause is worthy of notice : " That the person so swearing is a citizen of the United States , and that there is no subject or citizen of any foreign prince or state , directly or indirectly , by way of trust , confidence or otherwise , interested in such vessel , or in the profits or issues thereof , etc . <p> Section 4165 . No vessel which is registered , pursuant to any law of the United States , and which is seized and captured and condemned , under the authority of any foreign power , or which by sale becomes the property of a foreigner , shall be entitled to or capable of receiving a new register , notwithstanding such vessel should afterward become American property ; but all such vessels shall be taken and considered , to all intents and purposes , as foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel registered as a vessel of the United States shall be sold or transferred , in whole or in part , by way of trust , confidence , or otherwise , to a subject or citizen of any foreign prince or state , and such sale or transfer shall not be made known , as hereinbefore directed , such vessel , together with her tackle , apparel , and furniture , shall be forfeited , etc . <p> Section 4180 . Every vessel built in the United States , and belonging wholly or in part to the subjects of foreign powers , in order to be entitled to the benefits of a ship built and recorded in the United States , shall be recorded in the office of the collector of the district in which such vessel was built in the manner following , etc . <p> There are three ways of recording vessels entitled to carry the American flag . By register the vessel is entitled to carry on the foreign trade . Vessels owned and officered by citizens of the United States and built there , or captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wrecked vessels on which the cost of the repairs has amounted to three-fourths the value of the vessel , and no others , <p> are entitled to register . <p> All vessels not registered , if above 20 tons , must be enrolled ; the restrictions are the same as for a registered vessel . All vessels below 20 tons and all enrolled vessels carrying on the coasting trade are licensed . No foreign vessel can carry on the coasting trade , and trading between Atlantic and Pacific ports is considered as coming under the head of coasting . No enrolled or licensed vessel must visit a foreign port without special permission , nor can they carry on the foreign trade without being registered . <p> Nearly all the laws under Title XLVIII hamper our merchant marine . Some are injurious without any apparent excuse for their existence , such as those preventing the investment of foreign capital in American vessels . Others have been passed in order to benefit some other business ; such as prohibiting the American flag to any but American-built ships . This was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crushing them . Some are necessary for the prevention of attempts to defraud the revenue , and are necessary as long as we maintain a high tariff . <p> TAXATION . <p> The war severely stretched the purse-strings of the nation , and it was necessary to raise money by taxation in every direction . So the capital invested in shipping was taxed . The following are extracts from the Revised Statutes , showing the laws for this taxation : <p> Section 4219 . Upon vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place there shall be paid duties as follows : On vessels built within the United States but belonging wholly or in part to subjects of foreign powers , at the rate of thirty cents per ton ; on other vessels not of the United States , at the rate of fifty cents per ton . Upon every vessel not of the United States , which shall be entered in one district from another district , having on board goods , wares , or merchandise taken in one district to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate of fifty cents per ton . Nothing in this section shall be deemed in anywise to impair any rights or privileges which have been or may be acquired by any foreign nation under the laws and treaties of the United States relative to the duty of tonnage on vessels . On all foreign vessels which shall be entered in the United States from any foreign port or place , to and with which vessels of the United States are not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade , there shall be paid a duty at the rate of two dollars per ton ; and none of the duties on tonnage above mentioned shall be levied on the vessels of any foreign nation if the President of the United States shall be satisfied that the discriminating or countervailing duties of such foreign nations , so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States , have been abolished . <p> In addition to the tonnage duty above imposed , there shall be paid a tax at the rate of thirty cents per ton , on vessels which shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from any foreign port or place ; and any rights or privileges acquired by any foreign nation under the laws and treaties of the United States relative to the duty of tonnage on vessels shall not be impaired ; and any vessel , any officer of which shall not be a citizen of the United States , shall pay a tax of fifty cents per ton . <p> Section 4220 . No vessel belonging to any citizen of the United States , trading from one port of the United States to another port within the United States , or employed in the bank , whale , or other fisheries , shall be subject to tonnage tax or duty , if such vessel be licensed , registered or enrolled . <p> Section 4223 . The tonnage duty imposed on all vessels engaged in foreign commerce shall be levied but once within one year , and when paid by such vessel , no further tonnage tax shall be collected within one year from the date of such payment . But this provision shall not extend to foreign vessels entered in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels of the United States are not ordinarily permitted to enter and trade . <p> The above taxation falling at a time when the carrying trade had already received such severe blows , aided in the decline . State taxation is also a severe burden , but Pennsylvania extorts no tax , and there is a move to repeal such taxes in other States . There is also an indirect tax on shipping , in that certain articles which enter into the composition of ships are still taxed . The following sections show what articles are on the free list : <p> Section 2513 . All lumber , timber , hemp , manila , and iron and steel rods , bars , spikes , nails and bolts , and copper and composition metal , which may be necessary for the construction and equipment of vessels built in the United States for the purpose of being employed in the foreign trade , including the trade between the Atlantic and Pacific ports of the United States , and finished after the sixth day of June , eighteen hundred and seventy-two , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe ; and , upon proof that such materials have been used for such purpose , no duties shall be paid thereon . But vessels receiving the benefit of this section shall not be allowed to engage in the coastwise trade of the United States more than two months in any one year , except upon the payment to the United States of the duties on which a rebate is herein allowed . <p> Section 2514 . All articles of foreign production needed for the repair of American vessels engaged exclusively in foreign trade may be withdrawn from bonded warehouses free of duty , under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe . <p> SUBSIDIES . <p> Great weight is given by all free ship advocates to the fact that our Atlantic steamship companies had failed before the outbreak of the war ; from this they draw the conclusion that even then the high price of our ships had ruined the carrying trade . But have they been entirely fair in their arguments ? As we had been so successful in steamships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their cost did not differ greatly from foreign steamers , nor was there much difference in the running expenses . Then , competing foreign lines had commenced to build iron steamers , but they had not been able to replace the wooden ones . So it was too early to expect that their introduction , at a much cheaper rate than we could hope to build for , should ruin our steamship companies . It seems as if some other cause must be sought , and subsidies seems to suit the case . With Great Britain 's system of subsidies , our carrying trade was doomed to decrease , after the introduction of steam . It is doubtful if any fast mail lines have found steamers paying property , leaving subsidies out of consideration . In our present case the Pacific Mail seemed about to fail after the withdrawal of the subsidy , but much of the stock changed hands , the entire management was changed , and it is now run in the interest of a railroad company . <p> The Oriental and Occidental Steamship Company , chartering English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad . This road can afford to run the steamers even if at a loss , as the railroad freights pay well . The same may be said for the Pennsylvania Steamship Company , The Roach line to Brazil has been withdrawn lately , not being able to compete with English subsidized lines . While , if we had not forbidden the purchase of foreign ships , we could have struggled much longer ; free ships alone would not have enabled us to compete against subsidized lines , but they might have allowed us to compete on routes not occupied by such lines , and to have opened new routes . <p> RESUME . <p> The causes of the decline of our merchant marine may be summed up as follows : The introduction of steam as a motive power , the introduction of iron as the principal material for construction , the payment by Great Britain of large subsidies , the rebellion of the Southern States , the Navigation Laws , and taxation , both by the general government and by the States . The difficulties incurred in introducing steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been overcome at all it is not easy to say , for the war followed the introduction so closely that our shipbuilders had made no efforts ; but it is possible that iron might have been as successfully introduced as steam if the conditions had remained the same . But during the hiatus caused by the war our shipyards were idle or building makeshifts for the government , and there was no chance for the gradual introduction of iron . At the close of the war iron had been well established as the best material , and the yards of Great Britain were supplying the immense demand . Then were felt in full force the Navigation Laws ; the carrying trade was weak , and felt the effect of such laws as trammeled the traffic and inflicted taxation . And those laws which prevented our merchants purchasing foreign built ships completed the ruin . Although our merchants could not have competed with the subsidized lines , they had many other accustomed channels open , which they might have continued to occupy had they been able to purchase iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TAKEN FOR ITS REVIVAL . <p> To revive our merchant marine it is necessary to make the carrying trade profitable to American merchants and to make ships valuable property to own , property which is secure and returns a fair interest on the capital invested . How to do this is a very vexed question . The adherents of the different schemes may be arranged on two sides : that of the Free Ships on the one hand and Subsidies on the other . <p> FREE SHIPS . <p> The followers of the doctrines of free ships are free traders , and are reinforced by most writers on political economy . The argument for free ships has all the weight of free trade at its back ; and free trade in all things , or at least a tariff for revenue as against a tariff for protection , has been presented so strongly by all political economists since the time of Adam Smith , and the facts so fully prove the theory , that the only wonder is how it is possible that the people can take so long to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political economy is not the only one we refuse to learn , nor do we take advantage of the experience of others . Look at the system of sewerage in the national capital , where the plan of building immense sewers is being followed at an enormous expense , in spite of the fact that numerous cases in England have shown that large sewers are as unhealthy as they are expensive , and that small ones do their work properly where large ones fail . <p> David A. Wells has written one of the most exhaustive articles on Free Ships ; in this he says : " If by reason of natural conditions and circumstances the exports and imports of the United States can be transported more cheaply and conveniently by the people and vessels of foreign countries than by our own people and vessels , it would be fighting against nature and a waste of resources to attempt to have it otherwise by paying subsidies , or what is the same thing , hiring people to do what naturally it is not for their interests to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreigners in the carrying trade of the ocean is the result of our own bad management and stupidity , then the failure so to do is such a loss of opportunity and waste of resources as would , if general , result in complete national impoverishment and decrepitude . " And he shows very plainly that in his opinion it is the result " of our own bad management and stupidity , " and makes out a fair case ; but while he maintains the opinion , he fails to show that the repeal of the Navigation Laws and the free admission of foreign ships to American registry will re-establish our carrying trade . Prof. Sumner in a concise and lucid article in the North American Review lays down the dictum of Free Ships as governed by the laws of free trade . He says : " On the other hand , the emancipation of foreign commerce from all trammels of every sort is the only means of increasing the natural , normal . and spontaneous support of carrying and shipbuilding , assuming that the carrying trade and shipbuilding are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said above that , if there were no restraints or interferences , we should simply notice whether any Americans took to the carrying trade or not , and should thence infer that they might or might not be better employed in some other industry . It is impossible now to say whether , if all restrictions were removed , the carrying trade or shipbuilding would be profitable industries in the United States or not . Any opinion given by anybody on that point is purely speculative . " Again , " It is , however , no object at all for a country to have either shipbuilding industry , or carrying trade , or foreign commerce . Herein lies the fundamental fallacy of all the popular and congressional discussions about ships and commerce . It is only important that the whole population should be engaged in those industries which will pay the best under the circumstances of the country . " Thus he thinks the only way to increase our marine is to repeal all the laws which trammel the carrying trade ; but he is not by any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sees no object in attempting to increase our merchant marine . This is the extreme doctrine of those political economists who believe in a free government . They believe that most legislation is hurtful , and that none is right except such as is necessary to protect the citizens of a State from external and internal enemies , against foreign foes and domestic criminals ; also any legislation which trammels one trade injures all . As to the necessity of a carrying trade , of shipbuilding , or of foreign commerce . Prof. Sumner would be undoubtedly right if the millennium had arrived , but for modern times the argument is too ethereal . As the present subject is really the carrying trade and only relates to shipbuilding and foreign commerce in so far as they affect the carrying trade , it will be necessary to show the desirability of increasing the former . A war always seems improbable until we are in the midst of one . Look at our late war ; it was declared imminent many years before it came , and when it did come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A war with Great Britain seems improbable , but it is within the bounds of the possible . In the present state of the carrying trade it is hard to imagine how terrible would be the state of the country in case of such a war . It would be sufficiently unfortunate in any case , as are all wars , but as we now are it would be most disastrous . Look at our grain trade ; not only would it lose one market , but all markets would be cut off for want of vessels to do the carrying , for at the present time Great Britain has seven eighths of that trade . Our grain trade has reached enormous proportions . Every day we hear of blockades at the great ports , elevators full , and long lines of heavily ladened cars lying idle waiting for storage room . The farmers could not sell their grain , railroads would lose freights , they would have less power to purchase , " money would cease to circulate freely , and all business would be paralyzed at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to our merchant marine that the navy must look for assistance in emergencies . Without a merchant marine , where could we look for seamen , for transports , for supply vessels ? What would we have done in the late war without our merchant marine ? Of course , if we have reached the millennium no navy is needed , either for attack or for defense . The adherents of subsidies are full of reasons for establishing a carrying trade , they flaunt patriotism in the face of their opponents , they quote the immense sums paid to foreigners for carrying our exports and imports , and declare this is theft from our own citizens . But these reasons are not sound . True , we pay immense sums to foreigners to do our carrying , but that is because it is cheaper to hire than to perform the work ourselves . The capital that would be required to do our own carrying brings a better return as it is employed , and more than balances the amount spent in hiring foreign bottoms . The real reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessity of providing for the occurrence of war . To provide reasonable security to our commerce against being overwhelmed and crushed by war is why we need ships flying the American flag . <p> Herbert Spencer , who is now at the head of all political economists , and who is a strong advocate of free government , even he says that it is admissible to protect certain branches of manufactures , etc. , when necessary to encourage them for the protection of the state . Our commerce is strong enough to increase rapidly in spite of bad legislation ; our shipbuilding is struggling along by the aid of our coasting trade , where foreign competition is forbidden , but our carrying trade is sick nigh unto death . Heroic measures are necessary for revival , and free ships alone will not effect a cure . <p> SUBSIDIES . <p> The followers of the doctrine of free ships have one great advantage on their side , they appear to be giving disinterested counsel ; but with those who follow subsidies there is always the appearance of interested motives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial of subsidies has been exceedingly unsuccessful . But has it ever been fairly tried ? The amount of the subsidy has usually been small , and it has required each session of Congress great effort and expense to have the money granted . It is not possible to conduct business on a sound basis when such an important factor is doubtful . <p> The cause of the failure of our subsidized lines is that they have had to compete with lines already more highly subsidized , and with a country at their back ready to increase the amount if necessary . The repeal of the acts which prevent free trade in ships , in the materials which enter into their construction , and which impose taxation , would not allow the American capitalist to compete with the Europeans who have already large amounts invested in ships and are aided by their governments with large subsidies . We must subsidize American steamship lines . <p> The following shows the necessity of subsidies to British steamers which can be built so much more cheaply than our own . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the affairs of the Royal Mail S. S. Company , he expresses forcibly the absolute necessity of a subsidy for the maintenance of that company , as also the Peninsular and Oriental S. S. Company . He says , " In my report upon the accounts of the P. and O. Co. , I showed that the revenue , exclusive of subsidy , which the company expected to earn in the performance of the services required from them , would cover only 85 per cent , of the expenditures proper to those services . " " The actual revenue , exclusive of subsidy , of the R. M. Co , in the year 1864 , the period of their greatest prosperity , amounted to 90 per cent , of their expenditures , but in the following year it fell to 85 per cent. , and in the next to 79 per cent. , whilst in the present year it will be barely 70 per cent , of their expenditure . " <p> Subsidies paid by the French Government for the same year amount to 23,388,892 francs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their want of candor ; they profess that they oppose the doctrine of free ships in the interest of shipbuilding when they really advocate subsidies in the interest of ship-owners . They proclaim as a fact that ships can be built as cheaply in the United States as in Great Britain . Then why oppose free ships ? Hill says : " Great Britain can no longer claim to be the cheapest ship market in the world . . . . The cost of English-built iron ships complete is I3 10s. to 14 per ton . The offer has been publicly made to build , in this country , ships of like specifications for the same amount currency , viz. , $67.50 to $70 per ton , and guarantee an A 1 rate 20 years . In 1870 this could not be done , hit it can be to-day ' ' If we can build as well and cheaply as the English , which is better and cheaper than any other nation , free ships would not injure our shipbuilders . But this is not true . The Pennsylvania Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its freight in English-built steamers . Mr. Hill says the cost of the necessary labor is from 50 to 60 per cent , of the entire cost of an iron steamer . Mr. Roach says it is about 60 per cent . Mr. Roach , when interviewed on the occasion when he had trouble with his employees , produced a table from " Young 's Labor in Europe and America " to show how much he had to struggle against , and it conclusively proves that it is impossible to build as cheaply in this country as in Great Britain under existing circumstances . The following is the table : <p> Shipyard Department <p> United States England <p> Shipsmiths $15.95 $6.05 <p> Angle-iron Smiths $13.20 $6.29 <p> Helpers $8.80 $3.75 <p> Platers and Fitters $13.20 $6.40 <p> Calkers $9.35 $5.32 <p> Laborers $7.70 $3.38 <p> Rivet boys $3.30 $1.69 <p> Carpenters and Boatbuilders $13.20 $6.53 <p> Joiners $12.65 $6.53 <p> Painters $12.10 $7.32 <p> Riggers $11.00 $6.20 <p> Planers $8.80 $5.68 <p> Punchers $8.80 $5.00 <p> Riveters $11.00 $5.20 <p> Steam Engine Department <p> United States England <p> Draftsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6.59 <p> Helpers $8.80 $3.87 <p> Finishers $13.20 $5.86 <p> Turners $13.20 $6.05 <p> Planers $13.20 $6.25 <p> Boiler Department <p> United States England <p> Fitters $13.20 $6.47 <p> Riveters $11.00 $5.44 <p> Calkers $9.35 $5.00 <p> Holders on $8.25 $4.00 <p> Laborers $7.26 $3.38 <p> Boys , heaters and passers $3.30 $1.25 <p> Flange Turners $16.50 $6.20 <p> Iron Foundry <p> United States England <p> Loam Moulders $16.50 $6.50 <p> Green-sand Moulders $13.20 $6.37 <p> Melters $13.20 $6.00 <p> Helpers $7.70 $4.00 <p> Brass Foundry <p> United States England <p> Brass Moulders , $14.30 $6.15 <p> Melters , $8.80 $5.50 <p> Chippers , $11.00 $4.00 <p> Laborers , $7.70 $3.35 <p> Total weekly wages , 36 men , $406.01 $192.60 <p> Weekly wages of 2000 men . $22,556.00 $10,700.00 <p> ( at same average ) <p> This shows that wages are over double as much in the United States as in Great Britain . Now even if the raw material is as cheap in our country as in Great Britain , a vessel there would cost about five-eighths what it would cost in this country . From a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one American shipyard has accomplished . It shows that $14,000,000 were paid for labor and only $890,147 for material : a shipbuilder in Great Britain would have had to pay less than $7,000,000 for the same amount of labor . <p> Shipbuilding is so closely united with the carrying trade that it is hard to sever their interests ; and as our carrying trade was strangled in the interest of the shipbuilders , so it has reacted on them , and would have entirely destroyed them but for our coasting trade . When it comes to the foreign trade , shipbuilders must give way , even if they consult only their own interests . There will be no foreign carrying trade unless our capitalists can buy ships as cheaply as those of other nations ; and it would be better for the shipbuilders to have a carrying trade , even if all were foreign bottoms , for then they would have the repairs , and there would be a demand for their ships when labor became sufficiently cheap . <p> Some of the advocates of subsidies seem to think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage to pay large enough subsidies to enable steamship lines to be run with profit to their owners in spite of dear ships , in spite of present subsidies , and in spite of the increased subsidies , which would be given as soon as we attempted to compete . <p> Compromise . <p> There must be some compromise between the two factions , some ground upon which they can meet in common and both unite in order to influence legislation . Neither is strong enough to succeed alone . Most protectionists will oppose free ships , fearing that free trade in one article will only start the ball rolling toward free trade in all . Then there are those who , while not hoping for a general scheme of subsidies , hope to get through their own little scheme and thus be personally benefited . There are also free traders who , while they argue for free ships only , hope to use it as an entering wedge . <p> While free trade may be most devoutly hoped for , the object of this essay is to show how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to draw that interest as much as possible from the clashing parties ; not to put forward a scheme which would be adapted to the merchant marine under favorable circumstances , but what would best suit the existing state of affairs ; in other words , a practicable scheme . The great danger of a compromise is that it suits neither side , yet all legislation of the present day is the result of a compromise , and however strong and eager the advocates of any scheme may be , they must yield somewhat to their opponents , or there will be a deadlock , then a compromise is adopted and becomes the subject of abuse for all parties . <p> As the French have been wisely striving to increase their carrying trade , also their shipbuilding interests , something may be gained by looking at some new laws intended to promote those interests . These laws are in addition to a subsidy already quite heavy . <p> The French Mercantile Marine Bill . <p> Article 1 . The right of free pilotage is granted to all sailing vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurement does not exceed 100 tons , whenever they run regularly between port and port , and habitually frequent the entrances to rivers . <p> Nevertheless , at the request of the chamber of commerce , and after an inquiry in the usual form has been made , the public administrative regulations shall determine the modifications of rules which may be considered necessary in the interest of navigation . <p> Art . 2 . For foreign-going vessels the visit of inspection prescribed by Article 225 of the Commercial Code for a fresh cargo loaded in France shall not be obligatory unless six months have elapsed since the last inspection , except the vessel may have sustained damage . <p> Art . 3 . For the official documents or proces-verbaux , showing the changes of owners of the ship , either totally or partially , a fixed charge shall be made for registration of 5 francs . Article 5 , No. 2 , of the law of the 28th February , 1872 , is repealed so far as it is contrary to the present provision . <p> Art . 4 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff , the following allowances shall be made them : <p> For gross tonnage : For iron or steel vessels , 60 francs ; for wooden vessels of 200 tons or more , 20 francs ; for wooden vessels of less than 200 tons , 10 francs ; for composite vessels , 40 francs ; for engines placed on board steamers , and for auxiliary apparatus , such as steam pumps , donkey engines , winches , ventilators worked by machinery , also boilers and connecting pipes , 12 francs per 100 kilog . <p> Ships planked with timber , having beams and ribs of iron or steel , are to be considered as composite vessels . <p> Art . 5 . Every change in a ship by which an increase in measurement is gained shall give right to a bounty , based on the above tariff , according to the increase of tonnage gained . A similar bounty shall be granted for driving engines and auxiliary apparatus placed on board after completion of the ship . <p> On change of boilers the owner shall be allowed a compensation allowance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubes , if of French make . <p> Art . 6 . The fees granted by Articles 4 and 5 shall be paid on delivery of the ship 's register by the receiver of customs at the port nearest to the place of construction . <p> Art . 7 . The regulation of admission in bond fixed by Article 1 of the law of the 19th May , 18 16 , and by Article 2 of the law of the 17th May , 1879 , is abolished . <p> Art . 8 , Shipbuilders shall receive allowances for vessels on the stocks at the time when the present laws shall come into force , as stipulated in Articles 4 and 5 , after deducting the amount of custom dues fixed by the conventional tariff on foreign imports which may have been entered in bond for shipbuilding purposes . <p> Art . 9 . As compensation for charges imposed on the mercantile navy for recruiting and the military navy , a navigation bounty shall be granted , during ten years from the date of publication of this law , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounty is applicable only to foreign-going vessels . <p> It is fixed at 1 franc 50 centimes per register ton and per 1000 miles run for vessels fresh off the stocks , and decreases annually by 0.075 franc for wooden vessels , 0.075 franc for composite vessels , 0.05 franc for iron vessels . <p> This bounty is increased by 15 per cent , for steamers built in France according to plans approved of by the marine department . <p> The number of miles run is calculated according to the distance from the point of departure to the point of arrival , measured on a direct maritime line . <p> In case of war , merchant ships can be requisitioned by the State . <p> Vessels used for fishing , those belonging to subsidized lines , and yachts , are excepted from receiving a bounty . <p> Twenty per cent , from the bounty granted by the present law shall be deducted and paid into the " Caisse des Invalides " of the marine , so as to increase the retiring pensions of registered seamen . <p> Art . 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Article 9 of the present law shall be obliged to carry , free of charge , mails put under his charge by the post-office authorities , or which he will deliver to their administration , as prescribed in the consular decrees of the 19th Germinal , year X. <p> If a post-office agent is deputed to accompany the despatches , he shall also be conveyed free of charge . <p> Art . 11 . A regulation of public administration , containing a special statement of the distance between ports , shall fix the system on which this law shall be applied . <p> The above bill has already passed the Chamber of Deputies , and is now undergoing examination in the Senate . <p> Resume of the laws and regulations governing owners or part owners of foreign-built ships in France , which shows the privileges granted to the most favored nations . <p> Naturalization of Merchant Vessels purchased in Foreign Ports . <p> Sea-going vessels purchased in foreign ports , one-half of which at least is owned by French citizens , may be permitted to sail under the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 1 . The Import Duty , which is payable to the custom house . <p> 2 . The Transfer Duty , which is payable at the registration office . <p> 1 . Import DutyThis duty differs according as vessels are admissible at the rates fixed by conventional tariffs or are subject to those of the general tariff . <p> Conventional Tariff , Sea-going vessels are obliged to pay , according to the conventional tariffs , 2 francs per ton of their actual capacity ( no deduction being made for the space occupied by machinery , coal , sleeping apartments of crew , &amp;c . ) Vessels are measured by the English method known as the Moorsom method . For the conventional tariffs to be applicable the vessel must have been built in one of the European states with which treaties of commerce have been concluded since 1860 ; since they were launched , moreover , such vessels must not have ceased to carry either the flag of the country in which they were built , or that of some other contracting European state . The contracting European states are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norway , the Netherlands , Portugal , Austria , Germany , Turkey , Russia and Spain . <p> General Tariff.According to the general tariff , sea going vessels are obliged to pay the following dues : Vessels of wood , 40 francs per ton of actual capacity , plus 4 per cent . Vessels of wood and iron , 50 francs additional , according to the law of December 30 , 1873 . Vessels of iron , 60 francs additional , according to the law of December 30 , 1873 . All vessels built in non-European countries are obliged to pay the above dues , especially those from the United States and the British colonies , including Canada ; also vessels built in European countries not included in the above list . <p> 2 . Transfer Duty.According to the law now in force , which bears date February 23 , 1872 , any sale of vessels either in whole or in part , is subject to a transfer duty of 2 per cent , of the value ( plus the additional two decimes and the half decime . ) This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on those made in foreign ports . The custom house will not grant permission for a vessel to sail under the French flag until evidence has been furnished that the transfer duty has been regularly paid . But one exception is made to this rule , and that is in the case of a new vessel built in France or in a foreign country for the account of the person who applies for its registration in his own name . <p> Vessels purchased in foreign countries with a view to obtaining permission for them to sail under the French flag may be authorized by French consuls to carry the French flag temporarily , after evidence has been furnished that they have been actually purchased . To this end our consuls issue certificates to captains , which entitle their vessels and cargoes to the same usage on their arrival in a French port that is accorded to French vessels and cargoes . <p> These regulations and laws are very enlightened in comparison with ours , but it will be necessary for us to be even more liberal . We must repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lieu enact laws similar to the following : <p> 1 . Vessels registered pursuant to law , and such as shall be duly qualified according to law for carrying on the coasting trade and fisheries , or one of them , shall be deemed vessels of the United States , and entitled to the benefits and privileges appertaining to such vessels ; but they shall not enjoy the same longer than they continue to be wholly officered by citizens of the United States , <p> 2 . Any and all vessels wholly officered by citizens of the United States may be registered as directed in this title . <p> Also , such laws as are necessary for carrying out the above . <p> This would be a concession by the protectionists , but it is necessary , and would assist instead of injuring shipbuilders . The officers are required to be citizens because it is necessary for the safety of the state to encourage this class , and would ensure the vessels remaining under the flag as long as properly protected . <p> Retain the law requiring all enrolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and allow them the privileges of registered vessels after giving such notification as is necessary to prevent smuggling . The retention of this law is necessary for the protection of shipbuilding , and the protection of shipbuilding is necessary to the safety of the state . Moreover , experience shows that the saying of Mr. Roach , " that no country can have a large carrying trade which has not a large shipbuilding interest , " is true . <p> Repeal all laws for state taxation , and remit the taxation imposed by the general government to all vessels carrying the American flag . <p> Encourage shipbuilding by bounties , as in the proposed French laws . <p> Now come subsidies . It is not meant to recommend subsidies as heretofore granted ; nothing could be more ruinous , nothing more demoralizing . An ample scheme of subsidies is necessary , which shall be given , as far as possible , where it will benefit public and not private ends . It need not take the form of a direct gift , but may be a guarantee of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will have subsidized lines be few at first , to be gradually enlarged in number as the success of the plan is proven ; try only one or two lines , but let the subsidy be sufficient and certain . <p> It would be almost madness to try to establish more Atlantic lines at present ; except possibly one from Savannah or some other Southern port , where a direct line to England , carrying cotton , etc. , and bringing back European manufactures , might be successful with a reasonable subsidy . But lines to Mexico , Central America , and especially South American ports , might be made a success . There would be less opposition to encounter on such lines , there are demands for vessels from these ports , and our general policy of maintaining our supremacy on this continent would be greatly aided by such lines . Now these lines might be made to pay pecuniarily , as well as be according to the dictates of a sound policy , by the increased receipts from custom dues . In the case of the Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1876 , was about $1,500,000 over and above the subsidy , and the actual gain in wealth to the United States by increased trade was enormous . On certain lines which should be approved of beforehand the government should guarantee a certain per cent , on the capital invested , until such a time as the government inspector should find that the receipts of the line were sufficient to pay the necessary interest . The amount of interest should be fixed by a sliding scale , dependent upon the earnings of the company and the ruling rate of interest for that time . This would be a less dangerous and more economical form of subsidy than giving it in a lump sum . As such lines were found to reimburse the government by increased revenue , new lines could be started until our carrying trade bore a just proportion to our needs , and we were placed in a reasonably safe condition in case of war . That there are ports where American lines would greatly advance American business and commerce is conclusively shown by the consular reports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Commercial Relations of the United States . " <p> There must be made another concession in the direction of free trade , and that is in the tariff laws . For against the products of many American states our tariff amounts to prohibition , and in most cases it protects very small interests and benefits only a few men . But all who coin money by our tariff system , a system of protection for the few at the expense of the many , are united by their interests , which are plain and manifest ; while those who are injured are affected more indirectly , and are hard to unite on any plan . Still the country is becoming rapidly educated in the laws and advantages of free trade , and concessions must soon be made . The cry for a revision of the tariff is becoming so strong that the laws will be revised , and although it may be long before we can have a tariff for revenue only , steps will be taken in that direction , a compromise will be effected . <p> Commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce , the carrying trade , and shipbuilding , an executive head will be required , with the necessary force under his control . A Commissioner of Commerce will be needed , to see that the laws are carried into effect , to note their operation and to recommend changes . And it may be hoped that under intelligent direction the various branches will become so important as to justify the bureau under his direction being erected into a department . For the present there is a good nucleus for such a Bureau in the Treasury Department , where all the statistics regarding our commerce , etc. , are gathered and the present navigation laws administered . But the work needs to be gathered from the different bureaux among which it is now distributed , and placed under one head , so that some definite plan of action may be carried out ; and there is needed the same partial independence as is held by the Commissioners of Patents , Agriculture , etc . <p> By collecting his data he will be able to recommend where the subsidies are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . <p> Our Navy . <p> But what will avail all these inducements if our government can not guarantee ample protection to the capital invested ; and how can such a guarantee be maintained without a decent naval force ? Of course if we are to have no wars we need but few vessels to fulfill the duties of peace . But the belief in universal peace is not strong enough to induce capitalists to risk their money without some show <p> of protection . At present the only security to our flag when flown abroad , is the absence of desire or interest to offend . The small empire of Japan has a navy with which ours is unworthy of comparison . <p> In our late rebellion the want of adequate protection was severely felt , and a blow was dealt , by a few light cruisers , to our merchant marine from which it has never recovered . But during this war we showed a facility in raising a naval force which has served to lull the country into fancied security . This feeling of security has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the untruth of which was more apparent to the naval officer than to the general public . <p> Modern warfare afloat can no longer be conducted as of old , where courage and daring could supply the lack of power . What courage would enable the wooden vessel to stand up against one heavily armored ? Or how would daring avail in a slow steamer ? Many are now of the opinion that we have nearly reached a period analogous to that when land troops threw off their armor , and that guns will so far surpass armor that it will only be an unnecessary burden . But whether we fight at sea with armored or unarmored vessels , we must use all modern appliances . A man-of-war requires time and money for building , and the necessary plant can not be supplied rapidly under the pressure of necessity . A vessel-of-war has become a scientific instrument , and requires intimate knowledge of all its parts for successful handling . <p> While in theoretical knowledge our officers are second to none , and are ahead of most , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics they have had no experience since that motley crowd of vessels were assembled at Key West , and the experience there gained was about as useful as the experience of a raftsman would be to the master of a large ocean steamer . Of fleet tactics , ramming tactics , helm angle , etc. , our officers have no practical experience . <p> Our ram and torpedo boat has just been successfully repaired , and she can now make the wonderful speed of eleven knots , so that if she can only find , in case of war , some of the enemy who have , by accident , been reduced to that speed she will no doubt be able to do great execution . No doubt she has spread her fame abroad and thus added greatly to the protection afforded by the American flag . Property on water is like property on land , its value deteriorates or enhances in proportion to its security . And even with subsidies the profits are not large enough to induce capitalists to invest , if insecure , even when speculative mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the speculator . <p> The navy and the merchant marine must go hand in hand . Whatever capital is invested in shipping becomes interested in the navy , and without such an interest being created , adequate appropriations for a naval force can not be obtained . <p> Even with our present small merchant marine the want of proper protection has been felt . The flag of the United States has been insulted by Spain , and there was not sufficient force to avenge the insult . With a stronger force our policy might have been stronger . The show of force we then made was a balloon which may have deceived the Spaniards , but which would have been punctured by the first rifle-shot fired . <p> There is an apparent awakening to the condition and needs of our navy . A board of naval officers has been ordered , and is deliberating upon a plan for building up a navy commensurate to our wants . May this augur well for our merchant marine ! This plan being approved by the Secretary of the Navy , and urged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for building up a nucleus for our navy of the future ; and when the foreign carrying trade assumes its just proportions , the navy growing with it will be able to protect it from foreign aggression , as well as to extend it the hand of brotherly aid in all portions of the globe where commerce may call , and American enterprise send , the Stars and Stripes . <p> The new vessels which must be built will afford encouragement and assistance to our shipbuilders , and thus indirectly assist our carrying trade . <p> The Nicaragua Canal . <p> The mass of our Eastern States are destined to become great in manufactures . Even now , the Southeastern , having somewhat recovered from the effects of slave labor , are raising large manufacturing establishments . The State of Georgia has made immense strides since the war . Our Northeastern States have long been centres of manufacturing industry . <p> The Pacific slope is an immense grain-field , and adding to its acres under culture every day in the Northwest . For a free exchange of commodities between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by land are too expensive for the more bulky articles . A canal connecting the two oceans would give great impetus to trade between the two slopes , and would not injure the railroads , which on the contrary would share in the increase of business due to increased prosperity . Of course , as far as our carrying trade is concerned any other route than the Nicaraguan will do , provided such route can be used for the purpose ; but so far as our present information goes ( and it does not appear as if further information would give different results ) , the Nicaraguan Canal is the only feasible scheme . It has little to fear from such visionary schemes as De Lessep 's sea level canal or Eads ' ship railway ; they may draw away money which would otherwise be invested in the Nicaraguan Canal , but they will fall to the ground when actually attempted ! <p> This canal will also open out a large trade with the western coast of Mexico , Central and South America . As the trade between our Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there will be a large demand for American-built steamers . May our shipbuilders be ready and able to supply this demand . <p> Compulsory Pilotage . <p> The various laws of compulsory pilotage are a severe tax on any regular line of vessels , as they are required either to take a pilot or pay half pilotage , when in most cases the master of the vessel is able to perform all the duties required of a pilot . It is an unjust tax on the commerce and shipping of the country . Why should this body of men require special protection ? It would be as just , and far more beneficial , to tax them for the support of dockyards and require them to use and pay for the docks or pay half dockage fees . The supply of pilots will equal the demand if not interfered with by laws , and the owners may be left safely to consider the security of their property and employ pilots where and when necessary . There are few of our ports where the master of a steamship would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with safety . With sailing vessels it is different ; when obliged to beat up the channel the ranges must be well known , every foot of ground and all the currents familiar . The legality of these State laws is doubtful ; they appear to conflict with the constitutional power of Congress to regulate all affairs of commerce , both foreign and between States . our merchant marine . <p> Our Diplomatic and Consular Service . <p> Any improvement in our diplomatic and consular service would be an aid to our commerce and carrying trade . But if they were formed into a permanent corps somewhat upon the model of Great Britain 's service , it would be of great assistance . Even now the reports of Consuls and Commercial Agents are of considerable value ; but how much more valuable would they be if they had some certainty of tenure of office , and if the excellence of their reports were a test of their fitness for promotion . How carefully would every chance of increasing our commerce be watched , and every means of aiding our marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the so-called " Monroe doctrine , " therefore our diplomats have little else to do besides look after our commercial interests and seek after favorable opportunities for advantageous treaties . So let them be men who are familiar with our commercial and shipping interests . In those ports where our Ministers and Consuls have ex-territorial jurisdiction it is necessary to have lawyers , but they can look after our other interests as well , if sufficient inducements are held forth . <p> Resume . <p> The principal means , then , to be taken for the revival of our merchant marine are : first , the alteration of the Navigation Laws so as to admit any vessel to American register . To allow any one to invest his money in shipping . To allow an American-built registered vessel all the privileges of a licensed or enrolled vessel . To remit the tonnage tax , repeal the laws for State taxation , and compulsory pilotage laws . To pass a comprehensive scheme of subsidies . To place the three interests , so closely bound together that it is almost impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , and shipbuilding , under a Commissioner of Commerce . And to build a navy that will guarantee protection to the capital now invested , and to build it on such a basis that it may grow with the merchant marine , and render certain the carrying of our flag secure and honorable in all portions of the navigable waters of the globe .

The Battle of Ramadi was the most sustained and vicious engagement fought by Navy SEALs since their inception in 1962 . Never has a conventional commander fought a battle using Special Operations Forces as an intricate part of his battle plan . The operational and intelligence-gathering capabilities of a SEAL Task Unit produced startling and unprecedented success on the battlefield and in this urban battlespace . The book is an account of the Navy SEAL Task Unit in Ramadi from October 2005 through October 2007 . The text follows the Battle of Ramadi ( often called the Second Battle of Ramadi ) and the deployment of the SEAL Task Unit in that battle . The book is based on extensive interviews with Army , Navy , and Marine command and operational personnel who fought in this battle , and the author personally spent time in Ramadi in 2007 for a first hand assessment of the situation . Couch considers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement in the Global War Against Terrorism since 9/11 . The Battle of Ramadi and the Battle for al-Anbar Province was the first battle where SOF/Navy SEALs and conventional forces fought side by side to achieve victory . The Battle of Ramadi and the lessons learned provides a template for future joint combined Special Operations Forces and Conventional Forces cooperation in the new battles pace in the war against al-Qaeda and their allies . The lethal component SEALs can bring to an active , insurgent battle space . The Battle of Ramadi was fought with 5,500 soldiers and marines , 2,300 soldiers from the new Iraqi army , and 32 operational SEALS . Of the 1,100+ insurgents killed in the Battle , Navy SEALs accounted for a third of them . <p> Dick Couch is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and served with the Navy Underwater Demolition and SEAL Teams in Vietnam .

In this insightful book , former Navy SEAL Dick Couch gives a credible and historical narrative of the pitched battle for Ramadi through first hand accounts from Naval Special Warfare Task Unit operators and their Army Brothers , who together fought , sweat and bled for the relative peace and rule of law that now presides in al-Anbar , Iraq .

The real story in the Sheriff of Ramadi is how Special Operations and Conventional units put differences aside and cooperated and enhanced each other ? s capabilities to defeat AQI and win over the tribes and ultimately the population in Ramadi .

@@21175412 @1175412/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> Deception Is the Chinese Way of War <p> Chinese military interpretations of the Sun Tzu* are key to understanding their rationale for strategy and operations . <p> Chinese military texts on the teachings attributed to Sun Tzu emphasize the radical and effective nature of deception in Chinese warfare . Ren Li , editor of Lectures on Sun Tzus Art of War , argues that " warfare is a way of deception " is the most shocking concept in the Sun Tzu because it favors an unchoreographed , asymmetric approach to fighting while rejecting any notion of constancy in warfare . 1 The Peoples Liberation Army ( PLA ) uses these military texts to encourage commanders to do all they can to mislead their adversaries while employing agile and flexible responses to the actual conditions encountered on the battlefield . <p> PLA Senior Colonel Ma Jun , for example , leans heavily on this interpretation of deception , charging that " War is precisely war . War is precisely a fight to the death ( literally : you die and I live ) . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality . " 2 Ma notes , however , that such deception is to be used only against adversaries and never against ones friends and colleagues . 3 While it is unlikely that a casual reader of the Sun Tzu would derive such insights from these writings , knowing how the Chinese military interprets these texts is key to understanding their rationale for operations . <h> Meanings of Deception <p> Much of the academic research on the Sun Tzu tends to follow traditional Sinological threadshistorical , linguistic , and philosophical . Mass-market publications apply or misapply the text to contemporary issues such as business , leadership , and golf . Chinese military interpretations have a distinctly different and practical focus . <p> PLA texts explain warfare constantly is changing and can not be fought by relying on predetermined strategies . 4 They emphasize further that the Sun Tzus " way of deception " adds a series of rules to be applied dynamically in various conditions to get the upper hand . These guiding principles must be mastered for planning and directing war . Deception refers to : <p> The value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The recognition that change keeps warfare in a constant state of flux . <p> The imperative to focus on benefiting from and controlling ones superiority in warfare . 6 <p> Guiding principles allow the warrior to develop methods to turn deception into a " magic weapon " that a military strategist brings into play through initiative to vanquish the enemy and gain victory . 7 <h> Methods of Deception <p> The Sun Tzu presents 12 methods of employing deception . PLA texts explain that this is not an exhaustive list , but instead is a compendium of appropriate actions that might be taken in various situations . The list addresses both actions that could be used to deceive or mislead the enemy and other actions that do not meet the typical definition of deception ( e.g. if the enemy is strong , evade him ) . <p> The purpose of the first four methods ( " capable " through " far " ) is to deceive or mislead an adversary . <p> The next four methods ( " greedy " through " strong " ) provide ways of adopting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last four methods ( " angry " through " friendly " ) discuss weakening an adversarys warfighting capability by focusing on morale , psychology , stamina , cohesiveness , etc. , thus causing the enemys strong points to become weaknesses . 8 <p> These categorizations emphasize Ren Lis point that the goal of the " way of deception " is " to as much as possible increase our advantageous conditions and reduce the adversarys advantageous conditions . " 9 Deception not only involves manipulating an adversarys understanding of ones own capabilities and intentions , but also includes manipulating the situation with the goal of further degrading the adversarys capabilities . PLA texts include detailed analyses of each of the 12 methods of deception , explaining the meaning , application , historical examples , and contemporary significance of each method . <p> For example , Method 9 ( If your adversary is angry , then aggravate him ) varies across PLA texts in interpretation . At first , it seems unambiguous : " If the adversary is a bad tempered or obstinate and self-opinionated commander , you should think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me while in a state of having lost his reason . " 10 <p> But Ma Jun broadens his explanation by highlighting the importance of preventing ones side from falling victim to such a method ; <p> We must teach commanders to certainly be cool-headed and calm , not able to bad temperedly do battle . They themselves are not angry and rationally command operations , however we want the same to cause the adversarys commanders at will and in a violent rage to send their armies to do battle . This is the implication of " If he can be provoked , then agitate him . " <p> Ma Jun then relies on a " warring states " era example to demonstrate the danger of being easily provoked and concludes by restating the importance of keeping control of ones anger , even in peacetime . 11 <p> Other analysts take a different view . Because the character translated as " angry " may have originally meant " to have high morale , " some translate Method 9 as , " If morale is high , I should avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then attack him . " 12 Ren Li similarly interprets Method 9 as , " If enemy morale is running high , then frustrate him . " 13 Despite these differences , there remains universal agreement among PLA texts that the Sun Tzus deceptive methods must be understood and applied to achieve success in war . <h> Applying Deception <p> Specific applications of the Sun Tzu occasionally are included in PLA literature . Essentials of Sun Tzu and the Art of War and Submarine Operations , written by the PLA Navy Submarine Academy , for instance , provides four examples of how " warfare is a way of deception " might be applied to submarine operations . <p> " Show yourself to intimidate the enemy . " A submarine is equipped with formidable assault power . It can appear at a certain time or place to create a psychological threat to an adversary and prevent him from taking military action . <p> " Show the false to confuse the enemy . " A few submarines can be deployed to non-principal battle area and show themselves to divert an adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main battle area to catch an adversary by surprise . <p> " Create momentum to harass the enemy . " When a submarine is in the vastness of open-ocean long-range operations , it can create the appearance of the submarine being anywhere at any time , causing the enemy to set up defenses everywhere and yet not being able to defend anywhere , thereby dispersing their forces and exposing their weaknesses . <p> " Deceive to obstruct the enemy . " If a submarine is unable to realistically arrive at the operating area as a result of its slow speed , it can employ deceptive measures . Intentionally divulging incorrect information to the public can cause the adversary to believe that submarines are operating in important sea areas . This can deter an adversarys warships , especially those with poor antisubmarine capabilities . 14 <p> While the types of submarine operations being proposed are consistent with historical submarine employment , it is interesting to note how the Sun Tzus precepts are used to rationalize current operations . <h> A Magic Weapon ? <p> PLA texts analyzing the Sun Tzus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mislead ones adversary are deeply ingrained in the Chinese way of war . While inflexible plans established on anticipated conditions have no place in warfare , PLA commanders must employ agile and flexible deceptive responses to the actual conditions encountered in battle . Whether deception is a decisive " magic weapon " in modern war or not , remains to be seen . <h> The Rise of Deceptive War <p> The Sun Tzus influence on the Chinese militarys view of deception must be understood in context of seventh century Chinese warfare . Warfare was a highly ritualized and ceremonial affair that followed traditional procedures in which " an enemy force was encountered in the field , the day and place of battle would be formally fixed by the two parties , and then the requisite preparations for combat would begin . " 15 Martial legitimacy was earned by conforming to established military protocol . Going into battle without properly establishing ones battle array would not be considered real combat . Even if victory was achieved , at best the outcome was described as " defeating such-and-such an army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tradition " ) , an early Chinese classic , describes such an encounter between the states of Song and Chu in 638 BC . As the warriors of Chu were crossing a river , the Song general twice requested permission from his ruler to attack the vulnerable force and twice was denied . The Song ruler explained that his sense of honor would not allow him to attack the enemy until they had established their battle lines . Ultimately , the Chu force crossed the river , formed their battle lines , and routed the inferior Song army . 17 <p> Given such expectations for ritualized and predictable martial practices , one can imagine how the Sun Tzus 12 methods of deception were received . <p> When one is capable , give the appearance of being incapable . <p> When one is active , give the appearance of being inactive . <p> When one is near , give the appearance of being far . <p> When one is far , give the appearance of being near . <p> When ones opponents are greedy for advantage , tempt them . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When ones opponents are secure , prepare for them . <p> When ones opponents are strong , evade them . <p> When ones opponents are angry , aggravate them . <p> When ones opponents are humble , make them arrogant . <p> When ones opponents are at ease , make them weary . <p> When ones opponents are friendly to each other , divide them . <p> Attack them when they are unprepared ; Come forth when they are not expecting you to do so . <p> Herein lies the victoriousness of the strategist , which can not be divulged beforehand . 18 <p> Traditionalists who revered classic precepts as sources of moral guidance considered the use of deception in warfare to be unethical. 19 Eventually Sun Tzu commentators , such as eighth century Song dynasty scholar Zhang Yu , noted , " Although the root of the use of military force is based on benevolence and righteousness , for them to be victorious they must rely on deception . " 20 Over time , deception has become the accepted Chinese way of war . <p> *Authors Note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text of Sun Tzu ( it was compiled several hundred years after Sun Tzus lifetime ) , concepts and citations are appropriately attributed to " the Sun Tzu .

Although I would soon write a last line in that bloody chapter of Japanese history called the Midway Island Battle , the portion I had originally been scheduled to carry was small , indeed . Of the 160-odd ships that gathered from all parts of the Empire to strike at Midway , and the Aleutians , I-168 had the simplest assignment of allscouting . <p> I had missed the war 's opening battle . While nearly 30 other submarine commanders were deployed around Oahu , I was plodding our Inland Sea in RO-59 . My boat trained officers and crews for duty in larger submarines . We knew nothing ; about the proposed attack on Pearl Harbor , although we did suspect something was afoot because of the heavy radio traffic and many ship movements throughout November 1941 . All ships had been on wartime readiness for weeks . When in port we had a number of surprise drills , during which all hands ashore were ordered quickly back to their ships . <p> On 8 December 1941 , we had such a drill . But when all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we were not given the usual order to secure . Instead , we were told that we were at war with America . Our First Air Fleet had made a very successful attack on the U. S. Fleet at Pearl Harbor , I learned , and we then realized where so many of our first-line units had gone . <p> Some officers were disappointed at not being in on this battle , but I felt that it would be a long war . Therefore , a highly-trained officer like myself , with six special service schools behind him , would eventually see his full share of sea action . Nor was I disappointed five months later when my part in the Midway operation was explained to me at Combined Fleet Headquarters . I had meanwhile relieved Lieutenant Commander Otoji Nakamura as commanding officer of I-168 , in January . Since then we had been exercising in the Inland Sea . I-168 was designed to make 23 knots on the surface , eight submerged . She carried ten torpedoes , with four forward tubes and two in the stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force was to be commanded by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto , who would sail with it in the mighty Yamato , the world 's biggest warship and our national pride . A total of 13 submarines were to form the Advance Expeditionary Force , most of them strung out along two lines east of Midway . They were to report any enemy warships coming out of Hawaii to counterattack , then intercept , and sink them . Four carriers , Akagi , Kaga , Hiryu , and Soryu , veterans of many successful engagements , were to launch two quick air strikes against Midway , after which 5,000 troops in heavily-protected transports would move in and seize the island . This would advance Japan 's perimeter well to the east of the homeland . It might even entice the remains of the American fleet au t to fight . If so , defeating that fleet would give Japan control of the Pacific Ocean . <p> I-168 's task was to scout to the southward of Midway , and report on as much of the enemy 's activities as we could observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see no action at all . We would be near when the troops landed , but by then , our job would have been done . <p> We were the van ship of the entire operation , coming in sight of Kure Island , west of Midway , on 31 May 1942 . Part of the over-all strategy called for seizing this island , too . It was to be a seaplane and midget submarine base . After radioing a report that nothing appeared to be happening on that island , I proceeded to Midway , and spent the first three days of June making observations there . We would spend daylight hours on periscope watch , on Midway 's southern horizon . After dark each night , we moved in within five miles , and continued to watch through powerful binoculars . Our observations made us think that the Americans were expecting imminent attack . I radioed the information that 50 to 100 planes were making landings daily . This meant that American forces on Midway were getting ready to fly extensive patrols , or else were bringing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our striking force , although detected at the last , got near enough to launch planes against the island . I-168 had a front seat , or at least I did , at the day periscope , when 108 of our planes hit the island . Divided into equal numbers of fighters , dive bombers , and torpedo bombers , the last of which operated as level bombers and carried a 1,770-pound bomb each , this force did heavy damage . My crew grew more and more excited as I described the action to them , and a great cheer went up as I described some fuel tanks being blown sky high . <p> This portion of the attack appeared to be successful , even though Midway 's airplane had been warned . We saw them take off before ours arrived , and watched them land after that first attack ended . At this point Japan was doing very well . More than 100 of our 108 planes made it safely back to their carriers , while our Zeros shot down or badly damaged two dozen American fighters . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans counterattacked , with Grumman torpedo bombers , Martin bombers , and Boeing Flying Fortresses , as well as Douglas and Vultee dive bombers . A total of 52 planes attacked our striking force . All were either shot down or driven off , none of them able to do more than get a few machine gun bullets into one Japanese ship . The American aircraft carriers had slipped into the battle area before our submarine scouting lines had gotten into position . Their planes came next . They sent in an additional 41 planes , 32 of which were shot down . At that point , practically no damage had been done to our side . The 4th of June seemed to be a great day for Japanese arms . <p> Then the tide of battle turned . While our Zeros were at low level , defending against torpedo bombers , 54 American divebombers plunged out of the sky against loaded flight decks . They made a shambles of Kaga , Akagi , and Soryu . No hits were made on Hiryu . She soon got away two strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yorktown , but a return attack by the Americans hurt Hiryu so badly that her crew had no choice but to abandon and sink her . <p> By midnight of 4 June , the Midway Battle was lost , though we did not know it yet . Admiral Yamamoto still had hopes of finding the American ships and sinking them in a surface engagement . It was only the cautiousness of the America 's Admiral Spruance that prevented this . Having lost one carrier , Spruance decided it was better to fight again another day , and he turned his ships eastward after a short run westward . Comparison of ships ' logs after the war showed that , bad he continued westward , his two carriers , eight cruisers , and 15 destroyers would have run into a Japanese force that included seven battleships ! <p> While Yamamoto 's main body was steaming eastward , hoping to catch the American striking force , I-168 was given orders to close in on Midway and open fire with her 4-inch deck gun . I was to continue this until joined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These were the world 's most powerful heavy cruisers then . Their 40 big guns might easily have smashed Midway 's defenses with a bombardment in the early hours of 5 June , paving the way for an easy landing of the 5,000 troops in the transport force . <p> I obeyed orders , taking I-168 in . We surfaced about 0130 on 5 June but got off only six rounds before a pair of shore searchlights picked us out . We submerged immediately . Meanwhile , the four cruisers had their order changed , and were withdrawing . In the morning we were sighted by plane and attacked by them , suffering no damage . We were pursued for a short while by an American ship . <p> I-168 slipped back onto station as soon as I thought it was safe . We were supposed to watch the enemy and I intended to do so . <p> The next time our radio antenna poked above the waves frightening news came through it . Soryu and Kaga had gone down the evening before . Akagi and Hiryu had followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the messages gave I-168 a new role to play . Scout planes from Japanese cruisers had sighted the American aircraft carrier Yorktown lying dead in the water about 150 miles northeast of Midway . My orders came through quite clearly : " Submarine I-168 will locate and destroy the American carrier . " <p> We set off at once , running submerged in daylight hours at the best speed we could make and still nurse our batteries . After dark I ran on the surface , but could not use top speed for fear of missing our target in the blackness . So it was that , at 0530 , on 6 June , the 12-mm. binoculars of my best-trained lookout picked up Yorktown . She was a black shape on the horizon , about 11 miles distant . <p> It was the easiest intercept a submarine commander ever made . My course had not changed , from beginning to end . <p> I ordered a dive , a course change to 045 degrees , and then reduced speed to six knots , leveling off I-168 at 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed until we were never doing more than three knots . At intervals I moved I-168 up to 60 feet and took sightings . It required only a few course adjustments to set her heading straight for Yorktown 's beam . <p> Our screws were barely turning over , and I hoped they were not giving off enough turbulence for the American ships to detect us . I had sighted one destroyer ahead of the carrier with a towline out to her , and another destroyer nestled close to Yorktown 's side . Three more kept station on the side I was approaching , which made me feel certain there must be at least two more on the opposite side . This meant seven of them against one of us . <p> It never occurred to me to do anything except continue my approach and attack , in spite of the odds . Our intelligence said the American Fleet had seven carriers . Two of them , Ranger and Wasp , were reported in the Atlantic , and we had word that Saratoga was on the U. S. West coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk in the Coral Sea Battle a month before . That left the United States with no more than three carriers operating against us , and one of them was dead ahead . Sinking her would mean that the enemy would be left with no more than two to use against us for some time , a vital point now that we had just lost four of our first-line aircraft carriers . <p> Each time I took a sight , the sun was higher in the sky . Yorktown appeared to be making just a little headway . I kept making minor changes of course to keep I-168 headed at her amidships section . We might get sunk in this action , but before that happened , I meant to do the maximum possible damage to this ship . I wanted my torpedoes to plow into her midsection , not her bow or stern . <p> In those moments , a lot of faith was being placed by my crew in shrine charms previously given to each I-168 man by Lieutenant Gunichi Mochizuki , my chief electrical officer . Mochizuki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrines ashore , praying . My crew fervently hoped that his piety had given him some extra influence with the gods . When there was time to turn my thoughts in that direction , so did 1 . <p> All I-168 men limited their movements to the most necessary ones only , fearing to create some sound which the American detectors might pick up . By 1100 , I had decided that the enemy equipment was not very sensitive . This gave me confidence as the range shortened ; I kept moving in . Suddenly my sound operator reported that the Americans had stopped emitting detection signals I could n't understand this but , since it was now nearly noon , I tried to make my voice light and told my crew , " It appears the Americans have interrupted their war for lunch . Now is our chance to strike them good and hard , while they are eating ! " There were small jokes made about what to give them for dessert . Shortly thereafter I raised the periscope again . <p> Abaft my beam , each about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one to port , one to starboard . I-168 had safely pierced the protective screen of escorts ; I could now give the order to fire . <p> Then I took another look . Yorktown and her hugging destroyer filled my periscope lens . I was too close ! At that moment I estimated my range at 600 yards or less . It was necessary to come around and open up the range . <p> What I had to do now was try to escape detection by those destroyers above us and get far enough away so that my torpedoes , fired from a 60-foot depth , would have enough running space to stabilize themselves at a 19-foot depth for hitting . Whatever was the reason , enemy sound detectors could no longer be picked up by our equipment , I knew the destroyermen above were not asleep . <p> I kept I-168 in a right-hand circle , easing the rudder a little so that I could return to my original track at a point about one mile from Yorktown . I did n't dare put up the periscope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I concentrated instead on a torpedo tactic I wanted to use . Though some submarines in 1942 had Model 95 torpedoesunderwater versions of the very powerful Model 93 " Long Lance " used on surface shipsmy torpedoes were an older type . Model 95 's had 991-pound warheads , mine had 446-pound ones . So I planned to make two torpedoes into one . <p> Listing badly from the effect of Japanese air strikes , Yorktown was virtually helpless as the I-168 moved in for the kill . Four torpedoes , the last two following the wake of the first pair , finished off the six-year-old carrier . <p> If I followed the usual procedure and fired my four torpedoes with a two-degree spread , they would cover six degrees . But I wanted very badly to deprive the Americans of this carrier . I intended to limit my salvo to a two degree spread I would fire No.1 and No.2 first , then send No.3 and No.4 in their wakes , on the same courses . That way , I could achieve two large hits instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punch into the carrier 's midsection , rather than spread it out along her hull . <p> When I was back on my approach course , I took another look , and wagged my head at how the destroyers still seemed unaware of us . Either they were poor sailors , had poor equipment , or I-168 was a charmed vessel . At a range of 1,200 yards , my periscope up , I sent my four torpedoes away as planned . I did not lower the periscope then , either . The wakes of my torpedoes could be seen , so their source could be quickly established . And , if I-168 was going to die , I at least wanted the satisfaction of seeing whether our fish hit home . <p> Less than a minute later we heard the explosions . " Banzai ! " someone shouted . " Go ahead at full speed ! " I ordered , then , " Take her down to 200 feet ! " My conning tower officers were surprised when I ordered speed cut back to three knots a short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to be , directly beneath the enemy carrier . I did n't think she would sink at once , so had no fear of her coming down on us . And one of our torpedoes had run shallow and hit the destroyer alongside Yorktown . There would be men in the water . Her destroyers would n't risk dropping depth charges for awhile , for fear of killing their comrades . Meanwhile , I hoped to creep out of there . I ordered left rudder , and tried to ease away at three knots . <p> My plan did n't work . The American destroyers were on us in no time , dropping depth charges . They had I-168 pinpointed , and took turns making runs , according to my sound operator . We had torpedoed Yorktown at 1330 . By 1530 , the enemy had dropped 60 depth charges at us , one or two at a time . They were much more sparing with these than they were later in the war , and I took advantage of this by trying to keep an opposite course to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times , many depth charges dropping well astern of us as the enemy passed directly overhead . <p> One of the destroyer captains must have estimated that I was doing this , though . The last depth charge of the two-hour barrage landed just off my bow , putting out all lights , springing small leaks in many places , and causing the danger of chlorine gas forming in my forward battery room . <p> This was serious . I-168 had only ten gas masks for a crew of 104 men . But Lieutenant Mochizuki took a small group of men into the forward battery room , closed it behind them to protect the rest of us , and began disconnecting damaged batteries . Before long they had the situation under control , but more trouble was occurring in the bow . Both the outer and inner doors of No. 1 Torpedo Tube were sprung . I-168 was partly open to the sea ; water was entering the bow section . <p> We could n't work on the outer door , of course , so men tried to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorted it . Instead of lying flat in its seal , it bulged into the torpedo room , while water jetted from leaks around its edge . Torpedomen finally plugged the leaks with wedges , however , and everything came under control . <p> By now we had taken on enough water to weigh the bow down considerably . I ordered all crewmen possible to move aft a counterweight . This did not remedy the situation , so I employed a tactic used by other Japanese submarines in the war . Every man walked forward again , picked up a sack of rice from our supplies , and carried it aft . This helped considerably , and I-168 was on an even keel by the time full electrical power was restored . <p> Now we had been operating nearly 12 hours submerged . The destroyers had continued to fire depth charges after 1530 , but only sporadically . That sixtieth one had hurt us , and made us bob up from 200 feet nearly to 60 feet . A few more like it , and we might have broached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were hoarding charges for a final attack , knowing we would have to surface and charge batteries before long . <p> There were five pistols and ten rifles in I-168 's armory . I ordered these issued and told my deck gun crew to stand by near the tower . Sunset was not far off . If we could surface then , and run long enough to charge our batteries , I-168 might have a chance to reverse the situation , for we still had six torpedoes and five usable tubes left . We might even be able to dive and counterattack , using the darkness to our advantage . <p> It was still daylight when I ordered " Surface ! " There had been a long lull in the firing , and I thought the enemy destroyers might have given up when no sounds could be heard on our detectors . When I got to the open bridge , there was no sign of Yorktown on the eastern horizon . I was sure she was somewhere beyond it , sinking , for I had seen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sec three American destroyers , running in line abreast to the east , on an opposite course from my own . I guessed they were looking for other possible submarines , or else had been summoned back to help with survivors of the carrier . <p> We were not long on the surface before two of the three ships swung about in pursuit . I estimated their distance at about 11,000 yards . We ran west at 14 knots , the best speed I could make while charging batteries and taking in air . I ordered smoke made , using the heavy black clouds for cover . It helped for a while , and the enemy ships did not appear to be gaining on us very much during the first 30 minutes . I could n't understand this at all , because of the speed I knew they could make . <p> When they closed to about 6,500 yards , they opened fire and not long afterward I-168 was straddled . All a good gunnery officer had to do now was " walk " across me a few times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of the straddle most vividly . My lookouts began darting quick looks at me , their faces strained and pale . They were anxious to be back in the hull , and diving I could also detect a high note in the voices below as reports on the progress of the battery charge were called up to me . The men above wanted to dive , though they dared not say so , and the men below wanted to remain surfaced as long as possible while dials and gauges made higher readings . Finally , tile enemy silhouettes growing ever larger , I called down , " Do you have enough air and power for short time operations ? " <p> A reluctant " Yes , sir , " came up . <p> " Stand by to dive ! " I shouted , and cleared the bridge . I followed all hands into the hatch , ordering I-168 swung about for a dive into her own smoke . The tactic worked . Both destroyers over-ran us . They soon had our location fixed again , but dropped only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the east at high speed . <p> I looked at my watch . Only a few minutes until sunset . Whether the enemy ships departed because they feared a night encounter with us , or whether they had no more depth charges , I did not know . In either case , I-168 was going to get out of this now . <p> We surfaced a little while after sunset . Assuming that patrol planes from Midway would be seeking us out , we headed north . I hoped they would think I had set a course for Truk , and thus be thrown off the scent . After a few hours , we changed course for Hokkaido , our northernmost island , it then being the nearest to us on a great circle course . I-168 cruised at her most economical speed , for we were not out of trouble yet . Oil was the Imperial Navy 's lifeblood and strictly rationed . I-168 had been given only enough for cruising to Midway and operating there for a few days . All submarines were supposed to have refueled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing severe economies , however , we were able to set Yokosuka , then Kure , as our final destination . <p> Mr. Tanabe <p> Chief Journalist Harrington <p> A great crowd greeted our arrival .

This guaranteed me a crack crew . <p> There were to be other exciting times in the war for me .

@@21175417 @1175417/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> The Battle for Leyte Gulf <p> October 1944 , marked the return of General MacArthur to the Philippines . Rangers had gone ashore on some of the islets in the mouth of Leyte Gulf on October 17th . Three days later , General MacArthur ordered his forces ashore on Leyte . They encountered light opposition . And just three days after that , on October 23rd , the battle for Leyte Gulf began . I shall describe this battle as , aboard the U.S.S. New Jersey , I saw it develop . This description is based on my log and war diaries . <p> There were two U.S. Fleets in the waters off the Philippines . The Seventh Fleet was under command of Vice Admiral Thomas Kinkaid . His superior was General MacArthur . Kinkaid had under his command at Leyte , exclusive of the amphibious forces , six old battleships , sixteen escort carriers , four heavy cruisers , four light cruisers , thirty destroyers , and twelve destroyer escorts , which in itself was a powerful force . Its mission was defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the landing area , and stood by to guard them while they unloaded , and it was to protect them during their retirement . <p> The Third Fleet was under my command . My superior was Admiral Nimitz . My mission was offensive . When I received orders to cover the Leyte landings my mission did not change . It was still offensive . The tasks assigned my force were to gain air supremacy over the Philippines , to protect the landings and to maintain unremitting pressure against Japan , and to apply maximum attrition by all possible means in all areas . Finally , should opportunity for destruction of a major portion of the enemy fleet offer , such destruction would become the primary task of my forces . <p> If the two fleets had been under the same command , with a single system of operational control and intelligence , the Battle for Leyte Gulf might have been fought differently and with better coordination . <p> My Fleet was composed of Task Force 38 under Vice Admiral Pete Mitscher . It was divided into four Task Groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Task Group 38.2 commanded by Rear Admiral Bogan , Task Group 38.3 commanded by Rear Admiral Ted Sherman , and Task Group 38.4 commanded by Rear Admiral Davidson . These Groups were not uniform in strength but averaged a total of 23 ships per group , divided approximately as follows : two large carriers , two light carriers , two new battleships , three cruisers , and fourteen destroyers . <p> On October 23 we learned from one of our submarines , U.S.S. Darter , that a sizeable portion of the Japanese Navy was proceeding northwestward in the China Sea and would undoubtedly attempt passage through one of the Straits to reach the Leyte Gulf Area . We had been at sea since October 6 and during the entire time had repeatedly struck air fields and enemy installations on Formosa , Okinawa , and Luzon . We had been under severe enemy air attacks and had been most active throughout this period at sea . We planned to send each of the Groups in rotation into Ulithi for repairs and replenishment , and Task Group 38.1 , on October 23rd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other three Task Groups were standing eastward on the Philippines , awaiting their turn to retire , and meanwhile preparing further offensive strikes in support of MacArthur . On the basis of the Darter s report , I ordered them to close the islands and to launch search teams next morning in a fan that would cover the western sea approaches for the entire length of the chain . <p> Accordingly , by daylight on October 24 , the three carrier groups were disposed off the east coast of the Philippines from Central Luzon to just north of Surigao Strait , from which points they could search and attack any shipping that entered either San Bernardino or Surigao Straits , or the waters immediately to the westward thereof . <p> Our early searches on the 24th of October found two Japanese Forces : one apparently headed for Surigao Straits ( this Force will be hereafter referred to as the Southern Force ) and a second and stronger Force in the Sibuyan Sea ( hereafter called the Central Force ) . <p> The Group on its way to Ulihi was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our planes hit the Central Force repeatedly throughout the day and reported sinking the battleship Musashi , three cruisers , and a destroyer , and inflicting severe damage on many other units . These seemed to mill around aimlessly , then withdraw to the west . They were still in the Sibuyan Sea at 1600 on course 290 , but later turned east again . <p> That they might attempt to transit San Bernardino Strait , despite their fearful mauling , was a possibility I had to recognize . Accordingly , at 1512 I sent a preparatory dispatch to all Task Force Commanders in the Third Fleet and all Task Group Commanders in Task Group 38 , designating four of their fast battleships , with supporting units , and stating that these ships will be formed at Task Force 34 under Vice Admiral Lee , Commander Battle Line , with the mission of engaging decisively at long ranges . <p> This dispatch , which played a critical part in next days battle , I intended merely as a warning to the ships concerned that , if a surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 , form them in Task Force 34 , and send them ahead as a battle line . It was definitely not an executive dispatch , but a battle plan , and was so marked . To make certain that none of my subordinate commanders misconstrued it , I told them later by voice radio : " IF THE ENEMY SORTIES , TASK FORCE 34 WILL BE FORMED WHEN DIRECTED BY ME . " <p> Meanwhile , at 0943 , we had intercepted a message from one of Task Group 38.4s search teams , reporting that it had sighted the enemys Southern Forcetwo old battleships , three heavy cruisers , one light cruiser , and eight destroyers , southwest of Negros island , course 060 , speed 15 knotsand had scored several damaging hits with bombs and rockets . We did not send a strike against this comparatively weak force . <p> It was headed for Surigao Strait , where Kinkaid was waiting with approximately three times its weight of metalsix old battleships , four heavy cruisers , four light cruisers , and twenty-one destroyers , plus thirty-nine PTs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force would be soundly defeated by Oldendorfs group of the 7th Fleet . <p> Task Group 38.3 , the northernmost Group off Luzon , was under continuing violent attack by carrier planes . The Group shot down 110 of them , but they succeeded in bombing the light carrier Princeton , which later had to be abandoned and sunk . The Birmingham and three destroyers were damaged by the explosion of the Princeton s magazines and were sent to Ulithi with the Princeton survivors . <p> The discovery of the Southern Force buttressed my conviction that the Japs were committed to a supreme effort , but the final proof was still lacking . There was no naval carrier strength ( CVs or CVLs ) involved in these known forces converging on the Philippines . It did not seem probable that the Japanese would commit such a large portion of their naval strength without providing some measure of naval air support . The location of their carriers up to this point was a mystery . We believed that a strong carrier Task Force was probably also converging on the Leyte Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire ports . On this basis , orders were issued to the Northern Task Group to conduct an intensive air search to the north and east of their positions to attempt to locate the suspected enemy carrier force . <p> During the late afternoon reports were received from our Northern Carrier Group 38.3 and from land based air searches that the suspected Japanese Northern Force had actually been located . We had also received information indicating that Commander Seventh Fleet was prepared to meet any enemy force which might attempt the passage of Surigao Strait . The enemy force to the north , as reported from our air searches , was shown to consist of practically all the remaining operative Japanese carrier strength plus supporting surface ships , and was thought at the time to be the most formidable threat to our present and future operations in the Western Pacific . <p> We had all the pieces of the puzzle , and fitting them together , we noticed that the three Forces had a common factor : A speed of advance so leisurelynever more than 15 knotsthat it implied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second approach to San Bernardino against overwhelming strength , after being heavily mauled , was comprehensible only if they were under adamant orders to rendezvous with the other forces off Samar next day , the 24th , for a combined attack on the transports at Leyte . <p> Three battles offered . The Southern Force I could afford to ignore : it was well within Kinkaids compass . The Central Force , according to our pilots , had suffered so much topside damage , especially to its guns and fire-control instruments , that it could not win a decision . I believed it , too , could be left to Kinkaid . ( The pilots reports proved dangerously optimistic , but we had little reason to discredit them at the time . ) On the other hand , not only was the Northern Force fresh and undamaged , but its carriers gave it a scope several hundred miles wider than the others . Moreover , if we destroyed those carriers , future operations need fear no major threat from the sea . <p> We had chosen our antagonist . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had three alternatives : <p> I could guard San Bernardino with my whole fleet and wait for the Northern Force to strike me . Rejected . It yielded to the enemy the double initiative of his carriers and his fields on Luzon that would allow him to use them unmolested . <p> I could guard San Bernardino with Task Force 34 while I struck the Northern Force with my carriers . Rejected . The heavy air attacks on Task Group 38.3 which had resulted in the loss of the Princeton indicated that the enemy still had powerful air forces and forbade exposing our battleships without adequate air protection . It is a cardinal principle of naval warfare not to divide ones force to such extent as will permit it to be beaten in detail . If enemy shore based planes joined with his carrier planes , together they might inflict far more damage on my half-fleets separately than they could inflict upon my fleet intact . Furthermore I was confident from the reports of my aviators that Kuritas Force in the Sibuyan Sea had been damaged to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strait , Kinkaid had adequate strength to defend against them . <p> I could leave San Bernardino unguarded and strike the Northern Force with my whole fleet . Accepted . It preserved my Fleets integrity , it left the initiative with me , and it promised the greatest possibility of surprise . Even if the Central Force meanwhile passed through San Bernardino and headed for Leyte Gulf , it could only hope to harry the landing operation . It could not consolidate any advantage , because of its reported damage . It could merely hit-and-run . I felt Kinkaid was amply strong to handle this situation if it should develop . <p> My decision was to strike the Northern Force . Given the same circumstances and the same information as I had then , I would make it again . <p> About 1950 on the 24th , I informed Commander Seventh fleet : CENTRAL FORCE HEAVILY DAMAGED ACCORDING TO STRIKE REPORTS . AM PROCEEDING NORTH WITH THREE GROUPS TO ATTACK CARRIER FORCE AT DAWN . At 2330 , I ordered Mitscher : SLOW DOWN TO 16 KNOTS . HOLD PRESENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 127 ( northeastward ) . The purpose of this was to permit the three Groups to close up and to avoid over-running the Northern Forces " Daylight Circle , " the limit which it could reach by dawn from its last known position . If the enemy slipped past my left flank , between me and Luzon , he would have a free crack at the transports . If he slipped past my right flank , he would be able to shuttle-bomb mefly from his carriers , attack me , continue on to his fields on Luzon for more bombs and fuel , and attack me again on the way back . I had to meet him head-on . It was also essential to bring him under attack at dawn . Otherwise I would , at least partially , lose the advantage of initiative and surprise . I was trusting the Independence s night search planes to set my course . <p> They began to report and by daylight the composition of the Northern Force was established as one large carrier , three light carriers , two hermaphrodite battleships with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least eight destroyers . <p> I ordered Task Force 34 to form and take station 10 miles in advance , and my Task Group Commanders to arm their first deck-load strike and launch it at earliest dawn , and launch a second strike as soon afterwards as possible . <p> We had already increased our speed to 25 knots . If the enemy held his course and speed , he would be under our guns before noon . <p> At 0648 , I had received a dispatch from Kinkaid : AM NOW ENGAGING ENEMY SURFACE FORCES SURIGAO STRAIT . QUESTION IS TASK FORCE 34 GUARDING SAN BERNARDINO STRAIT . To this I replied in some bewilderment : NEGATIVE . IT IS WITH OUR CARRIERS NOW ENGAGING ENEMY CARRIERS . Here was my first intimation that Kinkaid had intercepted and misconstrued the preparatory dispatch I had sent to my Fleet the preceding day . I say " intercepted " because it was not addressed to him , which fact alone should have prevented his confusion . I was not alarmed , because at 0802 I learned from him : ENEMY VESSELS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When the Southern Force pushed into Surigao soon after midnight of the 24th , it pushed into one of the prettiest ambushes in naval history . Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf , Kinkaids tactical commander , waited until the enemy line was well committed into the narrow waters , then struck from both flanks with his PTs and destroyers , and from dead ahead with his battleships and cruisers . Almost before the Japs could open fire , they lost both their battleships and three destroyers . The rest fled , but the heavy cruiser Mogami was badly damaged , later collided with the heavy cruiser Nachi , and was sunk by Japanese destroyers about noon . About 1000 on the 25th , Army B-24s sank the light cruiser Abukuma , which had been previously torpedoed by our PTs . One of Oldendorfs PTs was sunk , and one destroyer was damaged . <p> At 0822 , twenty minutes after Kinkaids second dispatch , I received his third : ENEMY BATTLESHIPS AND CRUISERS REPORTED FIRING ON TASK UNIT 77.4.3 , FROM 15 MILES ASTERN . Task Unit 77.4.3 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escort carriers , three destroyers , and four destroyer escorts , was the northernmost of three similar Task Units in the Seventh Fleets Task Force 77.4 , assigned to guard the eastern approaches to Leyte . The enemy ships were evidently part of the Central Force , which had steamed through San Bernardino during the night . I wondered why search planes had not given warning of the enemys approach , but I still was not alarmed . I figured that the sixteen little carriers had enough planes to protect themselves until Oldendorf could bring up his heavy ships . <p> Eight minutes later , at 0830 , Kinkaids fourth dispatch reached me : URGENTLY NEED FAST BATTLESHIPS LEYTE GULF AT ONCE . That surprised me . I was not previously committed to protect the Seventh Fleet . My job was offensive , to strike with the Third Fleet , and we were even then rushing to intercept a force which gravely threatened not only Kinkaid and myself , but the whole Pacific strategy . However , I ordered McCain , who was fueling to the east : STRIKE VICINITY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so notified Kinkaid . <p> This was a new factor , so astonishing that I could hardly accept it . Why had n't  Kinkaid let me know before ? I looked at the date-time group of his dispatch . It was " 242225 " or 0725 local time , one hour and fifty-seven minutes ago , and when I compared it with the date-time groups of the others , I realized that this was actually his third dispatch , sent eighteen minutes after he had first informed me that Task Unit 77.4.3 was under attack . <p> My message was on its way to him in five minutes : I AM STILL ENGAGING ENEMY CARRIERS . MCCAIN WITH FIVE CARRIERS FOUR HEAVY CRUISERS HAS BEEN ORDERED ASSIST YOU IMMEDIATELYand I gave him my position , to show him the impossibility of the fast battleships reaching him . <p> The next two dispatches arrived close to 1000 , almost simultaneously . The first was from Kinkaid again : WHERE IS LEE . SEND LEE . I was impressed by the fact that it had been sent in plain language , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second dispatch was from CinCPac and asked the location of Task Force 34 . <p> At that moment the Northern Force , with its two remaining carriers crippled and dead in the water , was exactly 42 miles away . However , in view of the urgent request for assistance from Commander Seventh Fleet , I directed Task Force 34 and Task Group 38.2 to proceed south toward San Bernardino Strait , and directed Commander Task Force 38 with Task Groups 38.3 and 38.4 to continue attacks against the enemy carrier force . <p> While I rushed south , Task Groups 38.3 and 38.4 repeatedly struck the Northern Force and late that afternoon it retired in straggling disorder . When it was over the score for the Northern Force was : <p> Sunkfour carriers , one light cruiser , and two destroyers . <p> Slightly damagedtwo battleships , one light cruiser , and two destroyers . <p> A curious feature of this engagement is that the air duel never came off . Our strikes found scarcely a handful of planes on the enemy carriers decks and only fifteen on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luzon , and that our attack had caught them by surprise , because during the morning our radars picked up large groups of bogeys approaching from the westward , but they presently reversed course and disappeared . <p> This position was 55 miles northeast of Leyte Gulf , but the course was not toward the entrance . Moreover , the dispatch had been filed two hours before I received it , and I had no clue as to what had happened since then . The strongest probability was that the enemy would eventually retrace his course through San Bernardino Strait , and my best hope of intercepting him was to send my fastest ships in advance . <p> I threw a screen of light cruisers and destroyers around the battleships New Jersey and Iowa as Task Group 34.5 , and told them on TBS : PREPARE FOR 30 KNOTS AND BE READY FOR NIGHT ACTION . I also notified Kinkaid that we would arrive off San Bernardino at 0100 next morning , seven hours earlier than my original schedule . <p> I was puzzled by the Central Forces hit-and-run tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four battleships , six heavy cruisers , two light cruisers , and eleven destroyers which had survived our air attacks on October 24th had transited San Bernardino that night , while two destroyers remained until the sinking of Musashi and the damaged Myoko . When they were sighted next , at 0631 on the 25th , they were only 20 miles northwest of Spragues Task Unit . <p> The enemy continued to close , and presently his fire began to take toll . Spragues losses to the guns were three ships from the screen , and one escort carrier . <p> At 1050 the enemys shore-based air struck , but at 1310 planes from Task Group 38.1 arrived . In the emergency , McCain had launched them from far outside their range of return . After their attack , they had to land and rearm at Tacloban and Dulag fields on Leyte , which had fallen to MacArthur only a few days before . Together with planes from Task Group 77.4 , they sank a light cruiser and a destroyer and damaged most of the other ships . Task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force was in full retreat by late afternoon , and by 2200 it was reentering San Bernardino , with my force still two hours away . However , shortly after midnight one of my van destroyers made contact with a straggler , and sank it . This was our last surface action . <p> Thus ended the major action of the threefold Battle for Leyte Gulf . Six of our ships had been sunk and thirteen damaged . In my official report , I was able to write with conviction that the results of the battle were : " ( 1 ) The utter failure of the Japanese plan to prevent the reoccupation of the Philippines ; ( 2 ) the crushing defeat of the Japanese Fleet ; and ( 3 ) the elimination of serious naval threat to our operations for many months , if not forever . " The Japanese had lost one large carrier , three light carriers , three battleships , six heavy cruisers , and nine destroyers . <p> In all of the foregoing I have attempted to describe the battle as it unfolded before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was available then . No battle of such magnitude can be fought without someone getting hurt . The later established facts that no Japanese air attacks developed from Luzon on the 25th ; that the Central Force suffered less damage due to air attacks on the 24th than originally reported ; and that this force did finally make its sortie from San Bernardino Strait to surprise the Seventh Fleet . Units could not be determined in advance . Only " Monday Morning Quarterbacks " can speak of such items with certainty . As seen on the afternoon of the 24th and as viewed in retrospect , a Japanese Carrier Force to the north , particularly if allowed the initiative , was the most urgent and serious threat to the final success of our forces . <p> After the surrender , the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey learned , from the study of Japanese documents and the interrogation of Japanese naval officers , the Japanese plans for the Battle of Leyte Gulf . <p> The Japanese were divided into three forces , the Northern , designated Mobile Attack Force ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern , divided into two forces designated the First Diversionary Attack Force and " C " Force . <p> The plan called for two segments of the Southern Force to enter Leyte Gulf via Surigao Strait and attack the transports and supporting units off the Leyte beach-head . The Central Force was to arrive in Leyte Gulf via San Bernardino Strait two hours later and attack what remained of our forces after their engagement by the Southern Force . The planes from the carriers in the Northern Force had been launched on October 24 , and had attacked Task Force 38.3 and then landed on Luzon , from which point they were to continue to attack our forces within range . Few planes remained aboard these carriers . The carriers were to permit themselves to be attacked by my Task Forces so that my Fleet would be pulled north and brought under attack by land based planes in Formosa and Luzon . The Japanese northern forces were expendable so long as they have the southern forces the opportunity to destroy our forces lying off the beaches at Leyte . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oldendorfs Force and the Central Force was so badly damaged by air strikes on October 24 that it was retiring and had so advised CinC Combined Fleet . However , CinC Combined Fleet on receipt of this message sent the following dispatch : " With confidence in heavenly guidance the entire force will attack . " The Central Force again changed its course toward San Bernardino Strait . The attack on Spragues Forces were broken off and the enemy withdrew without pressing into the Gulf because the air and torpedo attack launched by Kinkaids Forces had further damaged his communication and fire-control facilities , had resulted in severe damage to four of his cruisers , and had caused his force to fall into disorder . Furthermore he was far behind schedule and he was afraid of our air attacks . When he heard that the Northern Force was attacking my fleet he decided to join this attack , but when no engagement offered in daylight he retired through San Bernardino . The Northern Force was disposed of by my Task Forces . <p> In conclusion I would like to emphasize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It had always been a cardinal principle of our naval tactics to bring all force of the opposing enemy under effective attack . In modern naval warfare there is no greater threat than that offered by an enemy carrier force . To leave such a force untouched and to attack it with anything less than overwhelming destructive force would not only violate this proven principle but in this instance would have been foolhardy in the extreme . <p> The battle also illustrates the necessity for a single naval command in a combat area responsible for and in full control of all combat units involved . Division of operational control in a combat area leads at the least to confusion , lack of coordination , and overloaded communications , and could result in disaster . <p> For two and a half days during the progress of this battle my communication officers decoded no dispatch on the circuit linking me with Commander Seventh Fleet that had a precedence lower than urgent . Much of this traffic consisted of intelligence summaries of previous unrelated action and other matters not directly related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain there should always be a command circuit linking all commanders in a combat area which is kept clear of all traffic except that of an urgent tactical nature . <p> The Battle for Leyte Gulf stands as a tribute to the effective employment of seapower and sea-air-power and of close mutual support . There was glory in it for all . <p> The credit for our overwhelming victory belongs in full measure to all who participated in its many phases and most particularly to those pilots and sailors who made the supreme sacrifice in order that our cause might prevail . <p> Graduating from the Naval Academy in the Class of 1904 , Admiral Halsey was a destroyer skipper in World War I.

The weapons tail fins immediately deployed , wings extended , and turbofan engine started as it headed out over the sea . When land appeared beneath the missile , its microcomputers took control , setting a course of several hundred miles across the Arabian Peninsula and over Iraq toward its target . That Tomahawk land-attack missile ( TLAM ) was the first weapon to strike Baghdad in Operation Desert Stormand the first Tomahawk to be launched in combat . 1 The San Jacinto would fire 16 of the cruise missiles during the 42-day war . <p> In that opening salvo of the 1991 conflict , the guided missile cruiser and eight other U.S. warships , including the Missouri ( BB-63 ) and Wisconsin ( BB-64 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were launched , of which 282 successfully transitioned to flighta remarkable record for a swiftly planned attack with a new weapon . Iraqi forces probably shot down two Tomahawks ( although some reports put the toll at six ) . <p> Images of Tomahawkssometimes flying high , sometimes low over Baghdadbecame one of the spectacles of that televised war . Around the world , viewers in homes as well as in bars watched real-time scenes of combat . " The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated , " Bernard Shaw reported on CNN as viewers saw on their TV screens " bright flashes going off all over the sky . " Startling video originating from high-tech weapons showed targets being detected and then instantly wiped out . The few fleeting images of Tomahawks were taken from the ground as they flew by at high subsonic speeds . <h> Early U.S. Cruise Missiles <p> Since the era of smoothbore cannon , warships have fired against shore targets . Later , rifled guns were used against such targets , the largest being the 16-inch guns of the Iowa ( BB-61 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Attempts to use rockets and then missiles for attacking land targets followed . One of the early missiles was the U.S. Navys Regulus , a land-attack cruise missile carrying a nuclear warhead that was launched from surface ships and surfaced submarines . Regulus missiles , in the fleet from 1955 to 1964 , were retired with the advent of the Polaris submarine-launched ballistic missile . <p> The demise of the Regulus ended the initial efforts by the U.S. Navy to put to sea land-attack cruise missiles . More than a decade later , in January 1976 , Secretary of State Henry Kissinger met with Soviet leaders in Moscow to discuss strategic arms limitations . A key issue was the Soviet plan to produce 300 Tu-22M Backfire bombers , a supersonic , variable-sweep-wing aircraft . In response , Kissinger argued for 375 cruise missilesthen called ship-launched cruise missiles ( SLCMs ) that would be carried in 25 surface warships . 2 <p> One year later , on 12 January 1977 , the U.S. government made the decision to develop a ground-launched variant of the SLCM , in large part to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pioneer ) , an intermediate-range ballistic missile being emplaced in the western Soviet Union to threaten European NATO countries . Operated by the Air Force , the U.S. ground-launched cruise missile ( GLCM ) was named Gryphon after the mythical beast with the body of a lion and the wings of an eagle , powerful on land and in the air . Virtually identical to the naval cruise missilesby then called TomahawksGLCMs were fitted in mobile launchers that would be based in Belgium , Great Britain , Holland , Italy , and West Germany as partners to the Armys Pershing II intermediate-range ballistic missiles ( IRBMs ) . Both were to be deployed in Europe108 Pershing IIs and 464 GLCMsin response to the Soviet SS-20 missiles . <p> The 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States led to termination of the Air Force Gryphon missile as well as the Army Pershing II along with the Soviet IRBMs . The Gryphon cruise missiles were destroyed after having been withdrawn from service between 1988 and 1991. 3 <h> The First Tomahawk <p> The Navys Tomahawkthe basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-range , antiship cruise missile in the early 1970s under the aegis of Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt . At the time the Navy was developing the Harpoon , a short-range antiship missile that could be launched by aircraft , surface ships , and submerged submarines . Zumwalt accelerated Harpoon development , initially with a 30-mile range , and it became operational in 1977. 4 <p> Admiral Zumwalt also pushed the development of a long-range missile based on the Williams International turbofan engine , which promised a considerable range in a relatively small missile . This became the Tomahawk . Further , Zumwalt insisted that the missile be held to a 21-inch diameter and approximately 20-foot length to ensure that it could be launched from standard submarine torpedo tubes as well as from surface ships and aircraft . ( Submarines could launch Harpoon missiles from their torpedo tubes . ) <p> The first missile in the Tomahawk " family " was the Tomahawk antiship missile ( TASM ) . With a range of several hundred miles and a 1,000-pound warhead , TASM used an inertial navigation system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It became operational on board U.S. surface ships in 1982 and submarines in 1983 . The destroyer Merrill ( DD-976 ) received the first Tomahawk installation in October 1982 for at ? sea evaluation ; the battleship New Jersey ( BB-62 ) was the second ship , receiving the Tomahawk in March 1983 . <p> The missiles were deployed in armored box launchers ( ABLs ) on board the four Iowa -class battleships reactivated in the 1980s by Secretary of the Navy John Lehman . The ABLs also were fitted in five cruisers and in seven destroyers of the Spruance class . Each ABL held four Tomahawks , providing 32 missiles per battleship ( plus 16 Harpoons ) and eight Tomahawks per cruiser and destroyer . <p> A major breakthrough for the Tomahawk cruise missiles occurred when the Navy developed the vertical-launch system ( VLS ) for surface ships and , later , for submarines . A surface ships VLS " cells " could hold Tomahawks as well as the various Standard surface-to-air missiles . Designated Mark 41 , the VLS cells soon were being installed in the new cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class122 and 96 cells , respectively . Also , the modular nature of the VLS permitted removal of the antisubmarine rocket ( ASROC ) launcher and magazine from 24 Spruance -class antisubmarine destroyers and installation of a 61-cell VLS . While the CG/DDG-type ships had mostly Standard missiles in their VLS magazines , the Spruances were all-Tomahawk ships . <p> Meanwhile , submarines were being armed with TASMs . A missile was successfully launched from the nuclear attack submarine Barb ( SSN-696 ) on 1 February 1978 , and the Guitarro ( SSN-665 ) became the first submarine armed with Tomahawks in 1983 . The ability to launch from torpedo tubes later was provided in many attack submarines . Subsequently , beginning with the San Juan ( SSN-751 ) commissioned in 1988 , submarines of the later Los Angeles and the Virginia classes have a 12-cell vertical-launch Tomahawk battery . And when the first four Ohio -class ballistic missile submarines were removed from service because of U.S.Soviet strategic arms agreements , they were modified to become cruise missile craft ( SSGN ) , each able to carry 154 Tomahawks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problems of identifying and targeting ships at distances of several hundred miles wereat the timebeyond fleet capabilities . And , given that the Tomahawk is a subsonic ( Mach 0.75 ) weapon , a high-speed ship could move a significant distance during a long-range missile attack . <h> A Revolutionary Weapon <p> The TASM was followed by the TLAMTomahawk land-attack missilewhich became operational in 1984 . It was soon the weapon of choice for U.S. political leaders and military commanders . The land-attack missilesfirst used in the 1991 war against Saddam Husseins Iraqheralded a new era in naval warfare , giving warships attacking land targets unprecedented range and accuracy . <p> The TLAM of 1991 , after being launched from a surface ship or submerged submarine , initially was directed toward its target by an inertial-guidance system that used the Tomahawks sensors and gyroscopes to measure acceleration and changes in direction . Once the missile crossed the shoreline , the more precise TERCOM ( Terrain Contour Matching ) guidance method took control , drawing information from the weapons computerized contour maps and comparing it with what the missile " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skimming at altitudes of 100 to 300 feet , the Tomahawk relied on a third guidance system as it neared the target : DSMAC ( Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator ) , which compared the target to a " picture " in its computer memory and made final course changes for a precise hit . Published accounts credit the TLAM with an accuracy of about 12 feet with a range of approximately 1,000 miles . <p> The Department of Defense summary report of the 1991 Gulf War stated : " The TLAM played an important role in the air campaign as the only weapon system used to attack central Baghdad in daylight . The cruise missile conceptincorporating an unmanned , low-observable platform able to strike accurately at long distanceswas validated as a significant new instrument for future concepts . " 5 <p> The TLAMlike the TASMhas a basic conventional warhead of approximately 1,000 pounds of high explosives . A TLAM-D warhead also was developed that dispensed 166 BLU-97 " bomblets , " each weighing 3.4 pounds , in packets of 24 . These submunitions could be armor-piercing , fragmentation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1991 , for example , a submarine-launched TLAM-D struck three separate targets in Iraq and then performed a terminal dive to strike a fourth . <p> A third Tomahawk warhead was developed for use against Iraqi electric-generating plants . Several of the 116 missiles fired on the first day of the Gulf War carried these still-experimental munitions that contained thousands of spools of carbon-graphite fibers . Upon detonation , the spools were released over the electric plants outdoor switching and transformer areas . They unwound in the wind and dropped onto power lines and transformers , causing massive short circuits but no permanent damage . The resulting blackouts disrupted the Iraqi electric-power grid , helping to blind air-defense and command-and-control activitiesas well as civilian electricity . <p> Yet a newer Tomahawk , the Block IVdesignated TLAM-Eis an improved land-attack missile with enhanced abilities , including in-flight retargeting . Its camera can provide a snapshot of the battlefield via a satellite data link . <p> On the heels of the conventional TLAM variant came the nuclear-armed TLAM(N) , which became operational in 1987 . This missile had the " common " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air-launched cruise missile and in the B61 gravity bomb . The warhead is credited with an explosive force of 5 to 150 kilotons . ( The atomic bombs used at Hiroshima and Nagasaki had explosive forces of just over 15 kilotons. 6 ) But TLAM(N)s , too , had a brief service life ; because of arms-limitation agreements , they were removed from the fleet in 1992 and dismantled . <p> Although air-launched Tomahawks were tested by naval aircraft and proposed to the Air Force for use on B-52 Superfortress bombers , they were not produced . The Air Force preferred its own air-launch cruise missile ( ALCM ) rather than accepting a Navy-developed weapon . <h> Instrument of Policy <p> On 17 January 1993three days before his White House tenure endedPresident George H. W. Bush again turned to Tomahawks to attack Iraq . Three destroyers launched 45 missiles at what American officials described as a nuclear fabrication plant near Baghdad . The raid was in response to Iraqs defiance of a no-fly zone established by the United States and its allies . A Pentagon official said the target was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the need for pinpoint accuracy and because Baghdad is so heavily defended . " 7 <p> The Tomahawks accuracy , range , launch-platform flexibilityand lack of a vulnerable human pilotall combine to make the TLAM politically attractive . President Bill Clinton continued to use the Tomahawk as an instrument of policy . On 26 June 1993 , he ordered U.S. warships in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea to launch Tomahawks against the headquarters of the Iraqi intelligence service in downtown Baghdad . This was in response to evidence of an Iraqi plan to assassinate former President Bush . 8 <p> Five years later , on 20 August 1998 , President Clinton again ordered a Tomahawk attack , this time in retaliation against terrorists who bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in a synchronized operation masterminded by Osama bin Laden .

" In a 70-hour campaign against nearly 100 targets , U.S. warships launched 325 Tomahawks while Air Force B-52 Stratfortress bombers released 90 cruise missiles . 10 <p> Additional TLAMs were fired in the lengthy Balkans confrontations and conflict during the Clinton presidency . In the 1999 campaign to free Kosovo , U.S. surface ships and submarines launched a total of 202 TLAMs , which were used selectively to destroy more than 50 percent of Yugoslavias ( i.e. Serbias ) key military headquarters and electrical power-station targets . The Tomahawks achieved a 90 percent success rate in all kinds of weather . Additional TLAMs were fired by the British submarine Splendid . 11 Earlier in 1999 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against reported terrorist targets in Sudan ( 30-plus missiles fired ) and Afghanistan ( 60-plus missiles ) . <p> In commenting on President Clintons use of Tomahawks , Time magazine called the missiles the " weapon of choice to provide the explosive oomph to back up his foreign and security policy . It is small and expensive , but it has the immense advantage of purring off to its targets by itself , putting no Americans at risk . " 12 <p> Tomahawks also were fired into Afghanistan in October 2001 in the opening phase of Operation Enduring Freedomthe U.S. assault on Afghanistan . And , during the MarchApril 2003 invasion of Iraq , U.S. surface ships and U.S. and British submarines fired 802 TLAMs into the country . <h> Present and Future <p> The present-day U.S. fleet has the more advanced Block III TLAM that features a smaller but more lethal warhead and an extended range permitted by additional fuel . These missiles also have a Global Positioning System ( GPS ) receiver and an improved Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator ( DSMAC ) for improved accuracy and time-of-arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a specific target . That variant has a Williams International 402 turbofan engine with a 19 percent increase in thrust and a 2 percent decrease in fuel consumption . And , the new tactical variant of the TLAM is capable of in-flight retargeting via a two-way satellite data link , can " loiter " near emerging targets , and allows the monitoring of its in-flight " health " and status using the satellite link . <p> But the Tomahawk is getting " long in the tooth " it has been in use for more than three decades . And while there have been major improvements in conventional Tomahawk guidance and payloads , the weapon is still a subsonic missile and , in its current configuration , strictly a land-attack weapon . The Navy now is searching for a more versatile missile , preferably one that could be launched against ship or land targets , at long ranges , with guidance invulnerable to jamming and other distractions , and , of course , compatible with the vertical-launch cells of surface warships and submarines .

The only other nation to procure Tomahawks has been Britain , with Royal Navy nuclear-propelled attack submarines launching TLAMs from their torpedo tubes .

When England 's small , but gallant , force of Hurricanes and Spitfires made daylight bomber attacks too costly , the Luftwaffe turned to night raids . To counter this , the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) employed hastily modified Bouton-Paul Defiant aircraft to fly at night . This handful of planes-cooperating with radar-equipped ground control intercept ( GCI ) stations , antiaircraft fire , and searchlights- was the key element of the infamous " Killer Belt " night defense system . With darkness no longer a safety screen for German bombers , night attacks against Britain were curtailed . The men of the RAF who fought and won the desperate Battle of Britain in the latter half of 1940hailed by Winston Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's first night fighter pilots . <p> U. S. forces ran up against their first major night operational problem on Guadalcanal in 1942 . The Japanese kept battle-weary Marines sleepless around the clock with " Washing Machine Charlie , " a night-flying nuisance aircraft whose purposely unsynchronized engines churned out a throbbing , annoying sound . Haphazardly dropping flares or casually-aimed bombs at random intervals guaranteed that the fatigued Leathernecks would have a nervous , tense night . <p> Possessing neither the experience nor the proper equipment to combat enemy night operations , the hard-pressed Americans improvised with what they had . U. S. Army Air Forces pilots , flying Douglas-built A-20s , attempted to catch " May tag Charlie " with disappointing results . They achieved limited success using Lockheed P-38s in concert with ground-based searchlights and antiaircraft fire . The Navy lacked any equipment to offer to this effort . Drawing upon the RAF 's experiences and the brief Army evaluations , the Navy began a crash course to build its night fighter program . <p> From the start , the Navy 's requirements were fundamentally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards suitable for carrier use . While land-based air units could accept heavier aircraft which were large enough to accommodate an on-board radar operator , the Navy designed its program , Project Affirm , around single-seat , carrier-type fighters . <p> Work began on 18 April 1942 at the naval air station at Quonset Point , Rhode Island . The research effort was to experiment , develop , and evaluate all information relative to night fighting equipment and tactics . Project Affirm was headed by Commander W. E. G. Taylor , a reservist and former RAF Eagle Squadron member . Taylor had intimate knowledge of early British radar and had seen night fighting brought to its highest development in England . <p> The Massachusetts Institute of Technology , whose radiation laboratory had conducted extensive studies on radar propagation , provided invaluable assistance . It undertook the task of modifying or producing tailor-made electronic gear to meet the Navy 's exacting specifications . Meanwhile , the Chance-Vought Corsair ( F4U-I ) was selected as the best available aircraft . When the first Corsairs were finally procured , experiments began to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On 10 April 1943 , less than a year after Project Affirm was instituted , VF(N)-75 was commissioned as the first night fighter squadron of the U. S. Navy . Commanded by Lieutenant Commander William J. Widhelm , the squadron was composed of 18 pilots , six ground officers , and 30 enlisted men . The manning was largely experimental , too , with personnel gleaned from what was available ; in 1943 spare people and spare parts were at a premium . Of the pilots , only five had any instrument flying experience . Three had checked out in Corsairs . Three were qualified only in the Grumman F4F Wildcat , a plane fast becoming obsolete . The balance had flown nothing more advanced than the North American SNJ , the workhorse trainer of all U. S. military flying schools . <p> Operational necessities reduced tile size of the original squadron almost before everyone got to know one another . Six pilots and aircraft and 11 enlisted men were detached and sent to the South Pacific on I August 1943 . This group , still under Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a shore-based unit in the Solomons . Their primary mission was to clear the skies of " Washing Machine Charlie , " and they were successful in short order . Lieutenant Hugh D. O'Neil , USNR , flying out of Munda , New Georgia , was vectored to the Japanese Betty bomber , which was promptly dispatched off Vella Lavella on Halloween night . <p> The continued successes of night fighters from VF(N)-75 and from a Marine squadron , VMFCN ) -531 , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Frank H. Schwable , soon caused a reduction in enemy attacks as more and more night-flying Japanese aircraft failed to return home . As shore-based U. S. night fighters proved their worth and the war turned in favor of the Allies , night fighting activity turned to the offensive . <p> On 25 August 1943 , Project Affirm was divided into two parts . The development phase was moved to Naval Air Station Patuxent River , Maryland , where it continued research and testing or ' experimental and operational hardware . Pilot training was placed under a new organization , the Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in charge . This unit was located at Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Charleston , Rhode Island , where night training could be carried on with minimal interference to daytime operations . <p> Project Affirm had verified that a qualified naval aviator needed more than ordinary flying skill to become a competent night fighter pilot . Desire and the ability of an individual to function effectively in an unconventional environment were equally important . Accustomed to full use of all one 's senses , a psychological adjustment is necessary when one sense is impaired or denied . Some individuals experience panic ranging from mild to severe when subjected to extended periods of complete darkness . Severe claustrophobia can also occur . While the night flying trainees were not superhuman , it was clear that they had to possess certain attributes of stability and be highly motivated . <p> There was no question among the NFTU instructors that night fighter proficiency required constant practice and special flying techniques . It took very little to convince pilots learning to fly F6F Hellcats off carrier decks at night that they could n't do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , night fighter trainees were taught to understand aircraft instruments , to fly by them , and to trust them . <p> A safe night approach to a flight deck showing only the minimal marker lights requires keen ability to use flight instruments precisely . Even more challenging is the need to maneuver an aircraft on instruments in order to follow exacting ground controlled instructions to complete interception of an unseen enemy target that is taking evasive action . These maneuvers involve abrupt changes in altitude , violent turns , and sudden fluctuations in airspeed . <p> Flight training commenced in Douglas SBD dive-bombers equipped with airborne radar . These served as flying classrooms in which the instructors could provide one-on-one training in night intercept work . The trainees then moved on to Hellcats in which they practiced ground controlled intercept moves on their own . They also completed an air schedule that included a series of heckler , zipper , and intruder missions . <p> Ground training was intensive and directed toward two practical purposes . It was designed to teach the students how to use radar and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications . All ground school work was night-oriented . Pilots learned to identify aircraft and ships , to work navigation problems , and to perform normal duties while wearing red-lensed goggles to simulate realistic conditions . <p> Emphasis was placed on functional electronics instruction through use of a radar-equipped Link trainer . In it , pilots gained experience in making split-second responses to GCI directions and interpreting visual indications shown on the cockpit scope . Each Link exercise ended with the gratifying report of a " splash . " After the trainer hop , pilot and radar officer held a critique of the mock mission . GCI officers who directed this training also gave communications lectures , increasing the contact between both groups . Since success for the night fighter resulted only when the fighter director and pilot worked as a team , complete cooperation was essential . <p> The program encouraged night fighter trainees to fly as much as possible . The pilot who logged the most night flying hours each week was presented with a desk model of his Helical . Long weekend passes were held out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night Fighter Training Unit was expanded into the Night Attack and Combat Training Unit ( Atlantic ) . Its mission was enlarged to encompass night carrier landing training . To accomplish this , the air station at Charleston was converted into a close approximation of a carrier at sea . At sundown , activities came into full bloom . The entire station remained blacked-out through the night . Runway lights , aircraft wing tip lights , control tower illumination , ready rooms , and even heads were dimly lit to preserve pilots ' night vision adaptation . Nothing was overlooked in the effort to duplicate the atmosphere of realistic carrier operations . A catapult for night launchings and deck arresting gear for recoveries were installed on one runway . Landing signal officers were assigned as instructors to conduct bounce drills and to give lectures on night landing techniques . <p> Having completed the course at Charleston , the night fighter pilot spent several days on an escort carrier off the Quonset Point area in order to complete carrier qualifications . He then shipped out to Naval Air Station Barbers Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Pacific ) provided the final operational polishing prior to posting to a fleet unit . Twenty-nine weeks of hard training had gone into the finished product : a first-class Navy night fighter pilot . <p> In January 1944 , Navy night fighters flew combat missions from a carrier for the first time . Two squadrons , one equipped with Corsairs and the other with Hellcats , were assigned to four carriers . Although they maintained their own individual squadron identities , the first carrier-based Navy fighters were segmented into six-pilot detachments . For 12 consecutive nights these few pilots flew constantly in an intense and successful effort to evolve defensive tactics that would be compatible with fleet procedures . <p> Lieutenant Commander Richard E. Harmer , skipper of VF(N)-101 , performed the first night interception of an enemy aircraft by a carrier-launched night fighter . Flying a Corsair , Harmer downed a Betty near the island of Truk . On succeeding nights , three more Japanese night intruders were " splashed . " One gyrated down out of tile night sky in flames and in full view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done " from the bridge of his flagship . <p> As more VF(N) units joined carrier forces , they extended their range and the number of missions so that the enemy was under attack virtually around-the-clock . The next step in the Navy 's night fighter program was the night carrier . In August 1944 , Night Air Group 41 ( NAG-41 ) , made up of specially-trained night fighter and torpedo units , went aboard the carrier Independence ( CVL-22 ) . <p> Led by Commander Turner F. Caldwell , NAG-41 made it to the fleet in time to participate in the Palau , Mindanao , and Luzon campaigns . By 1 October , the pilots were converted to full night status . Later that month , during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , the air group lent a hand when a large group of planes from other carriers went into the water as dusk approached . The night fighters deployed , sighted flashing lights on the water , and directed destroyers to the downed planes , earning the gratitude of the fleet . <p> How successful were night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the Pacific during the latter part of World War II , the groups racked up approximately equal scores . This is partly due to Japan 's strategy of restricting air operations to small night raids . In Japan 's last desperate effort to stave off American sea power , heavy attacks were mounted by kamikazes , usually under half-light conditions . With the advent of 24-hour patrols , the frequency of kamikaze raids dropped . <p> It was a grand , successful experimentthis mating of man with radar to make the fighter aircraft a more formidable weapon . In three short , violent years these men pushed aviation technology ahead by leaps and bounds . But their successes were not without cost . Among the many night fighters lost was a Medal of Honor recipient , Lieutenant Commander Edward H. " Butch " O'Hare , who was killed during night action at Tarawa on 27 November 1943 . This small group of men who put their faith in unfamiliar electronic developments were truly aviation pioneers . <p> Colonel Odell commanded the Army 's 420th and 547th Night Fighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England in April 1942 as member of the 1st Pursuit Squadron ( Night Fighter ) of the Eighth Air Force .

It was 25 October 1944 and I was standing up through the hatch in the ships Mark 37 director , scanning the horizon with 7x50 binoculars . The rumble of heavy gunfire had become continuous , and the lower quadrant of the southern sky was now a pulsing glow from muzzle flashes . The PT boats had sprung their ambush on the Japanese column and triggered a fierce firefight . The Battle of Surigao Strait in Leyte Gulf was under way . <p> There was a tug on my trouser leg and the Sailor at the pointers station next to me motioned to my eyepiece . Looking through the magnification of the directors optics , the scene to the south became clearer . The crosshairs of the lens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Japanese battleship . The flashes from her main turret salvos and the rapid fire of the secondary battery were lighting up the entire ship . From her clearly visible bow wave she was making at least 25 knots . <p> The radar operator sitting behind me tersely reported that he had picked up the target and was getting good ranges . I pushed down the bridge switch on the 21MC intercom and reported that we were tracking a battleship and locked on with the fire-control radar . The captain replied that the " Martinis " the radio call for the PT boatswere reporting that two battleships , a cruiser , and at least three destroyers had passed through the narrows . Our target was to be the second battleship . " Let me know when you have a fire-control solution on the Big Boy . Have the gun battery ready but do n't  shoot unless I specifically tell you to . We have been directed to make a torpedo attack with five fish . " His voice was clear and businesslike . In the background over the intercom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TBS tactical voice radio as they maneuvered to launch their torpedoes . Going back to the optics I could now see the two battleships in column . I moved the crosshairs to the second one , got a confirmation from the radar operator that he was locked on , and called the plotting room to tell them to let me know when they had a firing solution on the new target . <p> Now that the battleship had emerged from the strait , the image on the radarscope was clear of ground clutter and the fire-control radar was ranging consistently . In minutes , the plotting-room talker reported " tracking in automatic . " I passed this to the bridge and the captain acknowledged : " Very well . Train out the tubes but do n't  launch or shoot until I give the order . " I switched the five-inch guns and both quintuple torpedo mounts to director control , and again standing up in the hatch , looked aft to see the torpedo mounts trained out on the beam . <p> Our ship was running in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely make out the other two destroyers in our division . Like the Bennion , both were Fletcher -class destroyers . We were keeping a 300-foot interval in a loose column . The division was loitering at five knots , close to the western coastline of Leyte Gulf , using land clutter to hide from enemy radars . It was quiet in the director . Each member of the crew was absorbed in his particular duties . Our small talk had been used up long ago . <p> For the past seven months the five of us had been together eight hours a day in this hot , cramped steel box , standing watches or at general quarters ( GQ ) , shooting at the Japanese . At Peleliu , the Bennion had emptied her magazines three times in a single week . We considered ourselves experienced veterans . We had fought at Saipan , Tinian , Guam , and Peleliu . There was one new member of the director crew this night in Surigao Strait . The third-class fire controlman who normally manned the pointers station in the director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunnery officer had been wounded two days earlier when a shell from a Japanese shore battery on Leyte had struck close aboard the Bennion , unleashing a shower of shrapnel . Although I was standing just inches from them , I had not been hit . The assistant gunnery officer , Lieutenant ( junior grade ) " Robbie " Robertson , had been terribly torn up and was wrapped in a blanket , strapped to the dining table in the officers wardroomnow the ships main battle-dressing station . The war was over for Robbie , but he did n't  know it yet . He was full of morphine . He survived , but lost his right arm at the shoulder . A young ensign from the gunnery department was filling in at his GQ station . <p> I was a 22-year-old lieutenant , the Bennion s gunnery officer . This was my second destroyer assignment since graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy in June 1942 . After General Douglas MacArthurs landing at Leyte on 20 October 1944 it was fully expected that the Imperial Japanese Navy would attack Allied forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our submarines and Navy patrol aircraft indicating that two separate Japanese task forces were headed in the direction of Leyte Gulf . The hundreds of Allied transports , supply ships , amphibious craft , and support vessels anchored off Tacloban , providing support and resupply for the Army ashore , were a prime target for the Japanese fleet . <p> On the morning of 24 October , the Bennion was on picket station in the eastern approaches to Leyte Gulf when her captain , Commander Joshua Cooper , called me down from the gun director during morning GQ to show me a message : The southern group of Japanese ships was moving in a direction that suggested an attack through Surigao Strait , the southern entrance to Leyte Gulf . He thought we probably would be involved in a night action within 24 hours . When I returned to the director , I used the sound-powered phone circuit to inventory the distribution of our five-inch ammunition among the magazines and the five upper handling rooms . I also directed the torpedo officer to make sure that the torpedoes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shakedown , were ready in all respects for a war shot . With the 12-to-4 watch as officer of the deck on the bridge that afternoon , I was able to read the incoming voice radio and flashing-light traffic that laid out the disposition of our forces . Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf had six old battleships , eight cruisers , and 26 destroyers to stop the Japanese force that was expected to come through Surigao Strait . <p> Thirty-nine PT boats also were assigned to the Leyte Gulf force . I had been on the wing of the Bennion s bridge on 23 October when their formation passed us on the way to set up an ambush in Surigao Strait . I had never heard such a racket . We could hear the PT engines five miles away and see them at even greater distances , because they were engulfed in a cloud of their own exhaust fumes . It was my first encounter with PT boats ; I was not impressed . <p> During the afternoon watch , Oldendorfs detailed plan for the disposition of his forces came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploying to assigned positions . The Bennion s tactical assignment was the same as its administrative organization : The nine Fletcher -class destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 56 ( DESRON 56 ) , under the command of Captain Roland Smoot , were organized into three divisions of three ships each . DESRON 56 was assigned to attack the column of Japanese battleships and cruisers after it had emerged from Surigao Strait . In his battle plan , Oldendorf had specified that the destroyers were each to expend only five of their total of ten onboard torpedoes during the attack and hold five in reserve . Torpedo reloads for destroyers were hard to come by in the western Pacific . <p> Smoot planned for coordinated torpedo attacks , conducted separately by each of the three divisions : one against the eastern flank ; the second , head-on ; and the third ( of which the Bennion would be part ) against the western flank . Each division would approach in a three-ship column , and each destroyer would successively launch a salvo of five torpedoes as the column turned , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third division , it would be among the last destroyers to launch their fish . That meant the range from the enemy would continue to close for us as the column executed the corpen maneuver . Smoot further instructed that we should not fire our five-inch guns during the attack lest they provide Japanese gunners with convenient aim points . <p> As the ships of DESRON 56 converged at the designated rendezvous points in northern Leyte Gulf to form their disposition for the anticipated night action , we remained at GQ . The Bennion had been on picket station at the gulfs eastern entrance , and we had been under sporadic Japanese air attacks , which continued as we were steaming to the rendezvous point . The cloud cover was about 60 percent , and the enemy aircraft were popping in and out of the cumulus clouds . The Bennion s five-inch battery brought down a " Val " bomber , and the 40-mm and 20-mm guns combined to destroy a " Zeke " fighter close aboard . <p> We were deployed in our attack disposition by 1800 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from each battle station going down to the mess line to pick up battle rationsinch-thick bologna sandwiches . With the number of pickets deployed , both PT boats and destroyers , we would not be taken by surprise . <p> Shortly after 0300 , the soft purr of the idling fireroom blowers suddenly rose to a high-pitched whine . The bridge had rung up full power . The director began to tremble and the deck plates vibrated from the propellers cavitation as the ship accelerated . Almost simultaneously , the ships general announcing system and a sound-powered phone talker announced " Starting run-in for the attack . " I had been momentarily diverted , and looking through the optics again I was startled to see how much larger the image of the Japanese battleship had grown . The enemy column was headed in our direction at 25 knots and closing fast . <p> With the signal to commence the run-in to the attack , the three destroyers in our section turned in column to a southerly course to intercept the enemy , maintaining the 300-foot interval between ships . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ordered to make black smoke to screen our division . At " darken ship " there was only the dim blue light from the battle lanterns for illumination . Standing in the open hatch of the director , I could watch the entire panorama of the two converging fleets , and through the high-powered lenses of the director , the enemy ships could be seen in stark detail . As our destroyers broke out of the shadow of the shoreline , we were immediately taken under fire by the Japanese battleships and cruisers . It was strange to be rushing through the dark , closing with the enemy at a relative speed of more than 50 knots , not firing our own guns but seeing the steady gunfire of the Japanese ships and running through the explosions of their shots falling around us . The towering splashes of the 14-inch and 8-inch shells were close enough to wet our weather decks . Both sides also were firing star shells , their illumination adding to the eerie aspect of the scene . <p> As the Japanese came into range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cross the " T " at the top of the Japanese column , opened up with their main batteries . All along the northern horizon , enormous billows of flame from their 16- and 14-inch main battery guns lit up the battle line . Directly over our heads stretched a procession of tracers as the battleships shells converged on the Japanese column . The apparent slowness of the projectiles was surprising . Taking 15 to 20 seconds in their trajectory before reaching the target , they seemed to hang in the sky . Through the director optics , I could clearly see the explosions of the shells bursting on the Japanese ships , sending up cascades of flame as they ripped away topside gun mounts and erupted in fiery sheets of molten steel tearing into the heavy armor plate . <p> When the first destroyer in our division reached the firing point , the enemy was just 6,000 yards away . Each of the three destroyers in the column in succession executed a hard turn to starboard , launching five torpedoes when the enemy bearing was on the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge called out : " Launch torpedoes ! " The battleship Yamashiro completely filled the viewing glass of my optics . The crosshairs were stabilized on the waterline just below the foremast . Plot was repeating , " We have a good solution . " Glowing dials showed the torpedo tubes were trained clear and the torpedo gyros set . I pushed the " fire " button on the console and stood up to see our five fish shoot out of their tubes . I heard them slap the water . All were running hot and straight . <p> As each destroyer adjusted its turn at the launch point to have the target on the beam at the moment of firing , the formation became ragged , and the ships began maneuvering independently to avoid enemy gunfire . As the Bennion began to retire at 30 knots , still making black smoke , the scene of action was one of growing confusion . The Japanese formation had disintegrated . Some ships circled out of control , some were dead in the water . Many were on fire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bows gone , sterns blown away , and topsides mangled . <p> Standing up through the gunnery officers hatch in the main gun director , I had an almost unobstructed 360-degree view of the entire scene of action . Suddenly , a large warship loomed on our port bow . Using the slewing sight , I swung the director to point directly at this new target , instructing the rangefinder operator to track and identify this contact . If hostile , the fire-control radar would be locked on and the plotting-room computer would then generate a target course and speed . I called down to the captainno phone or intercom was needed as he was on the port wing of the bridge , one level below meto report the strange contact . It was at that juncture that the unidentified warship commenced firing what appeared to be its secondary battery . From the clearly visible tracers , I could see that the rounds were being directed at the USS Albert W. Grant ( DD-649 ) , a destroyer in our squadron that earlier had been hit and damaged by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the torpedo attack . The Grant had lost all power and was adrift in the middle of the strait . <p> When the unidentified large ship opened fire she had immediately established her identity as enemy , because her salvos were ripple fire . That was a characteristic of Japanese naval gunfire , in contrast to the simultaneous salvoes of U.S. warships . I shouted to the captain that the ship was Japanese . No sooner had he acknowledged that intelligence , than the fire controlman on the director rangefinder reported that we were locked on with fire-control radar , and that the plotting room already had a good solution for a torpedo attack . <p> I shouted this information to the captain and recommended we fire our five remaining torpedoes , because the ship was obviously a cruiser or battleship , too lucrative a target to ignore . Without hesitation he gave an affirmative reply , even though he must have had in mind , just as I did , Oldendorfs instructions to expend only five torpedoes in the squadron attack . Clearly this was not the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire all five of our remaining fish at this close-in target . <p> I passed the instructions by sound-powered phone to Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Tom Bayliss , the torpedo officer . He was manning the Mark 27 torpedo director back at the tubes , wearing the sound-powered phones himself and personally making the target data inputs and torpedo settings . I told him to set the torpedoes " deep " the recommended depth setting for a battleship or cruiser target , so that the torpedo would hit the vessel below its torpedo-defense blisters . Bayliss had been monitoring my conversation with the captain and was aware that the target was a large man-of-war ; he already had set the " deep " option . I looked aft and saw the quintuple torpedo mount training out to port , with the plotting room repeating the messages on the intercom , " We have a solution . " I stood up , reached out , and pressed the red torpedo-firing buttons on the interior bulkhead of the director , launching five torpedoes in a salvo . Still standing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their tubes in quick succession with their motors already running , slap the water , submerge , and head for that Japanese heavy , now only 3,000 yards away . I felt sure we would get a hit with our spread of five torpedoes . We were too close to have missed . <p> The Bennion heeled sharply as the captain ordered " Full right rudder , all ahead flank , " and we swung to a northerly course in the direction of the postattack rendezvous point . Captain Cooper did not wish to linger in no-mans-land , especially considering the fate of the hapless Grant . <p> By 0430 DESRON 56 had reformed north of Surigao Strait and , as first evidence of the morning twilight appeared , the destroyers were ordered to proceed south at high speed to engage and destroy the remnants of the Japanese force . In the pale predawn light the scene in the lower gulf was appalling . I counted six distinct fires , and debris littered the oily surfaces of the gulf . Groups of Japanese sailors were clinging to pieces of floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no time to pause to deal with survivors . In the smoke of the early morning gloom the Japanese destroyer Asagumo was limping south , badly damaged and afire . If the Asagumo still had torpedoes on board , she remained a deadly threat . The Bennion was ordered to deliver the coup de grGce . Changing course to intercept her , the Bennion opened fire with the five-inch battery at 10,000 yards and began to hit on the third salvo . I shifted to rapid continuous fire at 6,000 yards , and as our rounds penetrated the Asagumo s hull and exploded , flames burst from her hatches . When we had closed to about 2,000 yards , the Japanese destroyer slid beneath the gray , choppy waters , bow first , her screws still slowly rotating as we passed close aboard . <p> As the Bennion turned to rejoin the formation , a Zero broke out of the low clouds on our port beam heading directly toward us . Again using the slewing sight at the director officers hatch , I swung the Bennion s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a no-deflection head-on shot , a five-inch round scored a direct hit on the planes nose . The Zero vanished in a fiery explosion . Flaming debris fell into the sea around us . <p> At daylight on 25 October 1944 , the Bennion s crew was tired . We had been up more than 24 hourssince 0400 the day before , when we loaded five-inch ammunition from a Liberty Ship anchored off Tacloban as Navy Wildcats tangled with Zeros overhead . We had been at GQ for more than 12 hours . Now , as we listened to the reports come in over the TBS and saw yet more survivors clinging to the smoking wreckage of a Japanese fleet , we sensed that a great victory had been won . A major Japanese force of battleships and cruisers had been virtually immolated with serious damage to just one of our ships , the destroyer Grant . The showdown in Surigao Strait , along with close-by naval engagements of 24-25 October , collectively came to be called the Battle of Leyte Gulf . Samuel Eliot Morison , the distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle in history . <p> A few days passed before we in the Bennion had the time to analyze the engagement and submit our action report to commander DESRON 56 for consolidation with the reports of the other eight destroyers , and to assess the performance of our ship during the engagement . Torpedoman First Class Tom Bowen had been assigned to time the run of each torpedo salvo with a stopwatch to note if an explosion ( or explosions ) occurred at the moment of expected impact on the target . Bowen reported seeing an explosion at the expected impact time of one of our torpedoes . He also said in his report that the Bennion s sonar had detected an underwater explosion at the same time as his visual sighting . But it was not identified whether that presumed hit occurred as a result of our first salvo or second salvo . <p> A week after the battle I transferred off the Bennion . As I said goodbye to my skipper , Commander Cooper , a splendid gentleman and captain , he said he was sorry to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment before I replied : " Captain , in the past 48 hours we silenced four shore batteries , shot down three planes , sank a destroyer by gunfire , and made a close-in torpedo hit that helped sink a Japanese battleship . I think I 'd now like to try something new . " <p> Thus did the Bennion and I go our separate ways . I had orders to report for flight training . During a Japanese air raid I was transported via whaleboat to a departing cargo ship , beginning a long , slow hitchhike across the Pacific that marked the start of a career as a carrier pilot . The Bennion went on to the Mindoro and Lingayen Gulf landings , the assault on Iwo Jima , and received a Presidential Unit Citation at Okinawa , all without me . Not quite a year later , the war was over . <p> And there , but for a turn of fate decades later , the story might have ended , the Bennion s place in the history of Surigao Strait never fully secured . Save for Torpedoman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and others had felt at the time , we had no documentation , official or otherwise , that the Bennion may have helped sink the Yamashiro . <p> In 1958 Morison published Volume XII of his seminal History of United States Naval Operations in World War II . Volume XII is titled simply Leyte , and like the other volumes it is based on official U.S. Navy after-action reports available to him at the time . In Leyte he states that because the Japanese column conducted a course reversal at the time DESRON 56 made its coordinated attack , just one torpedo from the squadronfrom the Newcomb ( DD-586 ) is believed to have hit its target .

There it stayed until 2008 , when I picked it up again to research another aspect of the Battle of Surigao Strait .

The analysis had made extensive use of the interrogations of Japanese survivors , including a warrant officer from the battleship . <p> Sadly , most of the Bennion crew are gone , but its never too late to set the historical record straight . Thus , on the basis of the critical review of all official and authoritative information available , the Bennion today at long last can properly be credited with her torpedo hit on the Yamashiro , which directly contributed to the Japanese battleships sinking at the Battle of Surigao Strait in Leyte Gulf .

But while many of their exploits are legendary , the experiences of the men who sailed in the powerful vessels are often overlooked . <p> Only four days out of New York , " Old Ironsides " was bound on a cruise to the Pacific . It was a beautiful , cloudless Sunday morning . The frigate 's sails lay slack against her masts . The ship 's company , officers and men , stood or sat in silence , sheltered from the sun 's heat by awnings that overspread the quarterdeck . On a given signal the Constitution ' s chaplain stepped to the capstan over which was draped an American flag . The ship 's band opened the service with a hymn " whose sweet notes gave solemnity to the occasion . " In steady , well-modulated tones , the chaplain proceeded to deliver an " eloquent and impressive sermon " based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " no man ever regretted a moment or an hour that he had devoted to his God . " <p> A bystander who would later report on the day 's service would ask rhetorically : Who were these worshipers who so anxiously embraced the message of Luke 's gospel ? They were , he would answer , " some 430 ' children of the storm , ' whose daily life caused them frequently to be amidst danger on the high and giddy mast , wrestling with the storm . " 1 <p> For those children of the storm who contemplated the uncertain and transitory nature of life at sea , the fact that they were sheltered in such a stout vessel as Old Ironsides must have proved comforting , for the Constitution was among the largest as well as most powerful and renowned ships in the American Fleet . She was one of the first six frigates authorized for the new U.S. Navy in 1794 . Designed to be an overmatch for any vessel in their class and to outsail any ship of greater force , the first six frigates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and United States were a formidable combination of power , size , and speed under sail . During the years that marked their active operations , 1798-1855 , these remarkable ships fought in three wars , combated piracy , performed diplomatic missions , and protected the nation 's maritime interests . <p> Who were the men of the first six American frigates , these children of the storm , and what attracted them to such a hazardous calling ? While statistical data on U.S. Sailors of the early Navy is scarce , there is enough evidence to offer several conclusions about the men who served in these elite vessels . First , it can be said that a significant percentage of the six frigates ' Sailors were foreign-born . As one contemporary , an officer in the United States , remarked , " The American man-of-war of those days had a crew composed of men of all nations , and it was rarely the case that a majority of them were native-born Americans . " 2 A survey of the number of foreigners in the Constitution conducted in December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43.6 percent ) were foreign-born , a figure that included 23 different nationalities . 3 This polyglot character of the six frigates ' crews reflected the Navy 's inability to recruit large numbers of American tars to man its vessels , a fact that left administrators and senior officers concerned about the loyalty and orderliness of alien Sailors . 4 <p> Two other suggestive pieces of evidence help round out this portrait of the frigates ' Sailors . The first is the age profile of the Constellation ' s crew in July 1820 . According Charles G. Ridgely , the ship 's commander at that time , the average age of the " Yankee Racehorse 's " enlisted men was " twenty seven years two months and a day , " a figure confirming the youthful character of American man-of-war 's men . 5 The second piece of evidence is offered by Charles Morris , the Constitution ' s first lieutenant during her engagement with the Guerriere . One of the reasons Old Ironsides prevailed in that contest , observed Morris , was that many of her Sailors had served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining the Navy . The skills these men brought with them on entering naval service proved invaluable in repairing battle damage to the frigate. 6 <p> The men who enlisted in the six frigates did so for a variety of reasons . Edward W. Taylor , a corporal of Marines assigned to the United States in 1842 , " joined the Corps . . . to visit the shores of foreign lands and " to behold " some of the human beings who inhabit . . . the boundless universe , other than those of my own happy lands . " 7 Harry Rivers , another United States crewman , had originally intended to join the merchant marine before he met " a couple of old ' sea dogs , ' . . . who portrayed the bustle and liveliness on board a man-of-war in such glowing colors I relinquished my former idea and determined at all risks to enroll myself under the star-spangled banner and join the navy of ' uncle Sam . ' " 8 Other Sailors joined the sea service in a fit of patriotic enthusiasm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles to claim enlistment bounties and advanced wages . <h> Keeping the Crew in Line <p> " Order is the first great rule on board a man-of-war , and that to which all others must bend . It is in fact the Alpha and the Omega , the beginning and the ending , the centre and the circumference of her whole internal organization . " 9 This statement by Enoch Wines , a schoolmaster in the Constitution , captures the centrality of order to life within the wooden walls of the first six frigates . Rules , regulations , and discipline were the inescapable feature of service in these vessels . They were essential to the safe and efficient management of any ship . Whatever threat might arise at sea , be it accident , storm , or enemy ships , a frigate 's crew needed to respond swiftly , correctly , and with precision , or their lives and their ship 's existence might be forfeited . <p> Frigate Sailors felt the impact of naval order on their lives the moment they first stepped aboard their ship . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name on the ship 's watch , station , and quarter bill , gave him his berth and mess assignment , and assigned him his rating . In this way , each man learned what duty he was to perform and when , how , and where he would fight the ship , with whom he would eat , and where he would sleep . The first lieutenant also assigned watch and division stations to the frigate 's lieutenants and midshipmen , though it should be noted that custom largely governed the messing and sleeping arrangements of the ship 's officers . <p> Three sets of rules and regulations provided the legal and administrative underpinnings for a well-ordered frigate . These were the Navy Department Regulations , the " Articles of War , " and each ship 's own set of internal regulations , promulgated by the vessel 's captain . Collectively these documents described the duties of officers and enlisted personnel , defined violations and punishments of naval law , articulated the method of administering justice , and established the rules governing shipboard duties and routine . <p> How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a reflection of his own philosophy on this important subject . While all officers recognized that obedience to authority was essential to the running of their vessels , they differed on what methods were best to achieve this end . A small minority of frigate commanders , most notably Thomas Truxtun , believed that flogging was an abhorrent disciplinary practice . Truxtun 's philosophy was that Sailors were better led by force of character and example than by the threat of the lash . But the majority of frigate captains believed corporal punishment was an effective and essential tool to the maintenance of order and discipline in their ships . John Rodgers and William Bainbridge were two such officers who took a tough , no-nonsense approach to the application of naval discipline at sea . <p> Sailors , Marines , and officers committed a number of offenses that undermined the discipline and good order of a ship or that represented a serious challenge to the authority of a vessel 's leadership . Drunkenness was the most common of these and the most difficult to combat , as alcohol abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included neglect of duty , insubordination , assault , and the most serious of all crimes , mutiny . Punishments ranged in severity from suspension of rations to confinement , reduction in rank , flogging , dismissal from service , and in rare cases , death . The extremes to which punishments might extend are illustrated by the case of Robert Quinn , a seaman in the President , whom a court-martial found guilty of mutiny on 23 June 1804 . The court ordered Quinn " to have his Head &amp; Eye brows shaved , " to have " the Word MUTINUS " branded on his forehead , and to be flogged through the fleet with 320 lashes. 10 <h> A Sailor 's Work <p> It took between 350 and 450 men to sail , handle , and fight each of the early frigates . To manage the work of such a large body of men effectively required they be well-organized and well-directed . To this end , crew members responsible for working the ship were divided equally into two watches , denominated the larboard and starboard watches . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . Watch-standers thus worked one watch on , followed by one watch off , and so on . Watches were of four hours ' duration , except for the period between 1600 and 2000 , which was divided into two two-hour " dogwatches . " The mechanism of the dogwatch prevented crewmen from having to stand the same watch , day in and day out . <p> Work was further organized in a frigate by stationing crewmen to one of the six divisions responsible for conducting the ship 's evolutions : waist , afterguard , foretop , maintop , mizzentop , and forecastle . Assignment to each division was based on a crewman 's nautical skill and experience . Work in the forecastle and in the tops required the greatest amount of seamanship , knowledge , and dexterity , while service in the waist and afterguard relied more on brute strength than sailor-like skill . <p> A frigate 's crew had other duties beyond those relating to ship sailing . One task that occupied much of the men 's time on a daily basis was keeping the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite fastidious in this regard . Typical cleaning chores included sweeping , holystoning , wetting down , and drying the decks . Other duties that improved the cosmetic appearance of the ship included polishing the ship 's " bright-work , " blackening her guns , whitewashing her interior , and painting her exterior . <p> One of the most important routines performed by frigates at sea was exercising the men at their battle stations . The prudent frigate commander regularly practiced his men at the great guns , at damage control , in the use of small arms , and in boarding techniques . Though exercising the ship 's guns was often done without ammunition , a number of captains practiced with live fire and even employed targets . On the eve of his first wartime cruise in the Constitution , Isaac Hull drilled his gun divisions at target practice daily for three weeks . 11 In 1842 , both Commodore Thomas ap Catesby Jones of the United States and Captain " Mad Jack " Percival of the Constitution practiced their men at live-fire drill , target shooting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 <h> Conditions on Board Ship <p> For frigates that had been on extended cruises , making port offered the opportunity to carry out needed repairs and replenish depleted food and water supplies . After arrival , officers organized the men into gangs and working parties to help prepare the ship for sea . The most arduous duty to be performed was watering the ship , a job that was sometimes fraught with great peril . On 2 December 1812 , several boats from the Constitution tried to land on the island of Fernando de Noronha , Brazil , to procure water . The heavy surf stove in one boat , damaged a second , injured one man on the rocks , and nearly drowned several others . 13 Not all watering places were hazardous , though . The Hawaiian waterfall from which the United States drew her water in the summer of 1843 was frequented by naked native women who enjoyed swimming near the falls . An amused ' States midshipman confided to his journal , " Bathing has become quite a fashionable . . . pastime with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigate life that proved quite taxing to the men who lived and served in those vessels was the constant exposure to the elements . Extremes of temperature , hot or cold , made life miserable for those above and below decks . " Any person who wishes for hotter weather than this can not be satisfied short of , " lamented a United States midshipman describing a particularly scorching summer afternoon in the Mediterranean . 15 <p> Harsh weather conditions did not necessarily earn Sailors a respite from performing their regular duties . To scrub and wash " clothes in the open air in a snow storm , " observed Nathaniel Ames of the United States , " is a thing far easier talked of than done , for shoes and stockings , and jacket must all come off upon the occasion . " 16 Water taken on during storms or due to the leakiness of the ship also contributed to uncomfortable living conditions below decks . The acting chaplain of the Constitution reckoned that the frigate shipped several tons of water when heavy seas stove in the ship 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While Navy-issued rations of salted beef and pork and hard-baked bread formed the daily staple of meals on board a frigate , the ship 's company did have occasion to enjoy tastier fare . Port calls offered all the opportunity to purchase fresh provisions for their messes . Midshipman Schenck of the United States boasted that " when in port we have as good as the market affords . " According to Schenck , the steerage larder contained an " Abundance of hams , tongues , and other etceteras . Besides flour , lard , butter , vegetables , and dryd fruit . " 18 Some of the food the crew purchased came aboard in the form of livestock , to be slaughtered and consumed at a later time . After one such laying in of " fresh grub , " a Constitution officer described the ship 's gun deck as being " covered with geese , turkies , chickens , sheep , pigs , and rabbits , each in their proper apartment . " 19 The pleasure Sailors experienced in eating fresh food instead of their regular rations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin wrote that being able to eat delicious fruit , beefsteak , onion , and soft bread after a steady diet of salt pork and hardtack " produced a sensation never to be forgotten . " 20 <p> With as many as 500 men to accommodate , living conditions in a frigate were crowded . Joining the mass of humanity below decks was an animal population that included not only the critters destined for the cook 's soup pot but also entire menageries the crew claimed as pets . During one of the United States ' South American cruises , the pets on board that vessel included a number of terrapins , two parrots , a monkey , a mountain rat , and a cat . 21 In 1826 , birds , dogs , a goat , and a donkey comprised the roll of pets in the Constitution . 22 At different times Old Ironsides also numbered jaguars and Arabian horses among its denizens . 23 The presence of large numbers of animals below decks not only posed a health hazard to the crew but degraded the living conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On occasion , squadron commanders brought their wives and families to live with them on board one of the frigates , which usually served as the squadron flagship . These additions to the ship 's people were sometimes the subject of gossip and resentment . Peter Stuyvesant Fish , a captain 's clerk in the United States during Daniel T. Patterson 's command of the Mediterranean Squadron complained that Mrs. Patterson and her two daughters were running the ship : " The females have been already wished home a thousand times by every officer , as they have already given difficulty and will cause , eventually , the cruise to be disagreeable . They rule when the ship is to sail already . " 24 <p> Women caused commotions of a different sort on board ship when they gave birth to children . There are two documented examples of this rare event occurring in the six frigates , one in the United States in November 1800 and the other in the Chesapeake in April 1803. 25 It is also worth noting that the first documented record of women serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six frigates , when in 1813 Mary Marshall and Mary Allen were entered on the rolls of the United States as supernumeraries . According to the ship 's log , the women served the frigate as nurses . 26 <h> Passing Free Time <p> Spinning yarns , smoking , singing , dancing , enjoying music , and playing games ( cards , checkers , and backgammon ) were just some of the ways Sailors diverted themselves during their off hours . 27 Crewmen also relaxed by staging plays on board ship . During one cruise , the people of the Constitution contributed $250 toward the purchase of costumes and scenery for staging their own " aquatic threatricals. " 28 <p> Another favorite pastime on board ship was reading . Before departing for the Pacific in the spring of 1839 , the Constitution ' s crew purchased a library of 300 to 400 books by subscription . Titles in the new library included works by Sir Walter Scott , James Fenimore Cooper , and Frederick Marryat . The arrival of the ship 's mail ( an irregular event ) offered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . Henry Mercier , a foretopman in the Constitution , described the eagerness with which newly arrived journals were read and shared throughout Old Ironsides : " In a little time , in every part of the ship you could perceive our frigate 's newsmongers on the alert , reading aloud Heralds , Suns , Expresses , and Brother Jonathan , to attentive crowds , who were swallowing with true relish their precious contents . " 29 <p> Liberty days were eagerly anticipated by both officers and ratings once their frigate arrived in port . With wages in hand , Sailors made straight for local grog shops where they usually drank until their money ran out . At Minorca 's Port Mahon , some of the more colorful Sailors ' haunts bore names such as Codfish Bills , Jackknife Hotel , and The Sailor 's Last Push . 30 And if local bar owners failed to separate " Jack " from the last few coins in his purse , a host of disreputable " tradesmen " cruised nearby to snap them up . <p> In ports of call with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local backcountry . Midshipman Franklin visited the volcano Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii in 1843 . " It was a grand and rare sight to see this lake of liquid fire , " recalled Franklin , " its waves rushing from side to side with no regular motion , but meeting each other and producing a jet of lava which would rush many feet into the air with an indescribable bank and roar . " 31 Visits to European port cities also presented chances to take in memorable sights . During a tour of the royal palace in Lisbon , Captain 's Clerk Peter Fish contrived to lag behind in the throne room " in order that we might say we had sat on the royal chair of the House of Braganza. " 32 <p> The early American frigate officers serving in the Mediterranean and Pacific squadrons enjoyed a rather robust social life whenever their ships were in port . In one particularly busy week at Port Mahon in February 1833 , Midshipman Schenck did duty only one day out of seven , attending parties , masquerades , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted the young officer to complain , " I am getting tired of the Opera and Masquerades , but we have no other amusements here . " 33 <h> Conduct Under Fire <p> The first six frigates engaged in many types of operations over the course of their active service in peace and war . But they are best remembered for their record as combat vessels , especially in their ship-to-ship engagements in the Quasi-War with France and in the War of 1812 . It was these actions that validated the concept of Joshua Humphreys ' design and secured an enduring reputation for these ships and their commanders . <p> The battle performances of these vessels offer several lasting impressions . The first is the degree to which the American frigates proved an overmatch for their more lightly built , lightly armed opponents . Isaac Hull 's official letter reporting the capture of the Guerriere describes the physical devastation the American frigates were capable of inflicting in battle . " So well directed was the fire of the Constitution , " wrote Hull , " and so closely kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we got alongside of the Enemy ( One of their finest Frigates ) she was left without a Spar Standing , and the Hull cut to pieces , in such a manner as to make it difficult to keep her above water . " 34 Old Ironsides ' gunfire wreaked similar havoc among the Guerriere 's personnel , killing or wounding approximately a third of her crew . <p> The size , power , and speed of the American frigates continued to impress British and American observers more than a decade after their 1812 victories . Following a tour of the United States in 1825 , Royal Navy Surgeon John Cunningham declared , " I had not been five minutes on board before I ceased to wonder that my friend Capt . Carden in the Macedonian , was forced to succombe to her . " 35 Nathaniel Ames came to the same conclusion as Surgeon Cunningham after comparing his own ship , the United States , with the British frigate Tartar anchored nearby . The wonder , remarked Ames , was " not that we had taken any English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers could be found who had the temerity to engage such disproportionate force , or the hardihood to fight as long as they did . " 36 <p> Despite their power and speed under sail , Humphreys ' frigates could not have achieved such decisive victories over their opponents had they not been commanded by skilled Sailors or manned by disciplined and spirited crews . American seamanship at its best was on display in the Truxtun-commanded Constellation ' s duels with L'Insurgente and the Vengeance and in Charles Stewart 's brilliant tactical handling of Old Ironsides against the Cyane and Levant . Stephen Decatur 's United States was superbly fought by a crew that had sailed and trained together for more than two years . The courage and determination with which frigate crews served their guns in battle also contributed to American victories . On surrendering his sword to Isaac Hull , Guerriere Captain James R. Dacres praised the fighting spirit of the Yankee tars , declaring that the Constitution ' s Sailors fought " more like tigers than men . I never saw men fight so . They fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these components leadership , discipline , high morale the American frigates did not fair so well in ship-to-ship duels . On 1 June 1813 , James Lawrence rashly decided to leave the safety of Boston Harbor , sailing the Chesapeake into action against HMS Shannon . Captain Sir Philip B. V. Broke 's well-disciplined , highly motivated crew made short work of the poorly led , poorly trained Chesapeake crew , resulting in the first capture of an American frigate during the War of 1812 . John Rodgers ' inept handling of the President during an 17-hour chase of HMS Belvidera on 23 June 1812 allowed the latter vessel to slip through his fingers , when a more aggressive handling of the American 44 would have enabled Rodgers to have claimed the first frigate victory of the war . <h> A Precarious Existence <p> Following the near-drowning of one of the Constitution ' s Sailors , Surgeon Amos Evans made the following entry in his journal : " The tenure of a sailor 's existence is certainly more precarious than any other man 's , a soldier 's not excepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one . " 38 Evans ' comment highlights one of the central features of life in the first six frigates : its precariousness . Aside from combat , Sailors were subject to death or injury from a number of causes , one of the most prevalent of which was accident . Not surprisingly , falls constituted the most frequent type of accident to befall frigate crewmen . Falls from the rigging onto the deck almost always proved lethal , while falls overboard at least afforded the possibility of rescue , assuming the victim could swim and the sea 's conditions permitted it . <p> When James Johnson pitched into the ocean while working aloft in the Constitution in the midst of a gale , high seas prevented his shipmates from rendering him any assistance . 39 In what must surely count as one of the most ironic deaths to occur in one of the first six frigates , David Black of the United States drowned when the life buoys he had made failed and sank . Weeks earlier , Black 's shipmates had criticized the poor quality of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a man can not save himself with these , he ought to drown . " 40 <p> Like the men who served in them , the six frigates themselves were also subject to accident , putting crew and ship at risk . On two separate occasions , the frigate Congress came within a hairsbreadth of foundering in storms . The first came on 12 January 1800 , when an Atlantic gale stripped the ship entirely of its top-hamper , leaving the frigate " wrecked . . . as completely as ever a vessel was . " 41 The second occurred in the fall of 1823 , when a hurricane drove the frigate within a biscuit 's pitch of being dashed on the rocks of La Guair a Harbor , Venezuela . 42 Collisions , groundings , and fires were other kinds of accidents that damaged and jeopardized these vessels . <p> Disease posed the greatest hazard to the operations of a frigate and the well-being of her crew . Due to the cramped living conditions on board ship , communicable diseases such as smallpox , measles , and influenza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food- or water-borne diseases , such as yellow fever , dysentery , and cholera , were also capable of incapacitating or killing large numbers of Sailors . It was common for sick lists to contain anywhere from a half-dozen to three dozen names at any point in a ship 's cruise . Once illness took hold of a ship 's company , these numbers could rise stratospherically . In September 1801 , the President had to give up her cruising station off Tripoli temporarily and sail for Gibraltar because upward of 160 of her Sailors were sick with " a Kind of enfluensa. " 43 In September 1834 an outbreak of cholera swelled the sick lists in the Constellation to 70 , killing 18 crewmen and forcing an early departure for home from the Mediterranean . 44 <h> A Deep Sense of Pride <p> Life at sea in America 's first six frigates was little different from that experienced by U.S. Sailors serving throughout the Fleet . In this regard , service in these vessels reflected a Navy-wide experience . Yet in another sense , service in the six ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these frigates were the largest , swiftest , and most powerful ships in the Navy and a berth in any one of them was considered a choice assignment . Even after larger ships-of-the-line and newer classes of frigates entered the Fleet , the older frigates designed by Joshua Humphreys continued to elicit admiration . As one officer opined when describing the Constitution , " She is to our navy , what the first efforts of artists sometimes are ; efforts which they look back to , with surprise , but can not reach again : her model can not be surpassed . " 45 <p> Like all Sailors , the men who sailed in these majestic vessels felt a deep pride in their ships . In part this was due to the unique appearance and qualities these frigates possessed . 46 But more important , it was because they recognized the historical significance these ships held for both the Navy and the American public . Crewmen were regularly reminded of this fact when their ships entertained civilian visitors . " Is this the same Old Constitution that won so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked during a port call to New York in the spring of 1844 , an experience that was repeated on many other occasions . 47 <p> The Constitution ' s crew , however , did not need civilian visitors to remind them of the frigate 's significance , for among their ranks were men whose careers formed a living connection with the vessel 's historic past . These were the veterans of 1812 , or as Herman Melville described them , " hearty old members of the Old Guard " who spun " interminable yarns about Decatur , Hull , and Bainbridge ; and carried about their persons bits of ' Old Ironsides , ' as Catholics do the wood of the true cross . " 48 It was these kinds of connections with the Navy 's and the nation 's historic past that gave the first frigates that continued to sail after 1815 a special standing within the American Fleet . <p> By the time of the Civil War , the active service of the first frigates was over , with only one of these extraordinary ships , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , more than 200 years after she was first launched , Old Ironsides remains in commission , a visible and proud reminder of the Navy 's earliest days , when the children of the storm braved the elements and many enemies to protect the republic 's maritime interests whenever and wherever they were threatened . <p> 3 .

By law a military , law enforcement , and regulatory agency , the service has been part of four different cabinet departments over the past century and has shifted department-to-department on six occasions . 1 Unfortunately , the Coast Guards current home , within the Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) , is not ideal . <p> The seventh times a charm . A permanent move to the Department of Defense ( DoD ) specifically as the third naval service within the Department of the Navywould position the Coast Guard to become more robust , efficient , and combat ready than ever in its history . 2 <h> Benefits of Moving to DoD <p> Stability . Uncertainty is highly disruptive to the planning and execution of complex defense operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by law , the Coast Guard sits outside DoD in peacetime and is poised for transfer to the Department of the Navy during war . <p> Permanent placement of the Coast Guard within DoD would eliminate the possibility of a disruptive transfer to the Navy at the height of conflict . It would allow for consistent relationships among the five armed services , with no ambiguity as to who does what in the continuum of maritime operations , in peace , times of tension , and war , and would create numerous efficiencies between DoD and the Coast Guard . All five armed forces would be organized , trained , and equipped as they fight . <p> Operational Effectiveness . The Coast Guard is the best in the world at many of its non-defense missions , but it often has been a second-class citizen in the national security arena . This is the result of a systemic lack of resources and the relative infrequency with which defense missions are carried out . Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased Coast Guard warfighting skills , but these gains will atrophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . Serving full time within DoD would capture this recent boost . <p> The past 13 years as an agency within DHSa civilian organizationhave demonstrated how such a position keeps the Coast Guard from reaching its full potential . Being the only military service among civilian law enforcement and administrative agencies dulls the services warrior edge . The Coast Guards culture , worldview , operational focus , training regimes , maintenance programs , and work ethos are similar to those of the DoD services but markedly different from those of the Transportation Security Agency , Citizenship and Immigration Services , and Federal Emergency Management Agency . <p> Training and equipping the Coast Guard to a high standard of military readinessby moving it into the realm of the warfighterwould enhance lower-order missions , particularly homeland security and maritime law enforcement . Unquestionably , the reverse is not true . That is why governors call in the National Guard when riots break out : warfighters can conduct law enforcement missions with relative ease , but no one would expect city police to head to Fallujah to engage in hand-to-hand combat with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right-sized , predictable , and stable . Sadly , within DHS , for the Coast Guard they are none of the above . <p> Following 9-11 , the Coast Guard saw a modest surge in personnel , operating budget , and acquisition dollars , but these increasesmany of which have dissipatedpale in comparison to the growth of DoD and other DHS components . Meanwhile , the Coast Guards day-to-day responsibilities , primarily for homeland security missions , have ballooned . Within DHS , there is no plausible future that would see the Coast Guard receive the funding increase it needs to fully execute its non-military responsibilities , much less acquire the full suite of assets and personnel needed for national defense . <p> As part of DoD , however , the Coast Guard would have broader access to well-established logistics , command-and-control , research-and-development , and acquisition programs that could decrease costs and make more efficient use of taxpayer dollars . Rather than having its own redundant systems , the Coast Guard could leverage those already in place within DoD and the Department of the Navy . Further , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits increases , rather than having to depend on the vagaries of a separate department to keep pace with military allowance changes . <p> Acquisition . The implosion of the $25 billion Deepwater program a decade ago highlighted the immaturity of the Coast Guards acquisition capabilities . Conceived when the Coast Guard was an agency within the Department of Transportation and executed under the newly created DHS , Deepwater was at high risk for failure . Neither of the two departments had , or has , the expertise to oversee a complex , decades-long , multifaceted recapitalization of cutters , aircraft , and supporting systems . <p> It was not until the Coast Guard brought on senior DoD acquisition professionals that it began to turn the corner . By 2010 , Deepwater had been reformed and eventually devolved into individual programs , most of which are on a path to success . Even now , however , there is too little synergy with Navy aviation and shipbuilding expertise , driving up costs for the much smaller Coast Guard programs and squandering scarce acquisition dollars . <p> The Coast Guard always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As part of DoD , it would benefit from the acquisition expertise and infrastructure found within the Pentagon . <p> Advanced Capabilities . Research and development ( R&amp;D ) and the integration of advanced technologies are both prized and finely honed within DoD . In contrast , within DHS R&amp;D funding is scarce , and the Coast Guard sits years and often decades behind DoD in bringing state-of-the-art technologies to the front lines . <p> Regardless of where the Coast Guard resides within government , technological innovation will be a key element in keeping up with an ever-growing workload and an increasingly demanding mission set . Unmanned vehicles , robotics , advanced computing , stealth , space assets , and a multitude of other advances provide significant promise for fielding a more capable and effective Coast Guard . Such advances are far less likely to be brought to the fight , however , so long as the service is dependent on its tiny organic R&amp;D function and not the powerhouse Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Naval Research Laboratory , and the rest of DoDs R&amp;D enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to DoD would be detrimental to the Coast Guard and the nation on multiple fronts . They will say the Coast Guard is simply too small to survive within DoD , and that it would be smothered or dismembered by the Navy . Others will argue that the services civilian missions have no place within a military environment , that the posse comitatus statute would inhibit or prohibit the Coast Guards law enforcement functions , and that the services effectiveness as a humanitarian organization would be diminished . <p> These arguments can be refuted . <p> As for size , the Coast Guard would present the same relative budgetary footprint as the U.S. Special Operations Command , which appears , by all measures , to be doing quite well . <p> In respect to funding , history offers stark truths . When the Coast Guard was the largest operational agency within Transportation , it was nearly starved out of existence . For its 13 years under DHS , the Coast Guard has lost a multitude of budget battles to the more politically sensitive needs of its civilian law enforcement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive gaps in operational capability . <p> Certainly , the fight for dollars within DoD would be intense , and the Coast Guard would need to carve out a safe niche under the Secretary of the Navy . The secret to long-term success would lie in the legislation transferring the Coast Guard to DoD . The law would need to make clear the requirement for a separate , distinct service , preserving its full range of missions . Moreover , it would have to outline the specific national security functions for which the Coast Guard would be responsible while making clear the levels of operational capability needed by the service . This would provide a road map for the Pentagon brass and the congressional armed services and appropriations committees to follow . <p> Civilian missions such as search and rescue , maritime inspection , and pollution prevention could fold easily into DoD . The Coast Guards most visible mission , search and rescue , already is carried out daily with the assistance of the Navy and Marine Corps and the Air Force , with hundreds of lives saved each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in the DNA of all the nations armed forces . <p> Most other " civilian " functions of the Coast Guard , such as marine environmental protection and servicing aids to navigation , closely mirror existing salvage and pollution response capabilities of the Navy and the inland waterways oversight of the Army Corps of Engineers . It is only the Coast Guards strictly regulatory functions , such as marine inspection , that would require explicit protection in the enabling legislation . <p> Regarding law enforcement and the prohibitions of posse comitatus , there is no problem . Posse comitatus was passed by Congress in 1878 to prevent the U.S. Army from enforcing domestic policies and law ( such as registering newly freed slaves to vote ) . The law was amended in 1956 to include the Air Force . According to the Congressional Research Service , " The courts have generally held that the Posse Comitatus Act by itself does not apply to the Navy or the Marine Corps. " 3 It is only by DoD directive that the two Sea Services are included under the act . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitions on direct law enforcement activity by the Army , Navy , Marine Corps , and Air Force , but explicitly exclude the Coast Guard from the DoD regulations . <p> Finally , the argument that the Coast Guards humanitarian stance would be undercut does not hold water . DoD has carried out some of the most complex and far-reaching humanitarian responses the world has ever seen , for example , following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami , Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , and the 2010 Haitian earthquake . Under DoD , the Coast Guard would find itself among humanitarian brethren , and there would be no diminution of the services standing in the international communitya person being pulled from the water does not care what cabinet agency the rescuers work for . The white hulls and red stripes of the Coast Guards cutter fleet still would engender respect if they sailed into foreign ports under the aegis of DoD . <h> Win-Win for the United States <p> The benefits to the nation of a Coast Guard transfer to DoD are significant , wide-ranging , and long-lasting . The transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specialty expertise at the lower end of the warfare spectrum into the defense establishment . In addition , the Coast Guard would benefit from the experience and thinking of its DoD brethren . <p> Bring creative Coast Guard leadership to DoD . The Commandant of the Coast Guard would become a permanent member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , and Coast Guard flag officers could serve as combatant commanders , potentially for the Northern and Southern Commands . Coast Guard regional commands could contribute more effectively to the Unified Command Plan , in support of the geographic and functional commanders . <p> Allow DHS to focus on its core civilian missions . The departments leadership no longer would have to worry about overseas contingency operations , naval warfare , and other intrinsically Coast Guard activities . <p> Allow the Coast Guard to leverage the enormous capabilities of DoD to build a better , more effective , and more cost-efficient organization . DHS simply does not have the acquisition , R&amp;D , and funding clout to help grow and refine the Coast Guard as a military service . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conclusion <p> According to Title 14 of the U.S. Code , the Coast Guard is to be " a military service and a branch of the armed forces of the United States at all times . " By ping-ponging the service between civilian cabinet departments the United States has never realized this vision . <p> Brushfires are smoldering across all hemispheres of todays world . Before they burst into the open flames of major theater warfare , or before the next massive deployment of troops to a far-flung destination , the nation should align its five military services to most optimal effect . Moving the Coast Guard into DoD , alongside its larger military cousins , is the smart thing to do . <p> 1 . The Coast Guard has been assigned to the Departments of Treasury , Navy , Transportation , and Homeland Security . Transfers among departments occurred at the beginning and end of World Wars I and II , in 1967 , and in 2003 . <p> Jim Dolbow is editor of The Coast Guardsmans Manual , 10th edition , published by the Naval Institute Press , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board . <p> Captain Howe is a retired Coast Guard cutterman who served 12 years at sea , five in command . He now works in the nuclear industry . <h> The Coast Guard Is Closer to DoD than Some Think <p> To the casual observer , the Coast Guard sits far apart from its DoD brethren , focused on civilian or quasi-military duties . The reality is much different : <p> Coast Guard men and women have fought alongside the other services in every war in the nations history , to include Iraq and Afghanistan . Today , its patrol boats operate under Navy command in the Persian Gulf , protecting vital oil infrastructure , and they have been there since 2003 . <p> More than half of the Coast Guards discretionary budget is spent on national defense and homeland security-centric missions . <p> All major cutters are trained and equipped to Navy standards and have compatible weapon systems , electronics , and flight-deck protocols . <p> Coast Guard personnel are integrated into DoDs geographic combatant commands .

The war had taken a terrible toll on the city . If it was going to survive , Charleston needed something to restore its faith . <p> Dixons secret weapon was the H. L. Hunley , a 40-foot , hand-powered submarine moored at the Battery Marshall dock on Sullivans Island . And in truth , she was no longer much of a secret . In the past six months , the sub had dominated Charleston gossip . She had arrived in August with the promise that , finally , the blockade would be broken . But after little more than a week the Confederate military seized the craft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Charleston after that . Horace Hunley , the submarines namesake , had convinced General P.

With a simple telegram , Hunley raised an entire crew of volunteers from Mobile , Alabama . He was wise enough to put Dixon in charge . The former riverboat engineer , a member of the 21st Alabama Infantry Regiment , had helped build the torpedo boat and understood her better than most . While recovering from a serious wound , Dixon was working in the Park and Lyons machine shop in Mobile when the Hunley and one of her predecessors were under construction there . The lieutenant had been shot at Shiloh in April 1862 ; the bullet meant for his thigh hit a $20 gold coin in his pocket , warping it and mangling his leg . But the coin saved his life . <p> Dixon not only gained a pronounced limp , but also a good luck charm . He had the coin engraved with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserver .

With a crowd watching the demonstration from onshore , he sank the submarine in Charleston Harbor , killing himself and seven others . The subs death toll was at 13 , none of them Union sailors . After that , it had taken Dixon a month to convince Beauregard to let him try again . <p> By then many had dismissed the submarine as just another failed experiment , another lost cause . Dixon would change that perception on this night . The Hunley would sail in five minutes . <h> Early Efforts <p> The submarine age arrived 150 years ago , due mostly to an ambitious daydreamer , two years of research and development , and a war . Men had built underwater craft before the Civil War , but those submarines never actually accomplished the goal for which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hunley s feat was so far ahead of its time that it would not be repeated for half a century . <p> Horace Lawson Hunley , the daydreamer , was successful by almost any measure . He was an attorney , a former state lawmaker , deputy chief of customs in New Orleans , and friends with some of the citys most influential men . Hunley had made a modest amount of money , enough that he owned a small plantation and a few slaves . In late 1861 , he decided to expand his business portfolio . <p> He may have gotten the idea to build a submarine in the summer of 1861 . The Reverend Franklin Smith , a chemist and inventor , had sent a letter to Southern newspapers , urging businessmen to invest in the idea of " Submarine Warfare . " Smith wrote that " The new vessel must be cigar shaped for speedmade of plate iron , joined without external rivet heads ; about thirty feet long , with a central section about 4 x 3 feetdriven by a spiral propeller . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In truth he thought the war was foolish but suspected it could be good for business . The Confederate government and wealthy businessmen were offering rewards of up to $50,000the 19th-century equivalent of $1.3 million todayto anyone who sank a Union warship . But there was more to it than money . Hunley wanted to be a part of something bigger ; he dreamed of being a Great Man . He carried a notebook in his pocket , a ledger in which he wrote grandiose ideas to make a mark on this world . Eventually , Hunley discarded all those dreams and adopted Smiths . <p> McClintock designed and built his submarine that winter , and she apparently was modeled exactly on Smiths letter . The boat , which was christened the Pioneer , was 35 feet long and almost completely roundfour feet wide and four feet tall . She had a single hatch and two short , squat fins that the pilot could adjust to dive or surface . Her tapered ends served as ballast tanks to take in and expel the water needed to submerge and surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a third stood , his head in the hatch , and steered . <p> The Pioneer was launched in March 1862 , around the time the Monitor fought the CSS Virginia to a standstill at Hampton Roads . The sub proved fragile , slow , and leaky , but she worked . The Pioneer eventually became the only submarine to receive a letter of marquea privateer license , basicallyduring the Civil War . But she would never see combat . <p> In April 1862 , Union forces captured New Orleans . Hunley and McClintock , worried that their secret weapon would fall into enemy hands , sank the Pioneer and escaped to Mobile . There , Confederate District of the Gulf commander Major General Dabney H. Maury took an interest in the pairs efforts and introduced them to the owners of the Park and Lyons machine shop . It would take nearly a year to build their second submarine , the American Diver . <p> McClintock , wanting to improve on the Pioneer s design , wasted months trying to build an electromagnetic engine to power the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive ) . But he could not build an engine small enough to fit in his boat . Finally , McClintock had to give up and install cranks . He made the sub only a foot longer than the Pioneer but added two men to the crew complement , hoping more manpower would make this sub faster than the last one . <p> The Diver attempted only one attack on the West Gulf Blockading Squadron , and it was a disaster . Once the sub was untethered , she did n't  have enough power to fight the tide and her crew found themselves being pulled out to sea . They never attempted to engage the blockade ; it was all they could do to make it back to the dock . Before they could try again , the boat was swamped under tow and sank in Mobile Bay . <h> A Sleek , Complex Vessel <p> With the loss of the American Diver , Hunley and McClintock were out of money . They would have been forced to give up their dream except that Edgar C. Singer , a torpedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer recognized the importance of the project and found McClintock the money he needed to go back to work . <p> Throughout the spring and early summer of 1863 , McClintock and workers from Park and Lyons built a third sub , far more advanced than its predecessors . Years later , McClintock would write that this time he took " more pains with her model , and the machinery . " <p> She would have an " elliptic shape . " The bow would be only an inch wide , the submarine expanding to her broadest point at the crew compartment and tapering again toward the stern . McClintock added thin dorsal fins in front of the hatches to cut down on drag . He also installed small fins in front of the boats diving wings to deflect rope or seaweedanything that might jam the fins operation . This was not a cigar boat ; she looked more like a shark . <p> At 40 feet , the sub would be four feet longer than the Diver .

The main compartment of the submarine would be nearly 25 feet long . With that additional space , the sub could carry a crew of eight . McClintock expanded their power exponentially by installing a series of reduction gears and a flywheel between the propeller and hand cranks . The crew would be able to propel the sub like a wind-up toy . This would give the men periods of rest , and perhaps even allow them to work in shifts . It would cut down on exhaustion , which he hoped would increase the submarines range . <p> McClintock also improved the plumbing in this submarine . She would include forward and aft ballast tanks , as the others had , each with its own pump . But this time he added fail-safe redundancies with a network of pipes running beneath the crew bench . With the switch of a lever , water could be pumped from one tank to the other , equalizing water distribution . The pumps also served as back-ups to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was perhaps the boats greatest safety feature . The subs buoyancy was fragile ; a few inches of water in the main compartment , and she would sink to the bottom . <p> The first draft of history would call this submarine a converted iron boiler , but that was not the case . McClintock designed a sleek , hydrodynamic , complex vessel far ahead of her time . Well into the 20th century , most boats that traveled beneath the waves followed McClintocks vision , but he would never be recognized as the father of the modern submarine . <p> The H. L. Hunley was launched in July 1863 . A crew likely composed of men from the Park and Lyons machine shop tested the boat in the Mobile River for a couple of weeks . Finally , on 31 July , they invited Confederate officials to a demonstration . General Maury , Rear Admiral Franklin Buchanan , and Brigadier General James E. Slaughter gathered onshore , their attention directed to a flat barge anchored in the river . <p> On cue , the Hunley appeared upstream towing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . As the sub approached the barge , she gracefully slipped beneath the water . The mine stayed on the surface and , when it made contact , there was a tremendous explosion . The barge lurched and dipped and soon began to sink . Several minutes later , the Hunley surfaced 400 yards downstream . <p> Confederate commanders in Mobile soon were recommending the submarine for service at Charleston . Buchanan , commander of the Naval District of the Gulf , likely orchestrated the campaign . The admiral did not trust submarine technology , but military politics also played a role . The Hunley , although a civilian vessel , had been promoted tirelessly by the Confederate Armyand Buchanan had no control over her . To rid himself of the problem , he sent a note to the commander of naval forces in Charleston , Flag Officer John Randolph Tucker , enthusiastically recommending the Hunley . <p> " I am fully satisfied it can be used successfully in blowing up one or more of the enemys Iron Clads in your harbor , " Buchanan wrote . The admiral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his Charleston headquarters . The general responded almost immediately . He needed the Hunley .

By the winter of 1864 , Dixon was the only man left with faith in the boat . And he would not fail . <h> To Sink a Blockader <p> It took the Hunley nearly two hours to reach the Housatonic on 17 February 1864 . Running with the tide , the submarine traveled at about 4 knots . Dixon steered by compass ; from his vantage point low on the water , he likely could not see a ship miles away . The boat traveled on the surface , as Beauregard had asked Dixon not to dive . This was the only thing that gave the lieutenant pause . The Hunley recently had been refit with a 20-foot spar tipped with a torpedo . Instead of diving beneath a ship and towing a contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey with the torpedo . After completing the mission , Dixon would flash a blue phosphorus lamp , the signal for troops ashore to start a signal fire by which the lieutenant would steer the Hunley home . <p> As they sailed into the Atlantic , the grind of the crank and reduction gears became a monotonous noise that filled the compartment . The crew said little ; talking used oxygen , and that was a commodity they could not spare . Despite the boats deadly history , Dixon had found more than enough volunteers in Charlestonsailors , artillerymen , even some veterans of privateers . Throughout the winter these men trained , and those two months of practice made them the most proficient crew ever to sail the sub . In that time , the Hunley had gone out three or four times a week , sometimes getting close enough to blockaders that Dixon could hear sailors singing on deck . But they had never attacked . Conditions had never been quite right . <p> By 2020 , Dixon could see the Housatonic less than a quarter-mile away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn , to make it easier to return to shore .

The watch had changed at 2000 , and the men who had just arrived topsides were still adjusting to the cold . Most of the 155 sailors on board were belowdecks . <p> Life on board the Housatonic was about as dull as it got in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron . The 205-foot sloop had arrived off the coast of Charleston in late September 1862 and since then had seen little action .

Flemming was ready , too , even if nobody else was . <p> " If no one is going to report this , " he said , loud enough for the other men on deck to hear . " I will cut the buoy adrift myself and get ready for slipping . " <p> When Comthwait heard Flemmings remark , he took another look , this time using binoculars , and saw that this log had two lumps on it the size of a mans head . Water rippled around the lumps , and he realized the object was moving under its own power . Comthwait turned and ran aft to find the officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch had spotted the Hunley , including Acting Master John Crosby , who alerted Captain Charles Pickering . On deck within seconds , the captain quickly called out orders " Slip the anchor chain and fire up the engine " and got his first look at the fish boat . <p> " It was shaped like a large whale boat , about two feet , more or less , under the water , " Pickering later recalled . " Its position was at right angles to the ship , bows on , and the bows within two or three feet of the ships side , about abreast of the mizzen mast , and I supposed it was then finding the torpedo on . " <p> Pickering ordered his men to " go astern faster , " raised his double-barrelled shotgun , and fired two loads of buckshot at the strange boat . Several of the crew joined him . They shot at her for more than a minute with small arms ; the sub was too close to train cannon on her . Some of the men aimed at faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtering through the subs deadlights . The gunfire did no damage to the dark craft so far as they could tell . <p> And then , an explosion . Crosby would later say it " sounded like a collision with another vessel . " There was no smoke , no flame , no sharp report , no column of water thrown into the airsimply a noticeable pressure , and then the Housatonic blew up . <p> The men on deck were still firing on the Hunley when the explosion knocked them off their feet . The ship lurched violently to port , recoiling from the blow . Deck planks were blown nearly as high as the ships mizzenmast . One sailor saw furniture floating out of a ten-foot hole in the side of the ship . <p> The Housatonic was going down fast . But because the sloop had been anchored in such shallow water , she did not have far to go . When her keel hit bottom , about 25 feet down , most of the ships rigging still stood high above the waterline . Sailors climbed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been blown off his feet , told Crosby to take a lifeboat and pull for the nearby sloop Canandaigua for help . <p> While they awaited rescue , Robert Flemming , the man who had first spotted the Hunley , was among the sailors clinging to the ships rigging . After about 45 minutes he spotted the Canandaigua in the distance , some 800 feet away , making good time toward them . And then he saw something else . Later , Flemming would simply say , " I saw a blue light on the water just ahead of the Canandaigua , and on the starboard quarters of the Housatonic . " For more than a century , men would speculate that Flemming , the first Union sailor to see the H. L. Hunley , was also the last man to see her for more than a century . <h> The Mysterious Aftermath <p> It would be days before Charleston realized the Hunley was missing , and about a week before Confederate officials learned that the torpedo boat had actually sunk a blockade ship . By then , the surviving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eventually conclude there was nothing they could have done to avert the loss of their ship . <p> But what happened to the Hunley ? Was she struck by the Canandaugua , left rudderless and adrift ? Did the concussion of the explosion knock the crew unconscious or , worse , kill them ? Did one of the sailors on the Housatonic crew shoot out a port in the forward conning tower , allowing the sub to fill with water and sink ? Or did Dixon simply set the sub down on the bottom to await the turning tide , and there the crew ran out of air ? There are dozens of theories , and conflicting clues . The answer may never be known . <p> For a while , the Confederates maintained a ruse that the Hunley had returned to port , suggesting she still lurked among the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron . But Dixon and the worlds first attack submarine were on eternal patrol and would not surface again for more than 130 years . <p> Sources : <p> This article is adapted from a forthcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cusslers 15-year search for the submarine . It was pieced together using letters , official Confederate documents , and first-person accounts . A letter from George E. Dixon to his friend Henry Willey dated 31 January 1864 ( a copy of which is held by the Friends of the Hunley , www.hunley.org ) provides many details , as does a letter Dixon wrote to Captain John Cothran of the 21st Alabama on 5 February 1864 . William Alexander , a Mobile engineer who helped build the submarine and served in the final crew until two weeks before her famous mission , told various versions of the Hunley tale in a series of articles published around the turn of the century , beginning with " The True Story of the Confederate Submarine Boats " ( New Orleans Picayune , 29 June 1902 ) . Alexanders accounts provide most of the meat to a story that is largely cryptic in official military and naval records . The rest of the account comes from the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of Rebellion , particularly Series 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -related documents , not the least of which are records of the official naval court of inquiry into the sinking of the Housatonic . Several letters of Horace Lawson Hunley survive in the Archives and are most accessible in Ruth H. Duncans book The Captain and Submarine CSS H. L. Hunley ( Memphis : Toof , 1965 ) . <h> Solving the Enduring Hunley Mystery <p> By Brian Hicks <p> For 150 years , no one has been able to answer the single most important question about the H. L. Hunley : Why did she sink ? <p> Since the submarine was recovered from the Atlantic floor in 2000 , scientists have found dozens of tantalizing , sometimes conflicting clues about what happened to the boat following her attack on the Housatonic . But there 's been no smoking gun , no single piece of evidence that could solve the lingering mystery of what happened in the Hunleys final moments . <p> But that could soon change . This spring scientists will embark on two separate projects that should give new insights into the submarines last hours . One is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Hunley s conservators . The other is the beginning of the final phase in the subs conservation and restoration . <p> In March the Hunley will be submerged in a tank of caustic chemicals that will slowly extract the salt that seeped into her iron hull over the 136 years she was in the sea . After three months in this soak , scientists will begin the six-month job of deconcretion . A thick layer of sand and shell built up on the subs hull during her time buried beneath the ocean floor . Scientists have left this hard shella concrete-like substance called concretionon the sub to protect her hull and minimize its deterioration . That decision helped to stabilize the boat while her interior was excavated , but the trade-off has been that the Hunley s hull has never been examined . Now archaeologists will finally have the chance to see if there is damage that might she 'd light on her sinking . <p> Scientists believe a few months in the chemical soak will loosen the concretion enough to remove it , but the process could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the conservation process can proceed . After that , its expected the Hunley will have to soak three or four more years before shell be ready for display in a museum . <p> As conservators scrape the hull , archaeologists at Clemson Universitys Warren Lasch Conservation Center are planning the simulation of the Hunley s battle with the Housatonic . In the past year , new clues have emerged that change the story dramatically . <p> Conservators working to preserve the submarines 20-foot spar discovered remnants of the Hunley s torpedo still attached to its end . Most historical accounts suggest the Hunley speared a barbed torpedo into the ships hull and then backed away . The torpedo was then detonated with a line from the explosive that pulled taut when the sub was a safe distance away . But when scientists found copper sheetingthe skin of the torpedostill bolted to the spar , it suggested a very different scenario . It now appears the Hunley used its spar like some other Civil War vessels , by simply ramming an enemy ship with a torpedo that blew up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to the submarine and the data collected on the remains of the crew , which were buried in 2004 . Forensic tests have revealed much about the men who served in the Hunley some of them had bad backs , for instance , others had suffered broken bonesbut there was nothing that proved they suffered any sort of trauma the night of the attack . <p> The work planned for the Hunley this year could be the most revealing since the initial excavation of the submarine in 2001 . The sub , which was discovered in 1995 by best-selling author Clive Cusslers National Underwater and Marine Agency , was raised by South Carolinas state Hunley Commission and the non-profit Friends of the Hunley on 8 August 2000 . Since then , she has resided in North Charleston at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center , named for the Friends first chairman . <p> During the initial excavation , which lasted four months , scientists discovered hundreds of artifactsincluding Lieutenant George Dixons gold coin . Everything found inside the submarine was mapped on a three-dimensional grid so that each detail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those discoveries have proven contradictory . The sub was filled with mud and sand , but it remains unclear when the hull was breached . There is evidence that no sand penetrated the boat for at least six months after the attack . Also , there were stalactites on the subs ceiling , which means that at least part of the interior was dry for a long time . Still , the submarine could have been partially filled with water soon after she sank , as some evidence indicates . <p> Cussler believes the reason the Hunley sank may lie with the shroud around the submarines propeller . Half the shroud is missing , but the half that remains has a couple of distinctive triangular cuts in it that look a lot like propeller strikes . Cussler points out that the last reported sighting of the submarine , by Housatonic crewman Robert Flemming , put her directly in the path of the screw sloop Canandaigua . Cussler believes the ship could have hit the Hunley , severing her rudder and knocking the sub off an even keel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to her . <p> If there are clues that can dispel or support theories about her mission , chances are they will be found later this year . And then , finally , scientists may have the answer to that nagging question : Why did the Hunley sink ?

There is nothing that can be attributed to a person that is more highly valued , lauded , or sought after in our organization . From the first day of boot camp to every change of command and retirement ceremony , leadership is preached as the ultimate personal quality . For a term we use so freely , we also spend an inordinate amount of time debating its nature . Because it is the core tenet of our organization , one might expect that we had solved the puzzle by now . Instead , we argue over whether it can be taught or is innate , how can it be intrusive or empowering , and what other traits contribute to it . What is it about leadership that makes it so much harder to define than the attributes so often associated with it , such as charisma , efficiency , intelligence , ambition , and morality ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we all relate to leadership in different ways . We all choose our heroes and grapple with the question of leadership through their example . Those heroes may be personalfamily members or those with whom we have servedor historical , even drawn from fiction . It is only natural that we gravitate toward heroic models that resonate for different reasons , but because of this we have failed to find a concise definition . <p> My father is a carpenter and architect , and my education was in physics and engineering . By temperament and training , I prefer to deal with root causes and fundamental principles , building up from them instead of applying individual cases across a broad spectrum . While it is possible to find success in leadership by emulating predecessors , imitation does not substitute for genuine understanding . To truly grasp leadership , I have embarked on a journey to find its root principles . History and literature gave me models to follow and heroes toward whom to aspire , but it was in philosophythe philosophy of the Meditationsthat I found the fundamental nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroes fail to illuminate ideal leadership because they are never perfect . For every great leader used as an example , there are flaws . We build up the " great men " and women by cherry-picking their success and positive attributes , while pushing their failings into the corners . Lord Horatio Nelson is lauded for his inspiring command at sea and his victories over the French , but his affair with Lady Hamiltonsurely a failure of loyalty and honestyare glossed over . Some argue that his personal failings are immaterial to any discussion of his leadership ability . But if that is the case , why did General David Petraeus suffer such a backlash when his extramarital affair was discovered ? Similarly , if we were to hold up General Stanley A. McChrystal for his battlefield leadership , any discussion would have to separate his positive attributes from his lapses in judgment portrayed in the Rolling Stone article that ended his military career . <p> No individual throughout history can stand up to intensive scrutiny without having some flaw or failing revealed . So there is no perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership . We are forced either to ignore unpalatable traits in our heroes or study them piecemeal , putting the laudable to one side and the disgraceful to the other . George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both kept slaves ; John Paul Jones was fired from Russian service over accusations of rape and admitted to employing a prostitute ; Admiral Hyman G. Rickover was abusive to subordinates and insubordinate to the civilian authorities over him . Even legendary and mythical figures fail to live up to the ideal : the stories of King David gave us the Bathsheba Syndrome , and King Arthur was slain by the offspring of his own incest . This is not to say that these were not good leaders , but instead to show that none of them embody the perfect ideal of leadership . For me , trying to become the best leader I could by looking to historical models felt like trying to build a cathedral by looking at pictures of St. Peters Basilica and copying it : even though I could make a fa+ade that was similar , I could never hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural principles involved . <p> Fictional Examples <p> Of course , the study of historical leadership models is not without merit . They serve a necessary purpose in translating the ideal into a more concrete and teachable mode , but it is important to understand their limitations . History should also not be our only source for material , because it comes fraught with all the petty failings of real individuals . Better , in some ways , are examples drawn from literature and the arts , because there individuals can be formed without defects or flaws ; they are the architects concept drawing rather than the blueprint or the building . <p> Modern cinema offers two examples of what I see as the ideal leader , both from writer-director Ridley Scott . His epics Gladiator and Kingdom of Heaven present heroic leaders who demonstrate moral judgment and selfless devotion to causes , putting aside their own lives , honor , and glory . In Gladiator , Maximus Decimus Meridius is shown to be a powerful and respected generalhis authority and potential influence are feared by Commodusbut in his discussions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come up again ) , he demonstrates that he cares nothing for the trappings of power , has no need to assuage his ego , and serves only for the " dream of Rome . " His desire to escape execution is not for any thought of his own lifes worth , but for his family , and when he is finally victorious , his only command to the Praetorians is an attempt to restore that dream of Rome . <p> Kingdom of Heaven presents an even clearer example in the " perfect knight " Balian of Ibelin . Balian constantly makes the honorable decision regardless of the personal risk or cost to himself . He spares the life of his enemy , refuses to plot against his allies , and defends Jerusalem to protect its people . Balian defies every cynical suggestion that he take power for himself , including turning down King Richard the Lionheart and denying his own valor to strive toward his " Kingdom of conscience , or nothing . " When he has done everything in his power , achieving an unexpected moral victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire of accolades . <p> Both these examples demonstrate heroic leaders capable of devoting themselves wholly to their cause and putting all their ability into its service , not for any hope of advancement or personal reward but because the cause itself is just . In many ways , literature and the arts bring us closer to the ideal leader and dramatize examples in a way that resonates with us . But we are still just looking at a finished product and trying to copy it instead of understanding it . <p> Reexamining the Criteria <p> Top-down definitions failed to give me the understanding of leadership I needed , so I attempted to focus less on the heroes themselves and drill down on what are considered their merits , to pick traits considered worthy and use them to construct a foundation . This too seemed lacking . It failed me because you can not build something without knowing what it should look like at the end . It failed because to pick traits and use them to define leadership was to mistake the tools for the carpenter . Leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should not beleaders are defined , or recognized , by their successes , which is everything they use to accomplish it . This is not to say ends justify means . But we must recognize that we are in an organization that requires mission accomplishment . Any model of leadership that fails to account for this is terminally flawed . What must be understood is that no single tool can be used to define great leadership . Each attribute taken alone or in the wrong proportion will lead to a flawed leader . Just as we can find defects in all historical heroes , we can find imperfect leaders who exemplify all of our prized traits . <p> If it is success for which our leaders must be shaped , then surely effectiveness should be the principal trait by which they are judged . Yet history is replete with examples of leaders who were highly effective but also deeply , if not horribly flawed . General William Tecumseh Sherman was perhaps the most effective of the Union generals during the Civil War ; his drive across the Confederate states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him such success has also made him a controversial figure , to say the least , and one rarely praised for his leadership . An even more drastic example is Vlad Tepes , who was very effective at keeping his Ottoman enemies out of Wallachia but has gone down in history with an unmatched reputation for cruelty . <p> Clearly we do not value success at any cost . We want leaders who win in ways we consider honorable . Ambition or drive is often considered an important trait , but the ambitious and flawed leader is even easier to unearth than the effective and flawed . Alexander the Great was both , but his ambition was perhaps his single most defining trait . There is scant evidence that he was motivated by anything other than personal drive , especially for his later campaigns in India and those planned for Arabia . Alexander was a man who willingly accepted , even encouraged claims of his own divinity ; he killed one of his own lieutenants after that man disparaged his achievements . He led thousands of men across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great is still praised for his leadership skills and achievements , but never universally ; he is the epitome of the flawed " great man " of history . <p> The ability to inspire , to rally support behind oneself , is seemingly the very definition of leadership . But this is not the description that the U.S. Navy needs for good leadership . It is merely one tool that an ideal leader must have . Both Martin Luther King Jr . and Adolf Hitler had it , but only one of them should be even remotely considered a good leader . These are just a few examples of how seemingly laudable traits do not necessarily result in great leaders , and why building a framework for the ideal on such a basis is a faulty premise . <p> Back to Philosophy <p> Learning from historical and fictional examples helped provide an idea of what a great leader looks like , but the lens were always distorted . There were obviously some root principles at work , but the heros flaws obscured them . My education in physics and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to understand everything down to its most basic principles . It is possible to create a perfect copy of something that will function ; a recreation of St. Peters Basilica will stand . But you will never be able to build something new unless you understand why the original worked . I had to find a way to grasp the fundamental principles of a human concept . This is when I turned to philosophy and , perhaps not coincidentally , found my answers coming from another character in Gladiator . <p> Marcus Aurelius was , according to Machiavelli , the last of the good emperors , known as a philosopher-king even within his own time . Today he is still regarded as one of the greatest Stoic philosophers . His achievements as emperor are noteworthy , but to take his accomplishments and life as my role model would be to fall into the same trap against which I argued earlier . It was not Marcus life that I found so illuminating , as much as his writings . In his Meditations , he describes the ideals by which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership that most appealed to me , this exploration of guiding principles . Philosophy , particularly Stoic philosophy , gave me the understanding that I needed to construct a concept of ideal leadership . <p> This is not to say I have lived up to it , but through its study , at least I now know toward what I am striving . I understand why St. Peters Basilica stands , and I can use those principles to build my own cathedral . I can build a leadership style that reflects my personality , traits , and abilities , knowing that it is fundamentally strong . The principle that I found in Stoic philosophy , and that I believe is the core of good leadership , is selfless service . <p> The Ideal Leader Is Selfless <p> Duty was everything according to Marcus Aurelius : <p> Let it make no difference to thee whether thou art cold or warm , if thou art doing thy duty ; and whether thou art drowsy or satisfied with sleep ; and whether ill-spoken of or praised ; and whether dying or doing something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Long. , vol. 2 , part 3 , Harvard Classics , 190914 ) . <p> In Marcus philosophy , a leader should never be concerned with rewards or the praise that might come from success . He should concern himself only with doing what is best for the state he serves . This is selflessness . It is the abandonment of ego and pride to the cause that is greater than oneself . In the Navy we are called upon to serve the will of our nation , not ourselves , no matter what is our position . The more we set aside our own pride and ambition in service of that duty , the better we are able to achieve ideal leadership . <p> Alexander the Great was filled with his own ambition and pride , but an ideal leader has only one ambition : to serve his state . The success of the mission is not important as a way to prop oneself up or satisfy ones own vanity . It is important because that is all the ideal leader exists to do . The leader must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful completion of his tasks . The U.S. Navy is itself merely one tool in the hands of the government of the United States of America . How much more must the leaders within that organization see themselves merely as instruments of the U.S. Navy . <p> The ideal leader is willing to sacrifice everything of himself to his mission and to ask nothing in return . Napoleon Bonapartes invasion of Russia , Kara Mustafa Pasas assault on Vienna , and John Miltons fall of Lucifer are all examples of leaders at the height of their power being undone when pride drives them to overreach the limits of their resources for victories that would have been prestigious but of questionable material and strategic value . They did not put the security and prosperity of the state above their own egos , a failure that echoes as loudly through history as any of their achievements . <p> Selfless leaders shape themselves to the demands of the position rather than forcing the system to adjust to their personalities and demands . All traits , abilities , and skills become tools for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ability to know , for any given situation , what is required of them and the individuals they lead in order to accomplish the mission . Great leaders must develop judgment that relies first on information and second on the ability to translate information into action . Battlefield information is very important , but leaders must also have the background knowledge of what to do with that intelligence . They must also understand the motivations of their sailors and servicemen and how to best employ them ; this is another kind of information , and acquiring it takes patience and diligence . Thousands of books , studies , and articles cover a vast field of knowledge applicable to us as U.S. Navy leaders . No one will ever be able to read and store all of this information . But it should be our constant quest to learn more , know more , and better apply that knowledge . Marcus Aurelius would have considered such study part of his duty as emperor . Our duty to our country does not end with our assigned tasks ; we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better serve our country . <p> Heroic models will never go away as a teaching tool . The Navy will never stop trying to define the qualities required to succeed , or figure out better ways to teach , instill , or bring out those qualities . It is our responsibility not just to mimic our predecessors , no matter how successful they were . We must understand the underlying reasons for their success . It is our duty to put aside the personal affinity we might feel toward any of these models and root out the principles on which we must each construct our own identity as leaders . The world could be filled with beautiful copies of St. Peters Basilica , but would n't it be better filled with a thousand unique cathedrals all sharing the same principles of structural integrity ? <p> Lieutenant League serves as the submarine-operations officer for Commander , Destroyer Squadron Seven .

In 1991 the quest led to their hunt for a Soviet spy in the CIA and to their identification of the " mole " as case officer Aldrich " Rick " Ames , a long-time acquaintance and coworker in the Soviet-East European Division and Counterintelligence Center of CIA . That identification allowed the FBI to take the necessary law enforcement steps that led to Ames arrest in February 1994 and , two months later , a conviction and life sentence . One of the most destructive traitors in American history , Ames provided information to the Soviet Union that led to the deaths of at least eight Soviet intelligence officers who spied for the United States . <p> Not only is this the first book to be written by two of the CIA principals involved in identifying Ames as the mole , but it is also the first to provide details of the operational contact with the agents Ames betrayed , as well as similar cases with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories in all .

" Pete " Bucher surrendered his ship , the USS Pueblo ( AGER-2 ) , to North Korean gunboats in 1968 , he became one of the most notorious figures in U.S. Navy history . Bucher gave up his vessel without firing a shot , the first U.S. sea commander to do so since 1807 . Many in the Navys upper echelons regarded him as a coward and a disgrace , shaking their heads in disbelief that he had n't  done more to resist his attackers . " I would have shot the hell out of the North Koreans , " declared retired Vice Admiral William Raborn , echoing the attitude of many old-line officers . " I would have made them pay a high price . " A Navy court of inquiry urged that Bucher be court-martialed , faulting him with almost palpable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try . " 1 <p> But did Bucher , a tough , experienced ex-submarine officer , really do the wrong thing ? <p> An Unlikely Attack <p> At the time of her seizure , the Pueblo , an electronic surveillance ship , was trying to pinpoint the location of military radar and radio stations along North Koreas rugged east coast . The 176-foot vessel was alone , with no U.S. combat jets or ships to protect her . To defend herself , she had only two jam-prone .50-caliber machine guns . She was crewed by 81 officers and enlisted men plus two civilian oceanographers whose presence was intended to reinforce the ships cover story that she was engaged in peaceful scientific research . 2 Though packed with advanced eavesdropping gear , code machines , and classified documents , the Pueblo lacked a rapid-destruction system . Instead , her sailors had only fire axes , sledgehammers , two slow paper shredders , and a small incinerator to use in an emergency . <p> As the Pueblo snooped in international waters near the port of Wonsan on 23 January 1968 , North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faced two Soviet-built SO-1class submarine chasers , armed with 57-mm cannon , and four torpedo boats mounted with machine guns and loaded torpedo tubes . Two MiG fighters zoomed overhead . <p> The Navy had repeatedly assured Bucher that a communist attack on his ship was highly unlikely . He also had been told that if he did come under fire , he was on his own . Shortly before the Pueblo s departure from Yokosuka , Japan , Rear Admiral Frank L. Johnson , who supervised spy-ship expeditions in the region , warned Bucher not to " start a war " by provoking the always touchy North Koreans . 3 <p> The communist flotilla quickly surrounded the Pueblo as she lay dead in the water more than 15 miles off Wonsan . When the North Koreans moved to board the ship , Bucher tried to flee . But the antiquated spy boata converted Army freighter with a poky top speed of 13 knotscouldnt escape her much faster pursuers . The torpedo boats opened fire with machine guns as a sub chaser began pounding the Pueblo with cannon salvos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-secret equipment . A radio operator in Japan held out the possibility that Air Force F-105 fighter-bombers might be on their way to rescue them . <p> With the North Koreans blasting him and his men , Bucher stopped the vessel . The communists then told the U.S. captain to follow them toward Wonsan . Bucher did so , but crawled along at just four knots . When he stopped again , hoping to buy more time for his men to get rid of their secret materials , the gunboats again opened fire with cannon and machine guns . By now Bucher and ten other Americans were wounded , including a young sailor who hemorrhaged to death after a shell nearly severed one of his legs . A party of North Korean soldiers swarmed aboard . Bucher was pistol-whipped , karate-chopped , and kicked to the deck . The rest of the Americans were tied up and blindfolded . With night falling , a North Korean pilot steered the Pueblo to a dock in Wonsan . <p> Heightened Tensions <p> The outrageous attack on an American naval vessel in international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson . With hundreds of U.S. soldiers perishing each month in Vietnam , the last thing Johnson wanted was a second land war in Asia . But with many Americans clamoring for revenge against North Korea , he was under heavy pressure to take some sort of action . <p> Meanwhile , tensions were rising sharply between North and South Korea . Just two days before the Pueblo seizure , North Korean commandos had nearly succeeded in assassinating South Koreas iron-fisted president , Park Chung Hee . Seething with anger and drinking heavily , Park secretly instructed his generals to prepare to march north . 4 Both countries put their militaries on high alert . Terrified South Koreans hoarded rice and swapped their currency for black-market U.S. dollars as rumors of war multiplied . <p> Johnson responded to the ship seizure with a massive buildup of American military power in and around the Sea of Japan , dispatching more than 350 U.S. warplanes and 25 warships led by the carrier USS Enterprise ( CVAN-65 ) . The president also called up 14,000 Air Force and Navy reserviststhe largest mobilization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time , Johnson secretly reached out to North Korea , hoping that closed-door negotiations with the communists would bring a peaceful resolution to the standoff. 5 He privately promised President Park , a close U.S. ally and personal friend , a wealth of new military equipment in exchange for not taking any action that could touch off a second Korean War . <p> Who Was Bucher ? <p> LBJ also wanted to know more about the captain . The president and his advisers knew from the Pueblo s radio transmissions that she had been captured without firing her guns . Why had n't  Bucher fought back ? Had he handed over the spy boat and her valuable equipment to the communists for money ? Had they somehow blackmailed him ? Johnson instructed Defense Secretary Robert McNamara to conduct an in-depth background investigation of the captain . 6 <p> Agents of the Naval Investigative Service soon fanned out in the United States and Japan , where Bucher had been stationed during his submarine days in the early 1960s . The military gumshoes checked his bank records and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " morals . " One officer who had served with Bucher grew so incensed at the intrusive questioning that he threw a punch at his interrogator . <p> Born in Pocatello , Idaho , in 1927 , Bucher had been orphaned as a toddler . A couple that ran a local restaurant adopted him , but his new mother soon died and his father was imprisoned for bootlegging . By age 7 the boy found himself without parents or a home and survived by foraging for food in restaurant trashcans and sleeping in cardboard shelters . Eventually he was arrested for stealing fishhooks from a five-and-dime store and sent to a Catholic childrens home in northern Idaho . At 14 , he moved on to Boys Town , the famed Omaha , Nebraska , refuge for abused and abandoned boys . He played on the football team and served as captain of the schools cadet corps , organized after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . In 1945 , when he was 17 , he enlisted in the Navy , but the war had ended by the time he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bucher later attended the University of Nebraska and married a Missouri farmers pretty daughter . He rejoined the Navy as an officer in 1953 and two years later entered submarine school . In the late 1950s and early 60s he served onboard three subs with the delicate and dangerous task of eavesdropping on Soviet naval activities in the Far East . <p> Perhaps because of his Dickensian childhood , Bucher craved the company of others . He was the life of any party , telling jokes , gulping martinis , and leading everyone in song into the wee hours . Smart and well read , he could converse knowledgably about anything from U.S. naval tactics in Vietnam to Shakespeares sonnets to the ups and downs of the San Diego Chargers . He enjoyed fraternizing with enlisted men and occasionally jumped into a brawl at some wharf-side dive . One longtime friend aptly described him as an " intellectual barbarian . " <p> In the submarine corps he earned good job reviews as well as the respect of many of the men under him . He never realized his dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a list of candidates for 17 available boats . In 1966 the Navy " surfaced " him , putting him in charge of the Pueblo , a balky , World War IIera tub that had been dusted off from the Navys mothball fleet and refitted as a spy platform . <p> The Naval Investigative Service eventually reported that while Bucher had had a few sexual dalliances with Japanese bar girls , there was no evidence he was a traitor . 7 As part of the background probe , the Central Intelligence Agency worked up a psychological profile of Bucher . The CIA shrinks , too , concluded that he was a loyal American . However , they could n't resist pointing out what they evidently regarded as a significant character flaw : the captains " strong inclination to become too involved with his men . " 8 <p> Hellish Imprisonment <p> After mooring the pirated spy ship in Wonsan , the North Koreans paraded Bucher and his men past a screaming , spitting mob of civilians at the dock and threw them into a prison under nightmarish conditions . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and starved . 9 The communists applied horrendous pressure on Bucher in his first hours of captivity , trying to force him to sign a phony confession that he had intruded into their territorial waters for the purpose of espionage . He was beaten , threatened with a firing squad , subjected to a mock execution , and taken to a bleak basement to view an Asian man who had been gruesomely tortured and was barely alive . " Look at his just punishment ! " shrieked a communist translator , claiming the man was a South Korean spy and implying that Bucher was in for the same treatment . The captain bravely refused to sign . He finally caved when the North Koreans threatened to shoot his men , one by one before his eyes , and brought in his youngest sailor , a 19-year-old , as the first victim . <p> Despite such terror , the pain of his wounds , bouts of hepatitis and other illnesses , and the loss of about half of his body weight , Bucher proved a superlative leader in prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and at one point went on a five-day hunger strike to protest the miserable meals of rice , turnips , and chunks of a fish so smelly and disgusting that his men dubbed it " sewer trout . " He urged them to defy their captors in whatever ways they could and often led by example , mocking the prison guards and their rules . When the communists tried to take propaganda photos of them , the sailors raised their middle fingers to ruin the pictures , telling the clueless North Koreans they were displaying the " Hawaiian good luck sign . " <p> Unbeknown to the captives , the Johnson administration was doggedly trying to free them , negotiating privately with the North Koreans at the village of Panmunjom in the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas . For months the communists demanded that the U.S. government sign a false admission that the Pueblo had violated their territorial waters in order to spy and that no such intrusions would occur again . 10 The American position was that the surveillance ship was performing a military mission on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stalemate was broken when the North Koreans unexpectedly accepted a last-ditch U.S. offer to sign a confession only after publicly repudiating it . Bucher and his men finally were released and arrived in San Diego on Christmas Eve 1968 to cheering crowds of well-wishers . <p> Surviving the Court of Inquiry <p> Within weeks , however , the Navy convened a court of inquiry to examine the circumstances that led to the Pueblo disaster . The five admirals on the court heard eight weeks of often emotional testimony in an auditorium at the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado , California . The auditorium was typically crowded with newspaper and television reporters , since the widely publicized sufferings of Bucher and his men had struck a deep chord of sympathy with the American public . The president of the court was Vice Admiral Harold G. Bowen Jr. , the patrician-looking , sharp-witted commander of U.S. antisubmarine warfare forces in the Pacific . <p> After an emaciated Bucher delivered a spellbinding account of the attack on his ship and his travails in prison , a Navy lawyer warned that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which forbade a commander from allowing a foreign power to search his ship or remove any of his sailors " so long as he has the power to resist . " 11 The warning provoked a tornado of protest from newspaper commentators , members of Congress , and ordinary citizens who suspected the Navy was trying to scapegoat Bucher for mistakes made by higher echelons in the planning and execution of the Pueblo s ill-fated mission . Angry letters and telegrams poured into Coronado , including one addressed to " Bowen and his pimps. " 12 <p> Admiral Johnson , Buchers former supervisor , testified about his on-call arrangements with the 7th Fleet and 5th Air Force to rescue the Pueblo in the event of an emergency . But under close questioning by Bowen and his court colleagues , it became clear that no combat ships or aircraft were readily available to deal with an emergency in the Sea of Japan . Most 7th Fleet assets were tied up off Vietnam , and the Air Force , also drained by the war , had few planes ready for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces to deploy if the Pueblo came under attack . <p> The captain also explained his rationale for giving up without a fight . After the communist gunboats surrounded him , he felt completely outgunned and trapped . The Pueblo s two machine guns lacked protective shields , jammed frequently , and were covered by frozen tarpaulins . Bucher believed that any men who went out on deck and tried to uncover , load , and fire them would be quickly cut down by North Korean gunners . When the enemy vessels opened fire , he resisted the urge to shoot back , knowing that the sub chasers 57-mm cannon could chop his boat into splinters from a safe distance . For the same reason he did n't  turn his small arms on the boarding party . <p> Bucher said he decided not to scuttle for fear that the Pueblo would be wallowing without power or maneuverability if the F-105s showed up . ( A dozen jets had been dispatched from distant Okinawa but ordered to stop in South Korea. ) 13 He also thought the communists might have mistaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they realized she was American . This explanation , however , was undercut by Buchers earlier statement that he had hoisted the U.S. colors shortly after the gunboats arrived . <p> The bottom line , the captain testified , was that he did n't  want his men slaughtered in a futile effort to defend their ship . In response to a question from his lawyer , he declared flatly that he lacked the power to resist at the time he halted his boat . The admirals , though , seemed unconvinced . For generations , a banner has hung at the U.S. Naval Academy as an inspiration to midshipmen . It bears the last words of a mortally wounded commander , James Lawrence , during an 1813 battle off Boston Harbor : " Do n't  give up the ship . " In the minds of many naval officers , that brave exhortation carried the gravity and immutability of sacred writ . The Navy is a war-fighting organization , and loss of life is the inevitable byproduct of war . If Navy officers surrendered whenever they felt boxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would fall to pieces . <p> Although one member of the court of inquiry thought Bucher should get a medal for his leadership of his men in prison , the five admirals unanimously recommended in April 1969 that he face a court-martial on five counts , including permitting his ship to be seized while he still had power to resist and failing to destroy his classified materials . 14 <p> A Sympathetic Publics Influence <p> But could Bucher really have fought off the six gunboats and two MiGs that had enveloped him on that wintry day in 1968 ? What were his chances , realistically , of breaking out of such a tactical vise ? If the answer was slim to none , did he have a moral responsibility to surrender without wasting his subordinates lives ? Few would argue that a man with a derringer surrounded by six men with shotguns possesses , in any practical sense , the power to resist . Was there a point at which resistance regardless of the odds becomes an act not of bravery but of recklessness , even idiocy ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans sided with Buchers decision to conserve the lives of his crew . When public-opinion pollsters asked whether the captain " did a disservice to this country in trying to save his own life , " 68 percent of the respondents said no and only 9 percent said yes . <p> Newly appointed Navy Secretary John Chafee had to walk a fine line in his final disposition of the case . A politically savvy former Rhode Island governor , he realized that public and media sympathy precluded a court-martial of Bucher . But the secretary , who had served as a Marine company commander in the Korean War , wanted to pay homage to the brass strong disapproval of Buchers surrender , and he understood the importance of maintaining the dont-give-up-the-ship ethos within the officer corps . <p> Chafee fashioned a shrewd compromise . At a press conference in May 1969 , he revealed his admirals preference for a court-martial , but announced that he was overruling their recommendation . Chafee candidly admitted that mistakes and miscalculations by the Navy had led to what he called the Pueblo s " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus , the consequences of the ships seizure " must in fairness be borne by all , rather than by one or two individuals whom circumstances had placed closer to the crucial event . " Noting that Bucher and his men had endured a great deal of punishment in North Korea , the secretary said theyd face no further disciplinary action by the Navy . " They have suffered enough , " Chafee said as reporters raced for the phones . His decision was widely praised for its wisdom and compassion . <p> An Intelligence Debacle <p> Besides capturing the sailors , the North Koreans seized a host of secret equipment and documents , including key cards used to program code machines and intelligence reports showing how deeply U.S. eavesdroppers had penetrated North Vietnamese antiaircraft defenses . Bucher indicated during the court of inquiry that he never grasped the sheer volume of classified hardware and paper that needed to be destroyed . Its also likely that he did n't  understand the full implications of that material falling into communist hands . But he did know that as more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hed have fewer hands to destroy the secret gear . By running , he hoped to buy more time for the destruction work to proceed . <p> How serious was the intelligence loss from the Pueblo ? According to long-secret National Security Agency damage assessments obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , the capture of the ship and her eavesdropping gear was one of the worst intelligence debacles in U.S. history . 15 Of the 539 classified documents and pieces of equipment onboard the ship , up to 80 percent had been compromised , the NSA reported . Only 5 percent of the electronic gear had been " destroyed beyond repair or usefulness . " NSA officials worried that the North Vietnamese , in particular , might tighten their communications security , making their secret messages harder to crack and putting U.S. servicemen in more jeopardy . <p> But the United States was lucky . NSA analysts concluded in a 1969 report that the North Vietnamese had gained no apparent advantage on the battlefield as a result of the ships commandeered electronics . Nor has any evidence surfaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the Pueblo incident . <p> On balance , Bucher did the right thing in preserving the lives of his men . <p> 1 .

" <p> " Why did you attack Japan in World War II ? " <p> My wife Judy gasped , though I was not totally surprised . We were attending a luncheon in the Shrine of Mito City hosted by World War II Japanese veterans of the 2d Infantry Regiment Association , and in attendance were Japanese historical revisionists as well as those Americans who sought to compromise the B-29 atom bomb exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution 's Air &amp; Space Museum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprepared was posed to me the day before in the auditorium of the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo .

" That day , Mr. Ashiba became my friend . <p> If " like the crack of a bullet by my ear " was an apt metaphor for " Why did you attack us ? " then the question whether " the USA accomplished its goals in World War II as did Japan , " could be likened to the great dismay caused by the large mortar shell dropped among us several hundred yards inland from our Orange Beach landing zone at dusk on D-day of our invasion of Peleliu . Instead of a deadly explosion , green vapor seeped out to envelop us . " Gas ! " yelled a panic-filled voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrieve gas masks , which most of us had discarded to lighten loads . When clearer heads prevailed , the crisis was resolved ; the shell had been a marker signal . Similarly , with a moment to evaluate the question at the symposium , I felt my answer come clear . <p> Those first several days inland from Orange Beach could be described only as the cruelest nightmare . Our men and equipment were becoming casualties at a terrible rate from a nearly invisible enemy who had zeroed-in over previous months on all elements of the island 's terrain . The heat and humidity soared . A dreadful pre-invasion logistical error had caused our supply of drinking water to be pumped into oil-contaminated containers . At times more men were going down from heat exhaustion than gunfire . Those first few nights we expected but did not receive the typical Japanese mass suicidal attacks from unknown numbers of fanatical defenders hiding in coral caves and ridges . <p> Also unknown to us during the first 48 hours of the landings , our northernmost flank was in jeopardy of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled up and overrun . Were it not for the heroic defense from K Company of the 3d Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment at " The Point , " this salient flank cut off from the main body of 1st Marines could have proved disastrous . Though whittled down from 235 to 78 effectives , K Company gave a superb account of itself and held to close ranks , causing an estimated 800 Japanese casualties . <p> My close call with The Fox came along the West Road adjacent to Deadman 's Curve , so named for his lethal marksmanship . He was reputed to have dispatched some 90 1st Marine Division assault troops during the month following our 15 September 1944 initial landings . Even allowing for the exaggeration factor , which so often fills moments of boredom in war , he was an effective killer , and his tools were stealth , patience , and accuracy . This pattern indicated The Fox pulled the trigger to put a bullet through the chest of Colonel Joseph Hankins , the highest ranking Marine to die at Peleliu . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive pre-invasion bombardment from sea and air , though causing few Japanese casualties , it revealed this tiny two-by-six mile island in its naked form unknown previously to our intelligence people .

How prescient was the code name " Stalemate " assigned to this impending military operation . <p> After the beginning of the war , the Japanese high command fortified a honeycomb of natural and artificial caves throughout the island into hidden interconnecting tunnel strongholds .

Casualties for U.S. forces numbered 10,000 , with 2,000 dead . <p> At battle 's end , the Japanese senior officersColonel Nakagawa and Major General K. Murai ( who was serving as an adviser to Nakagawa ) committed seppuku , ceremonial suicide , in their last command post , a large , well-shaped vertical cavity positioned naturally in the China Wall , a limestone-serrated ridge among the Umurbrogol Mountains . Japanese resistance officially ended there on 25 November 1944 with the code message , " Sakura , Sakura " " Cherry , Cherry " meaning , " it has ended here , " sent through the underwater telephone cable to military headquarters at Koror . <p> In U.S. newspapers , the front page articles were of General Douglas MacArthur 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack on Arnhem , Holland , resulting in defeat for trying to take " A Bridge Too Far .

There are memories for a dwindling few . There are artifacts of war overlooked in the past by souvenir and scrap-metal hunters , now protected by the Republic of Palau which has designated Peleliu a historic site and national shrine . There are shrines and mementos to the men of war . And yes , there is much more . <p> For some who served on Peleliu the sorrow of buddies lost and the nightmares weigh too heavily ever to return . For others , the mystique of the place draws them back . And the lure is not limited to age or veterans of Peleliu . <p> Three other veterans , not of Peleliu but Vietnam , wrote to me in 1993 after being attracted by a magazine article I wrote in 1991 describing my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post . They joined me in a three-day expedition to find it . What we found was rampant jungle that seemed bent on covering up the past . <p> One of the veterans , Ed Underwood , is a retired Army major and highly decorated Vietnam veteran currently in civil service as an exercise and training specialist with the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans , Headquarters U.S. Army Pacific . During his combat tours he served as a psychological operations adviser to the Armor School of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam , as an Aero Scout platoon leader , and as a regimental aviation officer with the 11th Cavalry Regiment . <p> Ed 's friend , retired Colonel Lee Harmon , readily joined our search , for he had trudged over the old battlefields of Europe , Asia , and the Pacific and had whetted his intellectual appetite for studying historic war terrain and the tactical maneuvers that occurred there . Like Ed , he was highly decorated for his Vietnam duty .

In the past he had trekked former battle zones of Guadalcanal , Tarawa , Eniwetok , Saipan , and Peleliu alone to come to terms with himself and to ponder whether he could have withstood the horrors of World War II combat . <p> After two sweltering days reconnoitering Wildcat Bowl , Death Valley , and Bloody Nose Ridge , we relocated the actual last Japanese command post at the north end of the China Wall . Behind its jungle cover , Lee identified it first . We found the vertical sub-cave entrances to the command post , living quarters , and the communications center , all with protective snipers ' ports above . The entrance to the living quarters was filled with rubble blasted loose , probably by Army grenades or charges . <p> The place was a time capsule of 1944 ; there was no evidence that anyone had entered it since . Lee found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names on it and placed it in the sniper 's post above the communications cave . <p> Realizing there was yet another mystery to be solved with possible humanitarian implications , Ed and Lee returned to Peleliu and the last command post two months later with a friend , Colonel Ray Barrager . They labored for two days clearing away some of the rock rubble blocking the cave entrance to the living quarters of General Murai and Colonel Nakagawa . They discovered six U.S. Army detonated concussion grenades which had greatly changed the configuration of the chamber . Ed was confident that the human remains they found belonged to Murai and Nakagawa . He then contacted Mr. Bune Fukuchi , Director of the South Pacific Memorial Association of Japan with a detailed message of the discovery and closed with his hopes that this would clarify the ultimate fate of General Murai and Colonel Nakagawa , and their remains could be properly blessed and honored . <p> Appreciation for Ed 's efforts and our discovery swelled among Japanese military and historian circles , and Colonel Nakagawa 's widow expressed her hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheduled there for 15 September 1994 . <p> Judy and I returned to Peleliu for these ceremonies and were met by Ed , Karl , and Ray .

A promising career now seemed open to him when , with true Gallic spirit , he was rash enough to engage in an affair with one of the Bey 's numerous wives . Of course envious tongues were quick to lay the evidence before the master . Yussuf did some rapid thinking .

Did not an American naval hero once make use of a similar knowledge of the British Isles ? <p> Although at first directed toward halting further advance by the Spaniards , the Moorish counterattack soon became a fight against all Christendom rather than against anyone nation . The strategic importance of Barbary sea power as a phase of Ottoman naval policy has not , it seems to me , been given the importance it deserves . The Barbary States undoubtedly contributed to the rise of Turkish power , shared in its zenith and continued the fight , unaided , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaving strategy to wiser heads , let us permit the actors to tell their own story . The star role fell to one of the most picturesque figures in history , Keyr-ed-Din , surnamed Barbarossa , a curious and somewhat mysterious character . His parentage is uncertain . Moslems assert that his father was one of the followers of Mohammed II who settled in Lesbos ; Christians claim that he was the son of a Sicilian renegade ; Brantome assures us that he and his brother Uruj were French-knights who , after serving Venice , turned to Islam as offering better opportunities for promotion . In any event , he was a man of education , courage , and great cunning . His surname Barbarossa has probably nothing to do with the reputed color of his beard but was a corruption of the Arabic words Baba Aroudj , meaning " the elder . " In furtherance of the project to carry the " Holy War " into Africa , Ferdinand the Catholic had occupied Oran , Bougie , and Algiers and had reduced the local rulers to the state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Algerines revolted . They called to their aid Uruj , who had already established his fame as a corsair . Charles V now began a vigorous campaign to recover the lost territory , defeated and killed Uruj , only to find himself opposed by Uruj 's successor , the formidable Barbarossa . In short order Barbarossa established his sway over all of Algeria with the exception of Oran and was confirmed in his tenure by the Sultan . <p> The piratical warfare against all Christendom now began in earnest . The coasts of Spain and The Two Sicilies , as well as the Balearic Isles , were plundered as a mere matter of routine . Occasionally families of " Moriscos , " or Moors held in slavery by the Spaniards , were rescued , for a consideration . An amusing incident occurred on one of those expeditions . Desiring to show his appreciation to the Sultan Soliman for the viceregal honors conferred on him , Barbarossa decided to send a present which " the Magnificent " would surely relish . The present was to be nothing less than Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe , so at least the poets tell us . A sudden nocturnal raid on the lady 's castle at Fondi came perilously near being successful . The lovely duchess had scarcely time to mount her steed and escape with one knight as escort . Unfortunately for the knight , the lady was in decidedly Godiva-like disarray when she took to flight , a fact which tempted the cavalier to indulge in a familiarity for which he afterwards paid with his life . <p> More serious claims to his sovereign 's gratitude awaited Barbarossa . The rough school of sea fighting through which he had passed had made him the ablest commander in the empire . He was now called to the Golden Horn to reorganize the Ottoman navy . " He who rules the sea will shortly rule on land also . " This remark , which might well have emanated from the pen of Mahan , was addressed to the Sultan Soliman by Barbarossa at his first audience . The admiral proceeded to demonstrate it by winning the Battle of Prevesa ( September 28 , 1538 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded by Andrea Doria , himself a sailor of no mean ability . The prize , as ever , was the trade of the Levant , the scene , the old naval dueling ground which had seen the Battle of Actium and was to witness the Battle of Lepanto and , in modern times , the Battle of Navarino . <p> The Battle of Navarino , October , 1827 <p> Among the seventeen captains who had accompanied Barbarossa to Stamboul was a certain Dragut , an Anatolian and one of the few leaders of the Turkish navy not to be born a Christian . His debut in his profession was not fortunate . After some successes as a raider , he was captured by " the Religion , " as the Knights of Malta were then called , and spent the next four years chained to the oars of his own galley . The Grand Master of the order , Jean de la Valette , on inspecting his fleet noticed Dragut in irons on a rowers ' bench . " Usanza de guerra , " said the Master . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The play on words is preserved by the free translation " Chance of war , " " And change of fortune " ; the grim humor lies in the fact that in his youth la Valette had been captured by the Turks and had likewise spent several years on a rowers ' bench . Barbarossa finally ransomed his subordinate who thereupon resumed his campaigns against the hereditary enemy . A cruel and relentless war if ever there was one . Dragut was destined to die in harness , losing his life at the famous siege of Malta in 1565 in which Jean de la Valette immortalized his name and his order . A promontory on the island of Malta perpetuates Dragut 's name . <p> No notion could be more unfair or erroneous than to suppose that in this fight to a finish the Christian powers were any more considerate of their enemy than were the Mohammedans . In 1535 Charles V recaptured Tunis which a few years previously had fallen to Barbarossa . When the city surrendered , over 20,000 men , women , and children were massacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutes " an all time high " and furnished ample provocation for the reprisals which were to follow . It is small wonder that the Jews of Algiers , on seeing Charles ' fleet approach in 1541 , assembled in their synagogues to pray Jehovah for the success of Moslem arms . That prayer was abundantly answered . In spite of the fact that the fleet was commanded by Andrea Doria and the army by the Duke of Alva , the expedition ended in a disastrous failure . With great difficulty did Charles V make good his escape with his shattered forces . <p> The death of Soliman in 1566 marked the zenith of Turkish power . Thoroughly alarmed by the loss of Cyprus in 1571 , Venice , Spain , and the Papal States once more launched an offensive , this time commanded by one of the greatest admirals of history , Don Juan of Austria . But Barbarossa was no more , having died in Stamboul at the ripe old age of 90 . His incompetent successors , although disposing of a superior fleet , went down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ninety-four Turkish vessels were sunk and 130 captured . The Turkish losses have been estimated at 30,000 , besides 15,000 Christian galley slaves liberated . Although mutual jealousies robbed the allies of the full fruits of victory , the spirit of the Turkish navy was definitely broken and Ottoman sea power entered on its decline . <h> III <p> Occupying an unbroken stretch of territory extending from Oran to the Egyptian border , abounding in practically impregnable fortresses , the Barbary States were in an admirable position for a war of commerce destruction . Nothing daunted by the elimination of the Turks as a first-class naval power , they proceeded to carry on the fight with their own resources . That a harassing war is the inevitable recourse of a power whose main fleet can not hold the sea is axiomatic . Such tactics never can win a war but they do furnish an invaluable diversion which can draw the lightning away from the main citadel . To the Barbary navies belongs the distinction of having extracted the maximum of effect such a war can yield and of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in history . It was no idle boast when the Tripolitan Ambassador in London said that " Turkey , Tripoli , Tunis , and Algiers were the sovereigns of the Mediterranean , and that no nation could navigate that sea without a treaty of peace with them .

A typical illustration was that of Duquesne in 1683 when 6,000 shells , the entire supply of the fleet , were fired into Algiers , killing 8,000 persons . The enraged defenders , as a reprisal , took to loading their guns with French subjects , the first victim being the venerable Vicaire Apostolique , Jean Le Vacher . Twenty more such human projectiles were fired . The French fleet withdrew but returned five years later , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-countrymen . In the Musee de la Marine in Paris can be seen the mortar from which the French Consul was propelled ; it is called " La Consulaire . " Obviously France was getting nowhere ; all that was being done was to furnish justification for the subsequent dictum of Thomas Jefferson that naval bombardments were " much like breaking glass windows with guineas . " Remembering the disastrous defeat of Charles V under the walls of Algiers in 1541 , Christian nations hesitated to land armies on African soil , yet in no other way could the menace be effectively disposed of . To be sure the young American Navy accomplished creditable results and achieved undying fame , but by that time Barbary sea power had dwindled in the face of the increased armaments of Europe developed during the Napoleonic Wars . When in 1830 France decided to make an end of Algiers , once and for all , the difficulties to be overcome were military rather than naval . Mutual rivalries prevented any concerted action . Great Britain 's apparent indifference to a situation that was damaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were no Algiers , it would be worth England 's while to build one . " Strangely enough , the British were saying the same thing of the Dutch in the very same words . <p> One of the pressing problems confronting these states was the financial one . The proverbial precariousness of the Ottoman exchequer made help from that quarter out of the question . Consequently , the war must be made to " pay for itself " ; truces could only be granted if paid for . " If I were to make peace with everybody , " said the Dey of Algiers to the American representative , " what would become of my corsairs ? They would take my head off ... not being able to live on their miserable allowance . " Besides fending for themselves financially , they actually contrived to replenish the treasury of the home government . One of the humiliating tasks which fell to Captain Bainbridge , commanding the frigate George Washington , was the carrying of tribute from the Dey of Algiers to the Sublime Porte in 1800 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their archenemy , the Knights of Malta . No matter what truces other powers might make with the Turks , the usual " caravans , " as the Knights ' raiding squadrons were called , must go forth . How else could the order live up to its statutes , the minimum number of " corsos " required of a candidate for the Grand Cross being eight ? The revenue thus collected has been estimated at 125,000 livres annually . Nor were the rights of neutrals any more respected by " the Religion " than by the Arab cruisers . When not at war with the Porte , Venice carried on a thriving trade with the Levantine ports . The galleys of the Knights invariably considered Venetian vessels carrying Turkish merchandise , even though bound for a neutral port , as fair prizes , denying that " the flag covered the cargo . " Sixtus V had to use considerable pressure to compel his belligerent order to observe his decree that such trade was not to be interfered with , and in spite of his orders thirty Maltese privateers operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " farm out " the business to the highest bidder ! One of the reasons which impelled the Turks to undertake the difficult siege of Rhodes in 1523 and that of Malta in 1565 was the hope of ridding themselves of an enemy who , while flying the pious motto " Vias Tuas Domine Demonstm Mihi , " was indulging in precisely the same type of warfare the Barbary states excelled in . No conscientious scruples were allowed to interfere with so lucrative a business . When in 1637 the schismatic German knights offered three galleys to the order , the council ruled that " even when coming from a Protestant or heretical body , this could only redound to the service of God and the exaltation of his Holy Name and to the satisfaction of the Pope and the other Christian princes . " One of the characters of Spanish comedy is a swashbuckling buffoon called " Matamoro , " the " Moor-killer . " Behind the blatant boasts of this extravagant personage lies a tradition nevertheless . Moor-baiting was for centuries an international sport . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disregarding diplomatic niceties , the Barbary rulers put all Christians in the same class . In so doing , however , they failed to recognize the fact that some nations , the Scandinavian countries and ourselves for instance , had no quarrel with them ; an unfortunate blunder which greatly increased their difficulties in the matter of ships ' stores and brought down on their heads the ire of one young nation which at that time had some drastic notions concerning the rights of neutrals . <p> A defense of the methods of the Barbary states is probably impossible . That they championed slavery can possibly be overlooked as many Christian nations were addicted to it . The British and the Popes frequently resorted to the Maltese slave market . Moreover , at that period the distinction between slaves and prisoners of war was very shadowy . To the crime of slavery , however , they added that of white slavery , which to our way of thinking is abhorrent . In their defense it should be said that they were fighting for institutions their religion tolerated . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cortez and Pizarro can hardly point the finger of shame at the Moslem . As a stationary civilization , unable to read the changed spirit of the times , the Barbary States will continue to suffer in the judgment of history . This , however , should not blind us to the courage and resourcefulness they gave proof of in the defense of their faith and culture . <p> The Bombardment of Algiers , 1816 <p> The assistance Barbary sea power had been to Islam is best illustrated by what occurred once that power was broken . For the first time in centuries Christian nations could hear the cries of their coreligionaries suffering under Turkish misrule ; they were no longer drowned out by the wails of Christian captives languishing in African dungeons or groaning in Moorish galleys . The front , which had been fairly stable since the capture of Belgrade by Prince Eugene of Austria in 1688 , now began to crumble . The Greek War of Independence opened the first breach , closely followed by the rise of the Balkan States . Turkish power , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence on the fear Russia 's Panslavic program was causing in European chancelleries , rather than on the strength of its arms . It can not be claimed that the collapse of Barbary sea power was solely responsible for the result . Other powerful forces were at work . The spirit of nationality derived from the Napoleonic Wars and the growing venality and incompetence of the Turkish government would , sooner or later , have brought about the inevitable downfall . It should be borne in mind , however , that coincidences are extremely rare in history , cause and effect are the dominant factors . Viewed from this angle , the synchronization of the two events is rather convincing . <p> The year 1930 witnessed two centenaries in Paris , the centenary of Romanticism and the one hundredth anniversary of the capture of Algiers .

What will the next hundred years of French occupation bring forth ? Is it possible that in the new empire into which Algiers , Tunis , and Morocco are being absorbed a place may be found for the successors of Barbarossa and Dragut ? Will the Italians find in Tripoli the spirit of the men who captured that city from " the Religion " ? To be sure it is a far cry from the xebec with its lateen sails , such as Sert is want to portray in his decorative panels , to a modern submarine . Military equipment is somewhat different from the turbans and scimitars which have inspired many an exotic design by Bahkst .

These include longer deployments with high , unsustainable operational tempo and deployment-to-dwell ratios ; inadequate personnel end strength ; reduced training on board ships that remain at piers and in aircraft increasingly in maintenance depots ; deferred maintenance of equipment and facilities , compounding repair costs and recovery time ; drawn-down spare-parts inventories that affect maintenance ; and overextended service lives of aircraft , ships , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readiness deficit has further damaged the modernization programs of existing warfighting platforms .

Infantilizing young officers does not serve the interests of the Navy or the division well , and chiefs who insist on performing division officer duties allow their primary role to atrophy .

Westmoreland said during an address to the Association of the U.S. Army : <p> On the battlefield of the future , enemy forces will be located , tracked , and targeted almost instantaneously through the use of data-links , computer-assisted intelligence evaluation and automated fire control . . . I see battlefields that are under real or near-real-time surveillance of all types . I see battlefields on which we can destroy anything we locate through instant communications and almost instantaneous application of highly lethal firepower ( Congressional Record , U.S. Senate , 16 October 1969 ) . <p> It is hard to imagine that General Westmoreland would not be pleased with the ability of the United States to conduct Hellfire strikes from unmanned platforms such as the MQ-1 Predator , operating hundreds of miles from a friendly air base while a warfare commander watches the live feed half a world away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of surveying an area for hours before unleashing its lethal munitions is obviously a huge force multiplier . Strategic and ethical concerns aside , the tactical employment of lethal unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) rightly heralded as one of the biggest U.S. military technological innovations of the post-9/11 age . <p> But the Navy , at its core , is not a tactical service . Ships at sea exist at the operational level of war . When it comes to unmanned-systems employment , the service continues to use tactical techniques that have been borrowed and cannibalized from ground employment . So at the operational level , Westmoreland 's vision is far from being realized . As the Navy shifts from tactical to operational-level employment of unmanned systems , it must invest in the tools required to make data generated by these systems timely , relevant , and accessible . <p> UAVs Can Help with the Big-Picture <p> The rapidity with which the Navy has cycled through various unmanned platforms illustrates the services identity crisis regarding how best to use the power of these systems . Scan Eagle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the naval equivalent of the Global Hawk ) , all of these unmanned platforms have uncertain and often unhappy development stories . A major reason for which the Navy continues to struggle in unmanned-systems development is the current disconnect between utilization at the tactical and operational levels : even though the technology and capabilities of unmanned systems have evolved and improved tremendously over the past two decades , our fundamental use and application of the data they produce has not . Developers will , and should , continue to improve the design , range , and payload capabilities of unmanned systems . However , successful employment of these systems over the next decade at the operational level will require a paradigm shift from the tactical employment of single UAVs supporting individual counterterrorism missions to one of multiple systems working in tandem to maintain strategic , real-time , and persistent awareness of a much larger battlespace . General Westmorelands vision was one of localized , tactical battle awareness . If the Navy is to make the next evolutionary leap in unmanned-systems development , it must leverage UAVs to provide awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are significant technological barriers to using UAVs in support of broad-scale surveillance at the operational level of war . These problems do not stem from any deficiencies in the collection capabilities of the current platforms . The newest generations of UAVs , notably the BAMS-D , are optimized to cover long distances for long periods of time . Rather , the deficiencies in operational-level theater awareness are largely due to a lack of available processes and infrastructure to effectively collate and curate the vast amount of content being produced by the dozens of disparate unmanned systems currently being deployed in support of localized tactical missions . <p> Each UAV feed is just one stream of data flowing into a command center . Building a real-time strategic picture requires merging this stream quickly and efficiently into the overall operational picture . Unfortunately , as the structures now stand , this requires too much manpower and bandwidth to be practical . Therefore , when looking for avenues to invest in the future of unmanned systems , the focus should be placed on developing new and more robust data-management systems and unmanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually be able to realize General Westmorelands vision of " computer-assisted intelligence evaluation " and thereby utilize our unmanned systems to their fullest potential . <p> Lessons from the Commercial Sector <p> To better understand which avenues of development should be pursued in future research and development ( R&amp;D ) , it is helpful to examine the current process of employing UAVs to support naval operations . In order for the information derived from a UAVs operations to be exploited and disseminated quickly , it first must be converted , analyzed , and then presented in a format that a commander can actually use ( on a bandwidth-constrained naval ship , sending raw video format is often out of the question , and raw video provides no value to a commander or other decision maker ) . This conversion and analysis is a tedious , time-consuming task . Imagine that during a 14-hour mission , a BAMS-D vehicle spends six hours over a target harbor . During this period , it detects one possible fast-attack craft departing the harbor and nothing else of interest . Nevertheless , to glean this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit through 14 hours of video for those 10 minutes of action . The analyst will then post his report on a website . This report is , in turn , downloaded by the carriers analysts , and more than likely disregarded . <p> Furthermore , nowhere is the data stored as part of a longer-term trend analysis effort , or in a database that can be queried by operators and analysts alike . The reality is that while a massive amount of data is generated by unmanned systems , there is actually very little operational benefit gained , even at the tactical level , and certainly not at the theater commander level . The operational value of the BAMS-D flight information in enhancing the commanders battlespace awareness is further degraded by the fact that at best , the information is half a day old when the theater commander receives even the first chop of the reportwhich , in a combat environment , is more than likely too late . <p> This is why unmanned-systems development in the next decade should focus on the ability to automate video and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than on simply improving the capabilities of the collecting platforms themselves . However , there is no need to start the R&amp;D from scratch . In fact , recent developments in knowledge management and data-discovery technologies in the commercial sector offer two ways that could be adapted ( relatively ) easily to improve todays inefficient process of exploiting and fusing the unmanned systems contribution to the strategic picture . <p> First , technology that can automatically analyze image files in order to identify objects and activities already exists in the form of Facebooks facial-recognition software . Once it scans a face , it is capable of recognizing that face in future images . Similarly , video-scanning software could allow analysts to " teach " the software the type of ships being sought so that when a UAV spotted those vessels , it could immediately alert the analyst . This would save analysts time and , once the technology reached a certain level of maturity , it could possibly replace preliminary human analysis of video feeds altogether . <p> Make Intelligence Accessible <p> Another challenge is how ensure that finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future analysts and theater commanders . In addition to requiring updates on the current disposition of hostile units , the warfare commander is likely going to be interested in their historical disposition in order to gain a deeper understanding of normal operating patterns . Such background makes it easier to identify what type of behavior is out of the ordinary and , if not dangerous , at least interesting and worthy of further scrutiny . <p> Historical analysis , developing a baseline of knowledge about the adversarys activity , is now almost entirely a function of human analysts . Again , in this regard the Navy today is a long way from General Westmorelands vision of computer-assisted intelligence evaluation . For example , once the BAMS-D report described earlier reaches the carrier , it will be read by a dozen analysts and watchstanders as part of their daily digest of information , just one more drop in the ocean of knowledge . Over time these people , supported by the information gleaned from BAMS-D missions , may develop an understanding of how often fast-attack craft operate from that particular port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanders battlespace awareness . A large increase in the number of craft operating from that base may spell danger for the carrier , and if the analysts have built up a baseline , they can understand and report that fact to the commander . However , this method relies on human entry and indexingand in todays manpower- and funding-strapped Navy , accurate data entry , especially in the intelligence fields , tends to fall by the wayside . <p> There is a better way , one that uses existing commercial technology to augment human analysis and indexing . Ultimately all the raw video and collection data generated from the BAMS-D flights is stored somewhere , on a website or in a database . By running automated data-discovery software on this repository , commanders could accurately index all activity collected during UAV flights , both past and present . The commander could then easily query this indexed data to gain critical information at a moments notice . For example , an analyst could run a query against the database to learn what type of activity had occurred at a port over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a simple concept , and using databases to support decision making is nothing new . Its the speed and thoroughness of indexing and data analysis that needs to change , and , more important , the data needs to be made more accessible to a broader audience . Getting information from military databases today often requires human analysts to input a complex set of search queries , typically involving long strings of Boolean logic . There are several data-discovery tools available that would negate the need for complex queries . They would enable a commander to ask questions of the database in everyday language , letting automated data-discovery tools provide the answers . In the same way we ask the iPhones electronic assistant Siri where the nearest restaurant is , analysts and theater commanders need to be able to ask in plain English important analytical questions about current and historical activity . <p> Watson Never Forgets <p> The highest-profile data discovery and analysis support tool of this kind is IBMs Watson , which in 2011 made waves in artificial intelligence and data-discovery circles by beating the all-time Jeopardy champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson can answer questions posed in natural language by scanning unstructured and structured data sets . It then processes this data through semantic algorithms , creating an understanding of the relationships between different pieces of data . These algorithms allow Watson to relate a certain time ( say 1630 ) and date ( 2 August 2012 ) to the departure of a number of fast-attack craft ( five ) from a port of interest ( port X ) the same information that a human analyst would glean from the same report . The difference is that Watson can process 500 gigabytes , the equivalent of a million books , per second . And Watson never forgets anything . <p> Watson differs from human analysts in another crucial respect . During the aforementioned Jeopardy match , it rang in with its ( usually correct ) answer and degree of certainty . It did not ring in if that degree fell below a threshold ; Watson only answered if it were , say , 80 percent certain of the answer based on available information . While human analysts may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems unlikely they could say with a straight face that it was 86.75 based on available information . <p> It is also important to highlight the fact that as a system capable of understanding natural language , no special programming skill is required to use Watson . Imagine a team of analysts at the Office of Naval Intelligence who did nothing all day but feed a Watson mainframe the latest UAV reports . That mainframe would then be accessible to all commanders via a website on the SIPRNet ; it would crunch all the data and deliver answers immediately , much as Googles servers do now . Every aircraft carrier would not need its own mainframe . Analysts could ask Watson " when is the last time a submarine left port X " and begin their research based on the answer , as opposed to picking through months of reports one by one . <p> The next ten years will witness huge advances in unmanned system technologies . Sensors will become more accurate and be able to collect against targets at longer ranges . A combination of improved battery technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give UAVs the ability to operate over longer distances and remain on station for longer . Unmanned systems will gain in lethality as weapon systems continue to improve . " Swarm " algorithms will allow unmanned systems to calculate the optimum way to engage an enemy and perhaps even conduct an attack autonomously . <p> However , these advances alone do not mean unmanned systems will enhance the warfare commanders understanding and mastery of the battlespace , particularly at the operational and strategic levels . To ensure that future unmanned systems are utilized to their utmost , we must upgrade our capacity to ingest , process , and disseminate the information they produce . <p> Perhaps the greatest barriers to adopting unmanned analysis programs Fleet-wide will be cultural . The switch from paper to digital charts a decade ago caused an uproar that still echoes today ; it will likely be a while before a theater commander instinctively trusts an automated data-discovery program that gives him a statistically probable but counterintuitive answer that runs against his gut instinct and operational experience . Still , given the expanded analytical capability offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that unmanned machines have as much to offer us in terms of enhancing our cognition as they do in enhancing our eyes and ears . <p> Ensign Halton serves as the intelligence officer for VFA-41 and is stationed at Lemoore Naval Air Station , California .

The action of a recent Commandant of Midshipmen , however , officially acknowledges that Jones had nothing to do with this 100-year-old mantra . <p> In 1986 naval historian James C. Bradford carefully constructed a case proving that Augustus C. Buell ( 1847-1904 ) was a fabricator . " Qualifications of a Naval Officer , " long memorized by all midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy , was not written by John Paul Jones , as first cited by Buell in his 1900 two-volume Paul Jones : Founder of the American Navy . 1 Rather , Bradford convincingly argued in a 33-page pamphlet published by the Naval Historical Foundation that the popular biographer had rewritten some of Jones 's letters and created other documents to offer turn-of-the-century naval officers a model of modern professionalism. 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradford 's pamphlet , " The Reincarnation of John Paul Jones , " and subsequent scholarly treatments of the naval hero lamented that Buell 's fabrication continued to be taught to plebes every summer through the student handbook , Reef Points . But the Academy did not accurately attribute the quotation until 2003 . After a memo brought the issue to his attention , then-Commandant of Midshipmen Marine Corps Colonel John Allen considered the need for historical accuracy while also recognizing the positive impact the forged texts traditionally had played in the education of naval officers . 3 The colonel 's prudent solution was to retain the quote in the 98th edition of Reef Points while changing its attribution to read as follows : " Written by Augustus C. Buell in 1900 to reflect his views of John Paul Jones . " Directly following this ascription are four authentic quotations by the Revolutionary War hero that now-Brigadier General Allen hopes will in time replace the forgery . 4 <p> Whether this will end the controversy is debatable . Corporate memory is notoriously short , and heritage ( or " collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution are known to scholars ) , once incorporated , is very difficult if not impossible to alter . Unless serious discussion accompanies the recent changes in Reef Points , Buell 's fabrication likely will be reinstated at some later date . Past attempts by Academy officials to remove " Qualifications " from the curriculum failed when subsequent administrations , enamored by its effectiveness in building group cohesion , re-instituted the much beloved prose . <p> Except for the original fabricator , Augustus C. Buell , this story has no villains . Naval Academy officials who maintained the fabrication over the years as well as critics who periodically called attention to its fictitious nature all did so in the best interest of the Navy and its midshipmen . <p> Despite the fact that journalists and academics immediately embraced De Koven 's charges , the John Paul Jones title as Father of the Navy persisted in the popular imagination . The New York Times had congratulated De Koven for her dispassionate research , which had " completely disposed of the pretensions of the late Augustus C. Buell as a serious historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Historical Association , declared in 1909 that no other " bold and creative act of imagination . . . in American history surpasses Buell 's recent John Paul Jones . " 16 In the following years , respected scholars such as Lincoln Lorenz and Samuel Eliot Morison also warned readers of Buell 's unreliability . 17 Less careful biographers , however , such as Mary Mac Dermot Crawford , Valentine Thomson , and Phillips Russell , promulgated the myth by citing the fraudulent historian in support of their own glorifications of the nation 's naval past . 18 In 1956 , hoping to bury Buell forever , Milton W. Hamilton , a member of the Division of Archives and History in Albany , New York , systematically reviewed all of Buell 's scholarshipbiographies of Andrew Jackson , Sir William Johnson , William Penn , and even his much-cited Civil War memoirsand concluded that the bulk of the materials were " ' pure Buell ' legendary , garbled , or fiction .

The Confederacy began the war without a single warship to its name . <p> The imminent Italian historian Raimondo Luraghi argued in his books The Plantation South and A History of the Confederate Navy that to win , the Confederacy had to industrialize , which it was able to do . Industrialization allowed the South to take advantage of , as well as contribute to , revolutionary changes that were occurring in naval warfare . The Confederacy would combat test mines ( torpedoes ) , submarines , semi-submersibles ( Davids ) , and rifled cannon ( Brooke guns ) during the war . But the modern weapon in which the C.S. Navy initially placed its greatest faith was the armored ship , and by wars end it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ironclads . <p> The Confederate ironclads were neither the first commissioned , the first in battle , nor the most advanced . The concept of iron-armored ships was well known by naval officials . French ironclad floating batteries had engaged Russian shore batteries during the Crimean War . And both Great Britain and France had commissioned powerful armored warships by the time the American Civil War broke out . <p> Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen Mallory , aware of the Souths deficiencies in warship construction , attempted to obtain armored vessels in Europe . Despite efforts by various naval agents , only onethe Stonewall reached Confederate hands , but the war ended before she saw any action . <p> Mallory had considerably more success in building ironclad warships within the Confederacy . In the summer of 1861 he accepted plans to convert the sunken Union warship Merrimack into an ironclad and contracted for an additional four Mississippi River armored ships to be constructed by private builders . <h> The First Five <p> The Merrimack , a wooden screw frigate scuttled just before Confederates seized the Gosport Navy Yard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armored ship under the direction of John Porter , future chief naval constructor , and Lieutenant John M. Brooke , future head of the Bureau of Ordnance and Hydrography . Commissioned the CSS Virginia , the 262-foot vessel was constructed with an armored casemate inclined on the sides and whose ends were horizontally rounded . The rounded ends along with the bow and stern of the hull being submerged were unique ; no other Confederate ironclad would incorporate these features . Sallying forth into Hampton Roads on 8 March 1862 to attack the blockading Union squadron , she destroyed the wooden frigate Congress and sloop-of-war Cumberland . <p> What has rightly been called one of the most important naval engagements in American history occurred the following day . Two iron-armored warships , the Monitor and the Virginia , met in combat , the first such battle in history . Tactically it was a draw ; strategically it was a Union victory as the blockading fleet was not destroyed or forced to leave Hampton Roads , and the Confederate ironclad was unable to renew the action . The Virginia would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days after Confederate forces evacuated Norfolk , but her success in battle was a major factor in persuading the Confederate government to build an ironclad navy . <p> The four ironclads built under private contract were constructed on the Mississippi Rivertwo in Memphis , Tennessee , to be named the Arkansas and Tennessee , and two in New Orleans , the Mississippi and Louisiana . The five initial ironclads ( including the Virginia ) were to be capable of operating on the high seas , not only hopefully to lift the Union blockade , but as Secretary Mallory wrote , to " traverse the entire coast of the United States . . . and encounter , with a fair prospect of success , their entire Navy . " In other words , Mallorys initial ironclad strategy was offensive in nature . It was also a failure . <p> The Mississippi River ironclads were contracted for and constructed by individuals inexperienced in building warships . The Memphis armored vessels casemates had perpendicular sides rather than slanted , in contrast to the majority of Confederate ironclads . The New Orleans armored ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one abaft the other , were unworkable . The Mississippi was built along straight linesno curved hull frames , as the two brothers who designed her believed their concept was simple enough that construction would not require skilled ship carpenters . She was to be quite large , approximately 250 feet in length ; to carry some 20 guns ; and to be propelled by 3 engines , 16 boilers , and 3 screws . <p> The unfinished Louisiana was towed below New Orleans to Fort St. Philip and used as a floating battery against Flag Officer David Glasgow Farraguts squadron as it steamed past the fort on 24 April 1862 . Shortly thereafter her crew destroyed her . The Mississippi was launched , although still under construction , and set afire as the Union squadron approached New Orleans on the 25th . Charles Dufour , in The Night the War Was Lost , suggests that if these two warships had become operational , New Orleans and perhaps the Confederacy would have been saved . This is most improbable for various reasons , including the vessels serious defects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched ; the other , the Tennessee , was destroyed on the stocks with the approach from upriver of Union Flag Officer Charles Davis Western Flotilla in June . The Arkansas was towed down the Mississippi and up the Yazoo River to Yazoo City , Mississippi , where she was completed . <p> In July 1862 one of the most epic naval engagements of the Civil War took place when the 165-foot ship , clad with railroad T-rails , steamed down the Yazoo , running the Union ironclad Carondelet aground and chasing two wooden gunboats out into the Mississippi . Entering the river , the Arkansas then ran through Farragut and Davis anchored warships , firing as she went , before reaching Vicksburg . Later that day Farragut attempted and failed to destroy the Confederate ironclad with his oceangoing vessels as they steamed downriver past the fortified city . Weeks later the Arkansas would cooperate in a combined operation against Baton Rouge , Louisiana , but engine failure resulted in her being set afire and destroyed by her crew . <h> A Quartet of Conversions <p> Before any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels were being constructed by private builders and even state governments . The ironclad ram Manassas was converted from a tug , her masts and superstructure replaced with a lightly armored convex shield , or casemate . Armed with a single gun , she participated in the battle with Farraguts squadron below New Orleans , where she ran aground and was destroyed . <p> The Eastport , another conversion , was seized by Union forces in February 1862 while under construction on the Tennessee River . Financed by the Alabama legislature , the Baltic was converted from a lighter in Mobile . According to one of her officers , she was as " rotten as a mud scow " and worthless as a warship . The vessel was scrapped in 1864 and her armor used on the CSS Nashville . <p> The Atlanta was potentially the most impressive of the conversions . She was transformed in Savannah , Georgia , from the British-built blockade-runner Fingal into what was probably the most powerful armored warship built in the Confederacy . The only iron-hulled Confederate ironclad , the Atlanta was well armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 16-foot draft was the 204-foot warships major defect , and during a June 1863 engagement she ran aground at the mouth of the Wilmington River east of Savannah and was damaged by gunfire from the U.S. Passaic -class monitor Weehawken . Captured , she was later commissioned in the U.S. Navy and served in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron . <h> Armored Harbor-Defense Vessels <p> In 1862 the Confederate Navy changed its shipbuilding policy from one that stressed offensive warships to one that emphasized defensive ones . Various factors contributed to this change : the failure of the five initial ironclads , the belief that powerful armored vessels could be obtained in Europe , and most important , the growing threat of invasion . Until the end of the war the Confederate naval construction program would generally concentrate on small , shallow-draft , harbor-defense armored ships . <p> Chief Naval Constructor Porter developed basic designs for these ironclads , and in doing so probably took into account that Southern shipwrights had considerable experience building steamboats . Like those paddle-wheelers that plied the shallow waters of the Southern states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or no keel ) . However , the ironclads , unlike steamboats , carried their machinery within their hulls . <p> Other than the fact that they all included an armored casemate , generalizing about these vessels is nearly impossible . They were to be sheathed with four-inch double-layer ( laminated ) iron plate , but their armor actually varied from two to eight inches thick . While the original plan called for a 150-foot hull , the ironclads ended up ranging from the 139-foot Albemarle and Neuse to the 310-foot Nashville . <p> The length of the casemate varied depending on the size of the vessel , but Porter designed the shields on all of them to be smaller than the initial ironclads . A shortage of iron and the problem of draft were at least partially responsible for this . The ironclads were to carry a battery of two to six heavy guns , but again the number varied depending on what was available as well as the size of the casemate . Some of these ironclads were even armed with spar torpedoes . <p> The Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rams on a majority of the ironclads . The remaining vessels were self-propelled floating batteries . The ironclads power trains also depended on what was available . The majority were single or double screw , but a few were designed to carry paddle wheels . The Nashville , built at Montgomery , Alabama , was the only side-wheeler that became operational . The Missouri , constructed at Shreveport , Louisiana , incorporated a wheel recessed in the after end of the casemate . <p> The marine engineering industry was by far the most backward aspect of the Confederate shipbuilding program . Rebel ironclad machinery , particularly engines , was primitive . Only a few of the armored ships had steam engines designed and built specifically for them ; the majority were adapted from other vessels , such as steamboats and towboats . At least one , the Neuse , possibly was powered by a sawmill engine . <h> Virginia and North Carolina Ironclads <p> Of the approximately 50 ironclads laid down in the Confederacy , 20 of them incorporated Porters harbor-defense designs . The 150-foot Richmond was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norfolk . Advancing Union forces led to the vessel being hastily launched and towed up the James River to Richmond , where she was completed . The Richmond became the nucleus of the James River Squadron , which cooperated with the batteries at Drewrys Bluff to defend the river approach to the Confederate capital . In 1864 two additional ironclads , the Virginia II and Fredericksburg , were commissioned and joined the squadron . They had been built at the Richmond shipyards , where a fourth ironclad , the Texas , was under construction when the war ended . <p> The James River Squadron , with its ironclads and wooden gunboats , contributed significantly to the capitals defense and was one of the Confederate Navys most powerful squadrons . Beginning in 1864 , it often exchanged fire with enemy warships below obstructions Union forces had placed in the river . In January 1865 the squadron attempted but failed to pass through the obstructions and attack the Union naval force below . When Richmond was abandoned in early April , the squadrons vessels were destroyed . <p> Four ironclads were built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Neuse River , and one on the Roanoke River . The North Carolina and Raleigh were both of the 150-foot class , built in shipyards on opposite sides of the Cape Fear River , and commissioned in the spring of 1864 . The North Carolina , which was employed primarily as a floating battery close to the rivers mouth , sank at her moorings on 27 September as a result of a worm-eaten bottom . In May 1864 , the Raleigh , accompanied by two wooden gunboats , crossed the bar at the rivers mouth and , after exchanging fire with Union blockaders , fatally ran aground while attempting to re-enter the river . <p> Considering Wilmingtons importance as a major blockade-running port , it is surprising that these two ships were the most defective and decrepit of the harbor-defense ironclads . The master builders of both vessels had extensive experience in constructing vessels . The ironclad Wilmington was still under construction when her builders destroyed her in January 1865 shortly before Union forces captured the port . Approximately 240 feet long and with two small octagonal-shaped casemates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs . <p> The Neuse and Albemarle , built on the Neuse and Roanoke Rivers , respectively , were smaller versions of the 150-foot ironclads . They , along with a third vessel of this class that was never completed , were designed to operate jointly in regaining control of the North Carolina coastal regions shoal sounds and rivers . Along with other interior naval construction sites throughout the South , their shipyards were established because Federal forces had either gained control of coastal areas or were blockading outlets to the sea . They were temporary , primitive facilities on waterways considered deep enough to launch a vessel . <p> The Neuse was constructed at White Hall ( present-day Seven Springs ) about halfway between Kinston and Goldsboro . The site was selected because Union forces had seized New Bern , the most important shipbuilding center on the Neuse River . Also , it was considered safe from enemy threats , timber was available there , and perhaps most important , the location had access to a railroad with links to machinery and iron-plate facilities . Because of the shallowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched , the uncompleted gunboat had to be towed downstream to Kinston , where she was completed and commissioned . Unfortunately , the ironclad ran aground about a half mile from her anchorage in April 1864 while attempting to steam downriver and join in an attack on New Bern . Nearly a year later , she was destroyed to prevent her capture . <p> The Neuse s sister ship , meanwhile , was one of the more successful Confederate armored vessels in combat with Union naval forces . The Albemarle was placed under construction in 1863 at Edwards Ferry . Fear of an attack from Union forces in the Roanoke Valley prompted authorities to move her farther up the Roanoke River to Halifax . There the unfinished gunboat was close to the Wilmington &amp; Weldon Railroad . <p> In the spring of 1864 , the ironclads captain , Commander James W. Cooke , received orders to cooperate with Brigadier General Robert Hokes attack against Union forces at Plymouth , North Carolina . Workers were still on board the ship when she set off down the Roanoke on 17 April . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Union gunboat , the Southfield , and forced three others to retreat to Albemarle Sound . The next month , the Albemarle attacked a Union flotilla on the sound , mauling the double-ender gunboat Sassacus . Damaged herself , the ironclad retired to Plymouth for repairs . The Albemarle was at her berth when in the early hours of 28 October a steam launch under the command of Lieutenant William B. Cushing torpedoed and sank her ( see " Firebrand of the Union Navy , " October 2012 ) . <h> Defending South Carolina and Savannah <p> Charleston , South Carolina , where the first shots of the Civil War were fired , witnessed a coordinated attack by Confederate ironclads against Union blockaders . The 150-foot Chicora and Palmetto State were commissioned in the fall of 1862 . In the early hours of 31 January 1863 , at the urging of local commander General P. G. T. Beauregard , the two armored vessels crossed the bar at Charleston Harbors entrance and in a night action attacked nearby enemy warships . <p> The Palmetto State rammed the Mercedita , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not sink , and after the ironclads moved on to other targets and her crew made emergency repairs , the injured ship escaped . The Chicora meanwhile engaged a second blockader , the Keystone State . One Confederate shell burst her boilers , while others exploded on her deck or crashed through her hull before she limped out of the fight . The ironclads next bloodied the Quaker City and exchanged fire with three other gunboats before retiring back into the harbor . <p> The blockade was temporarily broken . But with the arrival off Charleston of the armored ship New Ironsides and several monitors , it was quickly back in stronger force than before , and the Confederate ironclads reverted to their more realistic role of harbor defense . <p> Two additional armored warships were commissioned in the South Carolina port : the Charleston and Columbia , both larger and more powerful than the Chicora and Palmetto State . The four alternated guarding the channels between the harbors forts . But the Columbia ran aground in January 1865 , to be later salvaged by the U.S. Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Confederate forces evacuated Charleston . Self-destruction was also the fate of Confederate ironclads defending Savannah , Georgia . <p> That ports importance led to Union naval forces blockading it early in the war . For more than a year after secession , wooden Confederate gunboats defended the river approaches to the city . In the fall of 1862 , the C.S. Navy commissioned two ironclads : the converted Atlanta and the self-propelled floating battery Georgia ( see " Naval History News " ) . The latter was apparently designed by a local foundryman with no experience in naval architecture . Although the Georgia theoretically was steam powered , in reality she had to be towed to defensive positions several miles below the city . One additional ironclad , the 180-foot Savannah , was added to the local squadron in 1863 . The Milledgeville , a twin-screw ironclad , was launched in 1864 but never completed . Another armored ship was on the stocks in late 1864 . With Shermans approach that December , Savannahs wooden gunboats escaped upriver , but the ironclads were destroyed by their crews and workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans , Confederate defenses along the Gulf Coast included one ironclad built at Columbus , Georgia , and several others to protect the important port of Mobile , Alabama . Columbus , on the Chattahoochee River , was the location of both a naval yard and the Columbus Naval Works , which became one of the most important industrial facilities in the Confederacy . Machinery for a number of the Southern naval vessels , including ironclads , was manufactured there . <p> The river port was the site for the construction of the ironclad Jackson , originally named the Muscogee . Porter designed the vessel to carry a centerboard paddle wheel , but when efforts to float her failed she was redesigned and completely rebuilt ; her hull was lengthened to 225 feet and a new power plant featuring twin screws installed . Near the wars end , Confederates destroyed the still-unfinished Jackson to prevent her capture . <p> Several others ironclads of the Jackson s original design were planned , but only one , the Missouri , was actually constructed . Commissioned in 1863 , she was 183 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than likely because of her 22-foot recessed wheel . Built far up the Red River at Shreveport , Louisiana , she never saw action and surrendered on 3 June 1865 . <p> After the fall of New Orleans , Mobile became the most important Confederate port on the Gulf . The naval force there included several armored vessels . Four were built along the Alabama River : three at Selma and one at Montgomery . Others were laid down at Oven Bluff , on the Tombigbee River , but never completed . Franklin Buchanan commanded the Mobile naval defenses . Wounded as he led the Virginia in her engagement with the Cumberland and Congress , he was promoted to rear admiral and ordered to Mobile . Two Confederate forts guarded Mobile Bays mouth , some 30 miles south of the port itself . <p> In 1864 Buchanan on paper had an impressive squadron of four ironclads in addition to wooden gunboats . But the Nashville was weak because of her slow speed , exposed paddle wheels , and inadequate armor , and the floating batteries Tuscaloosa and Huntsville were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee , one of the Selma ironclads , capable of challenging Rear Admiral David Farraguts monitors and wooden gunboats . But she proved no match for the Union squadron when it passed the forts and entered the bay on 5 August 1864 . The Confederate ironclad was battered into surrendering . Mobiles three remaining armored vessels would intermittently engage Union warships and ground forces until the city surrendered on 10 April 1865 . They were then scuttled . <h> Flawed But Significant Warships <p> Confederate ironclads , perhaps with the exception of the European-built Stonewall , were not things of beauty . In many ways they were rather primitive men-of-war with serious defects in design and construction . Most of them , however , were serviceable and contributed significantly to the Confederate war effort . Moreover , they had some notable successes in defending Southern rivers and harbors . <p> Of the five Confederate seaports captured during the last six months of the warSavannah , Charleston , Wilmington , Mobile , and Galvestontwo were taken by Union land forces from the rear and two others indirectly as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses of all of the ports but one , Galveston .

L. Hunley and the USS Thresher to inform its approach toward safety . <p> On 11 April 2014 , the U.S. Submarine Force marked its 114th birthday , celebrating its rich history of tradition and success . But just one day earlier , it observed a more somber milestone : the 51st commemoration of its worst non-combat loss , the sinking of the USS Thresher ( SSN-593 ) . Reflecting on this tragedy reminds us of a formative truth : The U.S. Submarine Force operates incredibly complex machines in hazardous and unforgiving environments for extended periods of time , and the U.S. Navys all-volunteer submariners put themselves in harms way every time they take their boats to sea . <p> To ensure the safety of our sailors , the Submarine Force offers a premier safety effort based on three programs : the Quality Assurance Submarine Safety program ( SUBSAFE ) , the Deep Submergence Systems Scope of Certification ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . Although all of them came into being within the past 50 years , the disasters they seek to prevent have been present since the earliest days of operations beneath the surface . <h> The Need for Safety Programs <p> On 9 April 1963 , the USS Thresher was nearing the end of her post-shakedown availability when she left Portsmouth Naval Shipyard to conduct sea trials . At approximately 0949 , she rendezvoused with her escort , the USS Skylark ( ARS-20 ) , a Penguin -class submarine-rescue ship . After completing a shallow dive , the two vessels transited independently during the night to a second rendezvous point . During the transit the Thresher conducted test evolutions , surfaced , submerged , and exercised the propulsion plant at full power . <p> On the morning of 10 April , the ships met to conduct a depth test . At approximately 0747 , the Thresher commenced a deep dive . At approximately 0913 she reported , " Experiencing minor difficulties have positive up angle . Am attempting to blow . Will keep you informed . " At approximately 0916 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words " . . . test depth " and at 0917 , another garbled transmission containing the words " . . . nine hundred North " was reported . At 0918 , a high-energy , low-frequency noise disturbance was observed . The water depth in the area of operations is about 8,500 feet . The Thresher , along with 129 souls , was lost that day . <p> After the incident , a court of inquiry and the Joint Congressional Committee on Atomic Energy hearings concluded that a flooding casualty in the engine room , resulting from a piping failure in one of the sea-water systems , was the most probable cause . On 3 June 1963 , the SUBSAFE program was established within the Bureau of Ships to develop the Submarine Safety Certification Criterion , outlining the minimum actions required to provide a satisfactory level of confidence in the integrity of submarine systems and the adequacy of certain depth-control capabilities . The first effort to apply additional rigor in design , manufacturing , operation , and maintenance to a subset of critical systems within the nuclear submarine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hull integrity to preclude flooding , and the operability and integrity of critical systems and components to control and recover from a flooding casualty , should one occur . The Bureau of Ships issued a certification criterion addressing design , material , fabrication , testing , and record keeping on 20 December 1963 . <p> Over the next ten years , changes and improvements to the original criteria were established , and the " Submarine Material Certification Requirements Manual for the Submarine Safety Program " was issued in 1974 . During this time , the Bureau of Ships evolved into the Naval Ship Systems Command and ultimately the Naval Sea Systems Command . The latter continues to review and update the administrative and technical requirements of the SUBSAFE program . <p> The second foundation of submarine safety , the DSS-SOC program , had its watershed event in 1982 . Five divers lost their lives when a vacuum was inadvertently drawn in a lock-out chamber on the USS Grayback ( SS-574 ) , leading to increased requirements for deep-submergence systems design , construction , maintenance , and operation . DSS-SOC efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or procedural failure will not imperil personnel by focusing on the operability and integrity of critical systems , components , maintenance , and operational procedures . In assessing the risks to operator and occupant safety , DSS-SOC considers hazards such as breathing gases , material off-gas toxicity , flammability , implodability , explodability , electrical hazards , and procedures . <p> The third foundation of submarine safety , the Fly-By-Wire Ship Control Systems program , was designed and executed to provide maximum reasonable assurance that the fly-by-wire ship control system in a submarine will not cause a casualty or prevent ship recovery from flooding or a control-surface jam casualty . Instituted with the initial introduction of limited electronic fly-by-wire systems for ship control on Seawolf -class submarines , the program expanded with a much greater capability on the Virginia -class . Fortunately , this system was not the result of a tragic event . Navy engineers recognized the risk similarities between submarine fly-by-wire control systems and commercial and military aviation systems and implemented the program proactively . <p> While the Thresher s loss is the pinnacle event that led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our work . Submarine casualties are a rarity in modern times , but this was not always the case . From 1915 to early 1963 , the Navy lost 16 submarines in non-combat related incidentsan average of one submarine lost every three years . All together , these accidents took the lives of 454 submariners . <h> Lessons from the H. L. Hunley <p> Reasons to develop all three submarine safety programs can be traced back more than 150 years ago to the sinking of the H. L. Hunley . Incredibly , she sank three times over the course of her career . All of the events that led to her sinkings share elements with the dangers facing submariners to this day and serve as a reminder of why the U.S. Navy implemented the aforementioned safety initiatives . <p> Originally known as " the Fish Boat , " or simply " the Boat , " the Hunley first sank on 29 August 1863 during surface operations . Lieutenant John A. Payne , the officer in charge , inadvertently stepped on the lever that actuated the dive planes , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , she experienced uncontrolled flooding , and five of the eight men on board perished . Perhaps the first control-system casualty in the history of submarine operations , this " jam dive " produced the result that todays Fly-By-Wire Ship Control System program is designed to prevent . <p> Despite the loss of life and sinking , the general in charge of Charlestons defenses , Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard , saw the boats potential and had her salvaged and repaired . The lost men were buried , a new crew was formed , repairs were made , and she was put back to sea in less than two months . This time , she was commanded by Horace L. Hunley , her creator and financier . He helped build the submersible and therefore knew her better than anyone else . In theory , this would be safer than training people who lacked comprehensive knowledge . <p> On 15 October 1863 , Hunley and his crew were doing training dives with a surface ship as an escort . The submersible made several dives and surfaces throughout the day and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and recovery . The divers found the boat in 54 feet of water , partially flooded , with her bow buried in the mud at a 30-degree angle . The assessment at the time was that she had suffered a ballasting problem ; unable to carry the additional weight , she plowed toward the bottom at high speed . With the bow firmly stuck in the sea bed , the crew could not free the submersible , and all eight of them either drowned or were asphyxiated . This loss foreshadowed the danger of flooding and the importance of ship-recovery systems , other factors the SUBSAFE program is designed to mitigate . <p> Despite a track record of two sinkings and the loss of 13 men , including her inventor , the boat was raised once again , refurbished , and put back into service . And again , an eight-man crew assembled , this time with Lieutenant George Dixon in command . After further training , the Hunley prepared for her fateful mission . On the night of 17 February 1864 , she departed South Carolinas Charleston Harbor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying at anchor off the shore . As the Hunley approached the starboard side of the Housatonic , watchstanders spotted her and opened fire with muskets and shotguns . Then the Hunley affixed an explosive charge to the Housatonic s hull , using a 25-foot spar on the submersibles bow , and detonated the charge , dooming both vessels . The Union lost five sailors from the Housatonic s crew , and the Confederates lost the Hunley and her entire crew when she sank soon after the attack . <p> The Union fleet outside of Charleston Harbor immediately knew its warships fate , but no one knew what happened to her attacker until 1995 when the Hunley s final resting place was discovered . In August 2000 , she was raised once more and has been undergoing conservation and examination at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in Charleston , South Carolina . Now that the Hunley has been salvaged and continues to be carefully preserved and examined , the mystery as to why she sank for a third and final time can hopefully be solved . What has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their stations , not crowded around the hatches trying to escape .

Additionally , she was found to the seaward of the Housatonic , the opposite direction of the planned return to Confederate-controlled waters . <p> Taken together , a plausible explanation might be that the crew was incapacitated and the vessel was set adrift in the ebb current , eventually sinking outside the harbor . The crews debilitation may have been caused by the poor air circulation , which would have heightened the deprivation of oxygen . This and other similar hazards are principal risks countered by the DSS-SOC program , which exists to prevent the imperiling of the operators of a submergence vessel . While this linkage is admittedly less certain than those of the Hunley s first and second sinkings , it is compelling to take her entire history and align it with the programs we rely on now to protect our submarines and their crews . <h> Todays Challenge <p> The U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a direct result of rigorous compliance with the technical and administrative requirements of the SUBSAFE program .

Part of that effort is looking at the past to identify failures so as not to repeat them .

The supreme sacrifice of those lost with the Thresher and other submarines can best be remembered by never letting it happen again . <p> Rear Admiral Jabaley is the Naval Sea Systems Command Deputy Commander for Undersea Warfare , leading the organization responsible for ensuring compliance with the requirements of the SUBSAFE , DSS-SOC , and Fly-By-Wire Ship Control Systems programs .

" Darrieus <p> The American Navy acknowledges no superior in its ability to steam and to shoot . If nothing else was required of a fleet of ships in naval warfare we might rest securely in the belief that we are as well prepared for war as any possible antagonist . Strange to say , not many years ago this fallacious belief did permeate the service and was based upon the above narrow , unsound and short-sighted assumption . <p> Within the last few years , however , a fortunate awakening has come about . The navy is comprehending with greater clearness every day , that a fleet is something more than a mere collection of ships ; that a bare " ship for ship " superiority over a possible enemy is not a guarantee of victory ; that before ships are ready to go into action , no matter how efficient individually , they must be welded into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single source and can act collectively as a unit free from embarrassing internal friction ; and that the problem of the proper utilization of the abilities to steam and to shootthat is , the problem of commandis not only less elementary but also much more difficult of solution than any yet undertaken by us . <p> Command and Doctrine <p> The importance of good management to any organization is generally recognized and well understood . In the industrial world , the survival of any concern and production by it of adequate returns for the capital invested , are matters which even the man on the street will admit without argument to be very intimately connected with management . The importance of the latter is indicated not only by the almost universal modern tendency to renovate management , and to adopt more effective , systematic and so-called " scientific " methods of supervision and direction , but also by the fact that the beneficial effects of good management are most apparent in " lines " of business where competition is keen and profits not large . While in exceptional cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is nevertheless true that management is one of the most important , if not indeed the most important , of the factors which comprise industrial organizations . <p> The necessity for good management in modern business has become universally admitted as axiomatic . But this general recognition unfortunately does not expand to some other forms of human activity , in all of which the principle is equally applicable that efficient planning and direction are essential to great success . From the trivial routine affairs of private individuals to the great critical matters of state , management , good or bad , is a cardinal element in the results produced . <p> The business of war , either on land or water , is no exception to this rule . On the contrary , the relative importance of management , as compared with the other ingredients of excellence , is probably greater in war than in any other form of endeavor . This truth is readily understood , even by civilians , when it is applied to the administrative management of a large fleet or army . The professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly includes not only the business of administration but also the leadership of forces engaged , or about to engage , in actual hostilities . Of the two , the latter , or more purely military function of command , is more essential to military success and also requires a greater measure of " scientific management . " <p> The superior importance of good leadership over good logistical administration , in so far as a favorable military issue is concerned , is well illustrated in the naval campaign between Suffren and Hughes . The former admiral was most of the time without a base and unable to obtain sufficient supplies . He constantly contended against scurvy , and an almost utter lack of medicines , provisions and materials of all sorts . His crews were greatly overworked and many ships unfit for sea . However great his administrative ability may have been , it was practically eliminated as a factor in the operations by the conditions which rendered his fleet destitute of the most vital products of administration . Yet Suffren succeeded through the genius of his leadership in winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to his own in size and gun power . The armies of the Potomac and of Northern Virginia in our Civil War furnish another example of the point in question . The former had the advantage during most of the war of the splendid organization and administrative system introduced by McClelland , and had bountiful supplies . Yet during three years of war this army was so poorly led as to be unable to win from its less numerous Southern opponent , which was unquestionably poorly administered and supplied , but well led . <p> Good leadership or command , as distinguished from administrative management , is then obviously a cardinal requisite to successful military operations . It properly includes not alone the efficiency of the person in chief command , but also that of the chain of subordinate commanders which theoretically connects the mind of the chief to each individual in the fleet or army . Command implies control and direction by a leader ; but before this is possible with a large number of units , they must be divided into groups , each under the command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similarly subdivided and commanded , and if the force be large it may be necessary to repeat the process of subdivision many times . By means of such a so-called " chain of command " it becomes possible to carry into execution the will of the highest leader in a manner which could not otherwise be done , and to ensure that the entire organization acts coordinately and harmoniously as a unit . <p> Organization , however , can not alone produce unity of action in accordance with the desires of the chief . It merely furnishes the mechanism for transmitting , interpreting , directing and executing instructions . It is little more than a bony skeleton , which , though it be an essential part of the organism , must nevertheless be augmented by flesh and sinew and infused with spirit before it can successfully accomplish its mission of life-like coordinated activity conformable to the will of the directing mind . <p> Moreover , in a military organization it is not sufficient that the " officer-body , " which forms the chain of command , shall merely transmit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , in war , frequently act on their own initiative in anticipation of the desires of higher authority . From the very nature of extensive military operations , whether they be afloat or ashore , the commander of the whole force can not possibly have cognizance of events immediately upon their occurrence . His vision is too limited and his communication system too precarious and slow . Therefore , should he attempt specific personal direction to meet every contingency as it arises , his attacks will be too late to take full advantage of favorable situations presented , and his parries dangerously tardy . Unfortunately in warfare , and more especially in naval warfare , nearly all of the important situations which confront subordinate commanders are of the type which do not admit of delayed decisions . Many of them arise far distant from the commander-in-chief , or occur under other circumstances , such as tactical combat , which make it impossible to defer decision and action while the highest authority is being informed and until his instructions have been received in reply . The time factor is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval battle , that it is normally imperative for the subordinate commander himself to decide and to act , even before his superior can be acquainted with the special situation which has been met . The classic example of Nelsons initiative at the battle of St. Vincent is far from being the only illustration in history of the necessity for independent action by subordinates in order that advantage may be taken of local situations to assist the efforts of the whole force . Almost every large naval battle ever fought abounds in incidents which illustrate , either negatively or affirmatively , the tremendous importance of such measures being taken by subordinate commanders . The most recent example is the failure of the commander of the Russian second division at Tsushima to form column on the first division at a time when such maneuver was manifestly necessary to avoid a disadvantageous tactical situation . On account of difficulties with signaling , Rodjesvensky was prevented from directing this maneuver . <p> Of course , in advance of any major operations , the commander-in-chief will usually issue general instructions intended to govern situations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon such instructions , unless they be supplemented by many other things , is thoroughly understood by every officer of experience and every student of history . The possible eventualities are so numerous and complex as to render it difficult in the extreme to foresee many of the critical situations which will arise . Furthermore , when instructions aim to provide against every contingency they are likely to become so comprehensive and voluminous as to be confusing and difficult to remember . Under the stress of hostilities they are frequently forgotten or misinterpreted , and in some cases are deliberately disobeyed either on account of conditions slightly different from those anticipated in the order , or because of conviction of their unsoundness . <p> The difficult problem connected with the art of command , however , is not how to ensure execution of such wishes of the commander as circumstances permit to be precisely expressed in time to his junior officials . That is relatively simple and easy . Discipline ensures obedience , and the organization provides for the orders being transmitted to the proper places and executed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , which are always required for the attainment of military success . This problem is one which has been always efficiently solved in our service : our whole system of command is built to satisfy these artificial conditions , with the result that whatever has been undertaken afloat in peace has been well done . Our success during war has also been gratifying , but it should be well marked by such of us who want to make of the navy a real and dependable insurance to our country , that history reveals no occasion upon which a large American fleet has been opposed by a strong , aggressive and numerous foe . It is only in such operations that the true test of our system of command can be made . If , as the author believes , the present system fails to anticipate and to adequately provide for the conditions to be expected during hostilities of such nature , it is obviously imperative that it be modified ; wholly regardless of the effect of such change upon administration or upon the outcome of any peace activity whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command is that resulting from a critical situation which imposes upon subordinate commanders the necessity of deciding for themselves the action to be taken , and of carrying their decision into execution , before reference can be made to higher authority . Under these circumstances any system of command is severely tested , and is sure to break down unless it provides adequately for them . If in such cases the decisions and actions of the various subordinate commanders harmonize with the desires of the commander-in-chiefthat is , if each one of them does what their chief would do were he present in personthen due coordination is assured and the efforts of the whole command reach their maximum of effectiveness through the resulting unity of action . In other words , the system of command then furnishes a satisfactory basis for the control of the whole force and is adequate to ensure that the will of the supreme commander governs , even in spite of the anomalous condition of its being done in advance on the expression of that will . <p> It is clear that subordinates can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to situations confronting them , unless they have to guide their decisions something much better than instructions issued before the event and , therefore , necessarily lacking in completeness and applicability . Other measures are indispensable , chief among which is a proper preparation of the minds of the body of officers . <p> Individually , the officers should be conversant with the theory of war , and familiar with its history and the lessons derivable therefrom . That is to say , education in the art of war , as distinguished from the other numerous branches of the military profession , is a necessary step in the preparation of responsible participants in war . The officers should also be trained in the mental processes which are demanded by active hostile operations . Until the mind receives such training no decision can be in any sense automatic , but must be the result of slow and labored reasoning . Frequently in war , and especially in naval war , it is imperative that decisions be made in advance of reflection , and under the stress of grave responsibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vastly better if it has been previously prepared by practice in frequent quick decisions involving similar tactical or strategic factors . <p> In addition , each officer should have previously acquired a spirit of intense loyalty to the plans of his superiors . Loyalty is not merely a moral virtue ; it is also a very great military necessity . In the absence of universal loyalty within an organization , the momentous effects which flow from united action are impossible . When loyalty permeates a command its " driving power " is vastly increased , not only because of the greater effect consequent upon cohesive effort but also on account of the stimulating influence upon individual effort . <p> Besides the preparation which the individual should receive , it is also necessary that the " team mind " should similarly be made ready in advance , before the acts initiated by subordinates can be counted upon to harmonize with the intentions and plans of their common superior . Of course , they should all receive the commanders general instructions and also be acquainted with the plan which such instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary before independent actions can be made to conform thereto . But decidedly something more than last minute preparation of this sort is required . The interpretation of the orders and of the plan by each one of the subordinates should be the same , and so complete and accurate that awkwardness of language , inaccuracies of expression , omission of details or even of generalities , or other defects of the written or verbal instructions , shall not prove a bar to each one knowing the true intentions of his chief , nor to a knowledge of what each and every one of them will think and do under foreseen circumstances or in a sudden and unexpected contingency . Finally , human nature is so constituted that perfect loyalty and cooperation is almost impossible unless the participants are inwardly convinced of the correctness of the plan and methods under which they are mutually acting . <p> Obviously , then , harmonious and coordinated effort under the pressure of immediateness and during the stress of hostilities , on the part of commanders between whom communications are precarious , is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of highly developed mutual understanding and common conviction . The development of such a bond , like the preparation of the individual mind , must necessarily be done during the years of peace preceding war . Of course , mutual understanding and conviction will be accomplished to some degree when the various subordinate commanders are men who have been qualified for their positions by study of the art of war and by training in war games and simulated maneuvers ; the loyalty of all to the promulgated plan will also promote common understanding . Yet a much deeper and more comprehensive understanding is required before a band of subordinates can be ready to undertake that kind of coordination demanded by complex and rapidly moving military operations on a large scale . The body of junior commanders must be almost literally of one mind with their commander-in-chief and with each other if frictionless and automatic team-work is to be obtained . Their direction at every point should be unhesitatingly the same as would be given by the commander-in-chief himself were he present . Then , and only then , can the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expressed plan . <p> The need for this type of understanding , as well as for the resulting concerted action , should be apparent to anyone giving mature thought to the subject of command . It is recognized as a necessity in the principal foreign military organizations , and they attempt to supply the deficiency through what has been termed " doctrine . " Commander Schofield of our navy has said , " In a military service , where many intellects must cooperate towards a single aim and where the stress of events forbid the actual interchange of ideas , when the need is most felt , there must be a governing idea to which every situation may be referred and from which there may be derived a sound course of action . It is only thus that the full driving power of an organization can make itself felt . " Again , in discussing the situation confronting the commander of a fleet on the night preceding a probable battle , the same officer says , " No verbose instructions that he may issue now can have the remotest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intellect and spirit . Such a change is a matter of long and patient educational effort that eventually centers around a doctrine of military conduct to which every act either of preparation or of execution is automatically referred . When such a stage of development is achieved a spirit of confidence becomes diffused throughout the service that invests it with a moral power of the greatest value . " <p> For some unaccountable reason the American Navy , and to a somewhat less degree the American Army , have never seriously endeavored to indoctrinate their officers , and thus to furnish a basis for harmonious decisions during hostilities . It is all the more striking that the navy has failed in this respect , because of the supreme importance of the time factor afloat . With us " time is everything , " even more than with Nelson , whose conspicuous successes were largely due to the high degree of mutual understanding that existed among his subordinate commanders ; and Nelsons indoctrination , more than anything else , made such understanding possible . <p> Probably all will concur in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summarized briefly as follows : <p> Good management is a cardinal requisite to the success of any organization , industrial or military . <p> Military management comprises both administration and command , of which two the latter is more essential to successful military operations . <p> Command depends not alone upon the orders and acts of the officer directing the entire operations , but also in great measure hinges upon the actions of the chain of subordinate commanders . <p> To properly exercise their command function the officer corps as a body must act unitedly . As a preparation to do this they must be educated in the art of war and trained in its conduct . They must be loyal to their commander-in-chief and his plans , and must possess a deep understanding of the mind of their common chief and of each other . <p> The degree of mutual understanding necessary to unity of action by a large organization , military or naval , can best be assured through previous indoctrination . <p> It is the purpose of this paper to examine into and to discuss the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unsigned article in the Edinburgh Review of April , 1911 , the statement is made that " a sound , comprehensive , all-pervading doctrine of war is as important to an army as its organization . " This is true to an even greater extent for a navy and it is , therefore , somewhat extraordinary that both the American military services as a whole are unfamiliar even with the meaning of the term " doctrine " when used in its purely military sense , and fail to comprehend its importance as well as its role in bringing about timely and united action in the midst of hostilities . <p> To many officers , doctrines are synonymous with principles ; to others , the word suggests methods ; and still others confound it with rules . While all of these are somewhat related none of them may properly be considered as having the same military meaning . <p> The object of military doctrine is to furnish a basis for prompt and harmonious conduct by the subordinate commanders of a large military force , in accordance with the intentions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to superior authority before action is taken . More concisely stated the object is to provide a foundation for mutual understanding between the various commanders during hostile operations . <p> By recourse to the dictionary it may be learned that doctrine means " whatever is taught ; what is held , put forth as true and supported by a teacher , a school , or a sect ; it is a general body of instructions ; doctrine denotes whatever is recommended as a speculative truth to the belief of others ; a doctrine may be true or false , it may be a mere tenet or opinion . " One meaning of doctrine is a " principle " or " body of principles , " but that is not the sense in which it is employed when applied to the art of war by European military forces . Some military writers and translators have caused great confusion by using the term as a synonym for principles . Military doctrines are beliefs or teachings which have been reasoned from principles ; that is , they flow from principles as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application of mutually accepted principles , and thus furnish a practical basis for coordination under the extremely difficult conditions governing contact between hostile forces . <p> A principle is a " fundamental truth as a basis of reasoning ; the cause , source or origin of anything . " Obviously , there is a great difference between a principle and a military doctrine , notwithstanding that they are related . It has been aptly said that the difficulty with fundamental principles lies not in their comprehension but in their application . Under any given circumstances fundamental principles might be correctly applied in a number of materially different ways , depending upon the varieties of doctrines held . Furthermore , in war the number of possible acceptable solutions to a situation is increased not alone by the number of possible applications of the several principles involved , but as well by the variations in the relative importance which may be assumed for each . <p> One of the best illustrations of the wide differences of doctrine which may be acceptably deduced from the same principles is afforded by the so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern the operations of the respective armies of these two countries . Both doctrines were evolved from exhaustive studies of Napoleonic methods of conducting war , so that both flow not only from the same principles but also from the methods of one man . <p> Briefly stated the German doctrine of war is that of envelopment . It was argued by their Great General Staff that the power of modern weapons has greatly decreased the vulnerability of the fronts of armies and correspondingly increased the weakness of their flanks . Hence the hostile flanks were chosen as the principal objectives for concentrated attacks . It was deemed preferable that superior numbers be utilized to envelop both flanks of the enemy , while at the same time containing his center . Such procedure necessitated initial deployment by large semi-independent groups over a very wide front , and consequently increased the danger of defeat in detail should the enemy succeed in concentrating on one or more unsupported detachments . To meet this grave danger the several detached parts of the army were each made of such size and character as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent , for a time at least long enough to ensure support from adjacent detachments . An army corps of about 40,000 men of all arms was selected as the minimum size of each semi-independent unit . <p> Due to its wide deployment the control of the whole army by the commander-in-chief was necessarily weakened and rendered precarious , and this fact also seemed to increase the danger of defeat in detail . To overcome this defect the corps commanders , as well as indeed all officers in the German Army , were educated and trained in the same school of thought ( indoctrinated ) , so as to reduce the necessity for greatly centralized command and to always insure unison of thought and cooperative action among separated subordinates under all circumstances . In order to further lessen the danger of defeat in detail , the initiative was to be taken and maintained at all cost . Whenever encountered the enemy was to be vigorously attacked and pressed without awaiting orders , so as to deny him the initiative and also to relieve pressure at points where he may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started their march on a wide flung front was to concentrate simultaneously on the battlefield itself , marching from different directions and enveloping both flanks of the numerically inferior enemy . <p> In order that a number of coequal semi-independent corps may avoid defeat in detail during the earlier part of such operations , and may finally concentrate simultaneously and successfully from exterior lines on to the battlefield against an aggressive enemy , it is obviously requisite that great skill and perfect coordination be displayed on the part of the detachment commanders . They must continuously exercise enterprise , boldness , aggressiveness and a high degree of initiative . But above all they must think harmoniously . The actions of each commander must harmonize with those of each of the other coworkers . In reaching any decision its effect upon the operations as a whole must take precedence over the local situation . <p> In other words , to wage such warfare successfully it is necessarily essential that the subordinate commanders be previously prepared as a team . Manifestly , the work of preparation should be done before the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers must , through study , learn to know war thoroughly from every aspect , and must be trained together as well as it is possible to do by means of sub-caliber games and field maneuvers . <p> If , during such exercises in common , differences of opinion develop , as will almost invariably happen , personal preference and belief must for the sake of the team success be submerged whenever they conflict with the reasoned and matured conclusions of the majority . Loyal acceptance by all of the teachings of their school of thought is necessary before unity of action can be attained during collective activities . In other words , indoctrination is essential to adequate coordination . <p> How successful the Germans have been in obtaining the requisite cooperation in spite of the difficulties of so doing which their doctrine of war creates , is attested by the brilliance of their work in 1866 and 1870 . True , there were certain exceptions , and at least one prominent general was removed from his command either because of his unwillingness to accept the common doctrine or else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , serve chiefly to emphasize with greater force the vital necessity of prescribing doctrine and accomplishing indoctrination , before command of large forces can be successfully exercised . The history of the present war is hardly yet begun and facts are difficult to obtain , but the phenomenal advance of the Germans during the first month of fighting indicates remarkable coordination between the various corps and army commanders . <p> Attention is here parenthetically called to the essentially similar conditions , as far as command is concerned , between sea warfare and the situations on land created during operations conducted in conformity with the German doctrine of war . In both cases direct control by the commander-in-chief is impossible and his influence is , therefore , liable to crumble . His principal work is of necessity limited to the period of preparation and to the earlier phases of hostile contact . Once action is joined in earnest the commander-in-chief must , both on account of the difficulties of communication and of the time factor , trust the outcome almost wholly to his subordinates ; it is then too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hence it soon becomes the function of a number of coequal subordinate commanders to act practically independently , but at the same time to make their respective decisions and acts harmonize with the operations of all the others , while also furthering the plan of the commander-in-chief which has been necessarily expressed in but very general terms . We on the water should particularly heed the fact that this problem in cooperation is not capable of satisfactory solution unless doctrine plays a conspicuous part as one of the favorable factors . <p> As will be explained later , the French doctrine of war prescribes extreme centralization of command and aims at the control of the whole army by two men supposed to keep constantly in communication with each other and with the various detachment commanders . In operations conforming to this doctrine the situations are comparable to those of a navy operating only during peace , and a study of the French doctrine is , therefore , not so profitable to naval officers seeking the best means for conducting a fleet during war . The principal reason why great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various commanders are separated , nor even because communication between them is imperfect , but because of the profound influence of the time factor upon water strategy and especially in water tactics . The exigencies created by the necessity for each situation being met immediately renders centralization fatally weak and makes it of supreme importance that the whole officer corps be indoctrinated in order that it may be capable of synchronous initiative . <p> The French doctrine of war was developed after the reverses of 1870 , and pretends to be a reply to the German doctrine as well as a more accurate interpretation than the latter of Napoleonic war . In the opinion of many profound students the French conception is the sounder for shore work , but is more precarious in that it depends for success upon two men having ability amounting almost to genius ; whereas the German doctrines may be put into brilliant effect by men whose intelligence and ability are not necessarily extraordinary . <p> The French doctrine is based upon application of the principle of the economy of forces . The Germans seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times and from exterior lines , whereas the French aim is to husband their troops and to preserve interior lines during a period while the strength and disposition of the enemy is being ascertained . Once the necessary information is obtained however and the time is deemed by the commander-in-chief to be opportune , conservation ceases and the end in view becomes a vigorous attack by almost the whole concentrated army ( all the stronger for the interior position and the previous conservation ) against the point chosen by the commander-in-chief with the aid of the information which he has awaited . The gathering of the information so necessary to the success of such a grand stroke is entrusted to the commander of a very strong advance guard , composed principally of cavalry and other mobile troops . The task of this officer , and of those under him , is difficult in the extreme . The desired information can not be obtained without penetrating the enemys screens , yet an engagement of so serious a nature as to prematurely force the involvement of the entire army must be carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt simplified the task of the advance guard commander , but nevertheless he must be an officer of rare judgment and brilliant attainments . It is necessary that he and the commander-in-chief be exceptionally brilliant men , while other commanders in the army will have few demands made upon their ability beyond that required for the specific execution of orders received . <p> In the present war it will be remembered that the French left wing retreated continuously from the Belgian border to Paris without once making a decided stand or taking the offensive in force . Probably this was done in accordance with the above described doctrine , their forces being conserved and the interior line being maintained until the commander-in-chief deemed his information sufficiently complete to warrant making a concentrated counter stroke . With heavy reinforcements from Paris the annihilation of the German right wing was attempted with great vigor and apparently came near to succeeding . <p> Plainly the two doctrines of war described above are directly opposite , notwithstanding the fact that both pretend to be applications of the principles which brought Napoleon his successes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . It is probable that studies by other minds of the same master might lead to doctrines differing radically from both the French and the German , yet entirely logical and quite satisfactory as a basis of military operations so long as their entirety was preserved . As already pointed out this probability is due to the differences in the relative values of the several principles involved , likely to be assigned by different students , as well as to individual variations in the manner of applying the various principles to specific conditions . <p> Any set of men who have read and studied the art of war independently and without collaboration are almost certain to have evolved varying conceptions of war and radically different individual doctrines , each one of which may nevertheless be a sound and reasonable doctrine and bring success if applied collectively by all the subordinate commanders of a military organization . But the reader will readily appreciate the utter confusion and the fatal dispersion of effort that would occur should an army or fleet be commanded by a body of men who have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must rely separately upon their own differing individual conceptions and doctrines formed by independent thought and reasoning . This hypothetical condition must assume a grave aspect when it is recognized to be the condition of our own navy at the present time . <p> It should be clear , and well worth mature reflection on the part of our officers , that concerted action by a large force engaged in hostilities requires as its basis common doctrines universally understood and accepted , and that an absence of doctrine is a serious danger to any military force , particularly when opposed , as we are likely to be if opposed at all , by an enemy whose personnel possesses such a bond of mutual understanding . <p> One is irresistibly led to the conclusion that the formulation and promulgation of doctrine , as well as its acceptance by all concerned , is a practical and an essential element in the peace preparation for war . <p> It is hoped that the foregoing has shown that : <p> A military doctrine is distinct from a military principle , rule or method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Concrete doctrine flows from a conception of war which is based upon a particular alloy of principles . <p> Universal understanding and acceptance of common doctrines is necessary before concerted action by a large force engaged in hostilities is possible ; it is an indispensable element of command , and an essential prelude to great success in war . <p> Historical Lessons <p> It would , of course , be too much to say that victory can not be attained without adequate doctrine , yet this statement is nearer the truth than will be generally conceded . There is little or no exaggeration in the assertions that without doctrine large military operations can not be carried on satisfactorily against a strong and active foe , and that the influence of doctrine upon victory is profound . Happily , it is not necessary to rely upon argument alone in order to prove the worth of doctrine . History furnishes a number of illustrations from which a good estimate of its value may be made . <p> Napoleons first campaign , that in northern Italy against the Austrians , was marvelously well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great , these results were accomplished primarily by means of the personal direction of the commander-in-chief at every critical point . On one occasion Napoleon was continuously in the saddle for five consecutive days and nights because of the repeated demand for his presence at various points of the field of operations . Manifestly , that army was not indoctrinated ; nor did it require such an aid to coordinate action , because the force was small enough to allow the genius of its commander to be employed in person wherever success was in jeopardy . <p> While doctrine did not enter as a factor into these early Italian victories , that campaign nevertheless served to indoctrinate in Napoleons conception and methods of war a number of subordinates . In consequence these men were afterwards able to successfully apply his system during operations of such greater magnitude as to render impracticable the personal supervision of the master at many crucial points . <p> In the campaigns succeeding his first one , Napoleon handled his army by means of orders assigning a specific task to each of the marshals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through plastic intellect trained in Napoleonic methods , had become indoctrinated , the orders almost invariably left to their discretion the manner in which the allotted task was to be performed . In many cases , marshals who commanded practically independent armies operating in conjunction with that under the immediate direction of Napoleon , had very meager instructions , yet were so en rapport with the master as to coordinate splendidly with him . Probably the best examples of this are the operations of Davout and Lannes in the Jena campaign . <p> The use of doctrine by Napoleon was only one of many elements contributing to a series of incomparable successes , yet it is significant to note that his vanquished opponents relied upon the archaic method of command which was devoid of doctrine and which consequently denied discretion to subordinate leaders . <p> What value Napoleon himself placed upon unity of thought gained from indoctrination may be culled from his remark after Waterloo to the effect that the reverses of his late career were largely due to the fact that certain marshals " did not understand my system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1815 the Edinburgh Review of January , 1912 , in an article on " The Place of Doctrine in War " has this to say : <p> In this same article it is further point out that the disastrous failures of marshals were peculiar to men who had not had the advantage of indoctrination by Napoleon . The burden of war and of government pressed so heavily upon the masters attention that he could not personally attend to the indoctrination of new marshals after old age , wounds , disaffection and death had claimed those who had been of one mind with him . To quote further from the Edinburgh Review : <p> It is not during the stress and strain of war , when every wheel of the military machine is working at high pressure to grind out concrete results in the shape of movements , operations , battles , that an army can be trained . An army is used in war ; it can only be trained in peace ; more especially is it only in times of peace that the minds of subordinate commanders can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought and of effort which are essential factors in harmonizing the principles of command . <p> The prominence given to doctrine in the German system of command has already been spoken of , and the successful manner in which , through its means , the Germans in 1866 and 1870 were enabled to operate large and widely separated forces practically as a unit , is a matter of almost universal knowledge . <p> In preparing their army for the war with Russia , the Japanese adopted German methods . Needless to say , so essential an element of the German system of command as indoctrination was also included by the army of Japan . At the outbreak of the war the Japanese officers had been educated in the same school of thought and imbued with the same conceptions and doctrines of war . This is equivalent to saying that they thought alike about fundamentals and spoke the same military language . Consequently , misunderstandings of information , reports , or of the intention contained in orders were reduced to a minimum . The various major and minor detachments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them ; secure , as each situation developed , in the knowledge of the exact manner in which all the other commanders affected by the same circumstances would act . <p> With the Russians in Manchuria , on the other hand , it was a very different story . Their officers were not well educated technically and had no such thing as a coherent doctrine known , understood , and acquiesced in by all . Therefore , there was great dispersion and conflict of effort ; internal friction was so great as to require most of the energies of the various commanders to overcome it rather than the enemy . In his book on the war General Kuropatkin often complains of the conflicting beliefs of the subordinate commanders with regard to the training of troops and their employment in the field . He writes : <p> Although the same drill books and manuals are used by the whole army , there is considerable variety in the way the tactical instruction is imparted , owing to the diverse views held by the district commandersOur troops had been instructed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this or that district commander . The stronger the officer commanding a district , the less did he feel bound to abide by the authorized method of instruction and training laid down in the existing drill books . <p> In an effort to remedy this condition , Kuropatkin issued comprehensive tactical instructions to his army soon after taking command , and supplemented these by subsequent instructions . The difficulties of indoctrinating an army or navy faced by an active enemy are obviously great , and a military or naval force so ill-prepared as to require such treatment at so late a date is badly handicapped in its endeavors to act as a unit . <p> That the lack of doctrine was the principal deficiency in the British Army responsible for the severe reverses in South Africa , is a fact which need not be supported here by lengthy discussion . It will be sufficient to state that this opinion is held by several eminent authorities , among them General Langlois of the French Army . Probably no more exhaustive study of this war has been made than that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which body reaches the same conclusion . <p> The foregoing illustrations should be sufficient to establish the fact that indoctrination is so essential an element of command that success without it is difficult . But the conservation of the naval mind is such as to forbid the general acceptance of any new belief or doctrine which is deduced from the history of land warfare alone . <p> Happily one of the best illustrations of the importance of doctrine to command , and of its use in accomplishing conspicuous success , has been bequeathed by no less a naval genius than Nelson . <p> The persistent and ceaseless way in which through many years he educated and trained his captains in his own original school of tactical thought is too well known to require more than mention here . He made them almost literally of one mind with himself , so that their acts in the face of the enemy were remarkably harmonious and well coordinated in spite of an extraordinary small number of signals . At Trafalgar , for example , but four tactical signals were made by the commander-in-chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet of 33 ships were formed for battle , maneuvered through about six hours of an approach , and then fought an opponent of 40 ships for about four hours until decisive victory had been gained . The share that mutual understanding coupled with common convictions ( which in effect is doctrine ) had in this performance must necessarily have been very great . <p> The plan given in the famous memorandum of course contributed largely to the mutual understanding as well as to the victory . But it is very essential to the student to note and to comprehend thoroughly that no plan , however well it may be expressed , can possibly be coordinately executed by a large force of vessels of several types operating against a strong and efficient enemy , unless the squadron , division and ship commanders have the same conceptions of war as their commander-in-chief and are well indoctrinated . It can not be reiterated too often that on the water the element of time will invariably prevent any effective coordination which depends upon signals , radio messages or written instructions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due preparation of the minds of the various commanders , both chief and subordinate , before the outbreak of hostilities . Such preparation comprehends not only adequate tactical and strategic study and training , but also a common meeting ground of beliefs as to the manner of applying principles to modern war . <p> One does not have to seek far in history to find evidence of the employment of doctrine by such successful naval leaders as Agrippa , Suffren , Tegethoff and Togo . No British admiral except Nelson used it to any marked extent . He sustained no defeats and his victories were conspicuously decisive , while the fights of his kindred admirals never resulted in better than the gaining of a slight advantage . <p> Moreover , history shows that the badly vanquished fleets have been invariably almost devoid of doctrine . Rodjesvensky , Persano , Villeneuve , Brueys and Antony almost wholly neglected this important matter . Suffren suffered four defeats before scoring a success . The principal change that took place in his fleet between the first fight and the last one was that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The lessons to be derived from the foregoing historical examples , both military and naval , are plainly apparent . The service which neglects so essential a part of the art of war command as the indoctrination of its commissioned personnel , is destined to fail in its ambitions for great achievement . <p> Until very recently the British Army was not indoctrinated and the process is probably not yet satisfactorily completed . Their navy is believed to be behind the army in this respect , which may partially account for some recent disappointments ; more especially so when it is remembered that the German Army has been well indoctrinated for 40 years and that the Germans are not the kind of people likely to omit so well tried and fundamental an element of command from their sea fighting organization . The Japanese Army is patterned after that of Germany and is indoctrinated ; that they have incorporated the same feature in their navy is probable . The advantages of indoctrination has been recognized for a number of years by the foremost French naval students and writers ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of all the great navies , our own is probably alone , in completely ignoring this great aid to the waging of decisive war on the sea . <p> Methods of Developing Doctrine <p> Within the last two years efforts have been made in our fleet to develop minor tactical doctrine for certain forms of operations . The method used was to crystallize opinion by discussion in conference , of maneuvers held with ships or on the maneuver board , and to adopt the general terms of the consensus of opinion as the governing doctrine . Once determined in this manner the doctrine was promulgated in official written form as the prescribed future general guide to conduct under circumstances similar to those in which experience had been gained by maneuvers . In this way a basis for mutual understanding was progressively evolved which had been reached by utilizing general rather than individual experience and opinion ; and which represented the convictions of the majority and the concurrence of all . <p> Such procedure naturally resulted in the enthusiastic interest of all in the maneuvers , with a consequent gain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination between ships and divisions on many occasions when communication between them was impossible . <p> Incidentally also , but of great importance , the existence of the doctrine made it possible to simplify and reduce in length the initial and subsequent orders necessary to be issued to carry on the operations . For example , on one occasion , with the doctrine in force , a night maneuver involving the cooperation of about 20 ships and extending over a period of about six hours , was executed exceedingly well in spite of the fact that before the maneuver began the captains were given no information , and no instructions were issued by the commander of the force at any time beyond those contained in a radio order of 44 words sent out at the commencement of the exercise . During the preceding year , practically the same force had performed an almost identical maneuver . In that case , when operating without the advantage of the doctrine , complete information and orders were necessarily issued several days in advance to ensure due understanding by all of the task to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of the maneuver . The orders on this occasion contained over 1200 words and were accompanied by two blueprints showing the track to be followed by each vessel of the force . <p> While the practical work outlined above has been valuable , and has demonstrated more convincingly than any amount of theory could do the extreme importance of doctrine towards the effective cooperation of vessels acting jointly under conditions to be expected during hostilities , its scope is obviously too limited to be considered as a comprehensive indoctrination of war . <p> It is manifestly desirable that doctrine should not be built up , from the little things to the larger ones , separately in each branch of the profession as we have done in gunnery and as indicated above to a tentative and minute extent in elementary tactics ; but that if effort in all branches is to synchronize , the start should be made at the top . The big questions of policy should first be settled as well as those of command , strategy , tactics , logistics and materiel . Then from such basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistently so that all parts of the grand scheme will be consistent and harmonious . <p> In all modern armies manuals are issued for the guidance of officers in the peace training of the men . In addition instructions are issued to govern the general methods and the details of healing the troops in the field . The latter are known as " Field Service Regulations . " It is of course intended that these various manuals and instructions shall produce uniformity throughout the army in all essential minor particulars , and , therefore , since they furnish a basis for mutual understanding in the execution of certain principles of secondary importance these manuals may properly be considered as prescribing minor doctrine . <p> We of the navy are entirely familiar with this form of instruction . For years we have had manuals for guidance in our various lesser activities . We have Infantry and Artillery Drill Regulations , Ship and Gun Drills , The Boat Book , and Gunnery Instructions , as well as the Tactical Signal Book which regulates the interior maneuver of ships in formation . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and action along certain lines of smaller consequence . <p> Yet there is a vital difference between our naval manuals which prescribe minor doctrine and those of the modern army . Ours do not flow from anything higher up , but represent merely a detached work unrelated to other branches of the profession . Almost invariably they are prepared by a board of officers , many of whom have no greater qualification for the task than that of being good all around officers . The product of the board is normally the personal opinion of one or two of its best prepared members , based upon their own study and experience , which is necessarily limited and incomplete . From time to time the manuals are revised , usually by an entirely new board , which inevitably injects its own personal equation into the new instructions . Consequently our manuals are not comprehensive and do not possess the close relationship which is desirable . The revisions do not develop the subjects in an orderly , logical and systematic manner but , due to variable conceptions and doctrines , produce confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempered when applied to the gunnery manuals , which have been evolved principally from service opinion and therefore do not contain the defects that necessarily creep into the products of haphazard boards . But the tendency to regard the subject of gunnery as detached and more or less unrelated to the employment of the navy as a whole is noticeable even in this excellent manual . <p> On the other hand , the army manuals of a first-class power are written by the general staff , which prepares itself for the task first by an exhaustive study of history and war , as well as of the material , political and other conditions which confront their country . From the results of this study is evolved a conception of war as it should in its opinion be best conducted . When this broad , comprehensive work of information and that of reflection is completed , and not before then , the general staff having evolved its conception of war formulates its fundamental major doctrines of war , which are made to flow logically from the reasoned conception . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major doctrine representing the grand decisions . From this is sequentially deduced lesser doctrines to be applied in every field of activity . Some of the numerous products are the various manuals and field service regulations which , therefore , fit in perfectly with the grand scheme . The whole is consistent , coherent and cohesive . <p> Hence it is apparent that to the modern army doctrine is something very real , exceedingly important and decidedly practical . On this side of the water , both ashore and afloat , we are prone to regard doctrine as being evanescent and purely academica matter of interest only from a theoretical standpoint . In so doing we eliminate from our services one of the most important elements of military command and a potent aid to victory . <p> It must not be supposed that the foreign general staffs dogmatically impose their doctrines upon the armies . On the contrary they are careful not to do so , because doctrine which is welded into the organization by the ardent convictions of the body of the personnel is incomparably more effective than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consequently the greatest pains are taken to convert the army to the reasoned beliefs of the general staff . The historical section of the general staff publishes to the service analytical studies of field practice maneuvers and of past campaigns , in which the causes for successes and reverses are carefully explained in such a way as to illustrate and to emphasize the soundness of the doctrines which are advocated , as well as the conceptions of war from which such doctrines have been deduced . <p> When nations foreign to themselves engage in war , officers are sent from the general staff to observe and record the operations . From the data thus obtained , as well as from other information , the historical section of the staff writes a history of the war and publishes it to the army . Such works are by no means mere records of events , but are profound studies of them . Like the treatment given to maneuvers and previous history , every aspect of the campaign is critically analyzed and the true cause of every important effect is deduced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correctness of the doctrines which pervade their own army . No such accurate , comprehensive and illuminating histories of wars have ever been written than those of the South African and the Manchurian campaigns by the general staffs of the German , French , English and Japanese armies . <p> In this manner are the convictions of an army strengthened and its morale correspondingly elevated . There is no more important work in time of peace than thus to lay the foundations for united and enthusiastic action after the outbreak of hostilities and for decisive victory as their conclusion . <p> Concrete Application to Our Own Case <p> The author has tried to make it clear that the first and most essential step in the process of so indoctrinating a military service as to ensure coordinate action during hostilities , is to improvise and formulate a concrete , comprehensive and coherent conception of modern war . <p> Napoleonic war was based upon the conception of first shattering the morale and weakening the command of his opponents army by jeopardizing his communications , and then delivering a concentrated decisive attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . Moltkes conception , and that of the French following 1870 , have been already explained . For the Manchurian campaign the Japanese adopted the Moltke conception . Nelsons conception of a concentrated attack upon a part of the enemy , followed by a close and decisive action at that point before it could be supported , is too well known to require explanation here . The essential point to be noted is that all brilliant military achievement of modern times with large forces has been preceded by the creation of a conception of war suited to the weapons and conditions of the times , which conception has furnished the basis for indoctrination of the entire force in all branches of activity . That such procedure has been one of the cardinal elements of great success is the opinion of many of the most eminent military authorities of the present day . Similarly , as previously stated , the lack of a comprehensive conception is by many great students considered one of the principal reasons for the failures of the British in South Africa , and of the Russians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Doubtless the French and Germans have recently brought their shore conceptions up to date . Had either of them failed to do so there might not have been the same equality of advantage as now exists between the two armies , notwithstanding the unprecedented numbers , length of line , power of weapons and other novel conditions presented by the situation . <p> Whether or not any navy has formulated a conception of modern naval war is unknown to the writer . But in view of the fact that some of them possess general staffs , one of the recognized functions of which is to perform this kind of duty , it is probable that they have not only created the conceptions but have also deduced the doctrines which logically flow therefrom . Consequently it is of great importance that we do likewise if we are to meet any possible enemy as well prepared . The fact that we have no general staff can not possibly serve as an excuse for neglecting this important matter . The work could probably best be done by a general staff , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body ; but it is not the purpose of this paper to stray into an appeal for a general staff . <p> As previously indicated the task of creating a conception of naval war necessarily involves profound and exhaustive study and analysis of naval campaigns , followed by closely reasoned constructive work . In the absence of genius this can be done properly only by a reflective body of officers , qualified from sea experience and professional study , and also by systematic education and training in the methods of war such as may be acquired at our Naval War College . <p> Once the difficult inductive reasoning necessary to the creation of a conception of war has been done the reflective body can proceed with the easier deductive processes of evolving doctrines out of their basic conception . In the latter work it is imperative that the active fleet be utilized if an objectionable academic taint to the doctrines is to be avoided . The reflective body of officers should cooperate with the commander-in-chief of the active fleet in planning maneuvers , should be embarked in the fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsequently analyze them . The results so obtained should be used in formulating new or modifying old doctrines , the nature of which is necessarily to some degree tentative and demands that it be acquired progressively . In other words , the creation of doctrine is an evolution . <p> We of the navy are familiar with the astute manner in which the department has used the collective mind of the service in brining gunnery up to a high level of efficiency . Competition was introduced to stimulate keen interest which was also further fostered by a system of rewards . In addition the entire personnel was taken into the confidence of the target practice office , thus producing a " team spirit " which engendered the personal enthusiasm of every man and officer afloat in the evolution of gunnery , as well as infused all with a pronounced conviction that we were , as never before , preparing for battle along correct lines . <p> Some such general method is manifestly necessary before any great progress can be made in the essential higher preparation and training for fleet action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminary work has been done by the reflective body , of inductively improvising a grand conception of naval war , from which it might also deduce a few broad general doctrines , the results should be published to the service together with the processes of reasoning which led to the conclusions . This should be presented in such manner as will win the warm conviction and support of most officers . Comment and criticism should be invited and also published . <p> The carefully planned fleet maneuvers should be put on a competitive basis ; otherwise the interest necessary to obtain the best thought of the officers may not be aroused . <p> Most important of all , the maneuvers should be followed by a free discussion in writing and in conferences by all officers above a certain rank , not too low , say lieutenant . Only in this manner can the service be made to feel that the resulting doctrines are born of themselves and not imposed upon them , and such sentiments are absolutely required before the collective mind , which is akin to genius , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general method will it be possible to arrive at definite conclusions concerning the larger questions of the profession . All will agree that the present rather aimless drifting of thought in these matters should come to an end if we are ever to bring the navy to the point of real readiness for major hostile operations . It is true that there is danger in undue rigidity ; but while by the method advocated , thought and doctrine will become partially solidified , it will also remain sufficiently plastic and tentative to permit changes which will inevitably be necessary from time to time to keep up to date . Without change , there can be no progress ; the acquisition of doctrine is not only a process requiring the utilization of the collective mind of the service , but is also a never-ending progressive one . <p> To reach the ultimate goal of war efficiency we must begin with principles , conceptions and major doctrines , before we can safely determine minor doctrines , methods and rules . We must build from the foundation upwards and not from the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine whether our strategic and tactical operations shall be offensive or defensive in character , and whether they are to be introduced by " secondary warfare " ( mines , destroyers and submarines ) or by " primary warfare " ( the employment of the whole force ) ; whether the fleet will form in ordinary simple column or in an alignment of groups ; whether a parallel fight is to be sought or a concentration of superior force at one or more points , and if the latter how and where ; whether each type of ship will be concentrated or the whole force divided into groups , each comprising several types ; whether we will attempt to fight by exterior or interior lines ; whether destroyers are to endeavor to cripple the enemy by a night attack preceding the general engagement or to be used only during the main fleet action ; whether submarines shall adopt eccentric plans or be utilized jointly with the rest of the fleet ; whether information is to be obtained by wide flung distant scouting or only by close scouting ; whether our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiative to subordinate commanders or will depend upon centralized direction by the commander-in-chief , etc . <p> The determination of such matters as these produces a " conception " of war which furnishes a point of origin , without which we are as uncertain of our bearings as a vessel in a fog . To leave such questions to the individual choice of succeeding commanders-in-chief invites the present state of chronic indecision and chaotic confusion of thought throughout the service , and debars us from the benefit of permanency in any progress that may be made . <p> In concluding this paper it is not out of place to call attention to the fact that the need for unity of service thought is not confined to the floating forces . The preparedness for the fleet for war is closely related to the efficiency of the shore establishment , from which its material wants are filled and upon which it depends for the inception and general direction of its active work . <p> The Navy Department is composed of a number of semi-independent and somewhat loosely organized and coordinated divisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a civilian head who is dependent upon them for advice on technical and military questions . With the best and most honest intentions , the departmental advisers must necessarily give conflicting counsel unless they belong to the same school of thought ; and when no school of thought exists it is inevitable that nearly every officer should have a somewhat different viewpoint and should often hold an opinion at variance with that of every other officer . Consequently it is to be expected that not infrequently each one of the Secretarys advisers will differ in his recommendations from all of his contemporaries in office , and that rarely can a consensus of opinion or any given question be reached . <p> The disastrous results that must follow a failure in Washington to hold similar views about fundamentals are apparent . There can be no fixed policies , no enduring organization , no uniformity of rules and methods and no stable progress . Fleet efficiency must become the football of momentary expediency . Things done today will be undone tomorrow and again done the day after . Who is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long since learned to regard professional advice with suspicion . It is we ourselves who are at fault and we can fairly blame neither Congress , our form of government , the un-military characteristics of the people nor any civilian official . <p> There is no complete cure for any bad condition , and it would be foolish to claim that universal concurrence in a school of thought could absolutely eradicate all these evils ; but on the other hand , in the opinion of the author , such a remedy would go farther to alleviate the troubles indicated at the seat of government than any other single measure that could be adopted . <p> Both ashore and afloat we , therefore , imperatively need first of all a conception of war . Once this is created we will be enabled to proceed , with our eyes open and our course well marked , towards a coherent comprehensive scheme of naval life . Doctrine , methods and rules may be made to flow consistently and logically , therefrom . Strategy , tactics , logistics , gunnery , ship design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramification of the professionmay be developed with confidence and wisdom , and harmoniously interwoven to produce , not merely the present heterogeneous body with a few efficient parts , but exclusively efficient parts well knit into a competent and homogeneous body .

In one of the most complete accountings of such an event , her crew provided a **26;0;TOOLONG report . <p> Robert Hunt , veteran of 12 consecutive war patrols as a torpedoman in the USS Tambor ( SS-198 ) , did not expect to survive World War II . " I was just sure I was going to die , " he recounted as he neared his 90th birthday . " So many of our subs were being lost and so many of my friends were gone . I assumed I 'd go , too , sooner or later . But I knew it would be fast . And that was okay with me . I did n't want to come home wounded . " <p> Postwar analysis supports Hunt 's claim . Fifty-two American submarines-18 percent of those that saw combat-were destroyed , most of them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Tambor came close to joining them . The boat survived 17 hours submerged beneath a skilled destroyer skipper who pinpointed the sub at the bottom of the East China Sea because of air and oil leaks . Years later , when the crew wrote letters to compile a room-by-room report of the action , they made possible a compelling story for two reasons : No other crew had written coordinated letters about such an event , and most who had undergone a similar experience died in their subs . <p> It was during the Tambor 's tenth war patrol , at 2035 on 28 January 1944 , that a convoy heading north was spotted . Visibility was poor , however , and it was difficult to fix its position and course to plan an attack . But finally , at midnight , her captain , Lieutenant Commander Russell Kefauver , latched onto the convoy and approached it on the surface from astern of port . <p> There were seven ships-three large transports escorted by four patrol boats-and Kefauver diagrammed the formation in his patrol report . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lampley stood a lookout post and gunner 's mate Carlos Clifton " Nip " Howard was assigned to the 20-mm gun , in case a " battle surface " was called . Bob Hunt manned the phones in the forward torpedo room , prepared to fire a spread of three torpedoes on orders from the conning tower . In the tower , the captain stood near Bob Dye as the radar officer monitored range from the target . Kefauver asked Executive Officer Ed Spruance , son of Admiral Raymond Spruance , to man the bridge , explaining later , " I did n't want to scare myself by seeing the ships so close . " <p> It would be a close shot-closer , even , than Kefauver intended . He brought the sub to within 1,650 yards of her target when the freighter zigged 45 degrees to the left , unwittingly nearing the Tambor . When the captain gave his order to fire , the range was just 600 yards , near the minimum for the torpedoes to arm before they struck their target . No sooner was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her red truck light , increased speed , and headed for the Tambor . Kefauver ordered the second torpedo away and then turned the boat hard to port to evade the onrushing escort . In the forward room , water flew as the tubes vented into the bilges , sucking air bubbles and seawater back into the boat to prevent detection and maintain the sub 's trim . Then the reload process began , but Bob Hunt knew something was happening above when the boat went to left full rudder and all-ahead full . <h> Close Call <p> Both torpedoes ran properly , and when they hit their target smoke and fire shot from the freighter . At such close range , the impact knocked the Tambor 's lookouts back against the periscope shears . Tom Lampley , the starboard lookout , saw bodies and debris spinning in the flash . The patrol boat , however , continued on , her bow pointed straight at the Tambor , her searchlight probing for the sub . As she loomed , gunner 's mate Howard saw Japanese sailors in white uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kefauver , who had stepped to the bridge to fire the torpedoes , reported , " All hands . . . were convinced that ramming amidships was inevitable . " <p> Tom Lampley , on his lookout perch , braced for impact . " I considered that the patrol boat was 12-15 feet from hitting us , " he recalled . " I know when their searchlights hit me I thought they were bullets and I thought , well , it really do n't hurt to die , after all . " The bullets , however , were flying in the other direction . Firing in a continuous burst , Nip Howard raked the deck of the patrol boat , knocking out the searchlight , sending a hail of fire into the bridge , and stopping the sailors racing for their guns . As the 20-mm gun blazed , the escort was so close that Kefauver read the numbers on her bow by the light of the tracers . Bullets may have struck the Japanese helmsman , because the patrol boat veered off course and passed within a mere 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a front-row balcony view , later said : " I believe that when Nip was shooting out the searchlights and raking the bridge with his fire that the helmsman was knocked down while holding onto the wheel , and as he went down he put right full rudder on his craft . " <p> Bob had listened to the gunfire from below in the forward room , and once he had secured from battle stations learned the full story of the encounter . " We are very lucky to get by with this deal we just pulled , " he wrote in his diary . " This guy on the machine gun will probably get a medal , as he really saved us from getting rammed . " <p> When daylight arrived , the Tambor submerged and patrolled southward along the Ryukyu Islands , surfacing in the evening and heading west to intercept convoys at the mouth of the Formosa Strait . At dawn , 2 February , her radar detected ships that proved to be a freighter and tanker escorted by what appeared to be a brand new destroyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his tracking group planned an approach that would allow the Tambor to fire at both the freighter and tanker with the destroyer on the far side of them . " We sure have a lot of nerve cruising with this can destroyer all night , " Bob wrote in his diary , " but he still does n't know we 're here . " <p> At 0400 3 February , the boat finally made her approach . Bill Reynolds , the portside lookout , faced the Japanese ships . " As always , the queasy feeling in my stomach and the trembling of my legs and hands returned when I heard the target ranges shorten up and eventually when the targets were discernable , " he recalled . In the forward room , Bob and his crewmates had readied all six tubes . At 0416 Bob heard through his headset the order to commence firing a spread of three torpedoes . Everyone in the boat felt the familiar , gentle tug as a burst of compressed air sent each fish out of its tube . As soon as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat and fired a spread of three at the tanker . <p> On the bridge , as soon as the first torpedo left its tube , Kefauver saw the destroyer turn , and Red Mayo heard her change the sonar pinging to a short scale . What happened next the captain recorded tersely in his patrol report : " Saw and heard two hits amidships in freighter followed immediately by one hit just forward of tanker 's stack . Swung right with full rudder and increased speed to flank . Passed 400 yards abeam of tanker . Saw men on fantail of tanker in light of huge fire , which followed explosion on tanker . Intense light silhouetted Tambor , and destroyer began closing the range . " <p> The lookouts remembered that the tanker 's explosion was like nothing they 'd seen before . First , Bill Reynolds had his binoculars trained on the freighter , Ariake Maru , when the torpedoes struck . A plume of seawater flew up , followed by the boom of the explosion that would send it to the bottom . Next he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the same geyser , the same report . A flicker of flame came from the stack and completely died down . Then a sight I 'll never forget . Suddenly night turned into day . The tanker exploded and it looked as though the noon-day sun was shining in the East China Sea . <p> . . . In that hellish light I felt like a naked person on a crowded street with no place to hide . Dive ! Dive ! All hands below ! The claxons sounded and I was the last man down and closed the hatch . Vents were open , all eyes were on the depth gauge , it just hung there , finally a down angle on the bow and from there on my memory is vague . I think I was on the stern planes until we hit bottom . I honestly ca n't remember . <h> The Initial Attack <p> As the Tambor dove , the destroyer passed directly overhead , and the crew heard splashes when the depth charges hit the water . Three exploded close by , shattering gauges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as close , then two more . Reynolds remembered a momentary panic in the control room-the explosions were closer than anything he 'd experienced . But Kefauver gave orders calmly , and due to the captain 's demeanor , Reynolds said , " discipline was returned and we were a crew again . " Kefauver took the sub to the bottom at 268 feet , and the boat went quiet . <p> The Japanese captain pummeling the Tambor knew his business . Methodically , the destroyer made pass after pass , dropping two charges at a time , all of which exploded extremely close by . Each time the crew heard the ship 's approach , a rumble that grew louder until it roared like a steam locomotive crossing a trestle directly overhead . Then , through the hull , they heard the splash of the charges , waited as they sank , then heard and felt the explosion . The shock was like an immense hammer striking the hull . It shattered glass , sent paint fragments and cork flying , and loosened pipe fittings , causing leaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower flooded the control room bilges and ran down to fill the bilges in the pump room below . <p> Enginemen Ray Bouffard and Warren Link , standing in the engine room 's throttle area , felt a blast and saw a wall of water . Their first thought was that the hull had been breached and their boat was finished . Jack Semmelrath and John Scaduto were there , too , and threw out their arms , but the wall of water , instead of flooding over them , persisted eerily in the room . Their arms had passed through a veil of water backlit by a lantern . A cooling water gasket flange on one of the engines had been jarred loose , sending the thin stream across the entire room . As soon as the men realized what had happened , Ray Bouffard tightened the connection and stopped the leak-but there was a more serious problem . The men heard the unmistakable sound of air escaping the boat and quickly concluded that a ruptured line in a nearby ballast tank was leaking . Rising bubbles , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyer . <p> Back in the control room , Nip Howard and Bill Reynolds were sitting on the deck with broken cork lying all around them . " Hey Bill , " Nip said , " are you scared ? " <p> " No , " Bill lied . <p> " Me , neither , " Nip replied . Perhaps saying it would make it so . <p> After an hour of listening to the destroyer churn over them and absorbing the blows of her depth charges , the crew heard a new sound through the hull . It was a loud crackling noise that the long-timers recognized as the sound of a ship 's hull breaking up . One of their targets was imploding as she sank . Then the destroyer passed again and two more close charges banged the Tambor . When one of them exploded , Bob Hunt was standing on a crossbeam used as a support during reloading . The vibration burned his feet as if he stood on hot coals . <p> After two hours there was a lull in the attack , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or sound gear . Kefauver decided to make a move . But that involved starting the loud drain pump to clear the flooded pump room bilges so the boat could be properly balanced . Kefauver later wrote in his report , with heat , " This pump is a menace . " Within minutes the destroyer was upon them again-she had stopped to conceal her presence and listen . Red Mayo , on the sound gear in the forward room , yelled : " The guy is right on the track and coming like hell . " When the sound of the screws came through the hull , Bob felt like they were drilling right into his head . " A very bad moment for all hands and about that time we got what we knew was coming , " he wrote . In 268 feet of water the depth charges sank for 30 agonizing seconds while the crew waited for the inevitable explosions . Two went off close to the Tambor , and minutes later another pair exploded even closer to starboard , causing the sub to hog and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat just about broke in half and did n't seem like she would ever stop shaking . " Kefauver quickly ordered the Tambor back to the bottom . <p> During this action Claude Brown , who had celebrated his 16th birthday earlier in the patrol , met Johnny Scaduto in the engine room . Brown remembered : " We stopped , facing each other , and he had his right hand on the cover of the Kleinschmidt salt water evaporator while I clutched the railings beside the engines . The destroyer roared over and dropped two . . . . I saw a streak of blue fire start from the forward bulkhead , travel the length of the electric cable , and shatter the light bulb over Scaduto 's head raining pieces of glass down into his hair-then he took off running aft as the deck plates shifted under our feet , and I took off running forward to the aft battery compartment . " <h> Two Hours <p> It was now 0655 , and the Tambor had been under attack for more than two hours . As the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , saying , " Some boat-she sure can take it . " But they had to wonder how much more she could take . The Tambor was the first of her class , an older " thin-skinned 250 , " which meant that her steel pressure hull was rated to a maximum depth of 250 feet , compared to the 400-foot rating of the later , thicker-skinned subs . Sitting on the bottom at 268 feet , absorbing blow after blow , the Tambor had taken damage in every compartment . <p> In the maneuvering room , near the back of the sub , water leaked through the packing glands around both screw shafts . When close charges exploded near the boat 's stern , Rex Harvey and Robert Galloway swore they could see flashes around the shafts , followed by the scent of cordite . In an attempt to stem the leaking , Roy " Foo " Rausher fastened a wrench to the tightening nuts and cranked hard . The crew had a saying about Foo , the strongest man on the boat , " When Foo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosen it . " But he could n't stop the leaks around the shafts . If water overflowed the shallow maneuvering-room bilges and rose above the deck plates in the motor room below , the main motors would get wet . So , between depth-chargings , the men formed a bucket brigade , frantically transferring water to the deeper bilges in the aft torpedo room . With every approach of the destroyer , they stopped , closed the water-tight doors between compartments , and sat out the attack . <p> And the attacks kept coming , sometimes 30 minutes apart , but for one terrifying hour they arrived every ten minutes . The destroyer crossed them from port to starboard , then back again , then down the port side , then down the starboard side . She had a fix on the Tambor . With air leaking from the boat , and given good depth and current charts , the Japanese captain could pinpoint the sub 's location . At 0840 , Kefauver recorded : " Destroyer ran down the port side , close aboard and dropped two duds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard falling through the water . " Some crew members recalled hearing these charges land on the deck , roll off , and bounce against the side of the boat . <p> The forward torpedo room was crowded . With the sub sitting on the sea floor , the main sound receiving heads on the bottom of the boat were useless , so radiomen Bill Shoop and Red Mayo were using the auxiliary sound gear there . And since this was the only way to track the destroyer-except when her screws were audible through the hull-the captain was there , too . Bob , in charge of the room , tried to keep his team occupied between attacks , instructing them to shut down leaks , mop up water , and sweep up debris . It was better than having everyone just standing around waiting for the next big jolt . <p> Then a big blast came . It sheared a pair of bolts from the overhead and sent them ricocheting through the compartment like rifle bullets . One bolt with its nut still attached struck Bob Dye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not badly hurt . Bob Hunt knew that the bolts held motors to the overhead , and if more of them were blown off the heavy machines would crash down . He told the men in bunks under them to move so they would n't get hurt when the motors fell . " This did scare the hell out of them , " he wrote in his diary , " but it got them moving rather than laying in a bunk and getting smashed by a motor . " <p> As the attack wore on , Kefauver made his way from room to room , assessing the Tambor 's condition . As he went , he made a point of speaking with every man . And as he departed each compartment he said the same thing , over and over : " I am honored to have served with you . " <p> If it sounded like the captain was preparing for the end , it only made plain what everyone was thinking . Nevertheless , the crew kept working , and gradually the air leaks were brought under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and William Wood , who crawled across the top of the sub 's powerful batteries on a rubber blanket to get into the pressure hull and tighten fittings inside the Number 1 air bank . <p> During the long ordeal , there were periods of quiet when the men tried to get some sleep . One lull persisted for three hours , raising hopes that the destroyer had finally departed . Bob wrote in his diary : <p> Most of us had turned in for some rest as best we could at depth charge stations with water and cork all over everything . About noon we came out of our bunks like divers as the can had eased in and laid one right on top of us . It looks like the end as we thought he was gone and ca n't figure out how he found us there on the bottom . It could only be one thing ? oil leaks . . . . <p> After that , he turned around and headed back ? so close we could hear those screws right through the hull . Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other letting us have a pasting that we were sure the boat would n't stand . We just stood around and waited . <h> Eight Hours <p> It was now past noon , and the Tambor had been under depth-charge attack for eight hours . And still the destroyer dropped charge after charge , all of them on target . Then , in a pause between blasts , Commander Kefauver turned to his long-time crewmate , looked him in the eyes , and asked , " Bob , did you ever hear depth charges this close before ? " <p> " Not that close , captain , " Bob replied . <p> Then Kefauver said , " We 've got to get out of here . " <p> Immediately , he turned and headed to the control room , making his way as quickly as possible through the closed watertight doors of each compartment . Once there , he ordered Chief Bill Blakenbaker to start pumping so the Tambor could get under way . He warned the men , " We may have to surface and fight it out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short work of a sub , but the alternative was waiting for the charge that would breach the Tambor 's hull . <p> Checking the depth gauge , diving officer Blakenbaker saw that the boat had settled 12 feet into the sea bottom . The explosions had churned up sand and muck , and the boat 's vibrations had settled her downward . As he gave instructions , the control room became a hive of activity to break the sub free . The trim manifold men pumped bilges into the sea to lighten the boat , the man on the hydraulic manifold opened and closed valves to shift weight from tank to tank , the men on the blow and vent manifolds did the same , and the crew in the maneuvering room applied power to the screws , running them forward and reversed , one at a time or both at once . The idea was to shift the boat from side to side , forward and back , like rocking a car stuck in mud . <p> Jack Semmelrath , in the forward engine room , watched anxiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was concerned about the waning battery power . " That was the real danger at this point , " he thought , " NO BATTERY , NO PUMPS . " The Tambor was stuck fast with dwindling air and power , and making a lot of noise for the destroyer above . <p> The crew on a submerged sub after 14 hours begins to experience shortness of breath as the oxygen content of the air diminishes . During the near-fatal East China Sea depth-charging , the Tambor remained submerged for 17 hours . <p> Methodically , Blakenbaker searched for just the right combination of weight distribution and thrust to free the boat . Bob remembered the ordeal of freeing the sub from the bottom lasting for about two hours . Clarence Erich thought it was five . <p> When at last the sub broke free , the crew was in for a white-knuckle ride . With flooded rooms , the boat-badly out of balance-tipped side to side and nosed upward , out of control . The control room gauges no longer worked , or flying debris had knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel , continuing to pump water and air among various tanks . The trick was to keep the Tambor more or less upright and to keep her from broaching the surface where the destroyer would finish her off with gunfire . Blakenbaker called for full power on both screws to steady the boat , but trim was hard to establish . With great expertise and quick responses in the control and maneuvering rooms , he gradually brought the sub under control and kept her beneath the surface . Given a stabilized boat , Kefauver maneuvered , running for deeper water . The destroyer dropped another charge , and Red Mayo , still in the forward room , listened intently to its movements . <h> Breaking Free <p> For another two hours the Tambor took evasive action , listening for the destroyer and waiting for full darkness . Finally , at 2100 , Kefauver dared to surface the boat while improvising a tactic to conceal his position . On the way up , the helmsman fought to maintain his given heading , indicating a strong underwater current . Observing this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing any leaks of air or fuel oil to be carried far behind . <p> When the Tambor reached the surface , Kefauver could n't be sure he 'd lost the enemy , and even opening the conning tower hatch would be a risky venture . Without functioning gauges , equalizing the pressure in the boat with the pressure outside was a matter of guesswork , and when the hatch popped it nearly carried a man up the ladder . In the burst of decompression , the air in the conning tower turned smoky and blue . When the lookouts ran topside and scanned the area , however , they were relieved to see that a surface battle was not necessary . The East China Sea was dark around them . The Tambor had escaped . <p> By daylight the next morning , repair parties examined the sub topside and were shocked by what they found . Jack Semmelrath marveled at the white blotches on the superstructure that smelled like TNT . Jagged pieces of depth-charge shrapnel were embedded in the wooden decking . On the aft deck , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite the bracket that held its barrel in place . The conning tower had been driven back three inches against the pressure hull and was misaligned . And , most disturbing , a 21-inch-long crack was visible in the outer hull . From the split , thousands of gallons of fuel oil leaked from the port-side fuel ballast tank . <p> The Tambor continued to trail oil , her ability to dive was compromised , she could not radio her location or condition and was nearly blinded by the damage to her periscopes and radar , and her only remaining weapons were the 20-mm gun , small arms , and the forward tubes . But without a working Torpedo Data Computer , it would be hard to hit anything with the remaining fish . Again , the crew went to work . <p> To reattach the turbo blower to its base , Gus Builder and Warren Link used the boat 's lathe to fashion new bolts from raw stock . Builder hand-filed the bolt 's hexagonal heads and retapped the old holes , and the blower was soon back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoring it to use . Builder and Art Strickle cannibalized the two ruined compressors to make one good one , and the Tambor could once again jam air for future dives . <p> Bill Shoop , Harvey Refensterf , and Red Mayo worked to re-establish radio communication , drying the transmitter and running a lead up through the control room and the conning tower hatch to serve as an antenna . In case of a crash dive , a man was stationed at the hatch with an axe to chop through the lead . In this radio work , Red Mayo was hampered only slightly by the deafness in one ear caused by the explosions that had boomed in his headset . The radiomen managed to achieve a short-range signal , but it was not strong enough to reach an American outpost . So they did not hear that Tokyo Rose reported the Tambor 's destruction , a report that did reach Gunnery Officer Vito Vitucci 's wife , who worked at the Naval Communications Station in Washington , D.C. <h> Combat Ready-Almost <p> As repairs continued , Bob Dye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out leads on the tube that drove the SD radar coils . Without radar , there would be no advance warning of aircraft . And without the Torpedo Data Computer , their most potent weapon was compromised , so a plan was devised to retrieve its dials from the bottom of the periscope well . Warren Link was the skinniest man on board , and he agreed to be lowered into the narrow well . Walter Post and Elmer Atchison fashioned a yoke out of heaving lines and a pillow , and Link went down head first , with ropes tied to his ankles and a flashlight hanging from his neck . It was a tight fit , and only the grease smeared on his skin allowed Link to slide 35 feet down the dark well . When they pulled him out after several tense minutes he was holding the crucial dials . Then , after 14 hours of continuous work , Post had the TDC working again . <p> The boat would have no aft protection , however . Neither the deck gun nor the aft torpedo tubes could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his men tried , both of their hatches continued to leak . More serious than the leaking hatches was the cracked fuel ballast tank . After three days of repair work , on 7 February , Bob wrote in his diary : <p> Still have an oil leak and we 're spreading oil all over the ocean-tried again to send the message but ca n't get it through . . . . Have all repairs made in the forward room and are now looking for the Jap again-we 're in very bad shape to be operating out here , but if we can get the oil leak stopped we wo n't be in so much danger . <p> Two days later , the leak was finally located and a repair plan devised . After the remaining fuel was shifted to other tanks , the damaged tank had to be flushed to fully stop the trail of remaining oil . Its pumps had to be converted to draw and expel seawater as in a regular ballast tank . The task required two men to go under the main deck , crawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plates . This could only be done with the boat on the surface in broad daylight . Warren Link and John Scaduto , nicknamed " the Oil King " for his work with the fuel supply , volunteered for the job . Kefauver warned them : He would not jeopardize the boat and the entire crew if the Tambor was spotted . He would have to dive , even if the two men could not crawl out and reach the hatch in time . <p> Working in close quarters by the light of a lantern shone down through the slats of the topside deck , Scaduto and Link worked quickly but carefully , tucking nuts and bolts into their breast pockets as they went . Deep in enemy waters , just miles from Japanese territory , a plane could appear at any moment , especially with the early-warning SD radar out . The duo understood the situation and finished their work with dispatch . When , at last , they tightened the final bolts , the converted valves were tested and they roared , producing the same sound the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cramped space and ran for the hatch , shouting as he went : " Do n't get in my way !

All tubes will fire by hand ; continued electrical work . Considered boat to be in fighting trim again . Commenced patrolling an easterly course . " <p> The Tambor and her crew had been at sea for 36 days , nearly all of that time in enemy waters . After the boat 's near destruction , first by ramming and then during the long depth-charging-and operating now with extensive damage that included foggy vision through her single remaining periscope-the Tambor resumed her mission . <p> Four days later she sank the Ronsan Maru , a 2,700 ton passenger-cargo ship , and then survived another 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days late-the crew learned that their mail had not been forwarded from Pearl Harbor .

Todays demand for stronger U.S. sea power harkens back to arguments made by Alfred Thayer Mahan in The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660-1783 . It is hard to imagine that a book published in 1890 still would have significance for modern naval forces , but if you scrutinize key naval events of the past century you will find elements of Mahans thinking in the German strategy for World War I and Japans strategy for World War II . When I commanded counterpiracy Task Force 151 in 2009 , the commander of the Chinese task force in the Gulf of Aden , Rear Admiral Du Jingchen , visited me on board the USS Boxer ( LHD-4 ) . We discussed two topics of naval strategylogistics for forward-deployed naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral John Richardsons " Design for Maintaining Maritime Superiority " says , " the essence of Mahans vision still pertains " to maritime forces today .

The launch of these cruise missiles demonstrates the U.S. Navys ability to execute orders from the National Command Authority without the permission of another nation state . <p> Last year , the USS Wasp ( LHD-1 ) Amphibious Ready Group ( ARG ) conducted Operation Odyssey Lightning strike operations in Libya . In response to a request from Libyas Government of National Accord , the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps team carried out precision air strikes against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant in Sirte , Libya , for almost four months . <p> Another recent hallmark maritime operation was carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( WMSL-754 ) seized 16 tons of cocaine with an estimated street value of $420 million in the eastern Pacific .

Recent events and the thinking of Mahan both confirm the need for a strong , capable Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard . The question facing us is will our maritime forces be able to maintain their advantage within the current budget constraints ? Admiral Richardson has argued for a larger fleet , stating , " The opposing team is making this game a lot closer than we feel comfortable . " Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Paul Zukunft has testified that his maritime forces have " 80 percent awareness " of all illegal operations , and " we can only act on about 20 percent of that because of the resource constraints we have .

It has intrigued World War II aircraft buffs for more than half acentury . Form follows function , and the unusual design resulted from a skillful blending of mission requirements with engineering-design expertise by the original de signers at Chance Vought Aircraft in East Hartford , Connecticut , in 1938 . <p> The name came from the Vought O2U- and O3U-series observation airplanes that first bore the name Corsair Navy and Marine Corps pilots logged many hours in these sturdy aircraft , mainstays of the airborne Navy in the late 1920s and early 1930s . Later , the name Corsair lived on in the Vought A-7 Corsair II , which performed so admirably in Vietnam and Operation Desert Storm . Chance Milton Vought 's O2U first flew in 1926 ; the Navy 's last Corsair II squadron was decommissioned in 1991 , but Greek and Portuguese pilots are still flying the aircraft . Back in 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed that they were creating a legend . <p> In the late 1930s , as Europe headed for war , Chance Vought Aircraft , a division of United Aircraft Corporation , was working with the Navy 's Bureau of Aeronautics on the preliminary design for a high-performance , carrier-based fighter to be built around the new Pratt &amp; Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engine . The Double Wasp developed 1,850 horsepower for takeoff and had the potential for reaching 2,000 horsepowerquite an increase from Pratt &amp; Whitney 's 1,000-horsepowet Twin Wasp . The Navy asked for proposals early in 1938 , and that spring Vought submitted its proposalcompany designation V-166 . <p> The design team had to resolve many conflicting requirements before arriving at the final configuration for an aircraft that promised speeds of 400 miles per hour , and one of the key constraints was the large-diameter propeller required to convert the high engine power to the thrust necessary to achieve maximum performance . The aerodynamicists calculated the static thrust necessary to accelerate the aircraft to takeoff speed and tried to minimize propeller tip-speed compressibility losses in order to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight regimes-takeoff , climb , cruise , and top speed . Using a new Hamilton Standard propeller design handbook , they determined that the aircraft required a 13-foot , 3-inch three-bladed propeller . By 1938 standards , it was a very big prop . <p> Excellent slow-speed characteristics in the landing configuration and good stall indications were required for carrier compatibility , but Chief Engineer Rex B. Beisel made it clear to his 90- man engineering staff on many occasions that " speed is king " and there would be no compromises on that point . We already had the biggest engine available , so it was obvious that the only way to increase performance was to decrease drag . The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA-later NASA ) had sent us a number of technical reports relating to the optimum position of the wing relative to the fuselage , i.e. , mid-wing versus low wing . <p> The reports showed that the mid-wing configuration , with the wing meeting the fuselage at an angle of 90 , was superior in achieving low drag . The low-wing position resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wing 's trailing edge where a cusp formed with the convex underside of the fuselage . While this could be ameliorated somewhat by using a fillet or fairing along the trailing edge of the wing-fuselage intersection , it was evident that the wing must join the fuselage at right angles similar to a mid-wing configuration if the fighter were to have any chance of achieving the desired speeds . <p> Still another important design constraint was the length of the landing gear that would retract into the wing . The structures and weights people pointed out that the large-diameter propeller and the mid-wing configuration would dictate a long and heavy landing gear and a complex and costly folding mechanism . <p> The Corsair 's distinctive gull-wing design actually emerged from a small engineering meeting in Rex 's office , which had assembled to resolve the conflicting design requirements . The writer recalls that among those present were : Beisel ; James M. Shoemaker , Assistant Chief Engineer ; Paul S. Baker , Chief of Aerodynamics and Flight Test ; William C. Schoolfield , Head of Aerodynamics ; Earnest Mailloux @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Weights ; Fred N. Dickerman , Design ; and yours truly , Aerodynamics . The group reviewed a number of aircraft configurations that had been generated in preliminary design studies . <p> Assessing the options while sketching on a desk pad , Rex conjectured that if the wing in front view had to be normal to the fuselage at its intersection for low drag , and the landing gear had to be short , why not just leave the wing low , put a little bend in it at the landing gear station , and let it rise to meet the fuselage at right angles ? <p> Then , going outboard , the curved section could rise , meeting the outer panel at the wing-fold station . He also pointed out that such an arrangement would permit an even shorter landing gear than a low-wing . The aerodynamicists confirmed that this configuration would provide essentially the same low drag as a mid-wing . It became clear that the inverted gull wing was the best approach , and Beisel directed that it be incorporated as the basic element of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is history . <p> The detail design work began with a contract go-ahead for the prototype XF4U-1 in June 1938 . The Chance Vought Air-U.S . Navycraft plant was moved from East Hartford to Stratford , Connecticut , in 1939 where the design continued as engineers and manufacturing experts worked out the details . They solved the problem of incorporating slotted flaps in the curved gull-wing section and , taking a tip from the SB2U-1 Vindicator , developed a landing-gear retraction mechanism that folded back and rotated 90 , permitting the wheel to be housed flat within the thickness of the wing . To reduce drag , the cockpit and canopy were streamlined into the fuselage ; in later models , however , the cockpit was raised and the canopy redesigned to improve visibility . <p> The Corsair 's horizontal and vertical tail configuration was similar to that of the Vindicator and the OS2U-1 Kingfisher . In an effort to get the last knot of speed , the engine exhaust stacks were designed to provide some jet thrust . Speed was indeed king . <p> Fabricating the curved wing center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rex Beisel recognized the complexity of the task and assigned the best designers to tackle the problem . The centerpiece of the effort was a massive jig fixture assembly built by the artisans in the tool shop . The key to assembling the wing main spar , firewall bulkhead , and other structural components , it was more comprehensive and intricate than any fixture previously used in aircraft manufacturing , and it stood tall in the shop as a tribute to Vought 's manufacturing ingenuity . <p> The designers knew that fighters needed a high roll rate with light aileron forces and the Corsair design emphasized maneuverability . To achieve it , they incorporated a variable lateral control linkage in the experimental XF4U-1 and used wooden ailerons to facilitate modifications to the aerodynamic nose balance . As the flight tests proceeded , the aerodynamicists and engineers varied the control linkage and whittled the aileron nose shape until they had what they wanted : a highly maneuverable production F4U-1 fighter that proved vastly superior to the Japanese Zero . Early production Corsairs also had wooden ailerons ; one of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ailerons as accurately as the wooden ones that performed so well . They didand Vought took its final step in the conversion from wooden to metal aircraft construction . <p> Other wing features included a leading-edge air intake at the fuselage intersection that provided cooling air for the oil system and the engine supercharger inter-stage . Under certain flight conditions , particularly high-speed dives , the intakes created a distinct screaming or high-pitched whistling sound . Japanese ground troops under attack by Corsairs soon linked the sound with the fearsome ordnance capabilities of the bent-wing bird . Because of this , and the Corsair 's superior air combat capabilities , the Japanese referred to the F4U as " Whistling Death . " <p> The distinctive aircraft acquired many nicknames . Navy and Marine Corps pilots called it " Hose Nose " and " Hog " because of the long fuselage and large engine cowling , especially as viewed from the cockpit ; " U-Bird " and " Bent-Wing " followed . New Zealanders dubbed their F4Us the " Kiwi Corsair " and U.S. Marine Corps infantrymen called it " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-fought campaign to capture the island . <p> Design of the production F4U-1 began in December 1940 and Navy officials signed an initial production contract for 584 aircraft in June 1941 . The first production Corsair flew in June 1942 . There were many models of the Corsair , from the XF4U-1 through the F4U-7 , spanning the years from 1940 through 1953 , and including the AU-1 ( F4U-6 ) , built specifically for ground-attack . Each version was either an improvement or a modification , such as the F4U-5N night fighter that carried a radar mounted in a fairing on the right wing . The F4U-5NL was a winterized version of the -5N that had been modified for operations in the Korean War . The F4U-5P was a photographic reconnaissance version . <p> More than 11,000 Corsairs were built during the war approximately 6,600 at the Vought plant in Stratford ; 4,000 at the Goodyear plant in Akron , Ohio ; and 735 by Brewster on Long Island . During 1944 , when the plants worked around the clock , the production rate exceeded 550 aircraft per month-18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days but not without its problems . A few days of bad weather or a lack of ferry pilots resulted in Corsairs lining both sides of all available runways . <p> Early in the flight test program , the XF4U-1 became the first single-engine fighter to break the 400 mile-per-hour barrier in level flight . The Corsair 's speed , maneuverability , and climb rate enabled it to achieve an outstanding combat record in the Pacific : 2,140 enemy planes destroyed against 189 lossesbetter than an 11:1 ratio . <p> The Corsair 's up-rated power plants gave it improved performance throughout the war . The XF4U-1 was built around the P&amp; W R-2800-4 engine rated at 1,850 horse power . The F4U-5 used an R-2800-32W that produced 2,200 horsepower and enabled the aircraft to reach 465 miles-per-hour in level flight . <p> Armament also increased : <p> The XF4U-1 had two .30-caliber machine guns synchronized to fire through the propeller and two wing-mounted .50-caliber machine . <p> The F4U-1 A carried six.50-caliber gunsthree per wing . <p> The F4U-1C carried four 20-mm cannontwo per wing . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Pacific Marines and Chance Vought field representatives had jury-rigged with bomb rack s ) eventually carried a 2,000-pound bomb load .

Vought produced 306 Corsairs in Texas ; the last 94 F4U-7s went to the French Navy in 1953 . Overall production totaled more than 12,000 aircraft , as Corsairs enjoyed a longer production run than any other U.S. propeller-driven fighter . <p> Corsairs served in many foreign countries after World War II . U.S. Marines flew Corsairs in peace-keeping efforts in China at the close of the war and the French and British continued to fly their Corsairs , using them in Indochina , Algeria , and during the Suez Crisis .

He , too , decided that the use of a permanent deck was the logical method for launching a scouting airplane from a ship . His means were limited and , while he was searching for an available ship , the World made known its plans . Captain Chambers made no efforts to instigate a race for the accomplishment of this experiment . He did , however , want to see the project arrive at a successful conclusion .

He emphatically refused to attempt the flight and no amount of persuasion would alter his decision . <p> As if by divine arrangement , Eugene Ely happened to be passing by .

Army and Navy observers were invited to attend the performance , for the World was sincerely attempting to prove the usefulness of the airplane in naval warfare . The same experiment would prove the case of the Hamburg-American Line which contributed the Pennsylvania for the test . <p> The plane was to fly from the ship one half-hour after she had sailed on her regular transatlantic trip .

The Pennsylvania steamed out to sea as a normal vessel and not as the first airplane carrier . <p> Captain Chambers waited with much interest for the results of the World 's activities . A wire informed him of McCurdy 's accident . Taking the train he went to Norfolk and worked with renewed vigor , making final preparations for the Navy 's attempt . <p> The morning of November 14 dawned far from favorable for the impending flight . The weather was unsettled with low clouds and occasional showers of rain and hail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a working party of men before reveille with orders to " roll Mr. Ely 's aeroplane down the dock and hoist it aboard . " As the Birmingham steamed down to Hampton Roads , Ely installed his favorite four-cylinder engine in the plane . Thus , without an air test of the installation , he was going to attempt the novel flight . The craft 's past performance , however , was excellent . It had already won Glenn Curtiss $10,000 by making the memorable flight from Albany to New York . <p> The original plans were to steam out into Chesapeake Bay and head the ship into the wind at a speed of 10 knots . The plane was to take off and fly to the Norfolk Navy Yard along a path of destroyers . The weather was so thick that the landmarks were obscured and the cruiser anchored off Old Point Comfort to wait for a possible improvement . Shortly after noon the sky cleared most encouragingly . The destroyers were sent out on station and the ship got under way to begin the flight operations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were again delayed . <p> Weather reports indicated that a storm could be expected on the following day . It thus became imperative that the experiment be carried out as scheduled . At about three o'clock in the afternoon the lowering southern sun peeked through the clouds for a few moments . It was decided to begin operations at once . The destroyers once more set out at full speed to take their positions . <p> Ely put on his life preserver and climbed into his craft to test out the engine . As his propeller reached full speed , the slip stream disconcerted those on the bridge considerably and the process of getting the ship under way was slowed down . The anchor chain was slowly coming aboard with much clanking . Impatient and eager , Ely once more turned his engine up full . Glancing around to make sure that he was clear he gave his mechanic a nod of his head , which was the signal to release the securing cable of the plane ... <p> Only a 57-foot run was available for him to take off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the meantime , the wind had shifted to slightly athwartship and was now causing the pilot some difficulty in maintaining a straight course down the narrow platform . Nearer and nearer came the deck - and still the plane was not flying ! It was too late to stop . As the machine reached the end of the runway it leaped into space and began to settle . <p> Ely , sitting in the flimsy outrigger , nosed his plane down for the water . If his craft left the deck without flying speed , he had planned to allow it to drop far enough to give his wings the lift which would carry him safely ashore . Down , down , he went . The 37-foot clearance was nearly used up . At last , satisfied that his faithful machine would respond to the controls , he pulled back on the elevators . Obeying his touch , the craft hesitated in its plunge , quivered and began to level off . Too late , however , to get away cleanly , for the wheels touched the water with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both propeller tips struck the spray and were splintered , but the engine never faltered and the plane began to climb away from the water 's surface . <p> The aviator lost his bearings due to poor visibility . Not knowing how badly his craft had been damaged in its contact with the water , he decided to land at his first opportunity . A broad , sandy beach loomed up ahead and he came down safely on the north side of Willoughby Spit after a flight of four minutes . <p> The first flight from a " carrier " had been made . Ely asked no compensation for his services . He was rewarded with a letter from Secretary of the Navy Myers for performing the experiment which was described as " being valuable for the possibilities of naval scouting . " <p> To complete the test , it was decided to have a plane fly aboard a ship . Glenn Curtiss who had moved his forces to San Diego , was consulted on this more difficult experiment . Ely ! in the meantime , had rejoined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight . <p> The cruiser Pennsylvama , already in San Francisco Bay , was ordered up to the navy yard at Mare Island to be fitted out according to the requirements of Ely and Curtiss . A wooden platform 120 feet long and 32 feet wide was built on top of the after 8-inch turret , with the forward end 5 feet higher that the after end . At the stern the deck sloped down abruptly at an angle of 30 . This ramp was intended to prevent a crashed plane from falling into the ships propellers and is still used on modern-day carriers . At the side of the platform were fitted guard rails to prevent the plane running overboard . A huge canvas screen was erected at the forward end of the runway to stop the plane and safeguard the pilot if the machine over ran the deck . Canvas nets were stretched along the side to catch the machine if it jumped over the rails . <p> In the original plans the plane was to be stopped by the upward slope of the deck and the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for braking must be provided . It was finally decided to use a series of sandbags which would progressively add resistance to the plane 's movement . Accordingly , twenty-two pairs of 50-pound sandbags were rigged up . At intervals of three feet lines were stretched taut across the deck and suspended about twelve inches above it . At each end was attached a sandbag . In this way , seventy-five feet of the platform 's surface was covered with athwartship lines . The Curtiss plane was fitted with three pairs of flat steel hooks . A metal air tank was secured to either side of the plane and a skid was placed forward to prevent nosing up if it should land in the water . Otherwise it was a normal landplane with rubber landing wheels . <p> It was originally planned to make the attempt while the ship was under way , but these plans were changed at a conference with Ely . On the morning of January 18 , 1911 the Pennsylvania was lying at anchor in San Francisco Bay . In spite of a light 10-mile wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Gate , riding to a flood tide . This was the worst possible condition for the experiment , as it would force Ely to land down wind . In spite of the unfavorable wind , the confident pilot took off from Presidio field . <p> Flying down the bay , and to leeward of the Pennsylvania , he turned around and began his approach to the smallest landing field yet known . The tail wind had shifted slightly across his course and . gave him some trouble in flying straight on to the center line of the deck . If he failed now , naval aviation would receive a tremendous setback , for , during the preparations , both flyers and newspapers did not hesitate to flay the Navy for this attempt . Endangering a man 's life ! Too hazardous ! Airplanes were not built for the sea ! <p> When seventy-five feet from the cruiser , Ely steadied down and came on at the platform , straight as an arrow . The crowds which were perched all over the ship 's superstructure were too fascinated at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform now began to edge away as they watched the plane flying straight at them . No use taking a chance ! <p> Pulling his plane up sharply to clear the ramp , Ely closed his throttle and waited for his craft to settle downward . His speed of thirty-nine miles an hour over the deck was sufficient to carry him over the first eleven lines rigged to stop him . Settling however his machine struck the deck and began to roll . The hooks on the plane were held down to the deck by bungee cord . Scraping along the platform they engaged the athwartship lines . <p> As the plane moved forward the sandbags of the engaged lines were pulled along the deck . Each three feet of forward progress brought another hundred pounds of resistance into action . The 1,000-pound plane had insufficient momentum to struggle against this load and came to a stop as it picked up the twenty-second line . After this 30-foot run it still had fifty feet to go before it reached the end of the platform . The airplane carrier had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its complete silence . Then , realizing that the test had been successfully accomplished , a roar went up that reached the eager audience on the beach . Taking up the chorus , whistles passed the word ashore and soon the entire city was rejoicing . Telegraphs and cables immediately got into action and the naval boards of all the important powers were set to pondering upon this upstart , aviation . <p> After staying on board for forty-five minutes , Ely had his plane turned around . The stern wind now helped him and he took off in the manner of a veteran . His machine leveled off when ten feet above the water . <p> It was evident that if planes were to be operated from war vessels in a manner such as Ely 's , many of the turrets would be placed out of commission . Other means had to be devised if the offensive power of the battleship which carried the planes was not to be reduced measurably . It was suggested that seaplanes alone be used for they could be hoisted over the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , were undeveloped at this time and for a while it appeared that they would always be fragile . <p> Others thought that landplanes would furnish the eventual solution of the problem . Naval authorities were divided into two schools of thought . One maintained that it would be better to make the battleship self-sufficient . by providing space for launching and landing planes on each individual man-of-war . The second group thought it would be better and more efficient to provide a central base such as a ship devoted exclusively to aviation purposes . In this thought we have the kernel of the idea of the modern airplane carrier . <p> Lieutenant la Point of the French Navy , in 1912 , accurately predicted the future carrier when he said , " In order to be of any real value such a ship must be a great vessel w1th enormous deck space and with a speed equal to that of the fleet . " <p> Captain Chambers now turned his attention to the catapult as a means of launching planes from the confined space of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cumbersome deck which interfered with the use of the guns . The burden of developing the earner now shifted to Great Britain with France and Germany taking some interest in it . The United States was not to join in this work until after the conclusion of the war . <p> A year after Ely 's memorable flight , Commander C. R. Samson of the Royal Navy flew a short biplane equipped with wheels from a temporary platform mounted on the deck of H.M.S. Africa while she was at anchor in Sheerness Harbor . These experiments became more advanced and on May 8 , 1912 , Samson and Lieutenant Malone made two flights from H.M.S. Hibernia while she was under way at 12-knots speed . A Farman plane fitted with pontoons mounting small runner wheels was used on this occasion . <p> In the meantime , Glenn Curtiss had developed the seaplane to a degree that it could survive a moderate sea . Moreover , he had flown his hydroplane out to the U.S.S. Pennsylvania where it was hoisted on board . Lowered over the side , he flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be fitted with a detachment of seaplanes . With this in mind , the French Navy set aside the repair ship La Foudre to be used for their aviation forces . This was the first ship to be placed at the exclusive disposal of aviation personnel . No attempts were made to launch planes from her decks . Seaplanes were operated and these were lowered over the side by means of booms . <p> The British continued their experiments and in 1913 many flights were made from the cruiser Hermes . A Caudron seaplane with an 80-horsepower engine was used for these tests . The floats of the craft were mounted on small wheeled trucks which rolled down narrow troughs fitted on the forecastle of the cruiser . As the plane attained air speed and mounted aloft the trucks continued on their way and fell overboard . These tests were fairly successful but the British also decided that the guns were interfered with and that tests on a normal war vessel were impractical . <p> During the course of these experiments a proposal was made to the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the express purpose of carrying seaplanes . This suggestion was held m abeyance until some definite conclusion could be reached concerning the results of the Hermes trials . Upon the abandonment of the long launching platform and , influenced somewhat by the French , the English in 1914 purchased the freighter Ark Royal and fitted her out with ten seaplanes . The attempt to fly planes off a deck was definitely given up for the time being . <p> The advent of the World War brought home to the British the enormous possibilities of the plane carrier . The fuel capacity of seaplanes based in England did not permit their use an offensive effort against the German coast . To offset this disadvantage , they took over several fast channel steamers and fitted them out with equipment for handling seaplanes . Among them were the Engadine , Empress , and Riviera . Planes from these vessels carried out a raid against the German dirigible base at Cuxhaven on Christmas Eve , 1914 . The airships were not located , but the threat of future raids weakened the morale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack were invaluable to the Allies . True , the material damage was not excessively large , but the threat of repeated raids was sufficient to cause the withdrawal from the front of an effective force of fighting planes for the purpose of defending the German coast . <p> The British converted the steamship Campania into a carrier during the latter part of 1914 by fitting her to carry and operate seaplanes , and providing a 120-foot flying+ off deck in the bow . She had an elevator 01 lowering her planes to the storage space below . With a capacity of seven reconnaissance and six fighting planes she was a powerful potential threat . Unfortunately , her slow speed of 22 knots allowed her to accompany the fleet only under the most favorable conditions . It is to be observed that the Campania was fitted with a flyingoff deck . Further experiments with motherships had convinced the naval authorities that the North Sea was generally too rough to permit satisfactory seaplane operations . It thus became necessary to launch planes from the deck of a ship . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decks of the new carrier . This plane was of the type which had won the Schneider cup race the preceding year . As before , the pontoon was mounted on a small truck fitted with wheels . When the craft took the air after a short run , the truck rolled on and fell into the sea . <p> The usefulness of aircraft for scouting was becoming more and more evident . The time had come for planes to accompany the fleet on its excursions and routine sweeps of the North Sea . As a test , H.M.S. Revenge shot a target practice with an observer in a seaplane controlling the gunfire of the ship . The results were excellent . Officers in the fleet became enthusiastic about this new function of the naval plane and urged that each major ship be supplied with one . During the Allied campaign at Gallipoli and the Dardanelles several converted mother-ships were used , though they suffered heavy losses . Kite balloon ships were also used during this offensive . The Germans were especially desirous of sinking any ship that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Hermes off the British coast . <p> During the battle of Jutland in May , 1916 , the mother-ship Engadine was the only plane carrier operating with the fleet . In the early phases of the fighting she put over a Short seaplane equipped with a 225-horsepower Sunbeam engine . The plane did some useful observation work , even though the range of both the craft and its radio was limited . Had suitable planes been available to the English the High Seas Fleet would probably not have been able to make its getaway under cover of the smoke and haze . <p> The Admiralty 's answer to the need for more plane carriers was the conversion of the partially built cruiser H.M.S. Furious . As first designed , she had only a forward flying-off platform . Her complement of four Short seaplanes and six Sopwith scouts on pontoons were flown from the ship with ease , but because of lack of suitable hoisting gear it was only with difficulty that they could be taken aboard . To solve this problem attempts were made to fly landplanes on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge he would skid across the vessel and attempt to align his plane with the center line of the landing deck . Frequently the handling crew would actually pull the plane out of the air . Practically every landing resulted in a more or less serious accident and this form of returning the planes to the ship was quickly abandoned . The first fatal accident from carrier landings resulted from these experiments . <p> Further , platforms were built on the turrets of practically all ships of the Grand Fleet larger than the light cruiser . These platforms were so short that they did not interfere with the operation of the guns . A 50-foot run was considered long enough in most cases and from these Sopwith Camels flew regularly . The 150-horsepower engine with which these craft were equipped could barely pull the plane into the air before striking the sea . Nevertheless , Sopwith two seaters fitted with radio were later used from these improvised decks . All these landplanes were normally operated close to shore where they could land safely . It was planned , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to end their flight by landing alongside a destroyer where the personnel would be picked up . <p> By the close of the war as many as fifty landplanes were taken to sea by the Grand Fleet . It was particularly desired to use these planes against Zeppelins . Heretofore the heavy seaplanes had tried in vain to reach the altitude so easily attained by the lighter-than-air craft . Such an occasion arose in August , 1917 , when the L-23 , commanded by Captain Dinter , was shot down off the Danish coast by a plane launched from an English light cruiser . A high percentage of deck planes were lost . The strain on the aviators assigned to this duty was enormous . To provide them with some degree of safety , flotation gear was rigged in each plane , consisting of rubber bags which could be inflated by the pilot after he had landed in the water . Sufficient buoyancy was sought for a floating period of twelve hours . This was nearly as great a factor of safety as could be provided by a seaplane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the German coast lay just outside the bombing range of her aircraft . In an attempt to convey aircraft closer to the objective , efforts were made to develop a small speed boat which could carry a plane . No provision was made for a forward run of the aircraft . Its engines were to be opened full out when the motor boat had worked up to its maximum speed and headed into the wind . It was thus hoped to give the plane sufficient air speed to lift itself out of the boat and maintain itself in the air . Although the trials worked out very well the rough seas under actual operating conditions prevented the boat from attaining its maximum speed . The frail craft proved unable to carry out the plans of the designers . <p> Another method was to mount scout planes on light barges which were towed by destroyers at full speed . The barge never permitted the aircraft to have a run of more than fifteen feet , but the trials were entirely successful . The operating conditions in open water proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not without having waged one successful action . The L-53 commanded by Captain Proelss , was watching with great curiosity a destroyer towing an empty barge . It failed to see the little scout that had just taken the air . One burst from the fighter 's machine gun was sufficient to send the airship to its doom . <p> Another scheme was to tow huge lighters loaded with fully equipped seaplanes to a point within striking distance of the German North Sea coast . Here sea valves were to be opened which would flood the lighters , thus allowing the planes to drift off the deck into the sea . During one of the experiments photographs of the proceedings were taken by a Zeppelin . As the element of surprise was removed the system was given up . <p> As we have seen , landplanes shad been flown from the decks of both earners and men-of-war , but they could be landed only on shore or alongside a vessel . In any case , their usefulness to their ship was ended for the time being . Seaplanes were slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriers , but they were forced to land alongside their mother-ship and be hoisted aboard . This required that the ship stop dead in the water , a dangerous procedure in the war zone . Besides the sea was frequently too rough to permit such a maneuver . This brought about an early demand for a ship which could not only launch a plane but also receive it on board without damage . Landings on the forward deck of the Furious had failed . Obviously the solution of the problem was to construct a landing deck on the stern of the vessel . <p> In 1918 a 300-foot flying-on deck was added to the stern of the Furious at the expense of an 18-inch gun previously mounted there . A narrow runway around either side of the smokestack and mast allowed the planes to be transported back and forth between the two flying decks . A similar vessel , the Vindictive , was completed m the autumn of the same year . The remodeled Furious carried out a highly successful raid in July , 1918 . Accompanied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Tondern the base of the Zeppelins wh1ch had been making night raids on London . Before daybreak a flight of seven landplanes took off with two SO-pound bombs each . The group made direct hits on the two large airship sheds and completely destroyed the L-54 and L-60 . <p> Had the war continued the new British carrier , Argus , would have contributed greatly to the success of the Grand Fleet many engagement . It was the first . of the clear-decked carriers and had a flying deck 68 feet in width and 500 feet in length . The possibility of eddy currents interfering with the pilot during a landing caused the designers to install horizontal smokestacks . <p> The first aircraft assigned to the remodeled Furious were mounted on skids not unlike skis . To enable these craft to take off from the bow , troughs with specially prepared sliding surfaces were laid fore-and-aft . When released the skids of the plane slid down these troughs until flying speed was attained . During the landing , the resistance was sufficient to stop the aircraft after only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot who failed to touch his runners far enough aft , a series of 2-inch manila lines were hung at 2-foot intervals from a boom extending across the entire both of the ship . The boom was placed at the forward end of the landing deck of the plane over ran the deck , it was Immediately enmeshed in the heavy lines and stopped with no injury to the pilot . <p> The method first suggested by Pegoud , the famous French aviator , in 1912 , was also tried for landing a plane on board . From the machine a vertical hook was mounted . A long fore-and-aft cable was suspended at a height of about fifteen feet from the deck . The pilot endeavored to engage his hook on the cable , after which he cut his ignition switch and slid to a stop . This method proved to be far from positive and was never safe . Accordingly , it was discarded after a very short trial . Still another method was tried on board the Argus . Steel fore-and-aft cables were stretched the length of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended approximately twelve inches above the platform . Swinging downward from the axle of the plane were several steel hooks . As the machine settled on the deck in the process of landing , the hooks passed down through the suspended cables . The plane then ran on to a point where the deck took a distinct slope upward . As the landing gear rolled upward with the contour of the platform , the hooks engaged the fore-and-aft wires which maintained their original level . The plane then was attempting to roll up the incline while the cables were trying to keep it down on the original level of the deck . This resistance caused the craft to stop quite short . Unfortunately , the retarding force took place at the forward end of the plane and created a turning moment which nosed the machine up . The frequency with which this happened and the number of planes it wrecked caused this method to be abandoned . <p> At last the British went back to the system first used by the United States Navy in 1912 , when Ely flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , from these , weights were suspended . Hooks were trailed astern by the planes and engaged in the wires . This method was satisfactory , but the task of clearing the arresting gear from the planes took considerable time . In the end , it was decided to leave the decks clear . Slow landing planes were assigned to this work . When the newer carriers with the long decks steamed full speed into the wind these aircraft were able to fly so slowly that they rolled only a short distance before stopping of their own accord . <p> It must not be thought that the Germans were remiss in the adoption of the airplane for naval uses . At the time of the Armistice they had four mother-ships for seaplanes . These ships often went out accompanied by mine sweepers to permit their planes to search for hidden mines . As a matter of fact , it was a German vessel which acted most successfully as a mother-ship during the war . From November , 1916 , until February , 1918 , Captain Neeger ravaged the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Friedrichshafen seaplane facetiously named the Wolfchen . Spare parts and replacements became exhausted from time to time and strange materials went into the machine to keep it in flying condition . The most difficult task was to keep a supply of proper fuel . The carburetor was designed to use benzol and upon the exhaustion of this fuel much trouble was experienced in keeping the engine operating . In all , fifty-six flights were made in the Pacific , Atlantic , and Indian oceans . Equipped with a load of + bombs and message dropping tubes , the plane would take off to pursue a smudge of smoke on the distant horizon . Overtaking the vessel she would drop on board a message directing her to heave to , or to change he ; course towards the approaching mothership . In only one case did the captain of the overtaken vessel continue on his original course . After two bombs had been dropped close aboard he changed his mind and rang up ' " Stop " on his engine telegraph . <p> The end of the World War found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earner . The United States had devoted her aerial efforts to patrol work which was so essential to the anti-submarine campaign . However , our naval officers had seen the progress made abroad and they returned home eager to have this country participate in a similar development . <p> In 1919 , Congress authorized the conversion of the collier Jupiter into an airplane carrier . However , up to 1921 planes continued to be flown from the turrets of our battleships and kite balloons were sent aloft from the quarter-decks in order to carry on aerial observations . As is well known , these methods were impractical when placed under the hard demands of the service . <p> The reconstruction work on the Jupiter , rechristened the Langley , was completed in 1922 . With a flat deck 65 feet wide and 625 feet long , she was a queer looking contraption . Her resemblance to a prairie schooner was so striking that she soon became known throughout the service as " The Covered Wagon . " Nor was this sobriquet inappropriate , for she was destined to blaze new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Langley has proved to be a splendid training ship for pilots in the operation of a carrier . Her slow speed of 14 knots has always hindered her during maneuvers . For this reason , she had never been considered anything more than an experimental craft . Nevertheless , much experience and knowledge has been gained from the naval problems engaged in by this vessel . When the Washington conference in 1922 caused the abandonment of our naval building program the Saratoga and Lexington were saved from the scrap heap . Since the Navy desired more earners it was decided to redesign these partially completed hulls for this new service . Their enormous horsepower , which gives these ships their high speed , renders them somewhat expensive to operate . Nevertheless , these huge vessels have become the backbone of our aerial armada . <p> With a tonnage of 55,000 still available for carriers , the performance of our new U.S.S. Ranger will be closely watched by all nations . Nor should we overlook the possibilities offered by the flying-deck cruiser . It must be remembered that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the number of decks available . The airplane carrier has become an indispensable type of vessel to any fleet .

Forsberg <p> As the U.S. Navy accelerates a trend toward automation and reduced manpower requirements , the term " unmanning " is apropos . Aside from its definition " to remove the men from " ( and the Navy is certainly removing both men and women from traditional tasks as mechanization and efficiency increase ) , " unmanning " can also mean " to cause to give up manly courage or spirit . " Even while lionizing the courage of those caught up in deadly combat , the Navy strives to eliminate the need for that very bravery ( attributed primarily to males historically , though the modern reader should recognize that men have no monopoly on valor or spirit ) . To the extent that the Navy succeeds in reducing the danger and discomfort of its members , it is also inevitably reducing the demand for characteristics that have been the foundation of its culture . Not only will the future Navy be more automated with less need for sailors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at least from the current perspective . <p> Unmanned vehicles on the sea , in the air , and under water will play an increasing military role . Just as significantly , advances in technology will produce more comfort and less peril for those who remain . As these changes take place , there will be effects , albeit hard to quantify , on the culture of the Navy . The changes may be painful and unwanted , but they will happen . Technology can usually be adopted faster than people and organizations can adapt . One example of how this situation can make tempers flare is the recent effort to establish a medal for drone pilots and " cyber warriors.

But as automation improves and machines become ever-more reliable and even able to fix themselves , the need for a reservoir of human power and knowledge will continue to decline . <p> An example of this is the antiaircraft role on surface vessels . In the World War II era , ships bristled with machine guns and various calibers of antiaircraft guns . They were operated manually , and often significant manpower was required to keep them feed with ammunition . As ships transitioned to antiaircraft missiles , far less manpower was needed to actually operate the system . But early rail-launching systems were complicated , necessitating specialist care in pneumatics , hydraulics , servos , and motors , and sundry other areas .

The result is a paradigm of " idiots and experts , " where low-level techs merely need to know how to hit a test button and pull a unit out of a rack if the light is red . If the unit needs repair , it is sent to a rear-area depot , where an expert can work on it . Eliminated is the need for a large " middle class " of techs who have gained journeyman skills through experience and who can handle various intermediate levels of fault . In Navy parlance , middle class could be translated as " petty officer . " <p> Completely unmanned operational units will probably function in a similar manner in the future . Sufficiently reliable and " smart " enough to operate without direct human intervention , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills , consisting primarily of swapping out bad LRUs . In-depth maintenance will take place far to the rear and be done by specialist experts . <p> In an idealized system , the forward operating area , with its attendant danger and discomfort , will be unmanned . There will be a minimally manned buffer zone where operational maintenance will take place by relatively unskilled techs . Finally , most remaining manpower will be in a rear safe area where experts can comfortably fix and maintain components . As the reliability and independence of such systems improve , there will be a diminishing need for human intervention . Ultimately the question becomes whether people are even needed , at least on the operational platform . <p> Such systems will further alter an already stressed Navy culture . The service has long prided itself on the dangers it faces , be they natural or human . Since the days of " wooden ships and iron men , " the Navy has rewarded the taking of physical risk that is associated with sailing and fighting on the seas.3 People in " comfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promotion and job assignment . But what happens as the ratio of salty toughs is ever reduced by comparison with that of shirtsleeve day workers ? <p> Warriors No More ? <p> Anthropocentrism seems to be a stubborn human trait . We like to envision humans as being at the center of , and controlling , that which we hold dear . And we hold few concepts dearer than the ideal of the warrior . In the movie Top Gun , it was a human pilot who basked in the adulation of the crew after a successful mission . In Pacific Rim , the human race has built enormous robots , but people are in them risking their lives and controlling the machines , puppet-like . <p> An even more telling example is the science-fiction movie Surrogates , in which Army soldiers sit in a comfortable room , remotely operating combat robots that fight on a battlefield far away . Yet the humans look as would be expected for those performing military missions . With crew cuts and in apparently good physical condition , they wear uniforms and spring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military standards of fitness , grooming , and custom required when the historical conditions that gave rise to them are gone ? <p> When combat requires little more than a mouse-click , physical fitness becomes far less important . Without the need to perform under conditions of danger and confusion , there is far less need for a strict military hierarchy . A future control center is likely to be staffed more like a call center than a traditional military unit . As danger and discomfort are reduced , so is the need for " hardened " men and women who can perform smoothly under adverse physical conditions and in the face of danger . <p> Of course , the idea of the warrior risking his or her life is central to the self-identification of the military , as well as in the minds of the public . Many of the benefits the services claim , not least of which is public adulation , are due to the idea that being in the military entails great danger and hardship . As increasingly sophisticated technology removes the people ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of being in the military will increasingly conflict with that ideal . Just as todays sailor lives a life of leisure and splendor compared with his counterpart in the age of Nelson , so tomorrows service members . The problem is not that things change . Rather , it is that they are now changing faster than people and organizations can adapt . As change happens in fractions of a lifetime , rather than in multiple lifetimes , human obstinacy will create greater cultural frictions . <p> The military services have evolved as specialized services largely because of the need to inspire and manage people in conditions of intense risk and hardship . As those lessen , so does the need for such personnel . Tasks can increasingly be assigned to civilians , be they government employees or contractors . Pay and benefits can be reduced , and the attrition attendant to stringent military standards can be attenuated . <p> Thus , not only will the future Navy rely more on unmanned platforms , but more non-military personnel will be doing the maintaining and even remote operating of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be long , but it tends toward zero . The ultimate end , in some distant future , may well be a robotic system that responds to civilian leadership , an entire military without a trace of the unreliability or expense of humans . <p> Of course , a completely robotic military appears far away today . But as remotely operated and/or autonomous platforms prove their worth , the trend toward them will accelerate . And , importantly from a cultural perspective , some of the highest-profile tasks may be the first to be dehumanized . Pilots have been centerpieces of Navy culture who take great risks , exemplars of physical and mental skills . Many once scoffed at the idea of automatic landing systems , let alone totally unmanned aircraft . Yet , that age is arriving . The pilot of the future may be a commuting suburbanite who works in an office environment rather than a risk-taking adventurer who flies in the face of danger.Similarly , reduced manning initiatives will decrease the number of sailors who actually go to sea . Newer platforms , incorporating ever-advancing technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing will be done with unmanned vessels , the manned vessels hanging further back . And in the submarine arena , where the requirement to provide life support levies vast engineering requirements , the advantages of unmanned vessels will be even more welcome . <p> Manpower Implications <p> Unmanned platforms will require a different system in terms of personnel , and this will dovetail with the reduced manning of remaining manned platforms . For much of history , the personnel levels in warships resembled a pyramid , with few on top and large numbers of seamen at the bottom . In the 20th century , this system adopted to the need for a larger proportion of skilled workers . Although often still called pyramidal , the Navy manpower pool was actually diamond-shaped , with few at the top or the bottom , but large numbers in the middle . The most numerous enlisted ranks were E4 and E5 , over halfway up the enlisted pay chain . <p> The future personnel structure will probably look like an inverted T. At the bottom there will be a contingent , reduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most will have more time and training than is typically found in todays lower ranks . Above them will be a narrow pipeline of ranks whose expertise will lead them up a promotion ladder . Many of the former middle positions ( in both officer and enlisted pools ) will no longer be filled by the uniformed military but by civilians , to the extent that they are not filled by machines . <p> Much of this change , including an emphasis on unmanned platforms , will be due to skyrocketing personnel costs . " The relatively high personnel numbers can be partially attributed to hiring young persons ( 18 to 22 years old ) and training them aboard ship . If destroyers were composed of only fully trained and experienced personnel , then some manpower requirements would drop significantly . " 4 This fact has been long recognized , but the ever-increasing cost of maintaining manpower in the all-volunteer force will continue to spur action . <p> The reason that much work will be transferable to civilian workers is , in large part , that military technology is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be specialized , often pushing the envelope in terms of advancement . However , these platforms are now more often designed to use commercially available technology . There will always be exceptions ; there are n't  many commercial aircraft catapults , for example . But things like computers are ubiquitous and purchased off the shelf , and even specialized military equipment is frequently designed using off-the-shelf components . <p> Blue-Collar Workers First . . . <p> Not only manual maintenance tasks will be automated . As various machine intelligence techniques advance , people will play a diminishing role in planning , coordinating , and controlling military events . Tasks that once took entire staffs will be done by machine . Already computers have leaped onto bridges , and staff centers to do work once carried out by teams of personnel , both enlisted and officer . Even sacrosanct jobs such as managing a flight deck will eventually be computerized.5 From discrete low-level operational analysis to higher-level planning , computers using algorithms based on huge datasets are vying with humans for the role of commander . The future admirals command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle in the combat area . <p> This raises a thorny issue with regards to traditional training and promotion patterns . In the past , seniority was attained by successive levels of experience in carrying out tasks to assist the top commander . If these types of duties ( such as mission planning for aircraft ) can be accomplished more quickly , accurately , and cheaply by computer , then where will personnel get the experience to become senior managers ? Secondly , one of the hallmarks of seniority was the need to wrangle ever-larger numbers of subordinates . If the job of commanding officer becomes primarily giving orders to a computerized system , then people skills are less important . <p> The Navy has already seen a shift toward a new leadership paradigm . No longer is the charismatic leader the model the Navy strives to produce ( though he or she can still be tolerated in small doses ) . Instead the service is adopting a different ideal . " A fourth image , that of the expert , is a form not of leadership but of domination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize in the leader skills that they can not themselves command . They trust the leader not in a moral fashion , not for what he is , but rather for what he can do ; that is , for his technical effectiveness . " 6 <p> The hardships and dangers of naval service have long served as a kind of filter . Those not inured to them were more likely to leave voluntarily , and the inability to adjust to them often meant involuntary separation of one sort or another . But in a service with less danger and hardship , how should the military select for advancement ? This is already an issue with reference to pilots of unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) . <p> Even before 2000 , it was recognized that " developing UAV technology is of relatively limited value if , as a category of weapon systems , they are relegated to cultural insignificance . " 7 As an organization , the military tries to impose its traditions and values on the technology it adopts . But sometimes the technology changes the very underpinnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rarely a smooth or pleasant process when the military is forced to adapt culturally . <p> It may be a very long time before completely unmanned warships perform months-long patrols with nary a human hand interfering with the mission . Indeed , such an extreme may never come to pass . But the last couple of decades have demonstrated the expanding potential of unmanned and minimally manned systems . This will clash with the publics view of the military , and the militarys view of itself . As manpower levels drop and those remaining face less danger and hardship , wrenching reevaluations will take place of a vast number of intricate and unmapped relations within and without the military . Objections will be made to technological progress because of the social stresses it causes . Still , in the end the utility of the technology usually wins out . <p> Some view the deployment of unmanned and safer technologies as weakness . Wired for War author Peter Singer says , " It makes you look like cowards , you 're sending out machines to fight for you . " 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the parties on the receiving end . It may be easy to dismiss enemy observations , but even within our services , this paradigm shift will continue to cause unease . " If we mark military prowess merely by personal physical exposure , " writes Jamie Holmes , " then yes , a blurry line has been crossed as Air Force pilots move from , as Blair put it , ten thousand feet to ten thousand miles. " 9 <p> But despite the existential agony they may cause , unmanned platforms are coming .

@@21175580 @1175580/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> The Emotional Cycle of Deployment <p> A deployment can be a pretty emotional experience for those left behind . But understanding the different stages of emotion and that those feelings are perfectly normal can make it a lot easier for everyone . <p> " I am tired of being compared to Mr. and Mrs. Jack Smith of Paducah , Kentucky , married 23 years , local carpenter , who have never been away from each other more than four days , that being when their last child was born 11 years ago ! " This comment by Navy Chaplain Nathan Ware reflects the frustration many Navy families feel in trying to understand and explain the emotional demands associated with Navy life . <p> The Emotional Cycle of Deployment ( ECOD ) model describes changes in Navy wives ' behavior and emotions during deployments of three months or more . Although it was initially developed for wives , the model has been useful in working with husbands and children as well . <p> The Navy has its own culture and traditions , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most Navy wives , for example , have heard from a civilian friend or relative the comment , " You 're so strong , I could never do it ! " It makes them sound weird , like superwomen , when they are just doing the best they can under the circumstances . The ECOD presents a general picture . The cycle appears to be true for most women most of the time , but each person is uniqueso obviously there will be exceptions . <p> Some people have expressed concern that there seems to be too much emphasis on " negative " feelings . First , feelings are neither good nor bad , they simply exist . Only actions can be negative . For example , there is nothing inherently wrong with feeling angry ; ways of coping with that feeling , however , can vary from abusing a child ( negative ) to discussing solutions to the problem ( positive ) . Some feelingslike loneliness , resentment , depression , anger , and anxietyare harder to identify and share . But they are a part of Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people try to ignore them . Acknowledging the whole range of feelings is the first step toward dealing with them in a healthy manner . Just because Navy couples live under abnormal circumstances does not mean they have to have sick marriages . In fact , experience supports the case that there is no stronger marriage than a good Navy marriage . <p> Getting ready for a deployment starts long before the husbands actually walk out the door . For a period of time , the women tend to ignore the deployment , fantasizing that somehow it will not happen : " Surely the ship will sink or he 'll get orders to shore duty . " Eventually , something happens to trigger recognition of the reality of departure , perhaps a flip of the calendar so that " The Date " is visible . At this point , the Emotional Cycle of Deployment begins . <p> Stage OneAnticipation of Loss : This stage occursfour to six weeks before deployment . During this time it is hard for a woman to accept the fact that her husband is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at songs , TV shows , and other such " silly things " that would not normally affect her . These incidents allow her to release some of her pent-up emotions . There is a lot of tension during this period as both husband and wife try to cram in a multitude of projects and activities : There are bikes and cars to fix , roofs to repair , deadbolts to install , garages to clean , family to visit , neighbors and friends to invite over , etc . <p> The wife will have some unexpressed anger , and the couple may bicker even though they usually do not . This can be upsetting if it is viewed out of context . Although unenjoyable , these arguments can be functional : They provide one way for the couple to put some emotional distance between themselves in their preparation for living apart . It is hard for a wife to feel warm and loving toward her husband when she is mad at him and , as one woman said , " It 's easier to let him go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , depression , and irritability . While women feel angry or resentful ( " He 's really going to leave me alone with all this " ) , men tend to feel guilty ( " There 's no way I can get everything done that I should before I leave " ) . <p> Stage TwoDetachment and Withdrawal : In many ways , this is the most difficult stage . It occurs sometime in the final days before departure . Such statements as , " I know I should be enjoying these last few days together but all I want to do is cry " indicate a sense of despair or hopelessness . The marriage is out of the couple 's control . Although they push ahead trying to complete the list that never gets any shorter , the wife often feels a lack of energy and is fatigued . Making decisions becomes increasingly difficult . <p> During this time , the wife may experience some ambivalence about sexual relations . The brain says , " We 've got to have sex ; this is it for six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to be that close . " Intercourse represents the ultimate intimacy in marriage , yet it is hard to be intimate when husband and wife are separating from each other emotionally . This can be especially difficult if it is seen as rejection rather than as a reaction to trying circumstances . The couple may find , too , that they stop sharing their thoughts and feelings with each other . This stage is most evident when departure is delayed for some reason . When asked if they enjoyed the extra time together wives invariably respond , " It was awful ! " The detachment and withdrawal stage is an uncomfortable time : Though both spouses are physically in the same house , emotionally they have separated . Wives think , " If you have to go , go , " and husbands think , " Let 's get on with it ! " <p> Stage ThreeEmotional Disorganization : No matterhow prepared Navy wives think they are , the actual deployment still comes as a shock . An initial sense of relief that the pain of saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry , " If I really love him , why am I relieved that he 's gone ? " They may feel numb , aimless , and without purpose . Old routines have been disrupted and new ones not yet established . Many women are de pressed and withdraw from friends and neighbors , especially if the neighbors ' husbands are home . They often feel overwhelmed as they face total responsibility for family affairs . Many women have difficulty sleeping , suddenly aware that they are the " security officer " ; others sleep excessively . A wife may feel some anger at her husband because he did not , say , provide for her physical security by installing deadbolts . <p> Wives often report feeling restless ( though not productive ) , confused , disorganized , indecisive , and irritable . The unspoken question is , " What am I going to do with this ' hole ' in my life ? " Whereas wives experience a sense of being overwhelmed , husbands report feeling " lonely and frustrated . " Unfortunately , a few women get stuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on emotionally ; they will both have and cause problems throughout the cruise . <p> Stage FourRecovery and Stabilization : At somepoint , wives may realize , " Hey , I 'm doing OK ! " They have established new family patterns and settled into a routine . They have begun to feel more comfortable with the reorganization of roles and responsibilities . Broken arms have been tended , mowers fixed , cars tuned up , and washing machines bought . Each successful experience adds to their self confidence . The wives have cultivated new sources of support through friends , church , work , wives ' groups , etc . They have often given up real cooking for " cruise food " ; they may run up higher long-distance phone bills and contact old friends . <p> Dr. Alice Snyder of Family Services Center , Norfolk , calls the women " single wives " as they experience both worlds . Being alone brings freedom as well as responsibility . They often unconsciously find themselves referring to , " My house , my car , my kids . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more outwardly independent . This stage is one of the benefits of being a Navy wife : Each woman has the opportunity to initiate new activities , accept more responsibilities , and stretch herself and her abilitiesall while secure in being married . <p> Nevertheless , all the responsibility can be stressful , and wives may find that they are sick more frequently . Many women continue to feel mildly depressed and anxious . Isolation from both their husbands and their own families can leave them feeling vulnerable . There is not much contact with menby choice or designand women may begin to feel asexual . On the whole , though , most women have a new sense of independence and freedom and take pride in their ability to cope alone . <p> Stage FiveAnticipation of Homecoming : Approximatelyfour to six weeks before the ship is due back , wives often find themselves saying , " Ohmigosh , he 's coming home and I 'm not ready ! " That long list of " things to do while he 's gone " is still unfinished . The pace picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anticipation of living together again . Feelings of apprehension surface as well , although they are usually left unexpressed . <p> This is a time to reevaluate the marriage . That " hole " that existed when their husbands left did get filledwith tennis classes , church , a job , new friends , schooland now they instinctively know that they must " clean house " in their lives in order to make room for the men . Most experience an unconscious process of evaluating , " I want him back , but what am I going to have to give up ? " Therefore , they may feel nervous , tense , and apprehensive . <p> The wives are concerned about the effect the husband 's return will have on their lives and their children 's : " Will he understand and accept the changes that have occurred in us ? Will he approve of the decisions I made ? Will he adjust to the fact that I ca n't go back to being dependent ? " The husbands are anxious , too , wondering , " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will the kids know me ? Does my family still need me ? " <p> Most women bury these concerns in busywork . Once more , there is a sense of restlessness ( but productive ) and confusion . Decisions become harder to make and may be postponed until the homecoming . Women become irritable again and may experience changes in appetite . At some point , a psychological decision is made . For most women , it is , " Do I want him back ? You bet ! I ca n't wait to see him ! " <p> Stage SixRenegotiation of the Marriage Contract : This stage , too , is one in which the husband and wife are together physically but not necessarily emotionally . They will have to have some time together and share experiences and feelings before they feel like a couple again . They both need to be aware of the necessity to refocus on the marriage . For instance : After one of the wives ' husband had been home for a few days , she became aggravated with him when he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up within the family-finally declaring , " I 'm your wife . Talk to me ! " During this stage , the task is to stop being " single " spouses and start being married again . <p> Most women sense a loss of freedom and independence while a minority is content to become dependent once more . Routines established during the cruise are disrupted : " I have to cook a real dinner every night ! ? " This causes the wives to feel disorganized and out of control . <p> Although most couples never write it down , there is a " contract " in every marriagea set of assumptions and expectations on which they base their actions . During this stage , the couple has to make major adjustments in roles and responsibilities ; before that can happen , they must undertake an extensive renegotiation of that unwritten contract . The marriage can not and will not be exactly the same as before the cruise : both spouses have had varied experiences and have grown in different ways , and these changes must be accommodated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months of living apart . More than one wife has had to cope with the fleeting shock of wondering , " Who 's that man in my bedroom ! " Some resent their husbands " making decisions that should be mine . " Still others question , " My husband wants me to give up all my activities while he 's home . Should I ? " On the other hand , the husband may wonder , " Why do I feel like a stranger in my own home ? " All of these concerns and pressures require that husband and wife communicate with each other . <p> Assumptions will not work .

They are back on the same track emotionally and can enjoy the warmth and closeness of being married . <p> Variations on the Cycle : Once the basic ECOD model or cycle is understood , we can examine the effects of other kinds of deployments .

Certain turnarounds can be especially difficult . For example : after being gone for two months , the USS Midway ( CV-41 ) returned to her home port in Yokosuka , Japan , for two weeks in December , after which she deployed to the Indian Ocean for five months . It was a very stressful time as families attempted to say , " Hello , good-bye , and Merry Christmas " all at the same time . Extension of a deployment during Anticipation of Homecoming , as recently happened to the USS Coral Sea ( CV-43 ) battle group off Libya , is more disruptive to the families than if the extension were announced while they were still in Recovery and Stabilization . <p> Implications for Future Use : ECOD 's primary usefulness appears to be in the area of prevention : Many problems in Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of adjustment . For example , lack of sexual intimacy just before deployment could be accepted as a natural reaction to difficult circumstances rather than being viewed as personal rejection . Arguing during that time may be tolerated instead of perceived as evidence of a deteriorating marriage . It also helps to know that it is perfectly normal to feel somewhat strange with each other when the husband first comes home . Almost everyone feels reassured just knowing that their range and fluctuation of emotions are normal . <p> Another use of the model is in the area of prediction . Key personnel ( e.g. , commanding officers and executive officers and their wives , ombudsmen , Family Services Center and Family Advocacy counselors , and chaplains ) could use the model to be alerted to potential problems at stages or to distinguish between transient situational problems and those requiring more in-depth attention . <p> In working with wives , someone invariably says , " I wish my husband could hear this , too !

However , many questions remain for further research . <p> The original thesis which developed the ECOD model was based on previous research and clinical observations . Only one symptomdepressionwas tested by using a cross-section of Navy wives . The findings of the study could be further validated by testing levels of depression longitudinally within each community ( air , surface , submarine ) , i.e. , by following specific groups throughout the entire deployment cycle . Other symptoms , such as physical illness , anxiety , or tension , could be tested in the same manner as depression . <p> The impact of other variables on the intensity of feelings at any given stage could also be explored . Such variables might include : length of marriage , perceived stability of marriage , length of deployment , anticipated danger of mission , or availability of reliable communications . In the course of the study , for example , it appeared that longer deployments with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renegotiation of the Marriage Contract stage . <p> Applicability of the ECOD model to husbands and children is another possible avenue . Experience indicates that men undergo the same basic cycle , with some exceptions , but no research has been conducted to document these observations . <p> The stages at which spouse or child abuse is likely to occur could be identified . For instance , Anticipation of Loss , Detachment and Withdrawal , and Renegotiation of the Marriage Contract are the stages that may increase the likelihood of paternal child abuse ; Emotional Disorganization and Anticipation of Homecoming , maternal child abuse ; Anticipation of Loss and Renegotiation of the Marriage Contract , spouse abuse . Also , overlapping stagesleaving insufficient time to work through one stage before proceeding to the nextincreases tension and confusion and the possibility of abuse .

In an article on aircraft safety in the December 1985 issue of Approach , for instance , Lieutenant Commander James DeVoll stated that " Safety planning must be based on an awareness of what periods represent increased mishap risk for the group , periods much in need of increased safety emphasis . " <p> Although the ECOD was developed for Navy wives , it offers a framework for assessing the reactions of other family members and for researching related issues . It has use both for professionals in the prediction and prevention of problems , and for individuals in understanding that they are indeed " normal " as they deal with the emotional demands of deployments .

Less than two weeks after his 45th birthday , John Paul Jones was found in his Paris apartment lying facedown on the bed , his feet on the floor . Although not a religious man , the position of the body led to speculation that he was attempting to kneel as he took his last breath . <p> Given his Scottish Calvinist upbringing and the unwillingness of American officials to take responsibility , he was buried in a Protestant cemetery on the outskirts of the French capital . It would be 113 years before Jones would return to America and receive the honors and recognition he so craved during the last years of his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of dedication and unrelenting persistence by the American ambassador to France , Horace Porter . <h> Far from America <p> Jones final years were fraught with frustration , sickness , and solitude amid the chaos of the French Revolution , far from the country he had fought so valiantly to free . Anticipating that American authorities would transport their legendary naval hero back to the United States , the French laid his body to rest in a lead coffin that was filled with alcohol and sealed to preserve the remains . This container was then placed in an outer wooden coffin . Gouverneur Morris , the American ambassador to France , displayed his distinct dislike for Jones and shocked French officials with his unwillingness to pay for a proper burial . Morris wrote : " I had no right to spend money on such follies , " and opined that Jones should " be buried in a private and economical manner . " He explained that " I did not agree to waste money of which he Jones had no great abundance . " <p> The French had great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America and France . Only through the influence of two friendsAmerican Colonel Samuel Blackden and Major Jean-Baptiste Beaupoil , a former aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayettedid he receive a proper burial . Frustrated by the miserliness of Morris , Pierre-Frantois Simonneau , the local precincts royal commissioner , agreed to pay for the interment . <p> As a display of religious tolerance in Catholic France , a delegation from the Legislative Assembly was selected to attend the Protestant funeral . Their presence lent irony to the affair , as Jones initial support for the French Revolution had turned to horror as its excesses began spinning out of control . Jones had admired and esteemed Louis XVI for the invaluable aid he had provided in support of the American struggle for independence . The king had awarded him the Order of Military Merit and the title chevalier ( knight ) , presented him with a gold-hilted sword , and proclaimed him " the valiant avenger of the rights of the sea . " But by the time of Jones death , although France was technically a constitutional monarchy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honored the naval hero with a military escort and procession . On 20 July the funeral cortege wound its way through the streets of Paris to the Saint Louis Cemetery , led by French grenadiers and followed by the Assembly deputation , representatives of the Protestant community , and Jones friends and acquaintances . Gouverneur Morris did not attend , sending instead a lower-level American attachT . In the distance , thunder and lightning provided a solemn aura to the journey , as Parisians lined the streets and hung out of windows in respectful silence as the funeral procession passed . <p> Within three weeks of the funeral , armed Revolutionaries stormed the Tuileries Palace , where Louis and his family were being held . Many of the 600 Swiss Guards who died defending the king , being Protestants , were tossed into a mass grave adjacent to Jones burial site . <h> A Frustrating Final Campaign <p> John Paul Jones presence in Paris is a story in itself . Following the American Revolution , he had become disenchanted with the unwillingness of the fledgling U.S. Congress to build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations defense . Restless in peacetime , Jones yearned to return to the sea and warfighting . Coincidentally , in early 1788 Russias ambassador in Paris contacted the naval officers friend Thomas Jefferson , then American minister to France , about Jones availability . Catherine the Great , empress of Russia , was waging a sea and land war against the Ottoman Empire and in dire need of naval expertise . Jones jumped at the opportunity . <p> After his arrival in St. Petersburg , Catherine bestowed on Pavel Ivanovich Dzones the rank of kontradmiral ( rear admiral ) , an honor denied him by Congress for political reasons . The empress had him believe that he would command a fleet and operate independently against the Turks , but he was misled . During the 16 months he served with the Russian navy , Jones participated in two significant sea battles , each critical to the Russian effort to dominate the Black Sea and capture Constantinople . But his skill and courage during the Liman campaign were downplayed and disparaged by his ambitious Russian naval superiors . <p> Jones was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being given command of the Baltic fleet , but during the trip north he aggravated an existing lung condition that resulted in a severe case of pneumonia from which he never fully recovered . On his arrival in the capital , the admiral became a victim of politics and intrigue at the Russian court and the expressed hatred of British naval officers serving the empress . He left St. Petersburg in August 1789 in the wake of an alleged sexual scandal concocted by his enemies . After wandering from Warsaw to Vienna , Amsterdam , and London , he retreated to Paris in 1790 , where he spent his last years in failing health , awaiting recall to service by Empress Catherine or President George Washington . <p> Years earlier Jones had written Secretary of State John Jay of his concern for American seamen captured by the dey of Algiers . His willingness to lead a fleet of American warships against Algiers had resulted in the dey posting a handsome reward for anyone who would bring him the head of John Paul Jones . Within weeks of his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of State to negotiate with the dey of Algiers for the release of American citizens reached Paris . <h> The Ambassadors Quest <p> Just over a century later , in 1897 , Horace Portera Civil War brevet brigadier general , Medal of Honor winner , member of General Ulysses S. Grants staff , and Grants secretary during his first term as presidentarrived in Paris . Two years later he began a quest that would consume six anxious years and great personal expense . A number of patriotic Americans , distraught that the remains of their early naval hero were residing ingloriously somewhere in a foreign land , had conducted unsuccessful attempts to research and locate Jones final resting place . Porter would be ably assisted in his search by Colonel Arthur Bailly-Blanchard , second secretary at the U.S. Embassy in Paris . <p> The ambassadors motivation for taking on the task was personal : <p> I felt a deep sense of humiliation as an American citizen in realizing that our first and most fascinating naval hero had been lying for more than a century in an unknown and forgotten grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover his remains and give them appropriate sepulture in the land upon whose history he had shed so much luster . <p> Knowing that he had been buried in Paris , I resolved to undertake personally a systematic and exhaustive search for the body . <p> Porter feared that on Jones death , the admiral had been " snatched from history and relegated to fiction " like " an obscure outcast . " <p> In 1892 a similar sense of outrage had taken hold of Porter because the remains of his mentor and friend President Grant still lay in what he described as " a little brick hovel " of a tomb seven years after his death and not in a planned memorial structure . He personally took charge of raising the necessary funds and overseeing construction of the famous monument to Grant that sits above the Hudson River . <p> Finding John Paul Jones burial location , gaining access to the site , and proving that the recovered remains were those of the admiral proved to be an exercise in detection and persistence that severely tested Porters analytical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June 1899 with an exhaustive review of writings about Jones in French newspapers and documents . The original certificate of burial had been lost when government buildings housing the records had burned during the 1871 Paris Commune . By careful sleuthing , Porter found a copy of the certificate in an 1859 magazine article written by French archaeologist Charles Read . The certificate confirmed the fact that Jones had been " buried in the cemetery for foreign Protestants , " specifically the long-since abandoned Saint Louis Cemetery . <p> Other writings and rumors raised doubts about the accuracy of the Read article . Speculation as to where Jones was interred included Charles Dickens claim that he was buried in the " Congressional " cemetery . An Alexandre Dumas novel located the grave in a cemetery that did not exist at the time of Jones death . There were also claims that Jones had been reinterred adjacent to Lafayettes tomb in Paris Picpus Cemetery . One account alleged that the body resided in a churchyard in Dumfries , Scotland , near his birthplace . Porter carefully investigated and refuted each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewing hundreds of periodicals and journals to determine if any other Protestant cemeteries had existed in and around Paris . No mention could be found of other such burial sites . Porter determined that Saint Louis Cemetery had been established in 1720 at the behest of the Dutch , and no burials had been permitted without an appropriate certificate issued by the Dutch Embassy . A review of the Church of Saint Louis meeting minutes revealed that four pages covering the period of Jones death and burial had been torn out . By searching numerous junk shops and antiquarian stores , Porter was able to track down the sale of the churchs old records to the Society of the History of Protestantism . The missing pages were found in its possession . The minutes indicated that the funeral oration for the admiral had been given by a Dutch pastor , Paul Henri Marron , and confirmed that all of Pastor Marrons burials took place at Saint Louis Cemetery . <p> In addition , a bill was found confirming that Commissioner Simonneau had paid 462 francs to bury Jones in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter attempted to locate descendants of the commissioner in anticipation of paying them for their ancestors generosity more than 100 years before . No living relatives were found . <h> Zeroing in on a Burial Site <p> Porter had become convinced that the Read article was correct and that Saint Louis Cemetery was the site of Jones burial . Using old maps , the ambassador explored the section of Paris called " le Combat , " famous as the location of cock , dog , and other animal fights . The government had sold the old cemetery to private interests in 1796 , and the ground was subsequently regraded . The graves lay approximately eight feet below ground level , beneath a courtyard , shacks , and buildings . <p> Under French law , abandoned cemeteries were required to transfer remains to the Catacombs of Paris . Whether the deceased had been removed from Saint Louis Cemetery prior to its being covered was unknown . A check of the Catacombs registry revealed that only one body had been exhumed from Saint Louis , that of Lady Alexandra Grant , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 25 years following Jones interment , no significant effort to remove other remains had evidently occurred . A further concern was the possibility that lead coffins had been dug up during the 179394 Reign of Terror and , like many lead statues , melted down to make bullets for the French Republics army . <p> The next step in finding Jones remains posed political , economic , and technical challenges for Porter . Loose soil , poor drainage , and damaged buildings would complicate the project , as would noxious odors and poor ventilation . Only by digging shafts and tunnels supported by elaborate timber shoring could the graveyard be searched . <p> To proceed with excavation , Porter was required to obtain individual agreements with each proprietor and tenant , and according to the ambassador , " This was altogether the most discouraging episode in the history of the undertaking . " Speculation abounded that the United States was willing to pay exorbitant sums to gain the right to tunnel . Given the unrealistic monetary demands of the owners and occupants of the various properties , Porter decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years before restarting negotiations . Using an appeal to public sentiment and assurance that the U.S. government had not allocated funds for the project , he obtained permission to proceed with the subterranean excavations in early 1905 . The agreement strictly limited access to the grounds to three months . Porter secured the services of Paul Weiss , an accomplished mining engineer , whose professional skill and devotion to the delicacy of the task proved well beyond the ambassadors expectations . <p> Meanwhile , under the influence of Alfred Thayer Mahans sea-power writings , President Theodore Roosevelt had launched an ambitious campaign to strengthen the U.S. Navy . Colorful naval reviews , elaborate ceremonies , and exercises were the order of the day , culminating in the around-the-world cruise of the Great White Fleet in 19079 , a blatant display of the growing reach of American military might . Aware of Porters efforts and anticipating the public-relations value of the project to his crusade for a more powerful American Navy , Roosevelt approached Congress for an appropriation of $35,000 for the recovery . Ironically , indifference to John Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took its time reacting to the presidents request . Porter theorized that the project may have been perceived as " too Utopian in its nature to receive serious consideration , the remains of the Admiral having been long since relegated to the realms of mystery and given up as lost beyond recovery . " The ambassador decided to avoid further delay and personally advanced the money with no expectation that he would be reimbursed . <p> The first shaft was sunk on 3 February 1905 to a depth of 18 feet . The immediate discovery of many skeletons confirmed that few , if any , remains had been removed from the cemetery . The corpses in this section were not in separate graves , leading to the conclusion that they were the remains of destitute individuals buried in inexpensive wooden coffins that had long since rotted away . Porter suspected that very few lead coffins like the one in which Jones body had been encased were present , given the expense of such containers . In all , five shafts were sunk and horizontal subterranean galleries extended out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soundings were made between the galleries using long iron tools . <p> As the excavation continued , a mass grave of skeletons piled helter-skelter was discovered . This was apparently the trench section where the bodies of the Swiss Guards had been tossed . The first lead coffin was discovered on 22 February . An encrusted inscription plate required the skills of a restorer of ancient art objects to decipher the name of the deceased . The nameplate as well as one found on a second lead coffin ruled out either occupant as being John Paul Jones . <h> The Hero Identified and Honored <p> On 31 March a third lead coffin was found . It lacked an inscription plate but according to Porter was " superior in solidity and workmanship " to the first two . The decision was made to open this coffin . Typical of those in use in France at the time of Jones death , the mummy-shaped coffin was narrow at the feet , widening to the shoulders , and rounded at the head . A preliminary examination determined that the corpse was approximately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the admiral . The remains were taken to the Paris School of Medicine for examination . For six days and in the presence of a dozen French and American officials , several renowned French anthropologists would perform tests and comparisons to definitively identify the body . <p> Wrapped in a winding sheet , the body was surrounded by straw . The alcohol that had originally filled the coffin had externally embalmed the remains , which were remarkably well-preserved . The head had been turned slightly to the right and the nose bent , due to the placement of too much straw beneath the head prior to the casket being closed . A linen cap and ruffled linen shirt were the only items of clothing . On the cap was an embroidered letter " J " with a very pronounced loop . When the cap was reversed , the letter appeared to be a " P " . Anthropometric measurements of the head and facial features were performed and compared to a three-quarter-size bust by famed French sculpture Jean-Antoine Houdon that Jones contemporaries had regarded as extremely accurate , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A peculiar-shaped earlobe and all other facial measurements were consistent with the features displayed on the bust . <p> Among the unofficial onlookers present while the remains were being measured soon after their removal from the coffin had been John Stone , Ambassador Porters 11-year-old nephew . Nearly 60 years later , retired Navy Captain Stone , a 1917 Naval Academy graduate , recalled that " there was a feeling of awe in the room . " Approaching the corpse , " Uncle Horace said I could feel his hand , I think it was his right one . . . . With some reluctance ( really a great deal ) I held the hand . It was soft and pliable . I did not hold it long ! " Stone added that " When first seen J. P. J. seemed alive . No photograph was made until about 2 days laterby that time his face had changed due to exposure .

The absence of scars or other evidence of battle wounds was also consistent with the belief that Jones had never been seriously wounded in any of his many engagements . Formal documents concurring with lead anthropologist G. Papillaults conclusion that " the body examined is that of Admiral John Paul Jones " were signed by all in attendance . Notified of the panels definitive findings , President Roosevelt immediately dispatched a squadron of four cruisers to escort the admiral home . <p> The body was placed in a new lead container that was soldered closed , affixed with seals of the American Embassy , and placed in an outer oak casket adorned with eight silver handles . The lid was secured using 16 silver screws and the casket then draped with the American flag . Placed on a French artillery caisson ornamented with flags , it was escorted to a Paris train station by 500 American Bluejackets , two companies of U.S. Marines , and French cuirassiers , horse artillery batteries , infantry , and military bands . The casket was transported to Cherbourg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 13-day journey across the Atlantic . <p> The American squadron departed Cherbourg on the evening of 8 July flying the American ensign at the fore and the French ensign at the main .

As the Brooklyn passed , four of the battle wagons fired a 15-gun salute . <p> On 24 April 1906 , the anniversary of his victory over the sloop-of-war HMS Drake , John Paul Jones was ceremoniously honored by President Roosevelt and fellow countrymen , including Ambassador Porter , at the Naval Academy . Atop his flag-draped coffin sat a wreath of laurel , a spray of palm , and the gold-hilted sword presented to him by Louis XVI after the capture of HMS Serapis .

" He added later in answer to a question that this loss of business is the prime reason American shippers either scrap vessels or reflag them .

This NAVADMIN announces the first phase of a multi- year implementation effort to transform current Navy Enlisted Career Management processes . 2 . This modernization effort is the result of a review of Navy rating titles completed this year by the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and his leadership mess . As a result , the Secretary of the Navy announced that the Navy will develop a new approach to enlisted ratings that provides greater detailing flexibility , training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly to the American public . The intent is to transform our enlisted personnel business processes to maximize talent management and career flexibility , while arming our Sailors with superior training and widely recognized credentials that will convey to the civilian workforce . 3 . Navy will move from Rating Titles to alpha-numeric Navy Occupational Specialty ( NOS ) codes . This change is a first step on the way to providing Sailors the opportunity to move back and forth between occupations . This change represents a significant cultural shift and it is recognized that it will not happen overnight , but will take time to become fully implemented . 4 . Effective immediately , enlisted Navy Sailors will be addressed by rank vice by rating . E1 through E3 Sailors will be addressed as " Seaman , " E4 through E6 will be called " Petty Officer Third/Second/First Class " as appropriate and senior enlisted paygrades of E7 through E9 will be called " Chief , Senior Chief , or Master Chief " depending on their paygrade . For example , a Sailor will no longer be called YN2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Second Class Petty Officer , " or simply " Petty Officer . " There will no longer be a distinction between " Airman , Fireman , and Seaman . " They will all be " Seamen . " As we move toward a Navy where Sailors may hold multiple occupations , rating titles will no longer be applicable . Addressing our Sailors by rank also brings us more in line with the other services . 5 . NOS codes will be grouped under logical and broader career fields . These career fields will enable flexibility to move between occupational specialties within career fields and they will be tied to appropriate training and qualifications . Each NOS will be matched with similar civilian occupations to enable the Navy to identify credentials and certifications recognized and valued within the civilian workforce . The Navy will aggressively pursue opportunities for Sailors to earn credentials recognized and held by their civilian counterparts and incorporate those credentials into Sailors professional development . 6 . A working group was formed in July to identify personnel policies , management programs , and information technology systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group has developed recommendations and a plan of action and milestones to fully implement the transformation to NOS . Changes to personnel management processes , policies , programs and systems will proceed in deliberate and thoughtful phases that will enable transitions that are seamless and largely transparent to the fleet . Fleet involvement and feedback will be solicited during each phase of the transformation . All aspects of enlisted force management to include recruiting , detailing , advancements , training , and personnel and pay processes are being carefully considered as we move forward . 7 . This change is one step in a larger effort to modernize our personnel systems , and will benefit all Sailors with greater career flexibility while in the Navy and after they depart the Service . 8 .

Since the implementation of optimal manning , the Navy reduced crew sizes , which decreased the associated personnel costs for most ship classes , even as crews were partially restored . However , increased maintenance costs offset the reductions in personnel costs , as shown below . Navy officials attributed maintenance cost increases to reduced crews , longer deployments , and other factors .

John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) outlining the U.S. Oct. , 27 2015 freedom of navigation operation in the South China Sea . <p> Dear Mr. Chairman : <p> Thank you for your November 9 , 2015 , letter regarding U.S. military operations in the South China Sea . <p> As you know , our Freedom of Navigation Operations ( FONOPS ) are conducted in full accordance with international law . They are one aspect of our broader strategy to support an open and inclusive international security architecture founded on international law and standards . This system has benefited all nations in the Asia Pacific for decades and will be critical to maintaining regional stability and prosperity for the foreseeable future . <p> On October 27 , 2015 , the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Lassen ( DDG-82 ) conducted a FONOP in the South China Sea by transiting inside 12 nautical miles of five maritime features in the Spratly Islands " Subi Reef , Northeast Cay , Southwest Cay , South Reef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Taiwan , Vietnam , and the Philippines . No claimants were notified prior to the transit , which is consistent with our normal processes and with international law . <p> The operation was part of an ongoing practice of FONOPs that we have conducted around the world and will continue to conduct in the future . It was the seventh FONOP we have conducted in the South China Sea since 2011 and one of many that we have conducted around the world in the past year . In that sense , it was a normal and routine operation . <p> The United States does not take a position on which nation has the superior sovereignty claims over each land feature in the Spratly Islands . Thus , the operation did not challenge any country 's claims of sovereignty over land features , as that is not the purpose or function of a FONOP . Rather , this FONOP challenged attempts by claimants to restrict navigation rights and freedoms around features they claim , including policies by some claimants requiring prior permission or notification of transits within territorial seas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under international law as reflected in the Law of the Sea ( LOS ) Convention , and the FONOP demonstrated that we will continue to fly , sail , and operate wherever international law allows . <p> The FONOP involved a continuous and expeditious transit that is consistent with both the right of innocent passage , which only applies in a territorial sea , and with the high seas freedom of navigation that applies beyond any territorial sea . With respect to Subi Reef , the claimants have not clarified whether they believe a territorial sea surrounds it , but one thing is clear : under the law of the sea , China 's land reclamation can not create a legal entitlement to a territorial sea , and does not change our legal ability to navigate near it in this manner . We believe that Subi Reef , before China turned it into an artificial island , was a low-tide elevation and that it therefore can not generate its own entitlement to a territorial sea . However , if it is located within 12 nautical miles of another geographic feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case with Sandy Cay then the low-water line on Subi Reef could be used as the baseline for measuring Sandy Cay 's territorial sea . In other words , in those circumstances , Subi Reef could be surrounded by a 12-nautical mile-territorial sea despite being submerged at high tide in its natural state . Given the factual uncertainty , we conducted the FONOP in a manner that is lawful under all possible scenarios to preserve U.S. options should the factual ambiguities be resolved , disputes settled , and clarity on maritime claims reached . <p> The specific excessive maritime claims challenged in this case are less important than the need to demonstrate that countries can not restrict navigational rights and freedoms around islands and reclaimed features contrary to international law as reflected in the LOS Convention . We will continue to demonstrate as much by exercising the rights , freedoms and lawful uses of the seas all around the world , and the South China Sea will be no exception . <p> I welcome your keen interest in this and other key issues in the Asia-Pacific .

The subject of scores of books and movies , the decisive showdown has been studied and debated exhaustively . Yet even seven decades on , some lingering questions continue to perplex historians . <p> Five years ago in these pages , Ronald Russell , webmaster of the Midway veterans online site ( www.midway42.org ) and author of the thoughtful and respected volume No Right to Win ( iUniverse , 2006 ) , noted the glaring discrepancies between Captain Marc " Pete " Mitschers official report on the battleparticularly the actions of the air squadrons of the USS Hornet ( CV-8 ) on 4 June 1942and the recollections of most of the pilots who flew off the Hornet that day . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle wondering about " what actually happened to all of those aviators on that epic day . " While it may be impossible at this remove to resolve the mystery with certainty , it is the purpose of this article to suggest a possible answer . <p> The origins of the puzzle stretch back to the commissioning of the new-construction Hornet in March 1942 . The newest American carrier , the Hornet did not even have sufficient time to qualify most of her pilots as she steamed south from Norfolk , Virginia , to the Panama Canal , then up the U.S. West Coast to Alameda , California . There the planes of her air group were struck below to the hangar deck , so she could take aboard 16 Mitchell B-25 bombers for an Army Air Forces raid on Tokyo led by Lieutenant Colonel " Jimmy " Doolittle . Naturally , pilot training had to be suspended while the Hornet was thus encumbered , and only after Doolittle and his fellow pilots took off did the Hornet resume normal carrier operations . Given that timetable , the Hornet had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American raids against Japanese outposts in the Marshall Islands and elsewhere . The Battle of Midway was therefore her first action against an enemy force . <p> On 28 May 1942 , the Hornet left Pearl Harbor in company with her sister ship , the Enterprise ( CV-6 ) , for a rendezvous nearly 1,500 miles to the north , a location optimistically code-named Point Luck . Cryptanalysts under Commander Joseph Rochefort , working in the dark , air-conditioned basement of the 14th Naval District headquarters in Honolulu , had determined that the Japanese were embarking on a major operation to seize the two-island atoll of Midway , and Admiral Chester Nimitz had decided to send his carrier force there in the hope of springing an ambush . <h> An Incorrect Assumption <p> The crucial role of the code-breakers in the Battle of Midway is well knownoften even overstated . Some students of the battle have asserted that Rochefort and his colleagues were able to provide Nimitz and the other senior American planners with a copy of the Japanese order of battle . That , however , was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Hornet air group in the subsequent battle . While Nimitz did know that the Japanese were sending four carriersplus supports and escortsto attack Midway , the available intelligence did not tell him how the Japanese would deploy those four carriersa point to bear in mind . We know now , of course , that all four ships operated together as a single task forcethe Mobile Striking Force , or Kido Butai . But at the time , Nimitz and the other key decision-makers assumed that the Japanese would operate their four carriers in two separate groups . 2 <p> The source of that assumption is unclear , but it may well be something as simple as a case of mirror-imaging : The United States operated its three carriers in two task forces ( TF 16 and TF 17 ) , so it perhaps seemed quite likely to the Americans that the Japanese would do the same . Evidence of this assumption is in Nimitzs initial orders to the task-force commanders and the commanders on Midway . In those orders , Nimitz suggested that " one or more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the attack on Midway , while " additional carrier groups " operated against American surface forces . In the briefing that Mitschers intelligence officer , Lieutenant Stephen Jurika , gave to the pilots on board the Hornet the night before the battle , Jurika told them " there were at least two carriers , two battleships , several cruisers and about five destroyers in the attack force which would attempt to take Midway " and that " the support force some distance behind contained the rest of their forces . " 3 <p> Those assumptions were reinforced at 0603 on 4 June when a PBY Catalina out of Midway reported the first sighting of the enemy : two carriers and two battleships , 180 miles north of the atoll . Two carriers ! Where were the others ? Forty-five minutes later , Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher , the senior American officer afloat , sent a message ( which Mitscher monitored ) to the commander of TF 16 , Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance , to remind him : " Two carriers are unaccounted for . " 4 It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> A Curious Lack of Documents <p> At 0705 , the Hornet and Enterprise began launching aircraft . The Yorktown ( CV-5 ) the third U.S. carrier at Point Luckheld her strike force back to await further news , presumably information about those " missing " two carriers . By 0800 all the planes from the Enterprise and Hornet were aloft . The Enterprise planes flew to the southwest on a bearing of approximately 239 degrees True , toward the coordinates sent in by the PBY two hours earlier . <p> But what about the Hornet s planes ? Which way did they go ? That turns out to be a complicated question . <p> For starters , there is a gaping hole in the official record concerning the activities of the Hornet s air group on 4 June . Though all unit commanders were required to submit official written reports after each action , there is only one official report from the Hornet , written byor at least signed byPete Mitscher . Stamped " Secret " and dated 13 June 1942 , it is sufficiently detailed in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group commanders report or reports from any of the squadron commanders . The absence of a report from the torpedo squadron ( VT-8 ) is easily explained : Torpedo Eight from the Hornet was wiped out in its attack on the Kido Butai that morning ; only one pilot survived , Ensign George Gay . Though he was debriefed , and much later wrote a personal memoir , Gay never wrote an after-action report . There is no explanation , however , for the absence of reports from any of the three other squadrons . <p> In the one report that does existMitschershe asserts that " The objective , enemy carriers , was calculated to be 155 miles distant , bearing 239 True from this Task Force ; one division of 10 VF fighters , Squadron Commander in charge , was sent with 35 VSB bombers and 15 VTB torpedo planes . " It is noteworthy that Mitscher uses the passive voice : The range and course bearing " was calculated " by whom he does not say . Similarly , the strike force " was sent " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that bearing of 239 degrees , that is certainly implied . ( Of course , passive voice wasand iscommon in Navy parlance . Even today , officers do not make requests , instead their chits read : " It is requested that . . . " as if the request existed independently of the author . ) <p> Mitschers 13 June report continues : " They the pilots were unable to locate the enemy and landed on board at 1727 . " Mitscher explains this by noting " about one hour after the planes had departed the enemy reversed his course and started his retirement . " And it is true that the Kido Butai turned from the southeast to the northeast at 0917 that day . As a result of that turn , Mitscher writes , the American pilots failed to spot the enemy and eventually returned to the carrierthose who could . Mitscher even included a map in his official report showing the air group flying on the 239-degrees-True course and missing the Japanese carriers because they had turned north . 5 <h> ( Most ) Pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , students of the Battle of Midway took Mitscher at his word and described the Hornet air group as missing the Japanese because the American planes flew south of the target . But , as Ronald Russell noted in his February 2006 article , unofficial evidence , mainly from postbattle interviews , memoirs , letters , and other such sources , mostly ( though not exclusively ) indicate that the Hornet air group had not flown to the southwest on a course of 239 , but to the weston a course of 265 degrees . <p> That evidence comes mostly from the pilots themselves , who , in postwar oral interviews recalled that they had flown " westerly , " as one put it , " almost due west , " according to another , or more precisely ( from yet another ) , " at 265 degrees . " When one pilot , Troy Guillory , initially said that the air group flew " westerly , " his interviewer suggested that he must be mistaken , that the course was to the southwest , at 239 degrees . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with " and pointing to the chart " to the 265 line . " Ensign Ben Tappan stated simply , " We were going west . " The commander of the Hornet s scouting squadron ( VS-8 ) , Lieutenant Commander ( later Rear Admiral ) Walt Rodee bluntly said , " We took the bearing and the course they gave us . It was about 265 . . . . It was almost due west . " Rodee did not file an after-action report , but he did make note of the course in his flight logwhich he kept . Finally , the radar operator on board the Hornet recalled tracking the air group as it flew away from TF 16 , and said that as far as the CXAM radar could track the air group , it had flown outbound on a course of 265 degrees . Significantly , not all the pilots agreed . Ensign Clayton Fisher , who flew as wingman for the group commander on 4 June , claimed until his death in January 2012 that the air group flew southwest on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the discrepancy between Mitschers report and the pilots memories is difficult . The absence of any squadron reports from the Hornet is by itself suspicious and encourages the conclusion that Mitschers official report may well be in error . Not surprisingly , Spruance thought so , too . In his own report on the battle , he wrote , " Where discrepancies exist between Enterprise and Hornet reports , the Enterprise report should be taken as more accurate . " That is an astonishing statement to make in an official report , and comes close to asserting that Mitschers report was not to be trusted . 7 <h> A Calculated Risk <p> To try to resolve this mystery , it is essential to re-examine what the Americans knewor thought they knewabout Japanese intentions that day . Remember that most of the high commandincluding Mitscherbelieved the Japanese were operating in two carrier groups : the one that had been sighted , and a second one , which was presumed to be operating 80 to 100 miles to the rear . Mitscher knew that the planes from the Enterprise were going after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he may have harbored fears that even if that strike were successful the other two enemy carriers would remain untouchedand more important , that the element of surprise would be lost . <p> Pete Mitscher was the most senior U.S. Navy aviation officer afloat that day . Rear Admiral Bill Halsey , an aviator who was supposed to have commanded at Midway , was in the hospital . Captain George Murray , commander of the Enterprise , was Naval Aviator No. 22 , and Spruance had designated him as tactical air officer for the strike . But Mitscher , who was Naval Aviator No. 33 , had been selected for promotion to rear admiral , and his staff already was referring to him as " Admiral Mitscher . " In Halseys absence , Fletcher was the senior officer afloat , but neither he nor Spruance were aviators . It is easy to imagine that , in Mitschers mind , it was up to him to ensure the proper coordination of the air strikes . <p> Mitscher knew there would be only one chance to effect surprise , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toss-up . If the Enterprise planes succeeded in surprising and sinking the two enemy flattops at the known coordinates , it is entirely reasonable to assume that Mitscher may have calculated the best use of the Hornet s air group was to find and sink the two carriers that had not yet been sightedbut which presumably were operating 80 to 100 miles behind the other Japanese ships . In consideration of those factors , Mitscher may have told his air group leader , Commander Stanhope Ring , to take the entire air group to a position 80 miles behind the leading Japanese carriers . If one calculates that bearing from the Hornets position that morning , it turns out to be about 265 degrees . <p> If that is what happened , Mitscher apparently did not share the revised objective with any of the four squadron commandersjust with group commander Ring . That would explain why the commander of Torpedo Eight , Lieutenant Commander John Waldron , was so surprisedand then angrywhen he was told the course he was to fly . He knew that a course of 265 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plotted in the ready room that morning based on the location of the sighted Japanese carriers . <h> Broken Silence , Angry Words , and a Breakup <p> There are no official transcripts of the radio chatter that morning because everyone was supposed to be observing radio silence . The objective , after all , was surprise . But years later , many of the air-group pilots recalled what they heard being transmitted , and their memories are revealing . <p> After the Hornet s planes launched between 0700 and 0755 that morning , the bombers and fighters climbed to 20,000 feet while the torpedo planes flew almost three vertical miles below them at 1,500 feet . Though they all flew under radio silence , only about 15 minutes into the mission several of the pilots remembered John Waldrons voice coming through their headsets : " Youre going the wrong direction for the Japanese carrier force . " Ring was furious that Waldron had broken radio silence , and equally furious to be challenged on an open radio netin effect , in front of the entire command . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this flight , " he snapped . " You fly with us right here . " Waldron was not intimidated . " I know where the damned Jap fleet is , " he insisted . Ring , even angrier , barked back : " You fly on us ! I 'm leading this formation ; you fly on us . " There was a brief silence before a final rejoinder came from Waldron : " Well , the hell with you . I know where they are and I 'm going to them . " Three miles below Ring , Waldron banked his plane to the left , heading southwest . His entire squadron went with him . 8 <p> History tells us , of course , that Waldron was right . He did know where " the damned Jap fleet " was . And when he found it , his squadron was annihilated in a futile and hopeless attack against overwhelming odds . But meantime , what was happening with the rest of the Hornet air group ? A half hour after Waldron departed , the Wildcat fighters accompanying the strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , abandoned the mission , flying back toward the Hornet on a reciprocal course . None made it , for they had waited too long and failed to find the task force . All of them ran out of fuel and ditched in the ocean . Two pilots lost their lives . <p> Soon after the departure of the fighters , some pilots in the bombing squadron ( VB-8 ) recalled hearing another broadcast from Waldron : " Stanhope from Johnny One . Stanhope from Johnny One . " There was no reply , but there were more messages from Waldron : " Watch those fighters ! " and " My two wing men are going in the water . " 9 It was evident now that Waldron had indeed found the Kido Butai . Soon after that , the planes from the Hornet s bomber squadron , led by their CO , Lieutenant Commander Ruff Johnson , peeled off from the formation and turned south . Ring broke radio silence in an attempt to recall them , but they continued on , partly to look for the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midways airfield because Johnson doubted that his pilots had enough fuel left to make it all the way back to the Hornet . Eleven of them eventually landed on Midway ; three went into the water out of fuel ; and three managed to reach the Hornet . <p> Ring continued to fly west , now with just the scout bombers still in company . At 225 miles outnearly 100 miles beyond the calculated range to the targetthe scout bombers , too , left , low on fuel . Astonishingly , for a few brief moments Ring flew on by himself . Very soon , however , he gave up and turned . He flew back toward the Hornet completely aloneabandoned by his entire command . In the days final tally , just 20 of the 59 airplanes that took off from Hornet that morning returned . Not one of them had dropped a bomb on an enemy ship . <h> The Case for Fudging an After-Action Report <p> The episode has gone down in the history of the Battle of Midway as " the flight to nowhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of Scouting Eight or Bombing Eight made contact with the enemy . " That much of Mitschers report , at least , is true enough . But if the recollections of the pilots are accurate , much of the rest of his report is not . So we are still left with the puzzle of why Mitscher recounted a dramatically different story in his report . 10 It ca n't be known for certain , but a very plausible explanation is that three considerations influenced Mitscher . <p> First , by the time Mitscher sat down to write that report nine days later , he knew that all four Japanese carriers had been operating as a unit , so that if he had , in fact , made an independent decision to send the entire air group to look for two of them elsewhere , that decision would now be revealed asat the leastunwise . Second , by then Mitscher also knew most of the details of the several mutinous actions of the squadron commanders who , one by one , had defied orders and abandoned the group commander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly have to file court-martial papers against each of them . Disobeying orders during a war patrol , after all , is mutiny . <p> Finally ( and this may have been decisive ) by 13 June when Mitscher wrote his report , it was very clear that the Americans had won an overwhelming victory at Midwayindeed , the greatest triumph in U.S. naval history . It simply would not do , then , to sully that achievement with a raft of posthumous courts-martial against men such as Waldron . So instead of filing mutiny charges , Mitscher wrote this : " Torpedo Eight , led by Lieutenant Commander John C. Waldron , U.S.N. , was lost in its entirety . This squadron flew at 100 knots below the clouds while the remainder of the group flew at 110 knots climbing to 19,000 feet . Lieutenant Commander Waldron , a highly aggressive officer , leading a well-trained squadron , found his target and attacked . . . . This squadron is deserving of the highest honors for finding the enemy , pressing home its attack , without fighter protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 11 <p> So Waldron was not a mutineerhe was a hero . Mitscher may well have asked himself what was to be gained by submitting a report that attacked the memory of the martyred Waldron or filing court-martial papers against any of the other squadron commanders . So instead Mitscher recommended all of them for medals , told those squadron commanders who had survived not to file reports , and submitted what he knew to be a false report . <p> Is that what happened ? The best answer a responsible historian can offer now , 70 years later , is " probably . " The historical quest is never-ending , however , and it is not impossible that one day additional material will come to light that will help explain further the enigma of the so-called flight to nowhere . In the meantime , how do we assess the actions and decisions of Marc Mitscher at Midway ? Here was the man who , over the next three years , would command the Fast Carrier Task Force that led the American drive across the Pacific to Saipan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " The Magnificent Mitscher . " Should that assessment be modified based on the likelihood that he knowingly filed a false report about the Battle of Midway ? Or given the circumstances of 13 June 1942 , was his decision to gundeck the story of the flight to nowhere a reasonable one ?

The British , however , emerged from the conflict with total command of the oceans and broad experience in blockade and amphibious operations . <p> The War of 1812 was a conflict between two very different naval powers , a pattern that is far more common in naval history than tends to be appreciated . Aside from a fundamental contrast in their strengthBritain had the world 's leading navy while the United States lacked a battle fleetthe opposing sides used their navies for very different purposes . Because no large-scale naval clashes unfolded on the high seas , it is all too easy to underrate the crucial strategic dimensions of naval power and its importance for the character and development of the war . <p> The United States had maritime , rather than naval , strength . The American merchant marine had grown rapidly in size and importance after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , there was no comparable expansion in American naval power because the new country did not seek command of the sea nor transoceanic commercial or political dominion . Indeed , the last American warship was sold in 1785 . <p> The American Navy , however , was revived in the mid-1790s , albeit as a minor force . In 1794 Congress approved the construction of six frigates to fight against the privateering Barbary State of Algeria . The last of the six was launched during the 1798-1800 Quasi-War , which was the result of French maritime pressure on American trade . By 1812 , the U.S. Navy had experience , but it was on a totally different scale to the Royal Navy . The Americans had an abundance of trained seamen to man their Fleet and the most powerful frigates of the age , which they were to prove adept at handling in ship-to-ship actions , but they had no ships-of-the-line , unlike Britain , which dominated in this sphere . The U.S. Navy at the outset of the War of 1812 comprised only 16 ships , nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fleet action . <p> This reflected the force structure and naval doctrine developed under President Thomas Jefferson 's agrarian republicanism. 1 In part , concerns about the cost and likely effectiveness of a large fleet had encouraged opposition within the United States to its creation , while the Jefferson administration 's emphasis on gunboats conformed to a militia tradition . <h> Early American Naval Triumphs <p> Initially , the United States planned a quick land offensive against Lower Canada up the Champlain Valley , which led to only limited interest in a strategic role for the Navy . At the outbreak of the war , however , the Americans found it easier to act at sea than to strike on land , where there were problems with mobilization. 2 The need to protect trade was also a key issue , and concern about safeguarding incoming merchantmen helped ensure a shift in attitude . As a result , ships were to be sent to sea , not only to convoy merchantmen but also to destroy the British warships that might attack them . <p> A naval emphasis also accorded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war not as conquering Canada , but as pressuring Britain to end hostile commercial policies . The seizure of territory in Canada was also intended to further this objective , although , conversely , naval action was seen as a possible way to put pressure on the British in Canada . Indeed , there was a common naval focus because Canada was perceived as a key source of the naval resources , especially timber , needed by the British Navy . Moreover , President James Madison was convinced that Napoleon would succeed in limiting British access to its other major source of naval stores , the Baltic , which would focus greater attention on Canada . 3 <p> Commodore John Rodgers , the U.S. Navy 's senior officer , saw opportunities in taking the initiative , and in accordance with his proposal , the American warships at New York were sent to sea in two squadrons in 1812 . The three frigates and two smaller vessels under Rodgers searched for a British convoy homeward bound from the West Indies , which he saw as a source of wealth for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but after the squadrons had been dispersed , the U.S. frigates were more successful on their own . The British frigates Guerriere and Java fell victim to the Constitution , and a third Royal Navy frigate , the Macedonian , to the USS United States . With 24-pounder cannon , the American ships were more heavily gunned than the British vessels with their 18-pounders . <p> These successes provided an initially valuable boost to American morale . Congress awarded Captain Isaac Hull of the well-gunned Constitution a gold medal for his capture of the Guerriere on 19 August , although the collisions between the two ships showed that his seamanship was not what it should be . After the same ship captured the Java on 29 December , Captain William Bainbridge , who had replaced Hull in command , also received a Congressional Gold Medal . <p> Indeed , the Americans initially did better at sea than anticipated . The victories also helped cover the return of American merchantmen , whose cargoes and customs revenues contributed to financing the war . Conversely , the United States did worse on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker of the House of Representatives Henry Clay , however , grumbled , " Brilliant as they are . . . they do not fill up the void created by our misfortunes on land . " 4 <h> Reasons for the British Defeats <p> At sea , the British initially suffered from overconfidence ; inaccurate gunnery , which reflected poor gun drill ; and ships that were simply less powerful and less well prepared than those of their opponent . Fire from the Constitution ' s double-shotted guns , for example , demasted the Guerriere and repeatedly pierced her hull . In addition , the Royal Navy 's North American station was not key in the ongoing war with Napoleon and , as a result , had been starved of resources . Indeed , many of the British ships were in poor condition as well as short of sailors ; the latter was a continual problem for the Royal Navy that had helped lead to war . Moreover , the dockyards in Halifax and Bermuda lacked sufficient materiel and skilled shipwrights to ensure that the fleet remained seaworthy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British dockyards. 5 This was the underside of being the world 's leading naval power . <p> In contrast , the Americans could call on effective local dockyards , while better gunners and heavier guns greatly helped their warships , as with the United States ' capture of the Macedonian on 25 October 1812 . Aside from the three frigates , the other British losses in 1812 were all of smaller vessels , such as the sloop Alert , carrying 20 guns , captured by the Essex , with 46 , on 13 August . In this clash , the British guns were 18-pounder carronades , while all but six of the American guns were 32-pounder carronades . On 18 October , the sloop Wasp captured the British sloop Frolic , but was then quickly taken by the 74-gun HMS Poictiers . <p> The American successes in the 1812 frigate clashes caused a furor in Britain , with much public soul-searching about fighting quality . On 18 February 1813 , George Canning , a former treasurer of the navy and foreign secretary , told the House of Commons that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was broken . " 6 John Croker , the influential secretary to the Admiralty , thought it necessary to publish the " Letter on the Subject of the Naval War with America " in defense of the government . In response to a sense of crisis , the Admiralty both built up its Halifax-based squadron and issued an order that it had not felt obliged to promulgate in the case of the conflict with the French . On 10 July 1813 , Croker informed station commanders-in-chief that the Admiralty " did not conceive that any of His Majesty 's frigates should attempt to engage , single handed , the large class of American ships ; which though they may be called frigates , are of a size , complement and weight of metal much beyond that class , and more resembling line of battle ships . In the event of one of His Majesty 's frigates under your orders falling in with one of these ships , her captain should endeavour , in the first instance , to secure the retreat of His Majesty 's ship , but if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endeavour to manoeuvre , and keep company with her , without coming to action , in the hope of falling in with some other of His Majesty 's ships with whose assistance the enemy might be attacked with a reasonable hope of success . " 7 <p> A sense of the enormity of the British task led Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren , the head of the North American Station , to press for reinforcements . His argument , in January 1813 , was that these were needed " in consequence of the enemy 's privateers becoming daily more numerous and the assembling of a force of three thousand men at Eastport in present-day Maine on the frontiers of New Brunswick and menacing that province with attacks . " 8 <p> Nevertheless , aside from the fact that there would be no invasion of New Brunswick , America would exert no serious pressure on British naval strength . The United States built ships-of-the-line during the war , but they were not ready in numbers for battle , which was just as well in light of the Royal Navy 's numerical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched at Charlestown , Massachusetts , in June 1814 , while , four months later , the Washington , another 74-gunner , was completed at Portsmouth . Construction of the latter had begun in the spring of 1813 , which showed how long it took to build up naval strength . <p> Overall economic capability and institutional experience gave the British a considerable advantage at sea . By 1812 , the victualling system of the British Navy was feeding 145,000 men daily ( aside from prisoners ) , and it was possible to mount a formidable effort in North America . <p> Yet most of the Royal Navy , including its best commanders , was involved in operations against France . For example , Captain William Hoste , a protege of Vice Admiral Horatio Lord Nelson 's and a master of frigate operations , held the Adriatic in awe in 1812-14 . Napoleon had rebuilt his fleet after its heavy defeat at Trafalgar in 1805 , and the British had to devote much effort to blockading French ports and supporting land operations in Europe , especially in Iberia . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Navy was stretched in the Mediterranean , and there was particular anxiety about enemy sorties from Toulon in 1811 and 1812 . British naval resources were also strained elsewhere . 9 Nevertheless , the capture of French overseas bases lessened the ability of Napoleon 's navy to challenge the British , and thus made it possible to build up strength in American waters . Moreover , funding for the Royal Navy rose , reaching a peak of L 20.1 million in 1813. 10 <h> Denying Access to the Sea <p> American successes in individual clashes did not prevent the implementation of a British blockade of most of the United States that transformed the naval situation by lessening American options . Indeed , Croker wrote to Warren in January 1813 that the Admiralty had withdrawn ships from other stations to place " under your orders a force with which you can not fail to bring the naval war to a termination , either by the capture of the American national vessels , or by strictly blockading them in their own waters . " 11 <p> Blockade was seen as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by privately owned vesselsas well as trade . In March 1813 , Warren was ordered to blockade New York City , Charleston , Port Royal , Savannah , and New Orleans . Robert , 2nd Viscount Melville , who had become the First Lord of the Admiralty in June 1812 , wrote him that , <p> " We do not intend this as a mere paper blockade , but as a complete stop to all trade and intercourse by sea with those ports , as far as the wind and weather , and the continual presence of a sufficient armed force , will permit and ensure . If you find that this can not be done without abandoning for a time the interruption which you appear to be giving to the internal navigation of the Chesapeake , the latter object must be given up , and you must be content with blockading its entrance and sending in occasionally your cruisers for the purpose of harassing and annoyance. " 12 <p> Thus , blockade was seen as more important than raiding the Chesapeake Bay , an instructive indication of the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind when considering British operations . In fact , the blockade greatly harmed the U.S. economy , with exports dropping from $45 million in 1811 to $7 million in 1814 , and it became more effective from 1813 , restricting American raids as well as trade . 13 Studies tend to devote insufficient attention to the blockade , which drew together the military , political , and economic dimensions of the war . In some respects , it was the counterpart to the policy of essentially resting on the defensive recommended for Canada in 1812-13 , although it had far more capacity to bite . <p> Maintaining the blockade , however , was far from easy . Admiral Warren noted in December 1813 that British efforts at the mouth of the Chesapeake were not fully effective : " Several large Clipper Schooners of from two to three hundred Tons , strongly manned and armed have run thro ' the Blockade in the Chesapeak , in spite of every endeavour and of the most vigilant attention of our Ships to prevent their getting out , nor can any thing stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winds . " 14 <p> The English newspaper Trewman 's Exeter Flying-Post reported on 1 December 1814 , " Letters received from the American coast . . . state that the Constitution and Guerriere frigates had been victualled for twelve months , and were waiting for an opportunity to slip out to seawhich it was expected a dark night whilst our ships were blown from the coast by the gales , would present to them . " In January 1815 , the 18-gun sloops USS Hornet and Peacock were able to evade the British blockade of New York City en route for the South Atlantic , although the frigate President surrendered after failing to breach the New York blockade , and the Constellation , also a frigate , could not break through the Chesapeake blockade . As a result , the attempt to operate the U.S. warships in squadron strength failed . A squadron might have been powerful enough to overcome a British convoy . <p> If , by strengthening their blockade , the British lessened the inroads of American privateers and warships , the Americans nevertheless thought it worthwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political and public conviction , drawing on the euphoria arising from victories , that naval power was worthwhile and a more specific awareness that it had indeed brought advantages . <h> Rising and Declining Naval Success <p> British gunnery improved during the war as , more generally , did Royal Navy effectiveness in Atlantic waters and on the Great Lakes . This can be seen in the fate of American warships and commanders . Stephen Decatur , already a hero for seizing and burning the captured Philadelphia in Tripoli Harbor in 1804 , captured the frigate Macedonian off the Azores when he commanded the United States . Yet his reputation was compromised when he surrendered the President . 15 <p> The 44-gun frigate slipped out of New York on the night of 14 January 1815 but sustained severe damage when her pilot ran her aground on the Sandy Hook bar . Chased by blockaders the next day , the President shot the sails from the yards of a 42-gun pursuer . When two lesser frigates closed in , one of which poured two broadsides into the President , Decatur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-pounders , versus the American frigate 's 24- and 42-pounders , and in Theodore Roosevelt 's estimation , the famous American commander " acted rather tamely , certainly not heroically " in not fighting it out with them . " At least it was well worth trying . " 16 <p> Larger British naval forces were also effective against individual ships farther afield . In the frigate Essex , Captain David Porter had successfully attacked British commerce in the South Atlantic and the South Pacific , capturing 12 whalers and their valuable cargo off the Galapagos Islands in 1813 . This was part of a major extension in American trade warfare , but two British warships forced Porter to surrender off Valparaiso , Chile , on 28 March 1814 after they cannonaded his disabled ship from a distance . Six months later , the British suffered far more casualties than the Americans when they attacked the privateer General Armstrong in the Azores ' Faial Harbor , but the Americans eventually scuttled and burned the ship . <p> In addition , the British were often successful in conflicts between individual ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chesapeake off Boston in a bloody clash fought at close range in which a lack of preparedness on the part of the American commander was a key factor . 17 On 14 August 1813 , the USS Argus was captured off Wales by the similarly gunned Pelican after the British gunners proved superior . 18 The next year , the British frigate Le Rhin captured the largest privateer to sail from Charleston , the Decatur , which had boarded and seized the British sloop Dominica in August 1813 . <p> American privateers and small warships nevertheless had an overall impact on Great Britain 's merchant marine . British trade was higher in 1814 than in 1811 ; however , the country 's traders necessarily faced the risk of attack from American privateers . This affected the practice and profitability of trade . 19 According to Lloyd 's , the British lost 1,175 merchantmen during the war of which only 373 were recaptured , and although overall insurance rates remained steady , they rose in some particular trades . 20 This showed that even a modest American fleet had been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 21 <p> British privateering meanwhile made major inroads on American trade , as well as bringing prosperity to the British possessions of Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and Bermuda , where the raiders were based . These privateers faced fewer obstacles from American warships than their counterparts did from the British fleet , which was a measure of the success of the Royal Navy and its blockade . 22 The navy could also provide the convoy protection necessary to send reinforcements to Canada . 23 Had it been necessary , the service could have provided direct assistance to Quebec ( while the St. Lawrence was free from ice ) or Halifax , and without capturing those positions , Canada could not be taken . <h> Shore Raids and Amphibious Operations <p> As well as privateers , blockaders , and high-seas warships , the United States had to contend with British amphibious operations . In September 1812 , William Duane , the editor of the Jeffersonian Philadelphia newspaper Aurora who was to be made an adjutant general , informed President Madison about his concern that the British would land a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former by bombardment . 24 Indeed the defense problems of New England were linked to opposition there to the war . 25 <p> Since the start of the conflict the British launched raids on the American coast . The damage they inflicted in part testified to a willingness to make civilians suffer . 26 Four days after the Americans turned back a June 1813 amphibious assault off Norfolk , at Craney Island , the British captured , pillaged , and burned nearby Hampton , Virginia . ( The British Army officer in charge blamed the excesses on his command 's two " Independent Companies of Foreigners , " composed of French prisoners of war who chose to fight for their captors . 27 ) Some British commanders , however , took measures to limit civilian suffering . For instance , Commodore Sir Thomas Hardy went out of his way to avoid noncombatant casualties when four warships under his command staged a four-day bombardment of tiny Stonington , Connecticut , in August 1814. 28 <p> The Americans had no control over whether raids could escalate into large-scale amphibious attacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports lacked adequately integrated defenses , and there was also a widespread absence of planning for such attacks . 29 American concern about amphibious assaults led , in July 1813 , to the creation of a Corps of Sea Fencibles for the " defense of ports and harbors of the United States . " Two companies of Baltimore fencibles helped defend Fort McHenry against the British in 1814 . <p> Naval strength on coastal and inland waterways , moreover , allowed the British to safely land large numbers of troops . Such was the case in August 1814 when some 4,000 regulars came ashore 25 miles up Maryland 's Patapsco River , routed a ragtag American force at Bladensburg , and burned Washington , D.C. About four months later , an even larger British force landed at Bayou Bienvenu , Louisiana , but its advance on New Orleans ended in a debacle . <p> British amphibious capability was retained to the end . On 11 February 1815 , Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane captured Fort Bowyer , which protected Mobile . When hostilities ceased with news of the 24 December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first Savannah and then Charleston had been planned , and both were already blockaded . 30 Indeed , a report from HMS Ceylon off Georgia indicated that Admiral Sir George Cockburn was threatening to attack New York City . 31 <p> In contrast to British successes in American waters , the U.S. plan in May 1813 and May 1814 for a small squadron to cruise off Nova Scotia and the St. Lawrence to intercept British supply ships failed , in large part due to the British blockade of American ports . Alongside the key factor of the unpopularity of the war in New England , naval weakness also ensured that the Americans could not mount amphibious attacks on maritime Canada . <h> The War at Sea 's Repercussions and Meanings <p> The War of 1812 was not a success for the United States as a naval power , but it was a triumph for its naval reputation . The ability to win duels at sea in 1812 created a lasting impression and helped make the U.S. Navy more popular than the Army . The Navy had been more successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , in 1816 Congress agreed to finance a plan for nine new ships-of-the-line and 12 large frigates ; four and two , respectively , had been launched by 1826 . <p> On the other hand , emphasizing the popularity the U.S. Navy gained during the war detracts from the realist perspective that , on the high seas , American power after 1815 remained dependent on British acceptance . In 1810 Britain had 152 ships-of-the-line and 183 frigates . The loss of several frigates to the U.S. Navy was humiliating . Indeed , the British responded to their shame by exaggerating the strength of the American warships and underplaying those of the British ships . <p> The loss of the frigates , however , was no real qualification of British maritime power . The War of 1812 was no triumph for Britain 's naval reputation , but it underlined the extent of Britain 's broad naval power and indicated what that offered in terms of blockade and amphibious capability . <p> 1 .

On 6 February 1813 , President James Madison instructed the American commander of the northeast theater , Major General Henry Dearborn , on the need to outbuild the British on the Lakes : " " If they build two ships , we should build four . If they build thirty or 40 gun ships , we should build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those waters is the hinge on which the war will essentially turn according to the probable course of it . " " 1 <p> The previous year , Captain Isaac Chauncey , former commandant of the New York Navy Yard , had built up a force that established a powerful presence on Lake Ontario , while in 1813 , Master Commandant Oliver Hazard Perry built nine ships , reversing the situation on Lake Erie . In 1814 , however , the British recovered their position above the Detroit River on Lake Huron , using small boats . 2 They were also able to construct the St. Lawrence , a 104-gun three-decker , at Kingston on Lake Ontario , while about 25 miles away at Sackets Harbor , New York , the Americans worked on a ship-of-the-line , the New Orleans . 3 <p> The benefit gained from an increased naval presence on the Great Lakes , however , must be set against the formidable logistical challenge posed by the requirements of building up the naval forces . These demands limited the prospects for land operations at the same time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect ; defeated opponents were forced to rely on the slower prospect of movement by land , while the victors could move troops over water . <p> The latter advantage was such that the Duke of Wellington , who had experience with combined operations and had benefited from British command of the sea , advised Liverpool in November 1814 that without dominating the Lakes " " it is impossible . . . to keep the enemy out of the whole frontier with Canada , much less to make conquest . " " 4 He added the following month , " " I have told the Ministers repeatedly that a naval superiority on the lakes is a sine qua non of success in war on the frontier of Canada , even if our object should be solely defensive . " " 5 <p> Alfred Thayer Mahan , the great theorist of naval warfare who was a key advocate of American deep-sea naval power later in the century , argued that " " the victories on Lake Erie and Lake Champlain do illustrate , in a distinguished manner . . . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to an inland body of fresh water . " " 6 At the same time , such superiority , while important around the Lakes , did not provide more than an advantage farther afield . More generally , the American 1813 campaigns around the Lakes also indicated the problems of sustaining and exploiting advantages . <p> That year , Perry 's victory at the Battle of Lake Erie cleared the way for Major General William Henry Harrison 's invasion of Upper Canada and defeat of British Major General Henry Procter 's British-Indian force . On Lake Ontario , meanwhile , the Americans mounted an amphibious operation that led to the capture of Fort George . Nevertheless , the successes came to naught . Harrison 's army withdrew and was broken up , and at the end of 1813 , the British captured Fort Niagara , across the Niagara River from Fort George . 
@@21175656 @1175656/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> Forging a Global Network of Navies <p> By Admiral Jonathan Greenert and Rear Admiral James M. Foggo III , U.S. Navy <p> As the world becomes more complex and the oceans less secure , we are compelled to strengthen the bonds of international maritime cooperation . <p> The United States of America maintains the largest maritime force in the world . The U.S. Navy is uniquely postured to operate forward and be ready to respond to any threat globally . This enables us to have naval forces present where it matters and when it matters . Throughout history , however , we have learned that it is almost always in the best interest of nations to act together when responding to crises , whether it involves deterrence or combat or providing humanitarian support . Accordingly , the U.S. Navy has rarely operated alone in a crisis . One of our advantages , as a nation and as a Navy , has been our extensive network of alliances , partnerships , and coalitions . <p> In 2007 , Admiral Mike Mullen addressed more than 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seapower Symposium in Newport , Rhode Island . He challenged the international community to act in concert when responding to threats to the global maritime domain , and he shared his vision of a " 1,000-Ship Navy " fueled by the common interest of global stability and economic prosperity . The " 1,000-Ship Navy " stimulated much discussion among our partners across the globe . Some wondered how contributions would be solicited , what the command-and-control structure would look like , and how binding the concept would become . The debate prompted Admiral Mullen to explain : <p> The 1,000-Ship Navy is a fleet-in-being of nations willing to participate in global maritime partnerships ( GMP ) . To face the challenges we do today , nobody can do it alone . Many countries are looking for ways to help create security through an international navy . The barriers to entry here are very low . You do n't  have to join ; you do n't  have to sign a treaty . 1 <p> GMP was a new approach to cooperation among maritime nations . It served countries with a shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of the seas . It was also a basis for building a global consensus on policy and principles , and for undertaking common activities to address maritime challenges by improving collective capabilities . GMP sought opportunities to assist one another in using the sea for lawful purposes and legitimate commerce , while limiting use as appropriate by those who might threaten national , regional , or global security . <h> How Many Ships Does it Take ? <p> Since its inception , the GMP initiative has been remarkably successful . The main focus of GMP was " partnership " and not " number of ships . " But it is worth reviewing the international ship inventory that contributes to offshore maritime security . Public-source documents show almost 12,000 ships in the service of navies around the world . About 7,700 of those ships are designated as " patrol craft " and therefore might not be considered " blue-water " capable by some . But they are still able to make an important contribution in littoral areas or coastal defense . On any given day , 685 multinational ships are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maritime capacity to protect local , regional , and global commons . The breakdown by class and size ( tonnage ) of these vessels is included in the tables here . 2 <p> By leveraging the robust capacity of navies worldwide , we are better postured collectively to face new and emerging challenges in the 21st century . There is no magic number of ships required to make coalition operations successful . What does matter is getting the right mix of capacity and capability in the right place , at the right time . <h> Forces Downsize , Challenges Grow <p> In the current economic environment , most navies are facing fiscal challenges at home , which is forcing cuts or slowing growth in developing sea power to meet their respective needs . At the same time , security challenges in the maritime domain continue to grow ; for example , transnational " bad actors " continue to use the maritime domain to support illegal or illicit activity . Terrorists , insurgents , and criminals are relying on freedom of the seas to support operations . The more ungoverned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them to foster dangerous and disruptive activities . <p> Chinas rise , both economically and militarily , has proceeded at an extraordinary rate , creating anxiety and sovereignty challenges in the Asia-Pacific region . Further , technological advances , low-cost weapon systems , and their market availability have contributed to the development of anti-access/area-denial strategies , such as employing mines , antiship cruise missiles , and antiship ballistic missiles to deny access or restrict maneuverability of naval forces , particularly at the maritime crossroads . <p> Recent examples underscoring the volatility of the world we live in include the Arab Spring , Syrias use of chemical weapons , Irans nuclear quest , North Koreas nuclear-weapon program and unpredictable behavior , and the crisis in Ukraine , just to name a few . Additionally , the impacts of natural disasters such as tsunamis , typhoons , and earthquakes only add to the uncertainty . <p> Fiscal pressures have impacted all but a few of the worlds most capable navies . These considerations require all of us to think strategically about the investment of resources . It is a major reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the years to come . Navies must lead in promoting , and adhering to , a system of international norms and standards of behavior . Accordingly , we must look for new ways to nurture relationships and form partnerships ( ad hoc as appropriate ) with traditional and nontraditional maritime partners who share a stake in international commerce , safety , security , and freedom of the seas . Operating together , we must prepare innovative and low-cost ways to respond to these emerging threats to regional and global stability . <h> Why a Network Is Important <p> The international community has become an economically hyper-connected global network of independent states pursuing prosperity and security . Trade and commerce transcend borders , while globalization drives interdependence among nations . With 90 percent of global trade by volume transported by sea , shipping lanes and the freedom to navigate them have become the critical elements of the worlds economic infrastructure . 3 As a result , the security of these commons is now a core issue for all nations , regardless of size or capability . President Barack Obama put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more interconnected , we all have responsibilities to work together to solve common challenges . " 4 <p> With the growth of globalization over the past two decades , collective security has become more vital to global economic stability . For example , recent academic studies have forecast the effects of the total shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz . If this maritime crossroad were closed , and a complete disruption of oil flow from the Persian Gulf resulted , studies predict that the global price for oil would rise 160 percent . 5 <p> As the world becomes more complex and the oceans less secure , we are compelled to move beyond the GMP initiative and forge a " Global Network of Navies . " The value of a Network of Navies is that it provides an open and adaptive architecture for facilitating both long-term cooperation and spontaneous , short-lived collaboration . This network can allow countries with converging interests in the maritime domain to form mission-focusedoften temporarygoal-oriented associations to address common maritime-security challenges . Whereas close partnerships can take years to develop , a network can rapidly support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to changing circumstances , while simultaneously providing an enduring backbone for the growth and development of deeper cooperation . <p> Individual navies can " plug in " to nodes of the network when it serves their interests , and then expand , contract , or otherwise alter their participation when it suits them . An advantage of a network is that the individual participants immediately gain the benefit of capabilities and capacities of all the other members of the network , and can rapidly leverage the resources of the network to provide force multipliers and extend the reach of their own capabilities . As such , the Global Network of Navies provides the opportunity for countries to more effectively meet the challenges of insecurity in the maritime environment in spite of resource constraints . The only requirements are a willingness to collaborate and the creation of a network that is scalable , durable , responsive , flexible , and interoperable . This makes the Global Network of Navies key to the collective future security of all maritime nations . <h> Global Network Already Under Way <p> There are those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rely on coalitions or partnerships to solve all of our problems . We have to " go it alone " because coalitions or partnerships are not enduring or binding , and they are sometimes limited by differing perspectives on authorities , rules of engagement , and national caveats . But a Global Network of Navies already exists . No singular response to crisis is ever the same . A network construct must be flexible and adaptable to different circumstances . Not all nations with the requisite maritime capacity or capability will always see it in their best interests to participate . That is their option , but there is compelling evidence that when like-minded nations get together , the whole of their contributions is always greater than the sum of their parts . Several vignettes illustrate how this network is already confronting common threats to our collective security around the globe . <p> In these examples the leadership and interrelations of various maritime networks are flexible . Leadership on the seas hinges more on the willingness and capability of participating nations , and the trust they engender from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navy . In areas like the Gulf of Aden , for instance , multinational forces rotate through leadership roles as they have in Combined Task Force ( CTF ) -151 for the last five years of its mission to combat piracy in the waters off Somalia . Commanders of CTF-151 have included officers from Thailand , Turkey , Singapore , Pakistan , Australia , New Zealand , Denmark , and the United States . Likewise , the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon ( UNIFIL ) Maritime Task Force ( MTF ) also consists of multinational forces that rotate the lead country in support of the Lebanese navy in monitoring its territorial waters . The MTF has been led by Germany , Italy , France , Belgium , and Brazil since first deploying in 2006 . CTF-151 and UNIFIL MTF are models for preplanned partnership operations and are two examples that we offer for your consideration in the seven vignettes that follow . <p> CTF-151 Conducts Counterpiracy in the Gulf of Aden : The international communitys response to piracy is an example of nations uniting against a common threat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ocean to the Somali coast , up through the Gulf of Aden and into the Red Sea are some of the busiest in the world . They also provide an endless supply of ships to pirates who , by mid-2005 , were being organized and funded by highly developed transnational criminal organizations . That year the International Maritime Bureau , a department within the International Chamber of Commerce that deals with maritime crimes , reported an " alarming rise " in the number of pirate attacks and hijackings in and around Somalia . <p> Piracy emanating from Somalia presented a real problem for the international communitynon-state actors in a strategically essential location threatening a vital artery of the global economy . This clear and present threat in a large swath of ocean compelled independent nations to reclaim sea space from Somali pirates . The United States and its allies , recognizing their vital stake in the matter , used existing resources to establish CTF-151 . The strategic scope of this security issue also attracted new countries to the region . Nations with considerably less experience operating forward , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding a solution . <p> In the years that followed , the standard in the Gulf of Aden became a diverse , non-allied makeup of 30 vessels from 20 different countries patrolling sea-lanes and denying pirates the opportunity to seize international shipping assets . This uncommon group of ships led to new opportunities to cooperate . 6 In 2012 the United States rescued an Iranian-flagged merchant ship under pirate attack . In 2013 the USS Mason ( DDG-87 ) joined the Chinese destroyer Harbin to conduct a series of evolutions , including counterpiracy drills , live-fire proficiency , and aviation operations . All were aimed at enhancing military-to-military interoperability in the region and beyond . These examples demonstrate how a Global Network of Navies can respond to a broad range of threats to collective security and drive even the most diverse nations together under a common cause . <p> UNIFIL MTF : Deployed since October 2006 , UNIFIL MTF supports the Lebanese navy in monitoring its territorial waters , securing the Lebanese coastline , and preventing the unauthorized entry of arms or related material by sea into Lebanon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the mandate of U.N . Security Council resolution 1701 . This is the first naval task force ever to take part in a U.N . peacekeeping mission . The deployment of UNIFIL MTF after the Israel/Lebanon conflict of JulyAugust 2006 was a landmark move that prompted Israel to lift its naval blockade of Lebanon . A total of 15 countries have contributed to the MTF : Bangladesh , Belgium , Brazil , Bulgaria , Denmark , France , Germany , Greece , Indonesia , Italy , Netherlands , Norway , Spain , Sweden , and Turkey . UNIFIL-MTF is currently led by Brazil and comprises naval units from Bangladesh ( two ships ) , Brazil ( one shipflagship ) , Germany ( two ships ) , Greece ( one ship ) , Indonesia ( one ship ) , Italy ( one ship ) , and Turkey ( one ship ) . It is both notable and commendable that these capable navies have undertaken the peacekeeping and maritime-security mission with an enduring commitment . All nations benefit from the enhanced security provided by UNIFIL in the Eastern Mediterranean . 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trafficking has long plagued the United States and other countries in the Western Hemisphere . In fact , most narcotics destined for black-market sale in the United States travel through the maritime domain . Understanding the multinational nature of this issue , President Bill Clinton established the Joint Interagency Task Force South ( JIATF-S ) in 1993 . JIATF-S is a U.S.-led interagency task force charged with supporting U.S. and partner-nation security through drug interdiction in Central and South America . Not only does the task force coordinate operations between the U.S. Navy , Coast Guard , and law-enforcement entities such as the Drug Enforcement Agency , but it also engages multinational partners seeking to eliminate illicit trafficking throughout the region . <p> Twenty years after its establishment , this maritime coalition continues to thrive . In 2013 the efforts of 14 Western Hemisphere and European nations seized over 131 metric tons of cocaine valued at approximately $3 billion . In addition , this coalition has had the opportunity to blend physical resourcesin early 2014 , an armed U.S. helicopter launched from a British auxiliary ship and seized over $37 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound example of how nations faced with a common security threat can establish deep maritime partnerships rooted in trust and cooperation . The task forces success proves how the worlds navies can join together to confront common threats and shows how nations can succeed in achieving a strong level of interoperability . <p> Mitigating the Mine-Warfare Threat in the Strait of Hormuz : Since the Shah of Iran was overthrown in 1979 , relations between Tehran and many Western nations have been tense and unfriendly . The strain of this relationship recently came to a head when , in 2009 , the United Nations passed sweeping sanctions targeting the Iranian economy in order to modify Irans behavior . Iran responded by issuing a volley of threats , stating that it would take action to block the Strait of Hormuz , essentially halting the flow of oil from the Middle East , if it perceived any future threats from foreign powers . <p> The prospect of cutting off Middle Eastern oil to the rest of the worldperhaps achieved through the covert deployment of sea minesreverberated throughout the international community , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took this opportunity to align support and coordinate an international response . After weighing options , U.S. Central Command hosted 29 countries in a comprehensive , wholly defensive minesweeping exercise , named the International Mine Countermeasures Exercise ( IMCMEX ) . Conducted in two phases , the exercise encouraged the exchange of ideas among senior military leaders in 2012 . During the second phase in 2013 , 35 ships trained together in a task force in order to improve tactical performance and interoperability , mine hunting , helicopter mine-countermeasure operations , and multinational explosive-ordnance disposal . 9 <p> In January 2014 , General James Mattis , the commander of U.S. Central Command , said : " We did n't  make an anti-Iranian exercise , we made an anti-mine exercise . . . the Iranians looked at it and realized they were actually creating an international coalition against them that was brought forward by the only navy in the world that could have done it .

This coalitions success underscored Irans isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctions , assisted in fostering a temporary deal in 2013 so negotiations on the future of its nuclear program could take place . 10 <p> Response to Typhoon Haiyan : On 8 November 2013 , Super Typhoon Haiyan struck the central Philippines , killing an estimated 5,000 people and affecting another 13.7 million . <p> Within hours of the storm , multiple disaster-relief efforts were deployed . U.S. military support needed to be coordinated in concert with various countries , nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) , and other contributors . Traditional information silos created a challenge for responders who did not have access to the same data . The United States launched the Typhoon Haiyan Response Group on the All Partners Access Network to provide organizations and the military forces of diverse countries , foreign governments , and NGOs a centralized location to share information , increase situational awareness , and decrease response time . <p> The United States , however , was not the only country to recognize the need to respond . In the aftermath of the storm , 57 nations contributed almost $350 million in aid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ground support to transport aid workers , provide aerial reconnaissance , deliver relief supplies , clear roads , and evacuate those affected . This response , in the form of a spontaneous coalition , was the result of a humanitarian crisis that threatened regional stability and economic prosperity . <p> During the crisis , China was publicly criticized for its muted response . The lack of substantive action can be traced to the ongoing territorial disputes between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea , where tensions have risen , particularly in and around the Scarborough Shoal and the First and Second Thomas Shoal . China took note , however , of the outpouring of international cooperation that put enormous pressure on the Chinese to respond more robustly . As a result , China increased its financial contribution and also deployed a naval hospital ship , the Peace Ark , to join multilateral efforts at sea . The spontaneous , very public show of support for the Philippines that included the formation of a Global Network of Navies to help in providing supplies and rescue assistance caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over political differences with the Philippines . 11 <p> The Elimination of Chemical Weapons in Syria : In 1997 , 98 percent of the worlds nations signed and ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention , making the use of chemical weapons an egregious violation of international law . The goal of this arms-control treaty , which has its roots in the 1925 Geneva Protocol , is to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction by prohibiting the development , stockpiling , or use of chemical weapons . 12 <p> Following the Syrian governments use of chemical weapons on its own population in August 2013 , the threat of use of force by the U.S. Navy enabled a diplomatic solution to the crisis . In a U.N.-brokered deal , the Assad regime agreed to surrender its stockpiles of mustard gas and nerve agents to the international community . The agreement was hailed as a breakthrough , with all five permanent members of the U.N . Security Council voting in favor of the expeditious destruction of Syrias chemical-weapons stockpile . Syrias actions facilitated the formation of uncommon partnerships . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denmark , Italy , Germany , China , Russia , and the United States came together to respond on behalf of the international community . This loosely formed coalition includes ships from five countries and also relies on the maritime-port infrastructure of Italy and Germany to facilitate the eventual destruction of Syrias stockpile . 13 <p> Search for Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 : The most recent example of navies coming together for a common purpose is the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 . A Global Network of Navies , partnering with air forces and coast guard assets from 12 different nationsthe United States , Australia , China , India , Indonesia , Japan , Malaysia , New Zealand , Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and Vietnamconducted an international search-and-rescue ( SAR ) operation east and west of the Malaysian mainland . Warships , maritime-patrol craft , helicopters , and a variety of other platforms conducted a focused search in the South China Sea , Gulf of Thailand , Malacca Strait , Andaman Sea , and Indian Ocean to locate the aircraft that disappeared on 8 March . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these nations came together to form a global maritime coalition . 14 <p> Maritime-coalition SAR operations are not uncommon occurrences , but the magnitude of support for the Malaysian airliner search and the composition of nations contributing ships and aircraft validate the concept of the Global Network of Navies and demonstrate how we are able to find ways to form relationships with traditional and nontraditional maritime partners , operate together , and produce innovative ways to respond to many different types of crises . <h> Growing the Global Network <p> These vignettes and other examples attest to the fact that a Global Network of Navies is already under way . As described earlier , this network is 685 ships on any given day . The U.S. Navy has about 100 battle-force ships under way globally , daily . Our challenge is to make this network more effective . We will need the help of other heads of navies to undertake a plan for improving this network so we are prepared to deter or limit future conflict , protect global prosperity , and provide humanitarian support when needed . Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where there is lawlessness , we must be present ; when there are crises , we must respond . There is no problem too great and no contribution too small for the Global Network of Navies . Its success requires our collective participation . By pooling our resources , together we can overcome the challenges that threaten freedom and security in the global commons . <p> 2 . Exercise . When there is time and resources , we must exercise together to improve interoperability . In June , 23 nations will assemble in the Hawaiian operating areas for the biannual Pacific Rim ( RIMPAC ) multinational maritime exercise . For the first time , the Chinese navy will be full participants in RIMPAC along with a host of other Association of Southeast Asian Nations partners . We will learn much about one another , but most important , we will learn how to work together . The lessons learned and the relationships established between these maritime partners will serve to strengthen the Global Network of Navies as we face new challenges over the horizon . <p> 3 . Talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet together , either embarked or ashore , to share our ideas and provide innovative solutions to problems . The International Maritime Seapower Symposium , Western Pacific Naval Symposium , Indian Ocean Naval Symposium , and the International Seapower Symposium ( ISS ) are all excellent gatherings that enable the fulfillment of this goal . The U.S. Navy will sponsor the 21st ISS at the Naval War College in Newport , Rhode Island , in September . This year , we will endeavor to make improved maritime partnership one of the focal points of the ISS agenda . <p> 4 . Standardize . We must develop a common language . It is imperative to have a standardized way of interacting on the seas , where we can be clear about one anothers intentions and operations . Maritime data standards help ensure consistent vocabulary and processes are used to promote safety and security . <p> 5 . Exchange Ideas . We must foster navy-to-navy exchanges between our officer and noncommissioned-officer corps . And we must send our best and brightest to take part in these exchanges that build relationships and foster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commander course , now expanding beyond the Naval War College to the Fleet level , and the Personnel Exchange Program are two prime examples whereby our leaders and future leaders can meet and share lessons learned and best practices with their counterparts . We will endeavor to increase enrollment and expand access to partner nations having not yet participated in this course of instruction . <p> We are all facing similar fiscal pressure and rising challenges at sea , and no one nation has the ability to be everywhere all the time or to act alone . It is incumbent upon nations to work together in support of global maritime security . This goal is achievableassuming we are committed to building trust and confidence . We must protect our interests around the world , we must promote and adhere to a system of international norms , and we must maintain stability worldwide by deterring potential adversaries from provoking regional conflicts . Achieving these goals wont happen overnight ; it is a process that takes time and enduring commitment . It is about developing and fostering relationships with our international partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sea . <p> As we work together to facilitate interoperability and build trust , we will all become stronger and better able to deal with the shared security challenges we face today and tomorrow . <p> 12 .

The impact that Naval Air Station ( NAS ) Corpus Christi has had on our nation during more than 70 years of war and peace is immeasurableit played a crucial role in the air war against Japan and later during the Vietnam War . <p> For years , Representative Richard Kleberg had lobbied Congress unsuccessfully for a naval base in his South Texas district . But with the increased likelihood that the United States would become involved in World War II , the Navy needed more aviators , and NAS Pensacola , Florida , lacked the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , on 11 June 1940 Congress passed a naval appropriation bill authorizing the construction of 12 naval air stations , the largest to be built in the Flour Bluff section of Corpus Christi , a dozen miles south of the citys more heavily populated areas . The South Texas coastal region , with its year-round flying weather and expansive flat terrain , was well suited for training aviators . <p> Realizing the economic boost that the naval presence would provide , Corpus Christis civic leaders gave the Navy an added incentive640 acres of undeveloped city land to add to what the government would purchase , plus $2 million to help with the cost of construction . President Franklin D. Roosevelt , a staunch advocate of naval aviation , signed the appropriation bill on 13 June , and construction began days later . <p> Texas Representative Lyndon B. Johnson , with the support of Undersecretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal , succeeded in having the building contract granted to Brown and Root Construction Company of Houston , a major contributor to Johnsons political campaigns . Instead of the customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fixed-fee basis that authorized close to $24 million for constructing the station and another $2.5 million for the contractors . 1 ( The cost would eventually exceed $100 million . ) Two other construction companies , W. S. Bellows of Houston and Columbia of California , were subcontracted . <p> Soon more than 9,000 men and women were working on the project as mechanics , machinists , engineers , electricians , welders , laborers , plumbers , cooks , and physicians . After the sites 125 permanent residents40 familieswere relocated , houses , fishing shacks , sand dunes , mesquite trees , and scrub brush were bulldozed and replaced by a two-story administration building , barracks , 39 miles of railroad track , paved streets , a pipeline , aircraft hangars , runways , seaplane ramps , power plants , a seawall , hospital , chapel , gymnasium , mess and recreation facilities , and a massive assembly and repair building for aircraft maintenance . <p> The station was already 70 percent completed when it was dedicated on 11 March 1941 .

They had met the Navys requirement of physical fitness with at least two years of college , were within the 20-to-28 age range , and had passed the elimination pilot test at various naval reserve training bases . One of the first cadets was Ed Parker of Oakland , California , a graduate of the College of the Pacific with a major in accounting . Parker had worked as a bank clerk for three years before realizing how badly he wanted to fly . He passed the Navy elimination pilot test after taking 15 hours of dual instruction and an hour of solo flight . 3 <p> Ground school began on 7 April and flight training a month later , when the first aircraft arrivedNaval Aircraft Factory N3N-3 Canary or " Yellow Peril " biplanes .

Down in Texas it has built a factory that is turning them out , ready for anything , in 6 months . " 4 The cadet featured in the article as " Joe Barker " was actually Ed Parker , selected , he believed , as " a typical American kid . " 5 <p> On 1 November 1941 , the 45 cadets who successfully completed training received their commissions and gold wings . Interviewed for the local newspaper , newly commissioned Ensign Don Hager of Crockett , Texas , said : " Everything was new when we got here . Our class has been a bunch of guinea pigs . Precedents had to be set , and we have done the setting . " Although anxious to join the Fleet , Hager was among the new ensigns ordered to remain at the base as instructors . 6 <p> Only five weeks later the nation was at war and the station on full alert with a seven-day round-the-clock schedule . Captain Alva D. Bernhard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corpus Christi , proudly proclaimed the facility " the University of the Air . " During the war , of the 35,000 men who successfully completed flight training there , many flew combat missions in the Pacific . Although most of the cadets , along with Navy and Marine Corps officers , were Americans , other trainees came from Great Britain , Canada , Mexico , and South America . With thousands of civilian employees at the station , the government had several housing units built off base exclusively for those with dependents . Separate housing was built for families designated as " Anglo-American , " " Latin-American , " and " negro . " <h> Other than Pilots <p> Also assigned to the naval air training bases ( after auxiliary airfields were added Corpus Christi was no longer referred to as " center " ) were WAVES ( Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service ) who served as instrument training ( Link ) instructors , parachute riggers , aerologists , meteorologists , radio operators , hospital apprentices , mechanics , metalsmiths , pressure-chamber technicians , air-traffic controllers , gunnery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor and a chaplains assistant . Mary Elizabeth Variel found her new assignment " very pleasant if you do n't  mind large cockroaches in your locker , and shoes mildewing. " 7 <p> There were humorous incidents . One of WAVE Link trainer instructor Irma Julkes students was ten minutes into his cross-country " flight " when the simulator appeared to go in all directions . The loud thumping and sounds from inside led her to believe that the cadet had " cracked up . " As she later recalled : <p> I grabbed a wing , put the trainer in its straps and cautiously raised the hood . The door to the cockpit flew open and out jumped my angry student hollering that a roach had crawled up his pant leg . Sure enough , out crawled a Texas-sized roach whose tiny legs had felt like spurs . He sure drew a crowd . The flight was continued successfully . The next day the order was given that NO FOOD was allowed in the area . 8 <p> After completing their basic training , cadets were introduced to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SNV Valiant , or " Vibrator , " so called because of the annoying vibration created by its propeller in high pitch . With an instructor on board , each cadet was put through the second stage of his primary training , which included learning to fly " blind , " entirely by instruments . <h> Action Frivolous and Serious <p> Some cadets and even instructors engaged in what was known as " hedgehopping " or " flat-hatting " flying dangerously low to the ground despite strict regulations forbidding the practice . Former cadet Willie Moeller later admitted : " We used to run a lot of beef cattle down on the King Ranch . Chase them around . But they told us not to do that . Some got kicked out . If you got caught you were out , and if you did n't  , well , you had a good time .

Not even the Marine guards knew what was taking place inside the compound . Cadets assigned to the station were prohibited from taking written material out of the classroom and warned that using the word " radar " outside the facility was a court-martial offense . When Colliers published a revealing article on radar in its 22 May 1943 issue , the author candidly pointed out that it was then being " widely used " by the Axis powers as well as the British and Americans . 11 After a U-boat was spotted near the Aransas Pass , Texas , ship channel on 29 January 1942 , precautionary alerts were routinely issued at the stations and cadets assigned scouting missions over the Gulf . <p> By 1943 , the Navy had lowered the age limit for cadets and begun accepting qualified high school graduates . After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover , Massachusetts , George Herbert Walker Bush went through flight training and received his wings at Corpus Christi in 1943 when only 18 .

The first two yearbooks feature individual photos of each graduating cadet , but as ever more students moved through the training , those for 1943 and 1944 picture row upon row of the new pilots in their respective training squadrons . By June 1944 , 3,000 officers and 7,000 cadets were at the station , with thousands more enlisted men , WAVES , and civilian workers there . Graduations took place twice a week and were kept brief and simple . For many cadets , marriages occurred immediately thereafter at the stations chapel , and local hotels were always booked solid . <h> Names and Notoriety <p> Some top-ranking graduates were " plowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This did not go over well with newly commissioned Ensign Wayne Lundquist : " I was pretty mad because I was very dedicated and very patriotic .

In a ceremony at Corpus Christi , Rear Admiral Alfred Montgomery awarded instructor Lieutenant Bob Kirmse the Distinguished Flying Cross for " heroism and extraordinary achievement as patrol commander during enemy bombings of Dutch Harbor Alaska , and thereafter . " 14 <p> Training was rigorous . A full-page photograph in Life magazine depicting cadets scrambling up a 35-foot cargo net illustrated the importance of their physical training , a program developed by the Navys athletic director , former boxing champion Lieutenant Commander Gene Tunney. 15 President Roosevelt , accompanied by his wife , Eleanor , and Undersecretary of State Sumner Welles , visited the station on 21 April 1943 to meet with Mexican President Manuel Avila Camacho in a demonstration of solidarity . Admiral Chester W. Nimitz also stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit . The Navy sent renowned painter Vernon Howe Bailey to produce an artists impression of the University of the Air . <p> Throughout the war , NAS Corpus Christi became something of a mecca for celebrities ; some came to receive flight training and others to entertain . Hollywood stars Tyrone Power and Charles " Buddy " Rogers ( married to actress Mary Pickford ) were already commissioned officers when they arrived at the base for aviator training . Baseball notables Ted Williams , Warren Spahn , Johnny Sain , and Sam Chapmanall naval aviatorsperformed exhibition games at the station . Football great Ed Frutig earned his wings there while playing for the Corpus Christi Flyers and being named to the 1942 All-Navy All-American football team . <p> Among the entertainers and war bond fund-raisers who visited NAS Corpus Christi were Carole Lombard , Ginger Rogers , Rita Hayworth , Katharine Hepburn , Bob Hope and his troupe , Frank Sinatra , Louis Armstrong , and Kay Kyser .

Although praised by Hammerstein as " fresh and original , " the musical never made it to Broadway . 16 <p> Cadets who later achieved distinction included not only George H. W. Bush , but also future astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn . Among the 1944 graduates was later radio and TV game-show host Bob Barker . John Tower , who became a Republican U.S. senator from Texas , washed out of the training program and became , as he put it , a " deck ape " on board an amphibious gunboat in the Pacific . 17 " Bilgers " such as Tower were usually sent to Naval Station Great Lakes , Illinois , as ordinary seamen , but also had the option of enlisting in the Army Air Forces , whose requirements at that time were not as stringent as the Navys . <h> The Down Side <p> To ground personnel , there was no more chilling sound than that of the crash alarm buzzer . Every Slipstream yearbook includes a memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year . With as many as 300 planes in the air at the same time and no radios in the primary trainers , the likelihood of accidents was extremely high . Guadalupe Valdez , a former aircraft mechanic in Assembly and Repair at Kingsville , recalled " about five or six airplanes flying together in formation , and one of them got out of the formation and hit another one , and finally about five or six planes were just dropping down , like rain . " 18 After a student pilot from South America was killed because of his inability to understand his instructors order to bail out , WAVES were assigned as English instructors to the Latin American trainees . <p> During June and July 1943 , Lyndon Johnson was a member of a House subcommittee investigating conditions at Navy-connected sites in Texas and Oklahoma . It reported that during the previous 12 months , 551 aircraft accidents at Corpus Christi had resulted in the deaths of 91 cadets and instructors . Only two of the accidents were attributed to mechanical or structural failures ; all others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from stalls or spins caused by fliers losing control of their aircraft . 19 Main Station had a designated crash boat , the Mary Ann , which was used when planes plunged into the Gulf of Mexico and Corpus Christi and Oso Bays . <p> While the Army Air Forces had the renowned Tuskegee Airmen , there were no African-American naval aviators during World War II . Most of the black sailors at Corpus Christi served as mess stewards , although some were assigned to yardcraft duties and a small number to a gunnery division . Some of the Mexican-Americans employed as civilian workers experienced discrimination as well . Guadalupe Valdez was employed in the sheet-metal department as a mechanic earning $1.01 an hour . Fifty years after the war , he felt familiar enough with the various aircraft on which he had worked to offer a challenge : " Give me a set of blueprints and I can build you an aircraft . " 20 <h> The POWs <p> In August 1945 , a detention camp for German prisoners of war was established at Main Station . The Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Houston in San Antonio , but only about 300 were sent . The prisoners were put to work doing grounds maintenance , painting , planting trees , performing kitchen duties , working as pin boys at the stations bowling alley , and clearing brush for a golf course . <p> Hein Bosowitz , who , as a diversion , skinned the numerous rattlesnakes discovered while working , considered the months he spent as a prisoner in Corpus Christi to have been a happy period in his life . He said he learned the true meaning of freedom by observing Americans and the lenient treatment he and the other prisoners received from them . 21 On 16 March 1946 , the camp was dismantled and the prisoners sent to England to work as agricultural laborers until their repatriation . <p> With the end of World War II , Main Station downsized its training of naval aviators , and all the auxiliary fields were closed except Cabaniss . The Overhaul and Repair Department ( previously Assembly and Repair ) closed in 1959 but reopened in 1961 and became a major facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Beeville was also reopened but later permanently closed . It is currently the site of an industrial and airport complex . From 1949 until 1955 , Naval Air Station Corpus Christi was headquarters for the Navys precision flying team , the Blue Angels . Neil Armstrong , the first person to set foot on the moon , received his flight training at Corpus Christi , as did future Arizona Senator John McCain , who narrowly escaped death or serious injury when he crashed his training plane into Corpus Christi Bay . <p> NAS Corpus Christi is currently headquarters of the Chief of Naval Air Training as well as the location of an Army depot , Coast Guard air station , naval aviation forecast detachment , and surveillance support center . The former auxiliary field at Kingsville now operates as Naval Air Station Kingsville , training tactical jet pilots . The retired World War II and training aircraft carrier Lexington ( CVT-16 ) , a permanent museum at Corpus Christis North Beach , serves as a fitting reminder of the men and women who contributed so much to achieving the final victory .

The conflict 's most notable battleship was the USS Oregon ( BB-3 ) , which was on the West Coast when the war started . To get to the action , she had to steam from San Francisco , around South America 's Cape Horn , and on to Florida before heading to Cuba . The inconvenience of the voyage demonstrated the need for the construction of the Panama Canal in succeeding years . <p> The key naval engagement in the conflict was the Battle of Santiago , off the south coast of Cuba , on 3 July 1898 , and the participating U.S. battleships were the Indiana ( BB-1 ) , Iowa ( BB-4 ) , Oregon , and Texas ( a second-class battleship ) . They chased and fired on a succession of Spanish cruisers , eventually disabling them and driving them to shore . Midshipman Daniel Mannix had a battle station in the conning tower of the Indiana that gave him a great spot to observe the action . He watched as Sailors took off their hats , neckerchiefs , jumpers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To him the bare-chested gun crews resembled Roman gladiators . <p> Mannix also saw some of the misadventures that occur in the heat of combat . He had the job of relaying information from a shipmate named McDowell , who was operating a range finder . At one point a Spanish projectile sent up a spout of water near the Indiana . Soon afterward Mannix saw that McDowell had bright red holes on both sides of one calf . With the battle in progress , McDowell had been so excited that he dropped his pistol , which fell to the deck , went off , and shot him through the lower leg . <p> A different kind of mishap befell another Indiana midshipman . A Spanish mortar shell hit his room and destroyed most of his uniforms , leaving him with only one pair of trousers , which were worn through in the seat . When the victorious fleet later hosted visitors in New York City , the midshipman found it necessary to be seated or else stand against a bulkhead if ladies were present . So go the fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stage <p> In 1901 Theodore Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency and began pursuing an aggressive naval policy that concentrated on building up the U.S. Fleet 's battleships . He also called for a palpable demonstration of his nation 's naval power . In late 1907 he dispatched a group of 16 battleships , dubbed the " Great White Fleet , " on a trip around the world that would last until just before he left office in 1909 . Critics jumped on it as a jingoistic venture , but the voyage had the benefit of giving the fleet seagoing experience at long distances , and it spoke of America 's will to be a world power . <p> One of the ships on the cruise was the USS Kearsarge ( BB-5 ) , and her crew included Apprentice Harry Morris . He had enlisted in the Navy in 1903 , soon after he turned 14 . Morris had an amazing career on active duty ; he did not retire until 1958 , after more than a half-century of service . During the course of the voyage he acquired a sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went around the bottom of South America , then to California , Hawaii , New Zealand , Australia , the Philippines , China , Japan , the Indian Ocean , the Mediterranean , and back to Norfolk . <p> In Australia the American Navy men found themselves quite popular with the local lasses , who seemed to prefer them to the Aussie men with whom they were more familiar . Hundreds of relationships blossomed in short order . Given such diversions , the visiting Sailors found it difficult to return to their ships on time . In fact , the Kansas ( BB-21 ) stayed behind to round up latecomers after the rest of the fleet had sailed off to its next destination . Even that was n't sufficient to bring in everybody ; more than 100 of the Americans deserted and stayed behind with their newfound companions . They had indeed found pleasure in the traditional recruiting pledge , " Join the Navy and see the world . " <p> In the years that followed , the battleship force continued to modernize as newer and bigger ships joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War I in 1914 , the United States stayed on the sidelines for a few years before joining the conflict in April 1917 . The U.S. ships that had the biggest part of the action were the troop transports that ferried Soldiers and Marines to the war zone and the antisubmarine vessels that coped with Germany 's U-boats . In late 1917 the United States finally sent over a division of older battleships to support Britain 's Grand Fleet . The newer ones , which burned oil , were kept back on the East Coast as training ships because the supply of coal in the British Isles was more plentiful than oil . <p> As it happened , even though the U-boats remained active , the German surface fleet did n't venture out for battle after engaging the British in the huge Battle of Jutland in 1916 . The American battleships were on hand and available but not needed . Captain Edward L. Beach was commanding officer of the U.S. flagship New York ( BB-34 ) when hostilities ended in November 1918 . On 21 November , ten days after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships steamed to the Firth of Forth in Scotland to surrender . Captain Beach observed that the peaceful outcome was a letdown for the officers of Britain 's Royal Navy , who had hoped for a victory at sea . As he put it , " This was not the way they had hoped to destroy the German High Seas Fleet . " <h> The Dirty Side of Sailor Life <p> Even after the war ended , most of the U.S. battleships still had coal-fired boilers , and many of them remained in the fleet for a number of years . Coaling a ship was tedious and physically demanding . The battleship either moored next to a coaling pier or had a collier or barge alongside . Winches then dumped coal on the decks of the ships . Just about everybody participated in the process of shoveling the coal down chutes and into the storage bunkers below . Coal dust filled the air and coated the bodies of the sailors . <p> Midshipman Fred Edwards , who made a cruise on board the Michigan ( BB-27 ) around 1920 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went into the head that he was unrecognizable in the mirror . Even showering did n't completely solve the problem . In the mid-1920s , Midshipman Jimmy Thach was at a dance ashore not long after helping move the coal . The exertion of dancing led him to sweat , and coal dust began bleeding down from his eyebrows . It gave him the effect of wearing mascaraperhaps not the best way to make a favorable impression on a date . <p> Once the coal was on board , there was an art to seeing that it was used properly in firing the boilers that made steam to turn a battleship 's engines . Sailors piled up the coal on the floor plates and used a certain technique to spread a pattern of lumps evenly across the roaring fire . The sweating sailors used slice bars to break up the clinkers that developed from the burned coal . In the early 1920s , Fireman Charles Herget reported to the Delaware ( BB-28 ) after receiving training ashore . He was among those who transferred coal from the bunkers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , he decided , " hell ca n't be any worse than this . " <p> It was n't always so bad , though , especially when his ship was steaming at a relatively slow speed and the demand for coal was reduced . On those occasions he and his shipmates put together night rations . They got meat , onions , and potatoes from galley stores and cooked their own stew by thrusting a coal scoop full of ingredients into a boiler firebox until it was ready . <h> A Good Job During Tough Times <p> The Navy was able to skim the cream of the crop in recruiting and retaining quality enlisted men during the Depression years of the 1930s . Ships provided steady employment , which often was not available in the civilian economy . Many of those enlisted men became officers during World War II . One was Radioman Al Pelletier , who was in the communications gang of the fleet flagship Pennsylvania ( BB-38 ) . He was on board in 1933 when the ship hosted the change of command as Admiral David Sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleet 's battleships journeyed to the East Coast for review by President Franklin D. Roosevelt outside New York City . Pelletier and his shipmates were then unleashed for liberty in the city , which he termed " a sailor 's dream . " Included was a trip to Yankee Stadium to see Babe Ruth playquite a contrast to the plight of those in bread lines . <p> Another for whom the Navy provided salvation was Doug Merritt , who rode many a freight train in search of work during the 1930s . He enlisted as an apprentice seaman in 1940 as a step toward earning an officer 's commission . That autumn he rode the Arkansas ( BB-33 ) , which had been commissioned in 1912 and was the oldest battleship in the fleet , during a training cruise to Panama and Cuba . His berthing compartment was a casemate for one of the ship 's 5-inch broadside guns . He abandoned attempts at sleeping in a hammock and settled for a berth on the steel deck instead . He also learned how to polish bright work and scrub a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive head facilities on board , and that loud-mouthed boatswain 's mates meant what they said . One day each week he could count on breakfast being baked beans , cornbread , and coffee . <p> Still another lesson came in observing civilization beyond the shores of his native land . In Panama he saw poverty even worse than he had experienced in his hobo days . It was a formative experience for the 20-year-old Merritt . He went from the Arkansas to midshipman school , became an officer , and served with distinction as a submariner in World War II . <h> Under Fire at Pearl Harbor <p> Battleships were the main targets for the Japanese on the day that the war started for the United States . The objective of their 7 December 1941 Pearl Harbor attack was to knock the big ships there out of commission . On board the Arizona ( BB-39 ) , 1,177 men perished , about 80 percent of the crew . Machinist 's Mate Ardenne " Bill " Woodward was 20 years old at the time and recently married . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1942 when his enlistment expired . In the summer and fall of 1941 he wrote a series of letters to his wife , Virginia . Their daughter , Karen , was born in July of that year , shortly after the Arizona left California for the last time . In the letters he expressed feelings of longing , a desire to be with his wife and child . He never saw his daughter because he was at his battle station when the Arizona exploded that December morning . <p> A shipmate of his was Gunner 's Mate Jack McCarron , who was at his post on one of the ship 's 5-inch antiaircraft guns soon after Japanese planes appeared overhead . Just as he was about to load a projectile into the gun , the explosion that engulfed the ship blew him overboard and into the harbor , where he drifted in and out of consciousness . The crew of a motor launch rescued him and took him to Ford Island . He regained consciousness about three days later and discovered he had been badly burned and his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , he was horrified by his appearance and wrote to his recent bride , Roberta , that she should forget about him because he was no longer the man she had married . Fortunately , she was not that easily dismissed , and the couple enjoyed more than 60 years of marriage together . <p> For Ensign Paul Backus of the Oklahoma ( BB-37 ) , Honolulu had proved to be a bachelor 's paradise . There were plenty of places to take dates , particularly the schoolteachers who came out from the mainland on board cruise ships . As he remembered years afterward : " The dance floor of the Royal Hawaiian . . . was hard to beat . . . . There , with Diamond Head in the background and the breaking surf luminous in the moonlight , all resistance was said to dissolve . " But that halcyon way of life abruptly came to an end with the arrival of the Japanese aircraft . On that fateful Sunday morning Backus was on board the Oklahoma as she took a bevy of torpedoes , listed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , Backus slid down the side of the ship and into the water . After his rescue , he moved on to other duty and a full career in the Navy . <p> More than 30 years after his ship sank , Backus returned to Oahu and visited the Punch Bowl Memorial Cemetery . As he toured the grave markers , he found the names of many of his shipmates , some of whom he had known well . During his walk among the graves he plaintively asked himself a question about those lost shipmates : " Why them and not me ? " <h> " Battlewagons ' " Role during World War II <p> Battleships performed a variety of missions in World War II , most notably providing antiaircraft protection in fast-carrier task groups and bombarding enemy-held beaches in connection with amphibious landings . One of the rare exceptionsin which battleships served in their intended mission of trading heavy gunfire with enemy combatantscame in mid-November 1942 during the naval Battle of Guadalcanal . U.S. Marines had captured the island 's airfield , and the Japanese relentlessly tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tokyo Express " missions by Japanese warships to reinforce their troops on the island and bombard American positions . On the night of 14-15 November , Rear Admiral Willis A. Lee Jr . commanded a task force built around the Washington ( BB-56 ) and South Dakota ( BB-57 ) as it fought a close-range gunnery duel with Japanese surface combatants . <p> Lieutenant Al Church was on the flag bridge of the Washington when the battleship 's big 16-inch guns began to light up the night sky . The concussion knocked the admiral 's glasses to the deck , so he and Church groped around for them as the battle continued . An officer on board a nearby American destroyer watched in awe as the 16-inch projectiles emerged from gun barrels , their tails glowing cherry red ; were hidden for a time by low clouds ; and then reemerged to conclude their parabolic flights by striking Japanese warships . That battle , which resulted in the sinking of the battleship Kirishima , turned the tide in the campaign for possession of Guadalcanal . <p> One other such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strait , in the Philippines . This was the closest the U.S. and Japanese navies came to fulfilling the plans for a big-ship encounter they had envisioned for many years before World War II . Six U.S. battleships formed a column that capped the T of Japanese ships steaming to engage them . Three of the American ships , the Tennessee ( BB-43 ) , California ( BB-44 ) , and West Virginia ( BB-48 ) , had been rebuilt after being badly damaged at Pearl Harbor . They had modern fire-control systems that put their 14- and 16-inch projectiles on target with great effectiveness . Lieutenant Bob Bamrucker , on board the West Virginia , watched as shells from his ship hit the Japanese battleship Yamashiro , which sank during the fight . On board the Pennsylvania during that engagement was Ensign Ed Snyder . More than 24 years later he took command of the New Jersey ( BB-62 ) when she was preparing to go to Vietnam . <p> While most of the battleship action during the war was in the Pacific , a few U.S. battleships operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( BB-36 ) , and Texas ( BB-35 ) bombarded shore positions during the 6 June 1944 D-Day landings in Normandy , France . One of the crewmen on board the Arkansas was Corporal Irvin Airey , a member of the ship 's Marine detachment . Gunfire from German batteries ashore sent shrapnel onto the battleship 's deck . Airey watched with satisfaction as the Arkansas blasted back with her 12-inch guns . Years later he remembered that he was excited rather than scared that day , but he did see lines of worry on the faces of some of the sergeants who had families back home . <p> The ship next supported the Allied invasion of southern France in August 1944 before heading back to the States en route to the Pacific . While Airey was home on leave in Baltimore , two Army MPs stopped him and demanded to see his leave papers . They also wanted to know why he had a campaign ribbon from Europe . When he told them he had been in D-Day , their reaction was , " The hell you were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific , but Airey was a battleship man on the other side of the world . <p> World War II came to a ceremonial end on the deck of the Missouri ( BB-63 ) . Even though she was a relative newcomer to the war , the ship got the honor of hosting the 2 September 1945 surrender because she was named for the home state of President Harry S. Truman . Gunner 's Mate Walt Yucka was among the hundreds of Missouri crewmen who watched the surrender ceremony in awe . Years later , when his memory of the event once again rekindled the emotions he felt , he said : " That was the greatest thrill of my life . The war was over . " Millions of Americans had survived and would be going home . Another Missouri man , Seaman Joe Vella , had longed for his home in Connecticut when the ship was overseas . But when it did come time for him to depart , he did so wistfully . After many months on board , building bonds with his shipmates , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa Class Weathers the Post-War Years <p> Once the hostilities ceased , the Navylike the rest of the U.S. armed forcesdemobilized rapidly to " bring the boys home . " The U.S. Navy ended the war with 23 battleships in commission . By 1949 only one remainedthe Missouri and that was because President Truman decreed that she stay in service . By then her role had essentially been turned into that of a training ship . <p> The following year , 1950 , the Korean War broke out , and the Missouri was sent overseas as a fully combatant ship . Soon the Navy began breaking out her sister shipsclass namesake Iowa ( BB-61 ) , Wisconsin ( BB-64 ) , and New Jersey from the mothball fleet to send them to Korea as well . The first to go was the New Jersey . Many of her new crew members were World War II veterans who had left active duty and gone into the Naval Reserve . Now they were uprooted from their civilian careers and family lives . One of those was Bob Storm , a gunner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the battleship 's 16-inch gun turrets . He took a pay cut to return to naval service . <p> One of his shipmates during the Korean War was Seaman Charles Jacobus . Battleship life was a special pleasure for him . The ship 's commanding officer , Captain David Tyree , cared for the crew and demonstrated it by his actions . One night Jacobus carried a fresh pot of coffee while Tyree carried cups . The skipper gave a cupful to each member of the watch section as a tangible way of demonstrating his appreciation for the Sailors ' work . <p> On nights when he was n't on watch , Jacobus lay in his bunk as the ship 's bugler blew the tattoo call five minutes before lights out , and then taps itself . He enjoyed that time as a period of quiet satisfaction to reflect on the events of the day on board ship . Years later , after he had left active duty , Jacobus created a special battleship room in his home in New Jersey . It was decorated with pictures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done as a boatswain 's mate and featured a special man-size horizontal niche recessed into one wall . When he wanted to get into a true battleship mood , he 'd climb into the opening and imagine himself back in his bunk on board the New Jersey . <p> Eventually , all four of the Iowa -class battleships took part in the Korean War . One role was to provide antiaircraft protection , but the air threats to the fleet were scant during that period , so they spent most of their time in shore bombardment and fire support of United Nations troops . The Missouri performed yeoman service with her bombardment at the port of Hungnam during a desperate rear-guard evacuation in December 1950 after U.S. Marines had retreated from the Chosin Reservoir . The ships also served in rotation as flagship for commander Seventh Fleet . <h> From Big to Enormous : Evolution of the U.S. Battleship <p> Following the lead of other maritime nations that had been designing and building battleships , the U.S. Navy on 20 November 1895 commissioned its first legitimate seagoing battleship , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had commissioned the Texas and Maine , which were known as second-class battleships but were essentially armored cruisers . They became second-class citizens within a few months when the Indiana arrived . The latter was 350 feet long , displaced 10,288 tons , and had a mixed bag of weaponry that included four 13-inch guns , eight 8-inch guns , four 6-inch guns , and some still-smaller guns . It was if a cook had thrown in a pinch of this and a dash of that to make up the recipe . <p> The ship-designing cooks kept to that same general formula for the next few years , and the battleships continued to be named for statesexcept one . The USS Kearsarge ( BB-5 ) , commissioned in 1900 , honored the name of a wooden-hulled Union screw sloop that sank the Confederate raider Alabama off Cherbourg , France , in 1864 . <p> In 1906 , the Royal Navy revolutionized battleship design with HMS Dreadnought , which pioneered the all-big-gun format that became standard from then on . Two comparable U.S. battleships , the South Carolina ( BB-26 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing boards earlier but were not completed until 1910 . The main battery of each ship included eight 12-inch guns , and the secondary battery comprised 22 3-inchers . These two and all subsequent battleships were known generically as " dreadnoughts " because of their British predecessor . <p> A next step up came with the New York ( BB-34 ) and Texas ( BB-35 ) , which were commissioned in 1914 , on the eve of World War I. They mounted main batteries of twin 14-inch guns . The Nevada ( BB-36 ) class , which entered service in 1916 , was the first built with boilers fueled by oil rather than coal . That same year brought the Pennsylvania ( BB-38 ) and Arizona ( BB-39 ) , each with four turrets of three 14-inch guns . In the hype of their day , they were known as " super dreadnoughts . " In the next few years the trend line continued toward bigger ships with the same basic armament package . Then came the jump to 16-inch guns with the commissioning of the Maryland ( BB-46 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , interrupted by the Washington Naval Conference of 1921-22 . The world 's naval powers had been depleted financially by the recently completed global war and sought a way to stop the spending . Battleships represented the biggest investments in a nation 's arsenal and became prime targets . In the naval treaty of 1922 , the various nations agreed to a moratorium on battleship construction and a limitation on their size . Work was already in progress for the six ships of the South Dakota ( BB-49 ) class . Each of these behemoths was to displace more than 40,000 tons , stretch nearly 700 feet long , and mount 12 16-inch guns . But the treatydeadly as a swarm of enemy projectileskilled all of them , and they were canceled while under construction . <p> In the mid-1930s , with the world situation heating up and Japan no longer willing to be bound by the treaty restrictions , the naval powers once again resumed battleship building . In the case of the U.S. Navy , this meant the inauguration of a new type : the fast battleship-capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard up to then . And the gunnery format became nine 16-inch and 20 5-inch guns for each ship . The North Carolina ( BB-55 ) class hit the fleet in 1941 , and the South Dakota ( BB-57 ) class in 1942 . <p> The final U.S. battleships built were the four members of the Iowa ( BB-61 ) class , commissioned in 1943-44 . These ships have been widely admired for decades as the acme in their type . They had the same gun battery as their fast-battleship predecessors but added extra shaft horsepower and length to provide a top speed of 33 knots . They came in at a whopping 887 feet , and when they were new , each ship had more than 120 antiaircraft guns . That armament , along with their speed , made them ideal for protecting aircraft carrier task groups of World War II , but the battleships had very little opportunity to use their 16-inch guns for their intended purposefiring at enemy warships . <p> For those who dabble in fantasy war games , there are wistful thoughts of what might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) class . Five ships were planned , and they were to be the ultimate superlatives in U.S. battleships : approximately 70,000 tons at full load ( more than six times that of the 1895 Indiana ) , 921 feet long , and armed with 12 16-inch guns-two triple turrets forward and two aft . By 1943 , the experience of combat in World War II dictated that the nation 's shipbuilding resources were more needed elsewhere . The United States already had ten fast battleships either in service or nearing completion . The Montana class never got beyond the drawing boards and the imaginations of those who sought to build really huge battleships for the Navy . <p> The battleship era in the U.S. Navy began when the keel for the Indiana was laid on 7 May 1891 . It officially ended just over 100 years later , on 31 March 1992 , with the decommissioning of the Missouri ( BB-63 ) . The memories remain . <p> Paul Stillwell <p> For a few years after the war ended in 1953 , the four ships of the class remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Naval Reservists . Typically , they made summer cruises to European ports , an experience that was broadening for both the midshipmen and members of the ships ' crews . One notable mishap during the period came on 6 May 1956 , when the Wisconsin was operating with a group of ships off the coast of Virginia . She collided with the destroyer Eaton ( DD-510 ) , and the result was heavy damage to the bow of the battleship , which looked as if it had a big bite taken out of it . The remedy was akin to an organ transplant . The bow from the never-completed sister ship Kentucky ( BB-66 ) was grafted onto the front of the Wisconsin and remains there to this day . The Wisconsin is now a tourist attraction at Nauticus , the National Maritime Center , in Norfolk , Virginia . <p> When the Wisconsin was decommissioned and put into mothballs in early 1958 , the U.S. Navy was without any active battleships for the first time since 1895 . With missile-firing ships joining the fleet in increasing numbers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam War made its imprint on the armed services and the nation as a whole . As a way to cut down on the number of airplanes being shot down over North Vietnam , the Defense Department directed the reactivation of the New Jersey . Unlike airplanes , her 16-inch projectilesonce they were on their way toward targets more than 20 miles distantcould not be shot down . <p> The greatest satisfaction for her crew came in providing fire support to American troops ashore . Often the big guns fired at long range , and the men on board learned of the results of their shooting only from reports from airborne spotters . Occasionally , though , the ship had short-range direct-fire missions . One mission in particular impressed Ensign Scott Cheyne . He watched the trajectory of the projectiles during their entire path from the guns to an enemy hillside and saw the shock waves as the shells exploded and then rippled through surrounding trees . Several more seconds elapsed , because light travels faster than sound , and then he heard the noises made by the projectiles when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey made only one deployment to Vietnam . The American public had turned against the overseas conflict , and Congress responded by cutting its monetary support . The battleship returned to the mothball fleet in December 1969 . <h> Final Call-Up <p> A dozen years later , the process was reversed as the Reagan administration dramatically increased defense expenditures . Included in the program was reactivation , one at a time , of the four Iowa -class ships . <p> In May 1986 the Navy recommissioned the " Mighty Mo " in a gala ceremony in San Francisco . During his speech at the event , Captain Lee Kaiss said , " On October 27 , 1945 , when President Harry S. Truman stepped aboard USS Missouri , he said , ' This is the happiest day of my life . ' Ladies and gentleman , I know exactly how he felt . " <p> That night , in a dinner in San Francisco 's city hall , President Truman 's daughter , Margaret Truman Daniel , addressed the crew . She had a special tie to the warship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1944 . In concluding , she said : " Captain Kaiss and the men of the Missouri , there 's one other thing I want to say to you . Please take care of my baby . " The brash battleship Sailors melted on the spot and gave her a standing ovation . <p> The firepower the battleships added to the fleet was interrupted by a controversial event . On 19 April 1989 , while the Iowa was involved in a gunnery exercise in the Caribbean , powder charges in her number two turret exploded . The disaster killed 47 crew members . The four battleships were prohibited for a time from shooting their 16-inch guns until the cause could be found . The initial investigation report determined that an Iowa gunner 's mate deliberately caused the explosion . Subsequent tests ascertained that the explosion could have been the result of mechanical problems involving the powder bags and the mechanism that rammed them into the breech of the gun . Once corrective measures were taken , the firing ban was lifted . <p> All four ships of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided missile and gunfire support during the 1991 Gulf War . The battle was not completely one-sided . One night the Iraqis fired a Silkworm missile toward the Missouri . The skipper , Lee Kaiss , ordered his men to hit the deck . Ship 's Serviceman Gregory Green was apprehensive , and thoughts jumbled in his mind . He thought about the possibility of the Missouri being hit , having to abandon ship , being captured , and wondering what the Iraqis might feed prisoners of war . All the fears proved groundless as the British destroyer Gloucester shot down the Silkworm before it could do any harm . Soon the war was over , and the battleships headed back to the States and the end of their active service lives . <p> In early December 1991 , just a few months before she would be decommissioned for the last time , the Missouri made a final voyage . She steamed to Pearl Harbor to take part in the observances of the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack . On board was Yeoman John Lewis , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again for old times ' sake .

We must determine how best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our core capabilities , increases the efficiency with which we build and operate the Fleet , and provides for the future proper sizing of the Fleets surface force . <h> The Challenges <p> The current and pending budget reductions are imposed on a surface force that was not built for or during our recent land conflicts . Unlike the post-Cold War drawdown , the current and projected security environment is not more peaceful ; rather , the rise of regional powers wielding anti-access/area denial ( A2/AD ) capabilities presents a direct challenge to the U.S. Navy and all nations with a vested interest in the freedom of the maritime commons . <p> The fiscal state of our nation imposes unique and difficult force planning challenges , as sequestration forces non-prioritized cuts in the defense budget and continuing resolutions limit flexibility in budget allocation . Added to these challenges is the nations desire to maintain a balanced military force , which requires strong , capable land , sea , and air forces . <p> The cost of ships , manpower , sensors , weapons , and combat readiness continues to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces rises , the resources available for training , acquisition , and modernization are increasingly constrained . The future recapitalization of the nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarine force looms as an additional resource constraint , specifically on our shipbuilding budget . Yet the demand for surface forces is unlikely to decreaseit more than likely will increase . <p> The redeployment of land forces from the Middle East will be mostly complete next year , and U.S. national interests in that region are unlikely to go untended , a responsibility that will fall largely to the Navy . America is also increasingly turning its attention to the Far East , and as a result of the January 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance the Navy will employ 60 percent of its forces in the Pacific . The Presidents September 2009 decision to implement the phased adaptive approach ( PAA ) to the ballistic-missile defense ( BMD ) of Europe creates a sustained requirement for BMD equipped surface combatants in the Mediterranean . <p> Due to the nature of the conflicts since the end of the Cold War , the Navy , and the surface fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a result , surface force sea control programs , skills , and capabilities have diminished and , in some cases , were eliminated . As we rebalance to the Pacific , we must properly prioritize procurement and training to firmly establish our preeminence in war-at-sea capabilities , specifically so we can persistently execute these missions in any maritime environment where our access might be challenged . It will be increasingly difficult , however , to operate and maintain the current surface force and its associated manpower while procuring the future force and its associated weapons and sensors for the war at sea . <h> Near-Term ( 010 years ) <p> In developing the vision for the surface force , I am guided by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenerts three tenets : Warfighting First , Operate Forward , and Be Ready . These provide clear and unmistakable direction for my programming priorities . Sequestration and the prospect of continuing resolutions make that prioritization more difficult and raise the prospect of driving the surface force out of balance . That balance depends on the investments we make each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ready surge capacity , shipbuilding , modernization of existing platforms , training , and , finally , research and development . <p> Given the CNOs priorities , the most immediate impact of decreasing resources will be on the readiness of non-deployed forces . We will accept additional risk in available surge capacity to ensure the combat readiness of forward deployed and next-to-deploy forces . Ship modernization timelines could be impacted or de-scoped to free up resources to plan for the future , protecting investments in both shipbuilding and research and development . All of this must be done with a weather eye to the ship-repair industrial base , the capacity of which is critical to maintaining Fleet readiness and mitigating surge risk should a crisis erupt . <p> That said , the near-term surface fleet will remain the worlds most sophisticated , globally distributed , powerful , and combat-ready force . No other nation possesses the warfighting capability and capacity of our Navy . Late last year , we launched the Zumwalt ( DDG-1000 ) , sending a signal to the world that a new level of surface-warfare capability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of these ships , their presence introduces a number of state-of-the-art capabilities including electric drive propulsion through the integrated power system ( IPS ) , the advanced gun system ( AGS ) firing long range land attack projectiles ( LRLAP ) , the peripheral vertical launching system , and the SPY-3 multi-function radar . The DDG-1000 program is quietly moving forward , delivering these capabilities within cost and on schedule . Obviously , when you cut a ship class back from 32 , to 13 , to 10 and then 3 hulls , the cost per hull will go up as research and **25;63;TOOLONG engineering costs are spread across only a few ships . Understanding that , I am proud of this program , and it has set the stage for an exciting era of ship construction and development for the future . <p> The most versatile and powerful surface combatantsthe DDG-51 Arleigh Burke sremain the workhorses of the Fleet . We will continue to field Flight IIA variants until 2021 , and the program remains an excellent example of how government and industry can work together to control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat ships ( LCS ) will join the Arleigh Burke s in ever increasing numbers . These fast , agile , focused-mission ships are optimized for operations in near-shore environments yet are fully capable of open-ocean tasking . Recent analysis of the antisubmarine warfare ( ASW ) module components has concluded that the LCS executing ASW will add substantial capability to the effort to locate and destroy adversary submarines in challenging water columns . Designed to defeat asymmetric , anti-access threats such as mines , quiet diesel-electric submarines , and fast surface craft , over half of the planned 52 ship-buy will be completed in the near-term . The LCS will be poised to affordably assume an appropriate portion of the forward presence and shaping responsibilities vital to the deterrence of potential adversaries and the assurance of friends and allies . <p> We deployed the LCS to Singapore and learned a lot . We are addressing some organizational and process challenges with this new manning , training , and deploying model . The Freedom ( LCS-1 ) had her share of maintenance and equipment issues , and we are addressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in other cases equipment changes . That said , she is still the first of her class and loaded with first in the Fleet systems . We pushed the envelope on purpose to deploy her earlier than planned , assuming risk in doing this , but the risk was absolutely worth it . As with the deployment of any new capability , there is a learning curve and we have made a huge jump on that curve in a very short period of time . <p> Important capabilities fielding in the near-term include the naval integrated fire control-counter air ( NIFC-CA ) , which provides engage on remote and **30;90;TOOLONG air defense capabilities ; the Aegis Baseline 9 , which will enable NIFC-CA ; and the Aegis advanced capability build ( ACB ) 16 , which will integrate advanced BMD capability , shipboard electronic warfare capability , the MH-60R helicopter , and the SPQ-9B radar . Further , the SM-6 missile combines the proven propulsion of the SM-2 family with an active seeker for enhanced endgame success , while the air and missile defense radar ( AMDR ) offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and anti-air warfare ( AAW ) threats . The SQQ-89A(V)15 ASW combat system is equipped with the multi-function towed array sonar , advanced active and passive processing , and modern displaysall on commercial off-the-shelf hardwareand the electromagnetic rail gun , a system with great promise across a number of critical mission areas . All these fieldings will add significantly to the Navys ability to dominate the maritime domain . <p> During this time , we will continue to invest in our people and the quality of their work , ensuring they are trained for the jobs we ask them to do . We have already restored Basic Division Officer Course ( BDOC ) and established the Weapons Tactic Instructor ( WTI ) program this summer . WTI is the cornerstone of our plan to improve tactical training , specifically in ASW , integrated air-and-missile defense ( IAMD ) , and anti-surface warfare ( ASUW ) the war at sea mission setat both individual and ship levels These efforts are strongly supported by the Surface and Expeditionary Warfare Training Committee ( SEWTC ) , a Navy-wide effort to make disciplined investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , positive effect on our manpower and training investment strategy . <p> The improved process starts with the activities of the Surface Training Systems Program Office ( PMS 339 ) , the center of gravity for existing and future Navy surface training systems . Our priority is to update our training systems in the school house so that sailors arrive at their ships proficient on their gear and ready to sail . Critical to this effort will be getting the mix of training methods right , with realistic immersive training using computer environments supplementing hands-on training and mentoring from fully qualified technicians . <p> Our recent conflicts and the increasingly complicated security environment have required operational excellence across a very diverse mission set , and this expansion into new missions has cost us some tactical proficiency in our traditional areas . The combined effects of the SEWTC , BDOC and WTI will reverse this proficiency gap . Surface Warfare is taking back the war at sea and making investments in improving our core competencies of ASW , IAMD , and ASUW . <h> Mid-Term ( 1020 Years ) <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Fleet , a modification of the proven , tested Arleigh Burke -class that extends and sustains the primacy of surface warfare in IAMD operations . Significant upgrades include substantial increases in available power and cooling to enable the S-Band AMDR and surface electronic warfare improvement program ( SEWIP ) Block III . SEWIP Block III will focus on electronic attack ( EA ) ( jamming ) capability improvements required for the AN/SLQ-32(V) system to keep pace with threats and will provide a common EA capability to all surface combatants . <p> In the mid-term we expect shipboard lasers will reach an operational maturity . Opportunities for insertion in the Flight III DDGs will present themselves , as well as in the ships that will join the future surface force in the 2030svessels that will be designed and built in this period . <p> The hypervelocity projectile ( HVP ) is also likely to be fielded . A next-generation , common , low drag , guided projectile , the HVP is capable of completing multiple missions for gun systems such as the Navy 5-inch , 155-mm , and railgun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and missile defense , and anti-surface warfare to name a few . The HVPs attributes , coupled with accurate guidance electronics , may provide game-changing , low-cost mission effectiveness against current and future threats . <p> Electronic warfare improvements , increased laser capabilities , more capable gun projectiles , and a return to Cold War-era electronic warfare concepts of operation will improve the currently unfavorable cost/exchange ratio between increasingly inexpensive and capable threat missiles and our very capableand expensiveinterceptors . We will work to decrease the cost per engagement , in some cases with less expensive hard kill systems , in others with active or passive electronic warfare measures . Ensuring our ability to remain within any contested battle space is critical to the success of any major maritime operation . <p> During this time frame we will complete the LCS building program , and those vessels will have assumed our nations surface mine warfare responsibilities in addition to a growing share of surface ASW and ASUW missions . Through forward stationing and rotational crewing ( three crews for two hulls ) ; the LCS will assume the lions share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimal . The ability of the LCS to efficiently perform a variety of presence and shaping missions will contribute to optimal employment of DDGs and improve the prospect of increasing these ships service lives . <h> The Future ( Beyond 20 Years ) <p> While two decades from now may seem like the distant future , decisions we make today will determine capability and capacity of the 2034 surface Navy . With this in mind , some assumptions about what that world will look like are in order . <p> The world will be more multi-polar than it is now , with the United States , China , Russia , India , Brazil , and the Eurozone all vying for resources and for economic , political , and sometimes , military power and influence . <p> The United States will maintain powerful naval forces forward , present , visible , and ready to protect and sustain Americas global interests in world of changing power dynamics . <p> The volume of ocean-borne trade will dramatically increase . <p> Absent conflict , the resources allocated to the Navy in constant dollars will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ships in the 2034 surface force is currently in service or in advanced design stages . <p> Thinking about the world in 2034 and steered by assumptions such as the ones above , several key attributes present themselves when envisioning the ships that must be acquired beginning in 2028 for delivery beginning in 2035 : flexibility , scalability , modularity , and commonality . <p> Flexibility . We can not afford to build ships that are retired because they have been outpaced by the threat ; rather , they will need to be retired because they have reached the end of their service life . Defined interfaces and modular designs will treat capability as a commodity , enabling continuous modernization to stay one step ahead of the threat . These " designed-in " features will dramatically lower the complexity of modernizing ships , reducing the time spent in overhauls , increasing operational availability , and reducing total ownership cost . <p> Scalability . Scalability is the quality of being able to increase or decrease capability through common hardware/software combinations . The most important example of this is the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array radar represents a significant performance and life cycle cost improvement over SPY-1 , we are designing-in scalability so that it can be fitted on future small combatants , big deck amphibs , and next generation carriersproviding commonality savings in logistics , maintenance , and training . <p> Modularity . Modularity is represented in todays surface force primarily by the mission modules associated with the LCS . In this case , modularity is achieved by building ships with the ability to accommodate mission packagesessentially integrated cargothat can be removed and replaced pier-side in a short period . A future version of modularity starts with a new way of building ships , a method in which common functional building blocks are arranged in different combinations to create platforms of differing capability mixes . One " class " of ship could have several variants , as determined by modules inserted during new construction . Within those modules , defined interfaces and rapidly reconfigurable spaces will enable developers to constantly respond to Fleet needs without intrusive and complex shipyard availabilities . <p> Commonality . We must begin to treat capabilities as commodities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the surface force wherever possible . We must break the link forever between the " combat system " and the " ship " so that we can achieve efficiencies of scale associated with the elimination of excessive variation in our ships , irrespective of the class . Where the submarine force or the naval air forces have already fielded capability we need or desire , we must integrate it wherever possible . We must strive to achieve commonality not simply in the things we buy and build , but also in the things we design . Design specifications , then , should be standardized wherever possible and re-used unless a substantial business case exists to the contrary . <p> We will define requirements for rapidly reconfigurable shipboard spaces during this period , enabling future surface ships to undergo more efficient and less costly modernization periods . The intrusive nature of current modernization efforts costs too much and takes too long to complete . The extensive cutting of bulkheads , the movement of major equipment bolted and welded to decks , overheads , and bulkheads , and the creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts , will be largely replaced by ships designed with moveable and reconfigurable spaces , planned and efficient paths for the movement of equipment , and strategically placed hull portals which enable equipment removal and insertion . Making the move to modularity will further allow us to maximize the service lives of our ships as we will be able to update the combat systems equipment to more easily and affordably keep pace with rapidly advancing technology . <h> Setting the Next Generation Up for Success <p> Change is never easy , and building our future surface force with the above attributes will require a good deal of cooperation among the Congress , the Navy , and industry in the years ahead . We simply can not continue to defend business as usual and hope to remain a powerful , globally arrayed Navy . Looking internally , we must more closely align the requirements generation and validation processes with existing and future acquisition processes to achieve program stability and design-lock early on , eliminating wherever possible increased , self-imposed cost and turbulence . Industry , too , must change certain behaviors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose from the changes sought and instead begin to determine how it will incorporate , improve , and profit from them . <p> Just as I was a department head 20 years ago , the Director of Surface Warfare in the year 2034 is a department head in todays Fleet . This officer shows up every morning while the sun has yet to rise , and likely goes home when it has already set , spending time each day doing his or her best to ensure the ship is as ready for combat as she can be . Decisions made 20 years ago , as well as those made last month , play into that effort . We owe that department head the benefit of good decision-making , long and short term . Most of the stakeholders in ensuring surface warfare dominance understand both the challenges we face and the range of options we have to overcome them . Now is the time to work together to ensure the powerful future of surface warfare . <p> Rear Admiral Rowden is the Director of Surface Warfare Division ( OPNAV N96 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft carriers in both the Atlantic and Pacific Fleets .

@@21175711 @1175711/ <p> A map of Chinas shifting definition of the so-called Nine-Dash Line . US State Dept . Image <p> The United Nations Permanent Court of Arbitration handed out a decision on Thursday that the Republic of the Philippines ' case against the People 's Republic of China regarding Law of the Seas violations can be heard . This long-awaited decision marks a turning point in the complex landscape of international legality as more maritime nations seek to establish boundaries on their oceanic and littoral territories . <p> The court now moves to hear the merits of the case , with a decision expected sometime in 2016 . A decision favorable to the Philippines could set the stage for that country 's legal standing on existing claims in the contested Spratly Islands , and further isolate China as the emerging maritime power seeks to consolidate its hold upon valuable resources in the South China Sea . <p> The Philippines filed their case in 2013 , following several years of persistent and repeated Chinese intrusions and violations into what is considered territorial waters . Aside from water-hosing fishermen , taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China also comprehensively expanded the Spratly Islands and features already under their control . The latest being the creation of a 10,000 foot long runway at Fiery Cross Reef that grants China the ability to control the airspace over the disputed territory . As the weakest military in the region , the Philippines could only resort to the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea , accusing China of multiple violations of UNCLOS provisions . <p> The majority of the Philippine claims against China specifically call out their seizure , reclamation and build-up of features ( i.e. , rocks and shoals ) does not entitle them to permanent presence and use of the Philippines EEZ or territorial waters . In addition , China has consistently used law enforcement entities ( i.e. , the China Maritime Coast Guard ) to effectively enforce foreign policy by reportedly arresting and abusing Filipino fishermen . There are also claims of environmental damage to specific areas in the Spratlys that China currently occupies . <p> The ruling was n't a slam dunk for the Philippines , however . The Permanent Court has also required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are not currently covered by the case moving forward . Notably among those is why China 's infamous Nine-Dash Line claim is unlawful , and how features such as Second Thomas Shoal and Mischief Reef fall within the Philippine 's EEZ . <p> While the Arbitration Court 's decision is welcomed as a victory for the rule of law , even a ruling in favor of the Philippines will not change the status quo . China has repeatedly and publicly rejected the authority of the Arbitration Court , stating that the Philippines had not yet exhausted bilateral negotiations . Notably , during the buildup to the hearing decision , China had also rebuffed calls to send representation to the court and chose instead to publish heavily detailed position papers outlining their perspective . For all practical purposes , China has well established outposts , some newly reinforced , and is not expected to vacate them regardless of the court 's ultimate decision on the merits of the Philippine 's case . <p> An undated photo of the amphibious BRP Sierra Madre the Philippines have used as an outpost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Philippines ? For starters , the practical approach is to start reinforcing outposts already established in the island group . The Aquino administration and the Department of Defense have been vacillating over this move even before the U.N . case was filed . It was only recently , thanks in no small part to extensive media coverage of poor conditions , that the Philippines had aggressively resupplied and reinforced the tiny Marine detachment at Second Thomas Shoal . There is a sense that the political leadership is hesitant to conduct any further reinforcement for fear of endangering a positive ruling for the Arbitration case . In reality , funding , a lack of logistical lift and in many cases proper receiving ports and shore-side facilities are preventing any practical upgrades of existing outposts . <p> Efforts should be made to come to a conclusion over the status of Scarborough Shoal . Out of all the Chinese claims , this particular location falls well within the traditional 200 nautical mile EEZ from the mainland of Luzon . Taking notice of the 2014 skirmish with Vietnam , it 's clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get its way . However , it 's also quick to de-escalate , and since the Philippines still enjoys a traditional and formalized defense treaty with the United States , there is political and operational breathing room to confront China using the same Operations Other Than War ( OOTW ) tactics by using non-military and civilian assets . <p> Finally , taking a cue from the United States , the Philippines and other claimants should establish their own Freedom of Navigation patrols in the region .

Greta had worked as a dental assistant at the Manhattan office for several months . While she hoped to someday design theater sets and pursue other vocations in the arts , work as a dental assistant bought her some independence and took her mind off a prolonged war . <p> When Greta arrived at the office on the morning of August 14 , she changed into her working uniform . If it were not for her place of employment , she could have been easily mistaken for a nurse . Her white dress , white stockings , white shoes , and white cap did not distinguish her from thousands of other caregivers in New York . <p> While Greta performed her dental assistant duties that Tuesday morning , many patients burst into the office short of breath and beaming . Excitedly , they informed the staff and patients that the war with Japan had ended . Most patients and workers believed them . Greta was n't so sure . She wanted to trust their reports , but the war had rained more than a fair share of misery upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay a celebratory mindset that could prove painfully premature . <p> During the later morning hours , patients continued to enter the dentists office with more optimistic news . While Greta tried to ignore the positive developments , the temptation to flow with the prevailing winds challenged her reserve . As the reports became more definitive and promising , Greta found herself listening , contemplating , and growing eager . <p> When the two dentists returned from their lunches after 1:00 pm , Greta quickly finished the business before her . Soon after , she grabbed her small hand purse with the colorful pattern , took off her white dental assistant cap ( as was customary before going out in public ) , and set out during her lunch break for Times Square . There the Times news zipper utilized lit and moving type to report the latest news . She wanted to know for herself if the claims that had been tossed about over the past several hours were misleading hearsay , or if , on this day , the reports would finally be true . <p> When Greta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold . While the celebration was subdued compared to what would follow later that day , Greta sensed a vibrant energy in the air . Suited businessmen , well-dressed women , and uniformed soldiers and sailors entered the pandemonium from all directions . Some ran with no determined direction . Others walked with purpose . Some remained stationary , as if waiting for something big to happen . Greta paid no one particular person much attention . <p> As she proceeded into the square she moved by several recognizable landmarks : the 42nd Street subway stairwell , a replica of the Statue of Liberty , and a large statue of Joe Rosenthals famous picture from a few months earlier . After walking a few paces beyond the 25-foot model of the Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima , Greta spun around and looked in the direction of the Times Building . She focused her sight just above the third-floor windows where the scrolling lighted letters spelled out the latest headlines . Greta read the racing and succinctly worded message quickly . Now she knew the truth . <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leave , Petty Officer First Class George Mendonsa paid no attention to the days newspaper headlines and worried little about his Japanese enemy . After almost two years in World War IIs Pacific theater , his mindset was that the war would unfold independent of his blessing or curse . On the morning of August 14 , 1945 , his thoughts focused primarily on Rita Petry , an attractive Long Island girl hed met a few weeks earlier in Rhode Island . <p> George woke up that Tuesday morning alone in a bedroom at the Petry familys Long Island home . After breakfast with Ritas family , he leafed through The New York Times looking for show times in New Yorks theaters . He and his new girlfriend decided to take in a matinee at Radio City Music Hall . They thought the 1:05 pm showing of A Bell for Adano would give them plenty of time to make it back to Long Island by early evening . George was scheduled to depart for San Francisco that night . In a few days he expected to board The Sullivans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles of World War II . He knew an invasion of the Japanese mainland was imminent . While he did not welcome the looming chain of events , he thought finishing off the Japanese in their homeland would be a fitting bookend to a war that had commenced almost four years earlier with the empires surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor . But all that was in the future . He still had one day left to enjoy in New York . <p> Preparing for that day , George wore a formal blue Navy uniform that hed had tailor-made while on leave in Newport . Rita liked how well fitted the new uniform appeared , but shed also noticed that " he did n't  look like a usual sailor . He did n't  have those things rates on his shoulder . " Shed offered to sew on the chevron , but George had insisted he would take care of the matter with a crossbow hand-stitch he had perfected affixing rates on uniforms on board The Sullivans . He never got around to it , so , in the event the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , George made sure to carry the chevron on his person when he and Rita set out for the city . <p> When they arrived in Manhattan at approximately noon , the city already buzzed with rumors of Japans anticipated surrender . However , neither Rita nor George listened much to peoples conversations . Intent on getting to the theater for the 1:05 movie , they made their way from the subway directly to Radio City Music Hall . <p> For all their rushing , George and Rita never saw the climax of A Bell for Adano , the movie they had come to see . After a few scenes of the film had played on the large screen , a theater employee interrupted the show by pounding on the entrance door and announcing loudly that World War II had ended . Radio City Music Hall patrons simultaneously leaped to their feet with a thunderous applause . Though President Truman had not yet received Japans official surrender , and the White Houses official announcement of Japans capitulation was still hours away , few raised the slightest objection to the premature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , Rita , and most other moviegoers poured out of Radio City Music Hall into a bustling 50th Street and 6th Avenue . As they merged into the frenzied scene , they fed off the contagious excitement that surrounded them . People yelled out news of victory and peace . They smiled and laughed . They jumped up and down with no thought of proper decorum . As if caught in a magnetic field , the historic celebration moved toward Times Square . People from other sections of the city were funneled to the same crossroads where they had gathered for celebrations in the past . <p> At the corner of 7th Avenue and 49th Street , George and Rita dropped into Childs restaurant for celebratory libations . As in other watering holes in New York , people walked , skipped and ran up to the jam-packed counter to tip a glass or two ( or significantly more ) to the war that they thought had finally ended . The scene at Childs looked much like that on 7th Avenue . Order and etiquette had been cast away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a favorite glass of wine , patrons forced their way toward the bar and reached out an arm to grab one of the shot glasses of liquor that lined the counter . A generous bartender continuously poured the contents of hard liquor bottles into waiting glasses . George grabbed whatever the server dispensed and did not ask what it was he drank . He knew the desired result would be the same whether the contributor was Jack Daniels , Jameson , or Old Grand-Dad . Even Rita gave over to the reckless abandon . After several minutes and the consumption of too many drinks , George and his date made their way out of the packed bar . <p> Emotions and alcohol-based fuel propelled them out into Times Square where victorious World War II celebrants continued to mass . George thought , My God , Times Square is going wild . And at that point , so was George . He felt uncharacteristically blissful and jubilant . As George moved briskly toward the 42nd Street subway station , the sailor from The Sullivans outpaced his girlfriend . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one triednot even Rita . The realization of a triumphant war created more vigor than his large frame could hold . He needed to release the energy . Rita did her best to keep up . At most points she trailed him by only a few feet . Although she enjoyed the folic through Times Square , she wondered if George would ever stop for a breather . <h> In Search of the Picture <p> As the spirited celebration of Japans surrender grew , reporters from the Associated Press , The New York Times , the New York Daily News , and other well-known publications descended on Times Square to record the spontaneous merriment that was enveloping the worlds most important crossroads . Photographers added more bodies to a burgeoning impromptu gala . One of them represented Life magazine . <p> On August 14 , 1945 , the magazine sought pictures that differed from most others printed earlier in the war . On this day , Life wanted its viewers to know what the end of the war felt like . The editors did n't  know with any degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left it to their photographers to show themjust like they had with other events over the publications nine-year history . Those unsupervised approaches had rarely led to disappointment in the past , and Life s editors trusted their photographers to deliver again today . <p> The magazines trust in its photographers was especially complete when Alfred Eisenstaedt was on assignment . He had photographed the people and personalities of World War II , some prior to the declaration of war and others even before Life existed . As a German Jew in the 1930s , he had chronicled the developing storm , including a picture of Benito Mussolinis first meeting with Adolf Hitler in Venice , on June 13 , 1934 . In another shoot hed photographed an Ethiopian soldiers bare cracked feet on the eve of Fascist Italys attack in 1935 . <p> After the outbreak of war between Japan and the United States , Eisenstaedt focused on the American home front . In 1942 he photographed a six-member Missouri draft board classifying a young farmer as 2-C , indicating draft deferment because of his occupations importance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington and photographed freshman senators performing comical monologues and musical numbers to entertain Capitol reporters . During World War II , Eisenstaedt showed the world what war looked like on the U.S. mainland . <p> On the day World War II ended , Eisenstaedt entered Times Square dressed in a tan suit , a white shirt with a lined tie , tan saddle shoes , and a Leica camera hanging from his neck . Despite his distinctive ensemble , he traveled stealthily amongst the kaleidoscope of moving parts looking for the picture . He made sure not to call attention to himself . He was on the hunt . He knew there was a picture in the making . Kinetic energy filled the square . Eisenstaedt wished for others to feel it , too . To create that sense , Eisenstaedts photo needed a tactile element . It was a tall order for the five-foot , four-inch photographer . He relished the challenge . <p> At some point after 1:00 pm , Eisenstaedt took a picture of several women celebrating in front of a theater across the street from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throwing pieces of paper into the air , creating a mini-ticker-tape parade . While the photo had its charm , it was not the defining picture Eisenstaedt was searching for that day . <p> Shortly after closing the shutter on that scene , he turned to his left and looked up Broadway and 7th Avenue to where 43rd Street connected to Times Squares main artery . As Eisenstaedt continued to search for a photograph that would forever define the moment at hand , he peered around and beneath , but probably not over , the sea of humanity . News of the wars end had primed Americas meeting place for a one-in-a-million kind of picture . A prospect would present itself soon . Eisenstaedt knew that . So he looked and waited . <h> The Kiss <p> Greta Zimmer stood motionless in Times Square near a replica of the Statue of Liberty and a model of the Marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima . To Gretas left was Childs restaurant , one of several in New York , including this establishment at 7th Avenue and 49th Street . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statues or belly up to bars . She wanted to read the Times zipper and learn if Japan really had surrendered to the United States . <p> With the 44th Street sign and the Astor Hotel to her back , she looked up at the tall triangular building that divided one street into two . The lit message running around the Times Building read , " VJ , VJ , VJ , VJ . . . " Greta gazed at the moving type without blinking . A faint smile widened her lips and narrowed her eyes . She took in the moment fully and thought , The war is over . Its really over . <p> Though Greta had arrived in Times Square by herself , she was not alone . While she continued to watch the motioning " VJ " message , hundreds of people moved around her . Greta paid little attention to the swelling mass of humanity . But they were about to take notice of her , and never forget what they saw . Within a few seconds she became Times Squares nucleus . Everybody orbited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . <p> Fresh from the revelry at a Childs on 49th , George Mendonsa and his new girlfriend , Rita Petry , made their way down Times Square toward the 42nd Street subway station . Rita fell behind George by a few steps . Meanwhile , Eisenstaedt persisted in his hunt for the photo . After traveling a block or so up Times Square , he took notice of a fast moving sailor who he thought he saw grabbing a woman and kissing her . That sailor was heading quickly south down Broadway and 7th Avenue . Wondering what he might do next , Eisenstaedt changed direction and raced ahead of the darting sailor . To avoid bumping into people in the crowded street , he had to look away from the sailor he was trying to track . He struggled to regain his focus on the Navy man wearing the formal Navy blue uniform . As he did so , Greta looked away from the Times zipper and started to turn to her right . George crossed the intersection of 44th and 7th Avenue , lengthening the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailor , and the dental assistant were on a collision course . <p> With a quickening pace that matched the surrounding scenes rising pulse , the sailor who served his country aboard The Sullivans zeroed in on a woman whom he assumed to be a nurse . The liquor running through his veins transfixed his glassy stare . He remembered a war scene when he had rescued maimed sailors from a burning ship in a vast ocean of water . Afterward , gentle nurses , angels in white , tended to the injured men . From the bridge of The Sullivans he watched them perform miracles . Their selfless service reassured him that one day the war would end . Peace would reign , again . That day had arrived . <p> George steamed forward several more feet . His girlfriend was now farther behind . He focused on Greta , the " nurse . " She remained unaware of his advance . That served his purpose well . He sought no permission for what he was about to do . He just knew that she looked like those nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurturing had provided a short and precious reprieve from kamikaze-filled skies . But that nightmare had ended . And there she stood . Before him . With background noises barely registering , he rushed toward her as if in a vacuum . <p> Though George halted his steps just before running into Greta , his upper torsos momentum swept over her . The motions force bent Greta backward and to her right . As he overtook Gretas slender frame , his right hand cupped her slim waist . He pulled her inward toward his lean and muscular body . Her initial attempt to physically separate her person from the intruder proved a futile exertion against the dark-uniformed mans strong hold . With her right arm pinned between their two bodies , she instinctively brought her left arm and clenched fist upward in defense . The effort was unnecessary . He never intended to hurt her . <p> As their lips locked , his left arm supported her neck . His left hand , turned backward and away from her face , offered the singular gesture of restraint , caution or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brutish force , caring embrace , and awkward hesitation . He did n't  let go . As he continued to lean forward , she lowered her right arm and gave over to her pursuerbut only for three or four seconds . He tried to hold her closer , wanting the moment to last longer . And longer still . But they parted , the space between them and the moment shared ever widening , releasing the heat born from their embrace into the New York summer afternoon . <p> The encounter , brief and impromptu , transpired beyond the participants governance . Even George , the initiator , commanded little more resolve than a floating twig in a rushing river of fate . He just had to kiss her . He did n't  know why . <p> For that moment , George had thought Times Squares streets belonged to him . They did not . Alfred Eisenstaedt owned them . When he was on assignment , nothing worth capturing on film escaped his purview . Before George and Greta parted , Eisenstaedt spun around , aimed his Leica and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those clicks produced V-J Day , 1945 , Times Square . That photograph became his careers most famous , Life magazines most reproduced , and one of historys most popular . The image of a sailor kissing a nurse on the day World War II ended kept company with Joe Rosenthals photo of the flag raising at Iwo Jima . That photo proudly exemplified what a hard-fought victory looks like . This photo savored what a long-sought peace feels like . <p> Alfred Eisenstaedt was not the only photographer to take notice of George and Greta . Navy Lieutenant Victor Jorgensen , standing to Eisenstaedts right , fired off one shot of the entwined couple at the precise moment the Life photographer took his second picture of four . Though Jorgensens photo did not captivate audiences to the same degree that Eisenstaedts second photograph did , Kissing the War Goodbye drew many admirers as well . <p> And then it was over . Shortly after the taking of V-J Day , 1945 , Times Square , Greta returned to the dental office and told everyone what was happening on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the days appointments and closed the office . Afterward , as Greta made her way home , another sailor kissed her , this time politely on the cheek . For this kiss Greta no longer wore her dental assistant uniform and no photographers took her picture . And as far she could tell , she had not been photographed at any point in time during that day . She did not learn otherwise until years later , when she saw Eisenstaedts photograph of a Times Square couple kissing in a book entitled The Eyes of Eisenstaedt . <p> George did not realize that he had been photographed , either . When George turned from the act hed instigated , he smiled at Rita and offered little explanation for what had transpired . As hard as it is to believe , she made no serious objection . Georges actions fell within the acceptable norms of August 14 , 1945 , but not any other day . Actually , neither George nor Rita thought much of the episode and proceeded to Ritas parents home via the 42nd Street subway train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport for a flight to San Francisco that left at approximately midnight .

Schultz and Linda ODoughda about his new book , A Hell of a War ( New York : St. Martins Press , 1993 ) . Still sporting his familiar thinly trimmed moustache and red carnation , he sat behind the desk of his Madison Avenue office immersed in a vast collection of memorabilia . Among the treasures he displayedmostly autographed photos of Hollywood and political notableswere the helmet he wore in combat , his Navy cover and lieutenant commanders shoulder boards , and a life ring off the battleship Washington ( BB-56 ) inscribed " Lieut . D. Fairbanks , Jr. , USNR , to a sailor good enough to be a Marine , " from then-Marine Corps Captain Donald Hittle , later Brigadier General Hittle , who is now a writer and the President of the Army-Navy Club in Washington , D.C. <p> In keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new bookwhich is the sequel to his Hollywood memoir The Salad Days ( New York : Doubleday , 1988 ) Fairbanks recalled his experiences as a Naval Reserve officer in the Atlantic and Mediterranean theaters of World War II . As it turned out , the veteran of more than 80 movies knew of the Naval Institute , too . <p> Fairbanks : I still take the Proceedings , you know . <p> Naval History : Now , that 's the way to start an interview . <p> Naval History : You took great pains not to be recognized or treated specially during your naval service . How do you feel about participating in interviews and getting attention now ? <p> Fairbanks : Frankly , being in the theatrical world , and also the governmental , diplomatic , and political worlds , I 've been at the other end of interviews since I was a boy . So there 's really nothing novel about it . I try to make sense out of it , to give the right answers , and to be as honest as I can . <p> Naval History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place your naval service in the overall context of your life ? <p> Fairbanks : That 's a good question , is n't it ? Its one I should n't answer quickly . Pauses . I 'd put it very high up , very high up indeed . But it had to be . I was n't a boy when I went in . In fact , I was beyond draft age . I went in 1940 , when I was already 30 years old . My theatrical career was fairly flourishing at the time . But I wanted to get into the Reserves and take on Adolf Hitler . Actor Robert Montgomery and I went in at the same time and did our training together . I had a difficult time getting a commission in the first place , because I did n't  have a university education . I finally got one through a correspondence course in California . Franklin Roosevelt , Jr . went with me the day I signed on to go to sea in Boston . <p> Naval History : Youve probably heard the various theories espoused about how in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Pearl Harbor . At least one even implicates President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a conspiracy . What do you think about all of that ? <p> Fairbanks : Nonsense . I do n't  believe that President Roosevelt would have been involved in any conspiracy . If that were true , evidence of it surely would have come out much earlier than this . People suspect anything they do n't  like or do n't  want to digest . Its libel and slander on the President to suggest a conspiracy . All sorts of things could have happened . Nearly everything is possible . The senior admirals and generals , I 'm sure , considered it a possibilitybut not a probability . And they likely gave it no more credence than a dozen other options . <p> Naval History : We realize that you had a close relationship with President Roosevelt and his family before the war . Has your opinion of him changed since then ? <p> Fairbanks : Not at all , except that I have even more admiration for him now . I thought he was a wonderful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book you say that , after you received an AlNav bulletin that Pearl Harbor had been attacked , you threw it in the wastebasket . Having been the first and only one on board to have seen it , what made you pull it back out ? <p> Fairbanks : I was not certain what it meant " Air Raid Pearl Harbor , this is no drill . " What the hell was Pearl Harbor ? Where was it ? And what did they mean , " This is no drill ? " That part made me think it might be serious and that maybe I should tell somebody about it . I was an Atlantic sailor at the time , not a Pacific one . Nobody in the Atlantic knew much about Pearl Harbor . <p> Naval History : You acknowledge that you were luckier than most , especially those in the Navy . How would you rate your general relationship with your shipmates ? <p> Fairbanks : Pretty good . I did n't  have any special advantages . I was just lucky that the things I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt . And I did n't  break any rules , or at least I did n't  get caught breaking any . <p> Naval History : So you made a specific effort not to trade on your celebrity status ? <p> Fairbanks : Oh , absolutely , yes . That would have been stupidsuicidal . There were always some who tried to put me in my place . " Well teach this guy , " theyd say . When I did n't  pay them any attention , that sort of annoyed them . They got no fun out of it and eventually just gave up . <p> Naval History : What do you remember about your relationships with the enlisted men ? <p> Fairbanks : I suppose it was just the same as any other junior officera very junior officer . I must have been a curiosity to many of them for the first few weeks . Then the curiosity just melted into the ships company . <p> Naval History : Which is exactly the way you wanted it to go . <p> Fairbanks : Oh , of course , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been impossible to do the job otherwise . <p> Naval History : When would you say you turned from being a green officer into a veteran ? <p> Fairbanks : I suppose that happened during the first engagement we had with a German U-boat on the destroyerthe Ludlow ( DD-438 ) it waswhen we crossed the Atlantic . It does n't  take very long once you get a good scare . You get scared once , and you 're part of the team . <p> Naval History : You obviously had a varied Navy career , at least as far as ship types go . By our account , the only ships in which you did not serve were submarines . If you could have served in only one of those ship types , which would it have been and why ? <p> Fairbanks : I enjoyed amphibious work best of all , because it had a little bit of everything . It had land , sea , and air , a combination that was sort of off the beaten track , not straight down the line . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun . It was n't so conventional . A battleship is too big , and a destroyer in a bad sea rolls around and rocks too much . A lot of people liked the tin cans best . But I 'd take cruisers . They 're sort of in between . I enjoyed my time in the battleshipsthe Washington and the Mississippi but they were so enormous . <p> Naval History : If you could have done anything differently in the war , what would it have been ? <p> Fairbanks : Stayed out . No , seriously , I 've always been interested in the diplomatic and political side . I would have liked to be in the State Department or to serve in some diplomatic capacity . I enjoyed my Navy experience , but I think I would have enjoyed doing the same sorts of things I did before the war for FDR down in South America and in Europe , particularly in England and France . I found it all very interesting . I was on a much higher level than people would have imagined from somebody like me . Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President and the Secretary of State . So it was all very interesting and fascinating from my point of view . <p> Fairbanks : Very fond ones , very fond . He was a gentle , nice man . When Admiral Ernest King gave him hell in front of the lot of us , the old man almost wept with embarrassment and humiliation . We hated Admiral King for doing that to him , because we had such affection and respect for Admiral Hewitt . <p> Naval History : You described the frustration you felt in the beach jumpers when you had a skipper who was not very knowledgeable or supportive . Did that situation improve once he was replaced ? <p> Fairbanks : The man was a madman . He was absolutely impossible . He tried to conspire with me , saying , " You must get more recognition . You must arrange to have somebody killed on the next operation . We have n't had enough casualties yet . " That 's when I got around to reporting it . I was on friendly terms with some senior officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was too dangerous . He was widely disliked , widely hated , widely feared , and finally sent out to the Pacific . <p> Naval History : How did the term " beach jumper " come about ? <p> Fairbanks : It was a code name given by Mountbatten , I think . We had training up in Inverary , Scotland . The idea was for it to be a cover namepartly descriptiveand a code name at the same time . <p> Fairbanks : I thought we could have done even more . Today , this type of operation is an integral part of the force . <p> Naval History : In the book , why did you spotlight operations in the south of France over Normandy , which usually gets most of the attention ? <p> Fairbanks : They did n't  do too much of my sort of fighting at Normandy . At Normandy we were experimenting with new things , like the Dieppe operation . Normandy was pretty much all power , not much deception . And we were later involved in strategic planning . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting group . They had supervision over that sort of operation all around the world . <p> Naval History : From the looks of your walls , its almost as if people were standing in line to give you medals . <p> Fairbanks : A lot of them do n't  mean a thing . Theyre just routine . Two or three of them mean something , and I received them gratefully . The others are all just automatic . <p> Fairbanks : Were going to a dinner tomorrow night at an ambassadors house . On the invitation it says that decorations will be worn . I do n't  know where all mine are at the moment . My wife thinks she knows . <p> Naval History : Some of the action summaries that you wrote during the war and then quoted in the book certainly display a flair for writing . Do you enjoy writing ? <p> Fairbanks : Yes . I probably should have done more . I 've always enjoyed writing , and I still do . That is the art I most respect . <p> Fairbanks : Different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 and 17 . Two poems of mine were published in Vanity Fair , and I had some short stories printed in Esquire . Ive been scribbling a long time . I did n't  win any prizes , but I did get published . <p> Naval History : What are you working on now ? Is it a follow-on to A Hell of a War ? <p> Fairbanks : Oh , yes . I 'm not working very hard on it , though . There 's no rush . <p> Naval History : Are you going to bring us up to the present in your next book ? <p> Fairbanks : I wo n't really know until it happens . I 'll see what the publisher wants . You might say I just scribble for the sake of the family now . <p> Naval History : How much did you rely on memory , how much on notes , and how much on research ? <p> Naval History : The research is the fun part , and the writing is the hard part . <p> Fairbanks : Youre absolutely right . It is fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of research that upsets everything else before it , and it contradicts what youve already concluded . <p> Naval History : As historians , we wish everyone had as keen a sense of history as you obviously do . What does history mean to you ? How important is it ? <p> Fairbanks : I 've always enjoyed itthe stories , the excitement , how things developed , the origin of everything . I 'm not only fascinated with natural historythe sun and the starsbut also political history , language , and culture . Ive been interested in how things began ever since I was a boy . <p> Naval History : Todays history teachers try to instill this interest in young people , but its become more and more challenging . <p> Fairbanks : My children are n't  in the least interested in history , so I understand the situation . <p> Naval History : In your opinion , how has World War II been depicted in films ? How would you rate it ? <p> Fairbanks : Do you know , I have n't seen very many of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one . I remember seeing the play , The Caine Mutiny , but I did n't  see the movie .

@@21175729 @1175729/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> Naval Aviation 's Most Serious Crisis ? <p> During an era of budget cutbacks for the Navy and uncertainty about the future of carrier aviation , senior admirals revolted , publicly airing the services grievances before Congress . <p> All things considered , 1949 was a terrible year for U.S. Navy carrier aviation . 1 It all seemed to start with the resignation of James V. Forrestal as secretary of Defense on 28 March . Forrestal had been selected to be the countrys first Defense secretary in September 1947 , following the conclusion of the 194447 Army-Navy fight over service unification that resulted in the passage of the National Security Act . As such , he was charged with coordinating the three services that had been unified under the new organization designated as the National Military Establishment . <p> Having served as secretary of the Navy during the final portion of World War II and the initial postwar period , however , Forrestal was a solid supporter of carrier aviation . He knew the value of the Navys aircraft carriers and its dedicated aviators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was willing to support the Navys position on the importance of carrier aviation even though the senior leaders of the U.S. Air Force were adamantly opposed to the country maintaining significant numbers of operational aircraft carriers . <p> By the final months of 1948 , however , the mental and physical strains of his work as Defense secretary had begun to show in Forrestals daily actions . As thenSecretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan remarked years later , " In the previous June he was not in good shape , but he made a comeback , and in September 1948 was more like his old self . Very early in October he began issuing me contradictory orders , and from then on he went downhill and very fast . " 2 <p> By early 1949 , even President Harry S. Truman had begun to notice Forrestals faltering job performance . President Trumans naval aide , Rear Admiral Robert L. Dennison , remembered a conversation . The president asked him if he knew who the secretary of Defense was . Playing along , Dennison said , " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman replied : " Youre wrong , I 'm the Secretary of Defense . . . . Jim calls me up several times a day asking me to make a decision on matters that are completely within his competence , but he passes them on to me. " 3 <p> On 28 January Truman called the Defense secretary to the White House for an off-the-record meeting . The president informed Forrestal that Louis A. Johnson would be replacing him as secretary of Defense on 1 May 1949. 4 But Forrestals command of his job continued to slip , and he left his post a month early . <p> If Louis Johnson had come into the Defense job without particular preconceptions about the countrys security policies , Navy leaders might have hoped for a reasonable opportunity to convince the new secretary that the services aircraft carriers had a useful role to play in U.S. military security . Unfortunately for the Navy , Johnson came into office with a strong preference for the strategic airpower views espoused by the Air Force . Indeed , his earlier close association with the prewar Army Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulent years as assistant secretary of War . 5 <h> Cancellation of the United States <p> The Navys first large flush-deck aircraft carrierdesigned to have a standard displacement of 60,000 tons and capable of operating an air wing consisting of 18 ADR-42 attack aircraft ( able to carry atomic weapons ) and 80 XF2D-1 fightershad been authorized by Congress in June 1948 and initially funded as part of the Fiscal Year 1949 Defense appropriation. 6 Nevertheless , on 15 April 1949 , less than three weeks after taking over as Defense secretary , Johnson sent a letter to General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was serving temporarily as presiding officer of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , stating that he would like to have the Chiefs judgment on the proposed new aircraft carrier " tentatively designated USS UNITED STATES . " 7 Three days later the flush-deck carriers keel plate was officially laid during a brief ceremony at Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company . <p> Toward the end of the week of 1723 April , the individual members of the JCS were informed that their views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Johnson by that Friday afternoon , because he would be making his decision on the ships fate the following morning . The Joint Staff received the separate service papers on the issue late on Friday , and it was not until almost 1030 on Saturday that the package of materials was sent to Johnsons office . Surprisingly , less than half an hour later Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Louis E. Denfeld received a copy of a press release from the Defense secretarys office that was being handed out to reporters . It announced that the carriers construction was being halted . 8 <p> When Navy Secretary John Sullivan returned to Washington on Sunday from a speaking engagement in Corpus Christi , Texas , he was absolutely furious at Johnson for his action . Before leaving on his trip , Sullivan had been assured by Johnson that he would make no decision on the carrier until he had had a further chance to talk about it with the Navy secretary . 9 Sullivan quickly decided that if he was not even going to be consulted by the secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other alternative than to resign . He submitted his letter of resignation on 26 April and left office almost a month later , following a short ceremony on the Mall side of the Pentagon . <p> During the 24 May ceremony , which Johnson briefly attended , Sullivan told the assembled crowd of supporters , " I have been privileged to serve with you men and women of the greatest Navy the world has ever knowna Navy that has never been defeated by a foreign foe . " 10 Amusingly , it was at this point in the speech that Secretary Johnson hurriedly left the gathering . <p> When Sullivan resigned , Under Secretary of the Navy W. John Kenney , in a gesture of solidarity , also left office . That , however , left the services civilian leadership open to the political whims of Louis Johnson . The Defense secretary decided to replace Sullivan , one of the Truman administrations prominent Catholics , with another prominent Catholic , but one who would prove more malleable. 11 The individual eventually chosen for the job was Francis P. Matthews , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both prior experience in either government or the military . He was sworn in as secretary of the Navy on 25 May . The choice of Matthews was to quickly prove a near-disaster for carrier aviation and the Navy as a whole . <h> The Anonymous Document <p> While the Navys carrier community had been suffering from Johnsons economic depredations , the Air Forces new B-36 bomber program had been the recipient of increased Defense largesse , as several hundred million dollars previously authorized for other Air Force programs had been quickly reallocated for the procurement of more of the enormous bombers . 12 The disparity in treatment convinced certain naval aviators and their supporters that a way had to be found to bring carrier aviations drastically worsening plight to the attention of Congress . <p> Two men who secretly took up this challenge were Cedric R. Worth , special assistant to new Under Secretary of the Navy Dan A. Kimball , and Commander Thomas D. Davies , special assistant to the assistant secretary of the Navy for Air . As Captain Frank A. Manson remembered , " Tom Davies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . can see him now , standing with his . . . foot on the window sill there and his . . . hand on his chin . . . talking about this situation , you know . And he was wondering How can we get a congressional hearing ? " 13 <p> The genesis of what subsequently became known as " the Anonymous Document " occurred when Worth and Davies began collecting material on the B-36 bomber program , but the decision to write the paper was actually made during a 13 April meeting that the two men had with Glenn L. Martin , chairman of the Glenn Martin Aircraft Company , and Martin Company representative Harold G. Mosier . Worth told the pair that there was a lot of news material on the B-36 bomber that if put together would make a very interesting story , Martin responded that if that were done he would like to read it . Worth then said hed see that Martin got a copy . 14 <p> The initial version of the document was apparently completed within a week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 numbered sections detailing particular facts or rumors relating to the B-36 procurement program . Assembled from a combination of aeronautical industry gossip and wild suppositions , the documents principal theme was that the B-36 was a " billion dollar blunder " whose procurement continued only because Secretary Johnson and Air Force Secretary W. Stuart Symington had personal financial stakes in its production and because they owed favors to Floyd Odlum , the head of Convairthe company manufacturing the plane . 15 Shortly after the Anonymous Document was completed , Worth handed a copy to Martin . Subsequent copies of the paper were given to certain members of Congress , including eventually Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn ( D-TX ) and Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Carl Vinson ( D-GA ) . <p> Rep. James E. Van Zandt ( R-PA ) , who had received one of the first copies of the paper , was a longtime supporter of Navy interests and a member of the Armed Services Committee . When a number of weeks passed without any public mention of the allegations about the B-36 bomber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act on his own . On 25 May 1949 , Van Zandt introduced a resolution in the House to establish a select committee to investigate the matter of aircraft contract awards and cancellations since 8 May . The following day he delivered a " fire-breathing " speech on the House floor in support of his resolution . In it he recounted many of the most damning rumors put forth in the Worth document about Convairs B-36 contracts and the putative roles of Johnson and Symington in the process . <p> The flurry of press attention that arose from Van Zandts speech alarmed Vinson , who for weeks had been ignoring the rumors emanating from the Anonymous Document . Accordingly , on 1 June he submitted a resolution in the House requesting that his Armed Services Committee be authorized to conduct " thorough studies and investigations relating to matters involving the B-36 bomber . " The House agreed to an amended version of Vinsons resolution on 8 June . The following day the committee adopted an eight-item agenda for its B-36 investigation . Interestingly , one of the items called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force and Navy to determine if the decision to cancel the construction of the carrier United States had been sound . 16 <p> June and July 1949 were difficult months for the Navy , as it was forced to respond to substantial budget cuts proposed for the FY 51 budget . On 5 July Defense Secretary Johnson sent a memorandum to the Army , Navy , and Air Force secretaries and the JCS that laid out forces and ceilings for the services in FY 51 . Under this new proposal , the Navy was tentatively allowed to maintain only four attack aircraft carriershalf the number that had been appropriated for FY 50. 17 From the perspective of many naval aviators , it appeared that senior Navy surface officers and the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations ( OPNAV ) as a whole were willing to accept this downgrading of carrier aviation if it kept Louis Johnson from battering the Navy with further cuts . 18 <h> The B-36 Hearings <p> During the committees 925 August hearings on the B-36 program , Air Force witnesses presented well-organized testimony that thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the final day of hearings , Carl Vinson declared , " Not one scintilla of evidence " offered during the proceedings supported charges that corruption or influence had played any part in the B-36 bombers procurement . 19 He then recessed the committee until 5 October . <p> By early September rumors were circulating around Washington that the committee would not resume the hearings to examine the other items on the agenda , including the matter of the United States cancellation . One naval aviator who was determined not to let that occur was Captain John G. Crommelin , an officer then serving on the Joint Staff . Accordingly , on 10 September he assembled a group of wire-service reporters at his home and gave a formal statement that castigated the " General Staff concept " then dominating the Pentagon for causing the B-36 controversy and the cancellation of the flush-deck carrier . 20 The Crommelin statement garnered substantial press attention and led to public comments by other naval officers , including Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey . <p> Angered by this publicity , which he thought was indicative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Navy Secretary Matthews sent out a classified message on 14 September to all major Navy commanders directing that those who wished to express views on the matter should transmit them to him through the appropriate channels . 21 One senior officer who responded to the secretarys request was Vice Admiral Gerald F. Bogan , commander , First Task Fleet . <p> In a classified memo that he sent up the chain of command , Admiral Bogan stressed that " The morale of the Navy is lower today than at any time since I entered the commissioned ranks in 1916 . . . . In my opinion this descent , almost to despondency , stems from complete confusion as to the future role of the Navy and its advantages and disadvantages as a permanent career . " 22 In their endorsements of Bogans memo , Admiral Arthur W. Radford , commander-in-chief , Pacific Fleet , and CNO Louis Denfeld agreed that substantial numbers of naval officers concurred with Crommelins and Bogans views . <p> During the final days of September , staff members from the House Armed Services Committee made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers to support ending the hearings without presenting the Navys side of the issues . Although Matthews was inclined to go along with this scheme , Admiral Radfordduring a 3 October meeting that he and other senior Navy leaders had with Vinsonpersuaded the committee chairman to at least hold off on announcing a delay in the hearings . 23 <p> Later that day , in an action completely unrelated to the earlier meeting , Captain Crommelin secretly handed over to an Associated Press reporter sanitized copies of the Bogan memo and Radfords and Denfelds endorsements that he had inappropriately received from an officer in OPNAV. 24 The resulting story made huge headlines and most likely forced Chairman Vinson to reopen the hearings . <h> The Unification and Strategy Hearings <p> The hearings that allowed the Navy to present its views before the House Armed Services Committee began on 6 October , with Secretary Matthews being the first witness . He proclaimed that Navy morale was good and asserted that naval aviators who felt otherwise were demonstrating their anti-unification biases . Not surprisingly , his views were not enthusiastically received by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Admiral Radford was the next to speak , and he gave a well-prepared presentation that decried the morality of an atomic blitz directed against the civilian populations of major enemy cities and questioned the purported operational effectiveness of the B-36 bomber . Other witnesses in the days that followed discussed issues such as the technical aspects of strategic bombing and the need to procure smaller and faster bombers for the strategic air mission . <p> The climax of the Navys testimony occurred on 13 October , when CNO Louis Denfeld presented his views . Although he had long attempted to avoid confrontations with Secretary Matthews over policy , in his appearance before the committee Denfeld had decided to support his Navy . To the shock of Matthews and Johnson , the CNO testified in support of Radford and the naval aviators . He detailed his concerns about the effect of budget cuts on the Navys strength , the role of the JCS in agreeing to additional money for B-36 procurement while advocating the cancellation of the flush-deck carrier , and the need to give predominant weight to service views in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stressed to the committee : " Fleets never in history met opposing fleets for any other purpose than to gain control of the seanot as an end in itself , but that national power could be exerted against an enemy . " 25 <p> Denfelds strong testimony proved to be a bombshell both to the committee members and , even more so , to the Johnson Defense Department . Although his forthright presentation subsequently cost the CNO his job , it undoubtedly helped carrier aviations cause . <h> Consequences of the Revolt <p> The short-term repercussions of the Navys testimony during the Unification and Strategy Hearings appeared minimal , at least on the surface . Yes , the strong testimony presented by senior naval aviators had convinced many influential committee members that carrier aviation had not been rendered inconsequential by intercontinental strategic bombing . But on the other hand , Admiral Denfelds successor as CNO , Admiral Forrest P. Sherman , was not inclined to openly oppose the budget cutbacks Johnson imposed on the Navy . Several weeks before the Unification and Strategy hearings , the Defense secretary had set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of two from his earlier proposal but still a drop of five from the FY 49 budget . <p> The longer-term repercussions were substantial . The committees report on the hearings , which was released on 1 March 1950 , expressed a solidly pro-naval-aviation viewpoint in certain important ways . It noted that U.S. airpower consisted of Air Force , Navy , and Marine airpower and that strategic bombing was only one aspect of it . The report also stated that differences between the Air Force and Navy were primarily due to " fundamental professional disagreements on the art of warfare . " 26 Moreover , the changed attitude of many influential members of the committee toward carrier aviation was demonstrated as early as April 1950 , when important congressmen began lobbying the Navy behind the scenes to construct a new flush-deck carrier . 27 <p> The Navy sailed treacherous seas in 1949 , but obviously survivedand even thrived . The start of the Korean War in 1950 simultaneously demonstrated the value and versatility of carrier-based aviation and the limitations inherent in relying solely on a land-based U.S. Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt-tightening being the order of the day , the size of the Navys carrier force again is under evaluation . This time not only the size of the force is being scrutinized , the size of the carriers themselves has become a contentious debate . It is important , then , for Navy and civilian leaders and the American public to reflect on the lessons of the " Revolt of the Admirals " and understand that crucial national security issues almost always have long-term ramifications . Their successful resolution requires extraordinary effort and must look well beyond that which is merely expedient . <p> 1 .

The coda to most accounts of the revolt is that the SecNav then fired the CNO in reprisal for his testimony . Admiral Denfeld was " made to walk the plank " for stating his views to Congress , is how committee chairman Rep. Carl Vinson ( D-GA ) bluntly put it . <p> But Secretary Matthews presented a different picture when he met with representatives of the Navy League of the United States in his office on 11 January 1950 .

Desperate to recapture Guadalcanal and its airbase , Henderson Field , the Japanese army was mounting a land offensive , and the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) came out in support . Some of the hardest-fought naval air battles of World War II figured in the six-month Guadalcanal campaign , including possibly the toughest , the 26 October Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands . <p> The IJN put its first team into the balance , sending large task forces to the east of the Solomon Islands . Aggressive Admiral William F. Halsey , who had just assumed command of the South Pacific theater ( SOPAC ) , opposed them with his own flattops in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hornet ( CV-8 ) . Using the incomparable advantage of Ultrainformation gleaned from decrypts of enciphered Japanese radio transmissionsHalsey was able to concentrate on the enemys flank . At the time , only the Hornet was actually in SOPAC ; after having had damage from the Battle of the Eastern Solomons repaired , the Enterprise was hustling forward from Pearl Harbor . The American carrier task forces rendezvoused just in time . <p> Under the tactical command of Rear Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid , the principal participating SOPAC unitsTask Forces 16 and 17included the pair of flattops ; the battleship South Dakota ( BB-57 ) ; half-a-dozen cruisers , with several of the new specialized antiaircraft light cruisers ; and 14 destroyers . Another force , built around the battleship Washington ( BB-56 ) , figured in the foes calculations , though it would not participate directly in the battle . Employing their own array of formations , the Japanese navys participating forces comprised 3 big carriers , 1 light carrier , 4 battleships , 8 heavy and 2 light cruisers , and 21 destroyers . <p> The course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the night before the main action , U.S. PBY Catalina search planes sighted some of the key Japanese fleet units and loosed glancing blows . The enemy took precautions and turned away while Admiral Kinkaid aggressively sought to close with him . From his headquarters at NoumTa , New Caledonia , SOPAC commander Halsey famously signaled , " ATTACK . REPEAT . ATTACK . " <p> The morning air searches by the Enterprise on 26 October found the main Japanese carrier forceVice Admiral Chuichi Nagumos Kido Butai , or Striking Forceand scout bombers made immediate attacks that put the light carrier Zuiho out of action . Japanese scouts had almost simultaneously found Kinkaids ships , and the sides exchanged air strikes . Passing near each other , some of the strike formations planes mixed it up . American aircraft went on to sideline a second enemy carrier and to damage a heavy cruiser . The Japanese meanwhile damaged the Enterprise and crippled the Hornet . <p> The " Big E " managed to restore her flight deck sufficiently to resume air activities and maintained combat air patrols through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inflicting more damage on the Hornet . Brave sailors fought the Hornets fires and kept her afloat , but late in the day the crew of the grievously wounded carrier was ordered to abandon ship . Admiral Kinkaid already had withdrawn from the battle area . That night Japanese torpedoes sank the Hornet , a task that " fish " and shellfire from U.S. destroyers had been unable to do before the " tin cans " were forced to retreat . <p> Japanese attacks also had damaged the South Dakota , the heavy cruiser Portland ( CA-33 ) , the antiaircraft cruiser San Juan ( CL-54 ) , and the destroyers Mahan ( DD-364 ) and Smith ( DD-378 ) . What was likely an errant U.S. torpedo sank the Porter ( DD-356 ) . American strikes had hit the carriers Shokaku ( Nagumos flagship ) and Zuiho and the heavy cruiser Chikuma . By percentage , plane losses on each side were nearly equal . But in number , the IJN lost 99 aircraft against 80 American planes , and Japanese aircrew losses were substantially greater . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cruz Islands have been written . Nevertheless , certain elements of the action continue to be poorly understood or remain virtually unknown . So rather than repeat the efforts of previous historians , what follows is an exploration of some the battles enduring mysteries . <h> Locating the Japanese Fleet <p> While Ultras code-breakers furnished crucial insights into the Japanese navys intentions and maneuvers , Allied intelligence was not omniscient . Pacific Fleet Commander-in-Chief Admiral Chester W. Nimitz at Pearl Harbor and Admiral Halsey at NoumTa based their plans on weekly intelligence estimates of Japanese fleet dispositions that were compiled by the F-16 Section of the Office of Naval Intelligence ( ONI ) in Washington . During the weeks before the Santa Cruz battle the estimates were consistently inaccurate , leading commanders to believe IJN forces to be weaker than they were . <p> Based on Ultra , Nimitz warned of a Japanese naval offensive as early as 17 October . But U.S. radio direction-finding and traffic analysis placed only two Japanese aircraft carriers in the battle area , and the ONI estimates located three of the five enemy flattops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Four Japanese flight decks would be at Santa Cruz compared with two American . The disparity would have been even worse save that the Japanese carrier Hiyo , crippled by mechanical failure , was sent away for repairs . The day after the battle , ONI still estimated that an enemy carrier division that had fought at Santa Cruz was in Japan . <p> The intel record with respect to other warships was equally poor . That was partly because of assessments that both of the Aoba -class heavy cruisers had already been sunk and partly because Rear Admiral Norman Scott , who won a surface victory off Guadalcanal at the 1112 October Battle of Cape Esperance , had overestimated enemy losses in that fight . He initially claimed three Japanese cruisers and four destroyers had sunk , but the IJN had actually lost only one heavy cruiser and one destroyer . The exaggerated losses were then scored to units other than Japans Cruiser Division 6 , which had the Aoba -class ships and had been the main opponent at Cape Esperance . This had the effect of minimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombarded Guadalcanal on 15 October , U.S. intelligence believed the former was in Yokosuka and the latter at Palau . <p> As for battleships , the 20 October ONI estimate carried as " possibly damaged " one of Admiral Takeo Kuritas vessels that had smashed Henderson Field on 13 October , placed the Yamato and Mutsu as possibly at Rabaul , and credited the enemy fleet in the Solomons as , again , " possibly " including the Ise , which was in Japan . At Santa Cruz , the Japanese surface fleet chased Kinkaids task force as the Americans retired from the scene . If the pursuit had resulted in a gunnery engagement , the mistaken appreciations would have come home to roost . <h> Who Owned Henderson Field ? <p> The Imperial Japanese Navys offensive was to be triggered by notice that the Japanese army had captured Henderson Field on Guadalcanal . The army demanded repeated postponements of a schedule that had called for the event to occur on 22 October . Had that schedule been kept , not only would the Japanese fleet have had more plentiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action before the Enterprise had joined up with the Hornet . For Halsey , who believed that carriers together were worth double what they were individually , that made a big difference . Japans army faced huge obstacles on Guadalcanal , but the degree of its cooperation is open to challenge . <p> That is true for the armys information as well . In August , during the sequence of actions that led to the Battle of the Eastern Solomons , the army had falsely reported success to the IJN . Wanting surety this time , the navy set up an observation post on Guadalcanal to supply direct reports to the Combined Fleet flagship , the superbattleship Yamato at Truk . <p> On the night of 2425 October the Japanese army duly reported it had taken Henderson Field . Naval observers indicated that fighting raged in the airfields vicinity . In the morning , Japanese naval aircraft flew down to Guadalcanal to verify Hendersons status . One plane even tried to land . The scouts found the field safely in American hands . That night the army again attacked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time even the armys chain of command confirmed that its ground attacks had failed . The navy nevertheless chose to proceed . <p> The IJN had been repeatedly frustrated by the armys inaccurate reporting and warned more than once that diminishing fuel supplies would oblige it to withdraw from Solomons waters . Why it proceeded with its offensive is an enduring mystery . Only conjecture is possible . Japanese naval officers , from Combined Fleet commander Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto on down , were chagrined at the Allies ability to prevent the IJN from effectively supplying Japanese forces on Guadalcanal . Faced with desperate conditions at the frontJapanese on Guadalcanal nicknamed the place " Starvation Island " Yamamoto determined to persist despite every obstacle . <h> Japanese Timing <p> Imperial Japanese Navy veterans , from Kido Butai Chief of Staff Rear Admiral Ryunosuke Kusaka to destroyer skipper Tameichi Hara , noted in postwar writings that principal commanders were influenced by several elements , including very limited information on the presence of American aircraft carriers , staff officers observations that 27 October was Navy Day in the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle in the South Pacific . <p> Kido Butai commander Admiral Nagumo behaved cautiously precisely because of the thin intelligence . The other two factors have long been obscure , but there is evidence supporting both points . Since 1922 , when the Navy League of the United States organized the first observance , 27 October has been celebrated as Navy Day in America . The date was the birthday of President Theodore Roosevelt , father of the Great White Fleet and a staunch American navalist . The event acquired some significance among IJN commanders because calendar dates were of special importance to the Japanese , who indulged themselves in a sense of fateful consequence . <p> Meanwhile , the idea of an impending major battle in the South Pacific was current in the United States . The Associated Press reported on 16 October that the battle for Guadalcanal was shaping up to be " one of the decisive engagements of the war . " The next day the Chicago Tribune headlined , " COURSE OF WAR AT STAKE ! " The story quoted Secretary of the Navy Frank J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  want to make any predictions , but every man out there , afloat and ashore , will give a good account of himself . " Reporting on Guadalcanal a few days later , the Associated Press explicitly forecast an imminent surface naval battle off Guadalcanal . <p> On 19 October , the United Press , another major news wire service , alluded to the same idea of a surface action but added carrier fighting for good measure , reporting that experts expected " the outcome . . . would hinge on the naval struggle " and the United States would combine the kinds of tactics used at the Battle of the Java Sea with those of " Coral SeaMidway . " Similarly , military correspondent Hanson W. Baldwin commented in a 23 October New York Times article that " we can not fight a protracted delaying action in the Pacific ; we must , it is felt , hit Japan continuously and without respite . " <p> Such press reporting was grist for the mill of shortwave news that was broadcast to the Pacific from San Francisco , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Pacific . On Guadalcanal , Marine commander Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift listened to the broadcasts every night before bed , and they were also staples on board the flagships of the Combined Fleet , the Kido Butai , and Rear Admiral Kakuji Kakutas Carrier Division 2 . <p> Rear Admiral Kusaka of Nagumos staff used the Navy Day date and the sense of impending battle in a dispatch to the Combined Fleet , suggesting that Admiral Yamamoto order the Japanese advance for 27 October . Instead , holding to his Henderson Fieldhinged timetable , Yamamoto insisted on immediate action . And by the 27th , the battle for Santa Cruz was over . <h> What Happened to the American Air Strikes ? <p> At Santa Cruz , scout bombers in the U.S. Navys dawn search succeeded in damaging the Japanese light carrier Zuiho . Later , Hornet dive bombers busted up the flight deck of the fleet carrier Shokaku . After those surprise bombings , throughout a long days battle , no Japanese flattop was again attacked . Yet the Hornet got off two strike waves ( totaling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes ) before she was damaged , and the Enterprise hurled a strike wave of her own ( with three SBDs and nine TBFs ) , necessarily small because she had used many planes in the air search . Thus the main enemy force was barely engaged by the major U.S. strike missions . <p> The " battle of the air groups " that took place as the adversaries strike groups flew past each other on reciprocal courses does not account for this phenomenon . During the clash , Japanese fighters reduced the Big Es torpedo planes by about half , but none of the American formations turned back , and except for escort fighters , attack strength was not further affected . One of the Hornet squadrons , possibly disoriented in the melee , shifted its vector , but that too was not determinate . <p> The long range at which the battle took place and the disposition of the Japanese fleet were the main reasons the U.S. attacks miscarried . Historians have almost uniformly castigated IJN operational doctrine for its practice of dividing forces into numerous fleet unitsStriking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so onin effect , diluting available strength . But at Santa Cruz the tactic worked to Japanese advantage . <p> The Vanguard Force , sailing dozens of miles ahead of Nagumos flattops , was the first enemy the American planes encountered . Some U.S. aircraft immediately attacked ; others pressed on to the limit of their range in hopes of finding the Kido Butai and then returned to strike the Vanguard . This was where the cruiser Chikuma suffered her damage . Because Kinkaids carriers lost their flight decks early in the day , and the Enterprise , once she restored service , was preoccupied with maintaining combat air patrols , there were no follow-up air strikes . <h> The Japanese Aviation Code <p> Embarked on board the Enterprise was a so-called " mobile radio detachment , " a unit of the signals-intelligence fraternity . It furnished Admiral Kinkaid with decrypts that circulated on the **27;122;TOOLONG network as well as tactical information from its own radio monitoring . The detachment in the Big E was led by a Marine , Captain Bankston T. Holcomb . His unit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided Kinkaid with his earliest warnings of some of the incoming Japanese air strikes , helping the carrier to position combat air patrols even before the enemy was acquired on radar . According to a postwar history of the mobile radio detachments , in the midst of the battle Holcomb had gained extraordinary access to Japanese aircraft message traffic because he was handed a copy of the IJN aviation code , salvaged from one of the attacking enemy aircraft that had crashed . <p> This account now appears to be more complicated than it originally did . The Japanese air group and squadron commandersthe pilots most likely to have possessed copies of the aviation codeeither did not crash aboard the Enterprise , or their aircraft were completely consumed while doing so . In addition , it is known that documentary material was recovered from a different Japanese aircraft , a plane that crashed aboard the destroyer Smith . <p> Aviation Machinists Mate Third Class Thomas Powell , a gunner with " Torpedo 10 " on board the Enterprise , recalled a provenance for the codebook , which was related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the battle , Kinkaid told Powell and some other sailors that the codebook had indeed been captured on the Smith . The Big Es after-action report does not mention the destroyer or indicate the Enterprise came to a stop during the battle to receive materials from another vessel . If true , this suggests that the Japanese aviation codebook could only have changed hands after Santa Cruz . Captain Holcombs assistance to Kinkaid in the heat of battle derived from more conventional radio-monitoring techniques . <h> What About the Enterprise ? <p> Many arguments about the outcome at Santa Cruz hinge on the notion the sides postbattle carrier forces were somehow equal . Once the Japanese sent the Zuikaku home to train a new air group , equality in literal terms did exist . But the status of the Enterprise , the flattop on the American side of this equation , is poorly understood . The combination of bomb hits and near misses that the carrier sustained at Santa Cruz did more than jam one elevator in place on her flight deck , thereby slowing flight operations . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that damage was more serious than thought . <p> Two near misses had sprung rivets or deflected platesin places as much as 2+ feet inwardopening fuel tanks to the sea along almost 100 feet of hull . In one area , all the frames , floors , and bulkheads had buckled . Leaks threatened . The Enterprise s stem was laced with fragment holes , a few up to a foot wide , and she was taking water , down four feet by the bow . On the hangar deck , the floor of a 50-foot section near the No. 1 elevator was heavily damaged , the decks below blown out . Crewmen in one compartment were actually trapped by flooded spaces above them . Two bomb hoists were questionable . The bridge gyroscope had failed . Several radios and a direction-finding loop were out . <p> Some repairs could only be made in port . Although the Big E could launch and recover aircraft , she was not truly combat-ready and in a renewed engagement would have been gravely disadvantaged . Battle speeds and even stormy seas might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handbent superhuman efforts to enable the ship to make speed despite her damage . <p> For 11 days after the carrier arrived at NoumTa she was completely incapacitated , as Admiral Halsey added every engineer and repairman to those already working over the ship . Hull breaches were repaired , but the aircraft elevator jam awaited drydocking in the United States . When the Enterprise went to sea again , Pearl Harbor privately estimated that the carrier was operating at 70 percent of her combat efficiency . Meanwhile , the IJN decision to return the Zuikaku to Japanese Empire waters was entirely voluntary , based on a plan to regenerate for another Guadalcanal offensive timed for January 1943 . She just as easily could have been retained in the South Pacific . <h> Who Won ? <p> American observers take a variety of positions on the outcome at Santa Cruz . Marine General Vandegrift termed the battle a " standoff . " Theater commander Admiral " Bull " Halsey wrote that " tactically , we picked up the dirty end of the stick but strategically we handed it back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle a Japanese tactical victory that gained precious time for the Allies . And aviation historian John Lundstrom , author of the most detailed examination of the aerial exchanges , wrote of a " supposed " Japanese decisive victory and followed this with an analysis that , while not actually saying so , framed the outcome as Japanese defeat . Robert Sherrod , chronicler of Marine aviation in the war , said Santa Cruz was a case in which " the box score is deceptive . " <p> Guadalcanal campaign expert Richard Frank made no direct assessment but approvingly quoted Admiral Nimitzs opinion , penned some weeks after the battle , which declares that the Japanese were turned back and their carrier air groups shattered on the eve of critical battles . Commander Edward P. Stafford , author of the authoritative history of the Enterprise , termed the battle " a bloody draw . . . which had been a U.S. victory only because it had momentarily thwarted a Japanese attempt at recapture . " <p> Popular authors parse their meanings too . Naval historian E. B. Potter concluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle " but had the solace of inflicting very heavy aviation losses . Edwin P. Hoyt called Santa Cruz " an American loss , but not one that made it impossible . . . to hold on to Guadalcanal , " while Eric Hammel termed the battle " technically a Japanese victory . " Carrier warfare authorities James and William Belote scored it a Japanese win , " a victory won at nearly intolerable cost . " And Kenneth I. Friedman pictured a tactical defeat that " forestalled a total and catastrophic debacle . " <p> All of these assessments , however , suffer from hindsight . We now know how the Guadalcanal campaign turned out and the importance of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in reducing the ranks of experienced Japanese pilots and aircrews . The climactic surface actions off Guadalcanal during November , in which the Japanese follow-up disintegrated , are also known . Admiral Nimitz , for example , issued his celebrated opinion of Santa Cruz after the November battles . But on Navy Day27 October1942 , SOPAC was in the direst of circumstances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defense of rear bases in the South Pacific . Both admirals asked authorities in Washington to request the loan of a British aircraft carrier for service in SOPAC . Meanwhile , Halsey set all hands to work in a race against time to repair the Enterprise , the only U.S. aircraft carrier left in the Pacific . <p> By many reasonable measures the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands marked a Japanese victoryand a strategic one . The Imperial Japanese Navy had pursued Kinkaids retiring fleet , indeed forced it away from the battle zone . The day after the action , the Japanese possessed the only operational carrier force in the Pacific . In addition to having sunk more shipsof greater combat tonnagethe Japanese had more aircraft remaining and were in physical possession of the seas . Although a big share of credit goes to Japanese aviators and even American destroyermen , the sinking of a U.S. fleet carrier , the Hornet , by surface torpedo attack was also a notable achievement .

But at the Battle of Midway , the U.S. Navy turned the tables on its powerful enemy , sinking four aircraft carriers and changing the momentum of the war in the Pacific . <p> Sixty-five years ago , in early June 1942 , the most decisive naval battle of World War II was fought between the Imperial Japanese Navy and the U.S. Pacific Fleet near tiny Midway Atoll . Victory or defeat depended heavily on the dive bombers , torpedo planes , and fighters that attacked the enemy 's forces . But , as with other decisive naval battles , commanders ' decisions and luck played large roles in determining the winner and the scope of the victory . <p> During the first months of the Pacific war , the Japanese war machine had been unstoppable . At the same time they were successfully attacking Pearl Harbor , Japanese forces began sweeping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December they sank the British battleship Prince of Wales and battlecruiser Repulse . By mid-February , Japan had captured what once had been called impregnablethe port of Singaporeand was pushing westward into Burma . It also lost little time in adding Borneo , Celebes , Sumatra , and Java to Emperor Hirohito 's realm and relentlessly advanced against Allied forces in the Philippines . Moving eastward , Japanese forces captured key Central Pacific islands , including Guam and Wake ; occupied New Britain and New Ireland ; and moved into the Solomon Islands . At that point , only New Guinea stood between them and Australia . <p> Japan 's early-war tactics were relatively simple . As its forces advanced , they constructed airfields to extend their warplanes ' bomb line . The army and navy did not move without air cover , and objectives were taken with high precision and relatively little loss of life . Japan did not launch any frontal assaults like in World War I. The Allies , in turn , found themselves fighting a virtually invisible enemy that stalked their retreating columns , blocked roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hot , disappeared into the jungle . The simplicity of its tactics , more than anything else , made Japan a formidable foe , and it was more than a match for an unprepared enemy . As its forces racked up victory after victory , the country 's propaganda and the many war correspondents writing about the lopsided battles perpetuated the myth of Japanese invincibility . <p> During the onslaught , America was sorely in need of some tangible victory , and in order to boost morale , President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to develop a plan to attack the Japanese home islands . Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel James H. " Jimmy " Doolittle and the U.S. Navy received the assignment . On 18 April 1942 , 16 B-25 bombers took off from the USS Hornet ( CV-8 ) and bombed Japan , 650 miles away . While the Doolittle Raid did not cause much damage and tactically was not successful , it was strategically important .

Most of Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky 's 32 SBDs from the Enterprise dove on the Kaga , scoring multiple bomb hits ; three of the Dauntlesses took on the Akagi and hit her with at least one 1,000-pound bomb . Meanwhile , 17 Yorktown SBDs dove on a third carrier , the Soryu , hitting her with three 1,000-pound bombs . With planes on their flight decks and unprotected torpedoes and armed and fueled aircraft on their hangar decks , the ships were soon engulfed in explosions and fire . Within minutes the carriers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of the Imperial Japanese Navy 's carrier force was gone . The damage would most likely have been greater if the strike 's 34 Hornet dive bombers had not flown a different course from the other attack planes ; they never found the Japanese ships . <p> The First Carrier Striking Force 's remaining flattop , the Hiryu , escaped the onslaught , and its commander quickly ordered 18 D3A1 Val bombers and six Zero fighters to attack the U.S. carriers . Following returning Yorktown planes , the Japanese attackers found the carrier and hit her with three bombs . Admiral Fletcher transferred his flag from the temporarily disabled ship to the USS Astoria ( CA-34 ) and turned over command of the carrier groups to Spruance . Later that afternoon , the Yorktown was again attacked , by a follow-up Hiryu flight of ten B5N2 Kate torpedo bombers and six more Zeros . The bombers scored two torpedo hits , severely damaging the carrier . The Americans , however , struck the last blow of 4 June when Dauntlesses found the Hiryu and landed four bombs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early hours of that day , Admiral Yamamoto called off the Midway operation and began retreating westward . Spruance pursued , and on the 6th , SBDs sank the heavy cruiser Mikuma . The American commander , however , decided to retire rather than chase the Japanese , whom he knew still had a potent force . Already on her way back to Hawaii , the Yorktown was under tow on the 6th when she and the USS Hammann ( DD-412 ) were torpedoed by the Japanese submarine I-168 . The destroyer sank immediately , while the battered carrier went down the next day . <h> Sixty-five-year Retrospective <p> In the final analysis , the American victory at Midway was both brilliant and lucky . The Japanese made many mistakes . A major one was having a plan that violated many principles of war . The Japanese did not mass their forces against the primary objective , take into account U.S. capabilities , gain surprise , maintain proper security , keep their operational plan simple , apply the proper amount of force to do the job , or maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even cocky . Every one of the Imperial Japanese Navy veterans that this author talked toincluding Masataka Chihaya , Mitsuo Fuchida , and Minoru Gendarepeated in interview after interview that they thought they were unbeatable and had what they termed " victory disease . " <p> Fate played a large role in the battle . Two leading Japanese officersGenda , Admiral Nagumo 's air officer , and Fuchida , the leader of Akagi ' s air groupwhile present were physically incapacitated and did not actively take part in the battle . Their participation may have made a difference . Also , had the Navy not broken the JN-25 code and learned that AF was Midway , the U.S. task forces may have been out of position on 4 June . The timing of the U.S. carrier-plane attack on the morning of 4 June and the fact that the Enterprise ' s dive bombers , when at their maximum range , had found the enemy carriers by following a Japanese destroyer were lucky breaks . One of the Americans ' other breaks may have been that Admiral Halsey was replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier task-force leader but who became a hero of the battle . <p> Finally , as my mentor Gordon W. Prange told me , one must consider the intangibles . What might have happened had the Japanese destroyed the three U.S. carriers and won at Midway is very debatable and open to speculation , but Australia and perhaps Hawaii would have been the next Japanese targets . With virtually all of the Pacific Fleet 's aerial striking power out of the picture , there would have been little to stop Japan . It would have been open season on U.S. forces , and the Japanese would have been in total command of the Pacific , including possibly the waters around the U.S. West Coast . Fortunately , this did not happen . <p> Captain Edwin T. Layton , an excellent intelligence officer and authority on Pearl Harbor , pointed out to Prange that " at Midway the Japanese lost or left behind a naval air force that had been the terror of the Pacifican elite force , an overwhelming force that would never again come back and spread destruction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war .

But the fleet never got past Fort Darling , situated on Drewry 's Bluff , some eight miles below the Rebel capital . Confederate artillerists and sharpshooters unleashed a barrage of shot , shell , and lead , compelling the Galena and her support vessels to withdraw . <p> The Galena had taken the worst of it . After Lincoln and his entourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the assembled crew and remarked , " I can not understand how any of you escaped alive . " He then delivered a short speech , thanking the officers and men " for their magnificent service . " 1 <h> ' The Young Heroes ' <p> Three crew members were singled out for special recognition . The captain of the Galena , Commander John Rodgers Jr. , called on them to step forward : Marine Corporal John F. Mackie , Quartermaster Jeremiah Regan , and First-class Fireman Charles Kenyon . " Mr. President , " Rodgers announced , " these are the young heroes of the Fort Darling battle . " <p> Lincoln approached each of them , shook hands , and thanked them " for their gallant conduct . " He then turned to Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and ordered that the men receive a promotion and the Medal of Honor . 2 <p> Little did those on deck realize that this was a singular moment . It was the first and only time that a President of the United States ( rather than an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For John Mackie it was a double distinction ; not only did he receive the medal at the behest of the commander-in-chief , but he was also the first U.S. Marine to be so honored . <p> Yet there was more than a twist of tragic irony to the event . The Battle of Drewry 's Bluff , as it became known , where Mackie demonstrated bravery well beyond the call of duty , was the only engagement in the history of the Corps where U.S. Marines and former Marines met in direct combat . <p> Of course , it was only a matter of time until such a clash would unfold . Once the states of the deep and upper South left the Union during the secession crisis of 1860-61 , like the other military services , the U.S. Marine Corps suffered its share of defections . In sheer numbers , however , the resignations were few compared to the Army and Navy , if for no other reason than the Corps itself was the smallest branch of the U.S. military . Its prewar strength was around 1,800 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army and 20 percent of the Navy . 3 <h> Confederate Marine Corps <p> Despite its slim numbers , the Corps was hit hard . While few enlisted men quit , this was not the case in terms of officer defections , especially on the junior level . For whatever reason , the states of the upper South were a primary source of Marine officers , and once the states severed bonds with the Union , most of their native sons followed suit . Nearly one-third ( 20 of 63 ) of its officers left . Of those , 19 served as the principal architects and leaders of the newly created Confederate States Marine Corps . <p> The Corps lost some of its most promising and brightest officers , many from Virginia . First Lieutenant Israel Greene was perhaps the best known at the time because he had led the Marines who subdued John Brown and his followers in 1859 at Harpers Ferry . Another son of the Old Dominion , Captain George H. Terrett , had distinguished himself at the battle of Chapultepec in the Mexican War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant John D. Simms , who , along with First Lieutenant Julius E. Meiere of Maryland , would see action at the Battle of Drewry 's Bluff . 4 <p> Defections notwithstanding , the role Marines played in the Civil War would be the same as it had been since the creation of the Corps in 1798 . Unlike 20th- and 21st-century Leathernecks , who would serve ( and continue to serve ) on extended expeditionary missions or as amphibious strike forces , 19th-century Marines functioned primarily as an arm of the Navy . Whether it be ashore or afloat , Marines performed a variety of tasks , such as guarding shipyards , enforcing shipboard discipline , serving on deck as sharpshooters , repelling boarders , manning guns on ships , and occasionally joining landing parties for brief operations ashore . 5 In fact , if Union commanders had recognized the tactical import of this last role , the outcome at Drewry 's Bluff might have been different . <p> There were indeed a number of " might-have-beens " regarding Union operations in the spring of 1862 . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of a 100,000-man army on the Virginia Peninsula between the York and James Rivers , had not spent most of April in an unnecessary siege at Yorktown , but instead chose to conduct a rapid 70-mile march up the peninsula , he might have taken Richmond . The delay allowed Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston to move his forces into position to oppose a Union advance . 6 <p> After finally taking Yorktown on 4 May , McClellan , nicknamed the " Virginia Creeper " for his geophysical pace , inched slowly toward Richmond . As Confederate troops withdrew to protect their capital , the Rebel-held Norfolk Navy Yard had to be abandoned . Retreating Southerners blew up or set fire to everything of military value , including the famous ( or in Union eyes , the infamous ) CSS Virginia , which had engaged the USS Monitor in the historic battle of ironclads at Hampton Roads , Virginia , two months before . Without a supply base for the ship and unable to lighten her draft to get up the James River to help defend Richmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than allow her to fall into enemy hands . On the morning of 11 May , after the crew removed the Virginia ' s guns , they set her on fire , a blaze that eventually reached the magazine and blew the ironclad to bits . 7 <h> Up the River <p> The Union Navy then swung into action . With the Virginia ' s destruction , the James River was left virtually defenseless . Given the problems McClellan was encountering ( or creating for himself ) on land , why not attack Richmond by water ? That was precisely what Secretary of the Navy Welles had in mind when he telegraphed Flag Officer Louis R. Goldsborough to send a Union squadron up the James straight to the Rebel capital . 8 <p> The squadron was composed of five ships , led by the Galena . Named in honor of then-Major General Ulysses S. Grant 's hometown in Illinois , the Galena was armed with six guns , her sides protected by horizontally laid interlocking iron plating some three inches thick . Her captain , Commander Rodgers , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families in American naval history , was in charge of the task force , which included two other ironclads , the Monitor and Naugatuck , and two wooden gunboats , the Port Royal and Aroostook . 9 <p> With Rodgers in command , the Monitor as part of the flotilla , and the Virginia no longer a threat , victory , it seemed , was within the Union 's grasp . So thought U.S. Marine First Lieutenant William H. Cartter . Writing to his mother from Hampton Roads on 11 May , Cartter predicted , " Richmond will be ours " within the next day or so . " The game is nearly up with them . I am in hopes that we shall start for home soon . . . . " 10 <p> A bit more guarded in his optimism , Flag Officer Goldsborough nevertheless was also of the opinion that Rodgers and his squadron would have an easy time of it . Despite reports that the Rebels were placing obstructions in the river , since they were put down " very hurriedly , " Goldsborough was convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . in clearing a passageway . " 11 <h> Rebel Capital in Danger <p> Richmond was in a state of panic . Though Confederate President Jefferson Davis , with military adviser General Robert E. Lee at his side , told his cabinet that Richmond would be held at all cost , plans were under way for evacuation . The Confederate treasury 's gold supply was packed and ready for shipment on board a waiting train , while the government had already sent its records to Columbia , South Carolina . 12 <p> But all was not yet lost . The Rebels were planning a last ditch stand at a site on the James RiverDrewry 's Bluff . Additional artillery , reinforcements , and river obstructions were being put into place there to challenge the Union flotilla and prevent it from steaming up the James and shelling Richmond . <p> As things turned out , the Confederates could not have chosen a better defensive position . The bluff , named after its wealthy owner , Captain Augustus H. Drewry , was about 100 feet above the water on a sharp bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunners had an unobstructed line of fire for more than a mile in both directions . A local artillery company under the command of Captain Drewry originally had manned the bluff ( officially known as Fort Darling ) .

" 13 <p> General Lee dispatched several infantry units , a company of sappers and miners , and a battalion of artillery , led by former U.S. Marine Colonel Robert Tansill , who oversaw the emplacement of three additional heavy guns . At the same time , the crew of the Virginia ( elated that they would have another opportunity to do battle with their nemesis , the Monitor ) had arrived in the area . The men would man the cannon on the opposite side of the James ( the north bank ) known as Chaffin 's Bluff , a mile and a half from Drewry 's Bluff .

One of his company commanders , First Lieutenant Julius E. Meiere , was also a former U.S. Marine officer , whose wedding President Lincoln and Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois had attended . Despite a promising career , Meiere , who had married a Southern belle , left the Corps and offered his services to the Confederacy. 15 <p> With anywhere between 8 to 14 guns in place ( the number is in dispute ) and more than 200 Confederate Marines in rifle pits on both sides of the river , the Rebels were hopeful that the Union task force could be stopped . And if all else failed , the obstructions placed in the riverpilings , cribs of stone , and sunken canal boats and steamers ( including the scuttled gunboat Jamestown ) placed just below the bluff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 16 <p> Undaunted , the Union flotilla steamed up the James . Its commander , John Rodgers , planned to unleash the firepower of his flagship , the Galena , against the Confederate defenders , while the rest of the expedition slipped by and headed for the wharves of Richmond . After all , only three weeks before , the Union Navy 's Rear Admiral David G. Farragut had implemented a similar strategy on the lower Mississippi against Rebel batteries defending New Orleans , and it had proved successful . Rodgers , however , was destined to be disappointedbut not for lack of trying . <h> Maneuvering the Flotilla <p> At around 0630 on Thursday , 15 May , the Galena , followed by the Monitor , Aroostook , Port Royal , and Naugatuck , came within view of the Confederate defense works at Drewry 's Bluff . As planned , Rodgers ran the Galena within 600 yards of the enemy position , and , despite the narrowness of the channel ( it was no more than twice as wide as the ship itself ) , he was able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and bring her guns to bear on the Rebel artillery emplacements . <p> Though impressed with Rodgers ' nautical skills ( one Confederate onlooker later wrote that " it was one of the most masterly pieces of seamanship of the whole war " ) , the Southerners lost no time in firing the first rounds . The Galena responded in kind , and the fate of Richmond , less than eight miles away , with its windows rattling from the roar of the cannon , stood in the balance . 17 <p> For the next several hours , the Confederate Marines and other Rebel riflemen on both banks of the river sniped at the Union crewmen whenever they showed themselves on deck ( or even below when exposed through gun ports ) , while the artillery gunners on the bluff unleashed a barrage of shot and shell , much of it targeting the Galena . Other ships in the Union task force that attempted to come to her aid were quickly eliminated from the action . The Naugatuck ' s main gun malfunctioned , compelling the vessel to withdraw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Royal and Aroostook , forcing them to retreat downstream as well . At one point in the battle the Monitor passed above the Galena , hoping to shield her and at the same time shell the Rebel positions . But her guns could not be elevated enough to reach the top of the bluff . Like the others , the Monitor had no choice but to drop back . <p> The Galena , however , refused to back down and made a fight of it , hammering the enemy 's gun emplacements with explosive shells , and silencing at least two of them . Nevertheless , it was only a matter of time before the ship 's Achilles ' heel became apparent . Unlike the Monitor ' s thick iron sheathing , which was able to repel the Confederate shot , the armor plating affixed to the Galena proved too thin to protect her from the merciless hail of fire . 18 <h> A ' Perfect Slaughterhouse ' <p> In his postbattle report , Commander Rodgers noted with considerable understatement that the Galena was " not shot proof : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own iron . " The ship 's assistant surgeon described the scene as " a perfect slaughterhouse . " The Rebels " poured into our sides a shower of solid shot and rifled shell , many of which came through our mail armor as if it had been paper , scattering our brave fellows like chaff. " 19 <p> With nearly a quarter of her crew wounded or killed , the Galena stubbornly held her position , in part thanks to her 14-man Marine detachment . Throughout the battle , the ship 's Marines were firing their muskets from the deck and through gun ports at their Confederate counterparts on shore . Return fire from the Rebel Marines must have been intense . When a port cover on the Galena jammed and a Yankee Sailor exposed his arm to shake it loose , a burst of rifle shots from the bushes rang out , and the arm dropped into the water . 20 <p> Then came " the decisive moment of the action , " as a Marine on the Galena later put it . Three rounds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of which passed " completely through her thin armor.

" 23 <p> Mackie and his fellow Marines manned the guns until word was passed that the ammunition was nearly expended . Around 1130 , after almost four hours of continuous combat , Commander Rodgers ordered a halt to the action and a withdrawal . <p> Richmond breathed a sigh of relief . True , the Rebel capital was not out of the woods yet .

History offers options . <p> Want to give China an ulcer , a nagging sore that compels Beijing to think twice about aggression ? Then look at the map . Geography affords the U.S.-Japan alliance abundant opportunities to make trouble for the Peoples Liberation Army ( PLA ) , denying Chinas military access to the vast maneuver space of the Western Pacific while hampering its movements up and down the Asian seaboard . Fortifying the offshore island chain while deploying naval assets in adjoining waters could yield major strategic gains on the cheap . Doing so is common sense . The only question is how . <p> One imagines the greats of strategy would agree . Sage Carl von Clausewitz instructs statesmen and commanders to size up the " strength and situation " of each competitor before embroiling themselves in power politics . Net assessment is basic for him . Savvy competitors turn their physical surroundings to advantage , harnessing geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predictable pathways where attackers can be met and overpowered . At sea , imaginative use of islands and passages can balk an adversarys strategy if that strategy depends on free movement through nearby waters . Terrain , then , can offset an opponents advantages in numbers of ships , aircraft , or manpower . Used deftly , it can produce a margin of superiority at places where it matters most . <p> And that 's the crux of things , is n't it ? For Clausewitz there 's no higher or simpler law than to make oneself strong at the decisive place and time . Doing sodisplaying imposing capabilities while telegraphing the resolve to use themimproves the prospects for deterring opponents , and thus for preserving peace . Its high time for the U.S.-Japan alliance to heed the wisdom of this long-dead Prussian in the strategic competition with China . Islands bristling with antiship and antiair weaponry can cast a long shadow over sea passages , making themselves strongpoints in an offshore barricade while creating overlapping fields of fire . Mines , submarines , and fleet-footed surface craft dispersed around the islands can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , these are low-cost measures that compel China to mount countermeasures at high cost to itself , and with doubtful efficacy . The value a combatant assigns its goals usually governs how many resources it puts into a martial endeavor , and for how long . The more valuable a political aim , the more lives , treasure , and weaponry it expends on behalf of that aim . But as Clausewitz notes , warring states have been known to limit an effort not by ends but by means . He terms this " war by contingent . " That is , a government caps the amount of resources its willing to spend on an enterprise ahead of time . It then looks for ways to wring maximum bang out of this predetermined number of bucks . Ingenuity and operational dexterity are at a premium as the contingent searches out ways to create outsized problems for and impose outsized costs on the adversary . <p> Asias " first island chain , " to borrow the ubiquitous Chinese phrase , encloses the East Asian coastline . It arcs southward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan , and the Philippine archipelago . Each annual Pentagon report on Chinese military power , moreover , includes a map that traces the island chain from the Philippines westward to central Vietnam . Interpreted thus , and sealed off by the occupants of the islands , the chain would present a formidable barrier to exit from or entry into the China Seas . This is an ideal opportunity for mischief-making at the PLA Navys expense . Contingents scattered on and around the islands and straits comprising the first island chain could give Beijing a bad day should things turn grim over the Senkaku Islands , Taiwan , or some other geopolitical controversy . <h> Variations on a Defensive Theme <p> Let 's consider how defenders can put geographic features to optimal use . Waging war by contingent along the island chain poses a problem of perimeter defense . Protecting a long , distended perimeter is hard . Think back to freshman calculus . A line is made up of infinitely many points . Now transpose that insight to a defense line . Trying to defend a perimeter means trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armed forcesleast of all those waging war by contingentsport the manpower or assets to pull off such a feat . If they make the attempt , they risk thinning themselves into irrelevance . An antagonist will simply mass superior force somewhere along the line and punch through . <p> Vice Admiral Yoji Koda , a former commander of Japans Self-Defense Fleet , deprecates the value of forward defense perimeters in the crowded confines of Asia . For China to view the first island chain , including Japan , as an outer defense line has " no significance . " This , he writes , would be like Tokyos fixing its defense perimeter at the Great Wall . That 's strategic gibberish . No nation can defend itself forward into anothers territory . But from an operational standpoint , the narrow seas piercing the island barrier are of enormous consequence for the power boasting the military capacity to control them . <p> Imperial Japan sketched an outer defensive perimeter , enclosing most of the Western Pacific , during World War II . Admiral Koda notes ruefully that the Japanese defense line barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this stands in stark contrast to the first island chain , a short , relatively defensible line along closely grouped islands . Even Koda , an avowed island-chain skeptic , concedes that the U.S.-Japan alliance can turn maritime terrain to advantage in its competition with China . <p> The question now is , how should the allies tap the strategic potential of the islands ? What sea areas do they want to manage , where should they station contingents for maximum effect , and what forces should constitute these contingents ? Surveying history reveals three basic outlooks on how to use walls and other defense perimeters : <p> A weaker defender worried about safeguarding territory behind a frontier may construct a defense line to slow down enemy forces and compress them into well-defined lanes where lesser forces can stymie or defeat them . The assumption is that a stronger enemy will get through . <p> Defenders can attempt to create a rigid , impenetrable shield against enemy passage . Stopping an advance in its tracks is the goal . <p> Or they can use a defense perimeter as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The barrier furnishes a backstop for offensive actions . Its commonplace to view a barrier as a passive thing behind which defenders shelter . It may be anything but . The value of a defensive barrier derives not just from stout construction but from the balance of strength between the contending sides . <p> Let 's take these general ideas in turn . The first model might be dubbed the Great Wall model . In The Great Wall of China : From History to Myth , University of Pennsylvania professor Arthur Waldron debunks traditional claims that Chinas Great Wall dates from remote antiquity . Rather , he writes , it was the Ming Dynasty ( 13681644 ) that consolidated and improved preexisting works into a formidable barrier against armed raids and incursions from the north . <p> Despite the Great Walls imposing appearance , however , it is an artifact not of Ming strength but of Ming weakness . Its purpose was less to stop all breaches than to confine and delay attackersgiving mobile striking forces stationed behind the wall time to amass superior might at embattled points . Strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as walls . Decaying or temporarily outmatched powers may . <h> Line in the Sand , Line on the Sea ? <p> The impenetrable line is the second type of perimeter defense . History has witnessed any number of attempts to stage such defenses . Of them , Frances Morice Line , erected to seal the border between Algeria and Tunisia during the French-Algerian War ( 19541962 ) , ranks among the most successful . It combined electrified fortifications with electronic detection devices and minefields , putting in place a truly forbidding barrier . Indeed , Algerian nationalist forces threw themselves against the Morice Line to little avail . It approached perfection as perimeter defenses go , relative to the opponent . <p> Though built to inhibit enemy movements on land , the Morice Linean elaborate array of defensive works built to hold a line in the sandshows that defense perimeters may be feasible at sea given sufficient resources , high technology , and political resolve . If armies can mount a perimeter defense in the desert , maritime forces may be able to do so in Asias near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , the near seas represent a geographically cluttered operational setting featuring natural guard towers and narrow defilesislands and straits , in other words . Such a setting could let the islands defenders cordon off the China Seas . They could block PLA Navy egress from these waters . Or , they could keep ships plying the Pacific or Indian oceans before the outbreak of war from returning to home waters . Either way , a nautical Morice Line could pay off handsomely , especially considering the modest investment it would demand . <p> We might call the third type the Hadrians Wall model . Roman forces overran most of Britain two millennia ago but elected to fence off present-day Scotland rather than try to complete their conquest of the island . Stretching from east to west across the narrow neck of northern Britain , Hadrians Wall supplied a backstop against serious enemy efforts at a breach . Yet it was largely a staging place for offensive operations . <p> This was a wall-building strategy of the strong , as strategist Edward Luttwak recounts in The Grand Strategy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating a buffer to inhibit encroachment toward the defense line . Wall-building is intrinsically defensive in nature , then , but the Romans gave it an offensive twist . Forward defense denied adversaries the luxury of acting with impunityeven on their own home ground . <p> A Hadrians Wall approach to maritime defensea highly active , offensive-minded defensewould attempt to deny the PLA access to its own home waters . It would turn the logic of access denialthe approach China has taken against the U.S. Navy and Air Force on the macro levelagainst China on the micro level . Deterrence might prevail . Failing that , the allies will have positioned themselves for success should Beijing opt for a trial of arms . <p> Granted , these analogies all come from land warfare . And indeed , as Alfred Thayer Mahan points out , the open ocean is like a featureless plain . Its hard to string a picket line across such emptiness . As Admiral Koda observes , Imperial Japans outer defense perimeter proved unenforceable with the resources Japans navy had to deploy . Near shore , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's doubly true in East Asia , with its complex strategic geography . In Naval Strategy , his last major work , Mahan spilled a vat of ink showing that marine warfare resembles land warfare in coastal zones . Perimeter defense can work under special **26;151;TOOLONG such as those prevailing in maritime East Asia . <p> Perimeter defense , then , comes in multiple varieties . A Great Wall defense would be oriented more toward the Western Pacific , with a view toward safeguarding those waters for allied fleets and air forces . Preserving that maneuver space would let forces surge to points of impact , moving around behind the island chain . A Morice Line strategy would concentrate mainly on holding the line along the island chain . And a Hadrians Wall strategy would look inward toward continental Asia , both to stage a forward defense of the islands and straits and to interdict north-south movement through the China Seas . <h> Actionable Perimeter Defense <p> Which model should the allies embrace ?

Or does some hybrid approach hold the greatest promise ? If war by contingentagain , war waged by the means allotted rather than the ends being soughtis the answer , then the questions revolve less around politics and grand strategy than around doctrine and force structure . Those questions include : <p> What Are the Limits of the Possible ?

In other words , how robust and numerous can contingents fielded along the Ryukyus be ? And how many heavy forcessurface combatants , nuclear-powered attack boats , and so forthcan the allies allocate to back up these defenders ? <p> How Much Pushback Is Likely ? What is the local balance of forces between China and the U.S.-Japan alliance , factoring in commitments in other theaters that could siphon off American or Chinese resources ? If the allies deem themselves to hold a strong position , a more aggressive perimeter strategy may be preferable . If a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their best if not only recourse . <p> Can Advantages Be Extended and Disadvantages Overcome ? What are the trend lines in the maritime balance ? Can the allies flatten out or reverse unfavorable trends while widening favorable ones ? <p> How Fast Can the Allies Improve ? If so , how quickly can any shortfalls in force structure and island-chain defense doctrine be remedied , given political and budgetary realities in allied capitals ? Can the allies move from a more passive to a more active defense ? Or will unfavorable trends in the military balance , whether through technological change or sheer weight of numbers on the PLA side , compel them to retrench ? <p> While war by contingent inverts the usual supremacy of ends over ways and means , however , there is no escaping diplomatic and grand-strategic factors . Here are some big-think matters Washington and Tokyo might ponder as they weigh which stance to take : <p> Will Allied Unity Hold ? The two countries should ask themselves to what degree they will remain united behind their political and strategic aims .

He was third lieutenant overseeing a gun division in the frigate Constellation , which successfully battled the French during the Quasi-War . Promoted to first lieutenant and command of the 12-gun Enterprise , he led that schooner to the Mediterranean in 1801 . There , off Malta in the Barbary Wars first encounter , the 23-year-old Sterett routed a better-armed Tripolitan corsair without losing a single man . President Thomas Jefferson wrote to him conveying Americas high esteem and asserting that " the enemy can not meet bravery and skill united .

Ten days later , Sterett replied that it was not compatible with correct principles of honor to serve under Decatur , and submitted his resignation . The secretary regretfully accepted , and observed that Steretts " high reputation . . . and distinguished energy of character " probably would have raised him " to the highest honors in the Navy . " 3 Cutting short a bright and promising naval career , Sterett thereupon entered the merchant service , and eventually , attained captaincy of the Warren . <h> Ex-Navy : Like Captain , Like Ship <p> The 396-ton , three-masted Warren , with copper sheathing and a carved figurehead , had been built in 1799 as a Navy sloop-of-war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of three merchant firms , " men of the highest commercial standing in Baltimore " with big plans for their acquisition .

He also was older brother to Navy Secretary Robert Smith . <p> The Warren s principal owner was Lemuel Taylor , a merchant who had been active in Baltimore maritime affairs for at least ten years . Taylors ships traded in a world at war , and he lost vessels to English , French , and Spanish privateers . Earlier in 1806 he had joined other local merchants and traders , signing a lengthy memorial to President Jefferson and Congress protesting Britains " Essex Decision , " which had legalized expanded attacks on American shipping . Taylor was appointed by the other Warren owners to act for them as the ships managing owner , or " husband . " To him fell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global-trade vision . Their plan , as generally understood , would send the Warren first to the Pacific Northwest to trade its cargo with the Indians for furs , and then to bargain those furs at Canton , China , for exotic commodities ( tea , porcelain , etc. ) to bring home . Potentially the exchange of goods at each successive market ( NorthwestOrientBaltimore ) could compound profits and bring the investors an enormous return . <p> The Warren had been purchased as ready to " put to sea at small expense . " 4 Still , about two months of activity was required before she could weigh anchor . So Taylor , the " husband , " and Andrew Sterett , employed by him as shipmaster , labored together to prepare the ship for her projected 18-month cruise . <p> Sterett apparently advised Taylor in hiring the Warren s officers .

The Coffee-House , supplied with letter bags for departing ships and stocked with useful periodicals , was the local source for maritime news and business gatherings , sought out by merchants and sea captains alike . The proprietor cultivated his patrons for information and communicated directly with correspondents in Europe . He published the Baltimore Weekly Price-Current ( quoted by area newspapers and reprinted all over the country ) , which included within its pages a comprehensive tally of Americas ships at sea . <p> A waterfront visitor observing the Warren and aware of her owners influence might wonder whether a military operation was being planned : Captain Sterett hired a gunner , a gunners mate , and an armorer , as well as a drummer and a fifer for the crew . The Aurora , a Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew is fitting out in Baltimore for an expedition " and surmised that it was destined for the West Indies with military stores to aid the rebellions of either Francisco de Miranda in Venezuela or Toussaint LOuverture in Haiti .

Pollock was 35 years old , a native of Spanish New Orleans , and the oldest son of a major financier of the American Revolution , Oliver Pollock . The elder Pollock had been the United States commercial agent in New Orleans during the Revolution , and had raised Procopio among Spanish Louisianas merchant elite . Though residing in Pennsylvania by 1796 , Procopio remained interested in Spains American colonies and even sought an official introduction to the governor of Havana . 7 In March 1797 , President George Washington appointed him as consul general to the port of New Orleans , but young Pollock probably never took office and resigned nonetheless in May 1799 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveled twice to Veracruz , Mexico , while employed as Baltimore merchant Robert Olivers supercargo .

" He replaced him in April 1806 . After his dismissal , Pollock returned to Baltimore , where his father resided , and was hired by Taylor as the Warren s supercargo . Olivers opinion of Pollock was not solicited by Taylor , but privately he " regretted exceedingly having anything to do with him . " 8 Pollock was described as " shrewd , " extremely guarded , and capable of the most refined deception , and he was " well-acquainted with the Spanish character and language . " 9 <p> The owners relied heavily on Captain Sterett and supercargo Pollock for the success of the voyage .

The men gladly came prepared with warm clothing for the extreme climes they would encounter . At the Custom House on Saturday , 6 September 1806 , Taylor completed the Warren s registry and obtained her clearance certificate . The big ship was about to sail . The latest Price-Current warned of destructive weather in the Atlantic , and reported on the damaged ships returning home . <p> Lastly , Taylor drew up the owners customary " Letter of Instructions " binding orders to guide the captain at sea , with directions and advice on financial contacts , markets and destinations , and the permissible discretion allowed .

" 10 No sooner had she stood down the Patapsco River , rounded the new observatory at Bodkin Point , and entered Chesapeake Bay , than skeptics back in town again questioned the advertised purpose of the journey . A concerned Spanish consul in Baltimore , Juan Bautista Bernabeu , wrote to the viceroy in Lima , Peru , warning that the ship was fitted out to conduct illicit commerce on South Americas Pacific Coasta colonial trade notoriously forbidden by Spanish law .

In October a sea-captain arrived in Baltimore from Bremen and reported at the Coffee-House that on 22 September he had spoken the Warren in the North Atlantic . He specified a location corresponding roughly to the latitude of the Capes of Virginia ( at the mouth of the Chesapeake ) , but at a longitude pushing toward mid-ocean . Sterett was apparently sailing " the old conventional track south , crossing the Atlantic eastward to the Cape Verde Islands to pick up trade winds that would carry the Warren toward Brazil . . . . " 13 <p> For several months no more was heard in Baltimore of the Warren s progress . But on 15 December , a ship-to-ship contact occurred that eventually would be relayed back to the Coffee-House .

One of the seamen , " a mere youth " named Peter Roe , was on the quarterdeck , immediately over the captains cabin . Peter heard a great disturbance below : a quarrel pitting Captain Sterett and the officers against Procopio Pollock . Roe listened to the officers protest that Pollock wanted to change the voyage . The supercargo produced a sealed Letter of Instructions from Lemuel Taylor . He broke it open and showed it to the officers . The instructionsradically different from those given to Sterettordered Pollock to take exclusive control of the voyage ( upon reaching a specified latitude ) and directed that instead of going to the Northwest Coast , the Warren was to engage in smuggling along the coast of Chile . The captains body servant ( and second cook ) , Murray Gibson , also was present at the encounter . He remembered that when shown the letter by Pollock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would serve under any such orders ; before he would do so , he would either blow out the supercargos brains , or his own . " 14 <p> Word spread , quickly sending the ship into an uproar . According to Roe , the tension continued over several days , and Captain Sterett showed that his mind was " deranged " but then , at intervals , he would seem in control of his senses . Pollocks sealed instructionsnegating Steretts ownalso effectively revoked the Shipping Articles the crew had signed and placed them in danger of capture by Spanish authorities in Chile . A few days after being shown the instructions , Sterettduring one of his unstable periodsattempted to shoot Pollock , but without success . <p> The captains disturbed state continued into another week , and the officers decided to take his pistols . Young Roe would sit up at night with Sterett , who frequently complained that he had " been taken in by the owners . " The Warren continued to sail southward . And then Steretts demeanor appeared to improve ; he seemed to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Captain Sterett shaved and dressed as if he were going ashore . At his request Gibson brought him his writing desk . Sterett wrote a letter , sealed it , locked it in his desk , and gave the key to Gibson .

Then he retired to his cabin and locked the door . <p> Two hours later , he put a pistol to his head and pulled the trigger . Gibson , who was in steerage , heard the guns report and ran to Steretts room . He found the captain lying on a trunk with the pistol in his hand , still pointed to his head . The ball had entered one temple and passed through and exited the opposite eye . Remarkably , Andrew Sterett lived for another 13 or 14 days " in great pain .

First Mate Samuel Evans was selected . But the Warren s troubles were not over . Under Pollocks direction , the new captain steered the Warren around Cape Horn to the Chilean coast and arrived at Concepci=n Bay on 19 January . Despite the crews objections , the supercargo ordered the ship to enter the bay , and the next day they landed at Talcahuano . Pollock went ashore and , after preliminaries , soon lodged at the commandants house . The crew was taken captive and imprisoned within a Spanish fort . Pollock arranged with the governor of Concepci=n to smuggle most of the cargo . It was unloaded from the Warren and stored in a warehouse to which only Pollock and the Spanish authorities had keys . The cargosilks , lace , and other fineryobviously was not intended for the Pacific Northwest Indians , but would bring a fine price in Chile .

Ultimately they were sent to a cell at Guayaquil , Equador , and confined under wretched conditions . Some were released after a few months , and some remained captive there for nearly four years . Treated poorly , still others became sick and died at Guayaquil . <p> Slowly groups of survivors made their way back to the United States . The first 14 arrivals reported Steretts death after landing in Newport , Rhode Island , on 11 February 1808 .

Thrasher , an American citizen , was drowned ; the attack on April 28 on the American vessel Cushing by a German aeroplane ; the torpedoing on May 1 of the American vessel Gulflight by a German submarine , as a result of which two or more American citizens met their death ; and , finally , the torpedoing and sinking of the steamship Lusitania , constitute a series of events which the Government of the United States has observed with growing concern , distress and amazement . <p> Recalling the humane and enlightened attitude hitherto assumed by the Imperial German Government in matters of international right and particularly with regard to the freedom of the seas ; having learned to recognize the German views and the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the side of justice and humanity ; and having understood the instructions of the Imperial German Government to its naval commanders to be upon the same plane of humane action prescribed by the naval codes of other nations , the Government of the United States was loath to believe " it can not now bring itself to believe " that these acts , so absolutely contrary to the rules , the practices , and the spirit of modern warfare , could have the countenance or sanction of that great government . <p> It feels it to be its duty , therefore , to address the Imperial German Government concerning them with the utmost frankness and in the earnest hope that it is not mistaken in expecting action on the part of the Imperial German Government which will correct the unfortunate Impressions which have been created and vindicate once more the position of that government with regard to the sacred freedom of the sea . <p> The Government of the United States has been apprised that the Imperial German Government considered themselves to be obligated by the extraordinary circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in seeking to cut Germany off from all commerce , to adopt methods of retaliation which go much beyond the ordinary methods of warfare at sea , in the proclamation of a war zone from which they have warned neutral ships to keep away . <p> This Government has already taken occasion to inform the Imperial German Government that it can not admit the adoption of such measures or such a warning of danger , to operate as in any degree an abbreviation of the rights of American shipmasters or of American citizens bound on lawful errands as passengers on merchant ships of belligerent nationality ; that it must hold the Imperial German Government to a strict accountability for any infringement of these rights , intentional or incidental . <p> It does not understand the Imperial German Government to question those rights .

The Government and people of the United States look to the Imperial German Government for just , prompt and enlightened action in this vital matter with the greater confidence because the United States and Germany are bound together not only by special ties of friendship but also by the explicit stipulations of the treaty of 1828 between the United States and the Kingdom of Prussia . <p> Expressions of regret and offers of reparation in case of the destruction of neutral ships sunk by mistake , while they may satisfy international obligations , if no loss of life results , can not justify or excuse a practice the natural and necessary effect of which is to subject neutral nations and neutral persons to new and immeasurable risks .

Driven by the thirst for knowledge , the lust for treasure , the bragging rights of discovery , or varying combinations of the above , many sought Captain William Kidd 's legendary lost ship , one of the holy grails of piratology . In 2007 , happenstance at last yielded the secret of the vessel 's resting placenot hidden down in the dark depths , but just 10 feet below the surface in crystal-clear Caribbean waters . <p> There , the remains of the Cara Merchant had lain undisturbed for more than three centuries . 1 Though her resting place is in shallow water , the site is deep in significance : It is the only pirate shipwreck ever discovered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americas to date . 2 To this find of profound historical importance the name " Indiana " will always be attachednot Indiana Jones , in this case , but Indiana University . <p> While a landlocked institution of higher learning ensconced in the heart of the Midwest might not automatically conjure the words " underwater archaeology , " Indiana University in fact has one of the nation 's oldest and largest programs in the field . For the past 12 years the intrepid diver-scholars of the school 's academic diving and underwater science programs have been conducting research with the cooperation of the Dominican Republic 's Oficina Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural Subacu a tico . So when a snorkeler reported spotting an array of barnacle-encrusted cannon a mere 70 feet off the shoreline of the Dominican Republic 's Isla Catalina , government officials naturally alerted the Indiana team . <p> The wreck 's location and the size and arrangement of the guns strongly suggested that there , indeed , was the grave of Captain Kidd 's ship . Charles Beeker , director of IU 's underwater archaeology programs , quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect it from looters . As a preemptive strike against wildfire word-of-mouth and the subsequent swarming of divers like blood-crazed sharks , the discovery was officially announced at a press conference in December 2007 , the site was declared temporarily off-limits , and the Dominican Republic licensed Beeker 's team to protect , preserve , and research the wreck . <p> As work progressed through 2008 , the " smoking gun " of positive identification revealed itself . After gingerly , painstakingly moving one of the cannon , archaeologists were pleasantly stunned to find the ship 's keel still extant beneath . Wood-analysis results in September 2008 explained why : The keel had survived because it was fashioned from decomposition-resistant teak . <p> The very fact it was teak was the key to the mystery ; this ship , clearly , was an absolute anomaly in Caribbean waters in the late 17th century . Quite simply , " Teak wood does not belong in the Caribbean in this time period , " Beeker said . <p> Teak was used in the shipyards of the western coast of India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean at the time . " Indian merchants were trading with England , but they were not in the Western Hemisphere , " said Fritz Hanselmann , IU director of field research . Such a ship would have seemed wildly exotic and utterly out of place heavingto off the Hispaniola coast in 1699which is exactly what Captain Kidd did . He and a bedraggled skeleton crew had crossed the Atlantic in a captured India-built craft , a 400-ton three-master with fanciful , swirling Eastern flourishes in the carving , a plunder-laden prize ship on the run from the combined might of the Royal Navy and the East India Company . <p> " It 's a rare instance in the historical record of a ship built in India having been in the Caribbean , " Hanselmann said . " If you couple the historical documentation that we 've studied with the archaeological record at the wreck site and the wood being teak , that allows us to fill in the pieces of the puzzle . " <p> William Kidd is pirate history 's Rorschach blot . His record affords bountiful arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlucky , a scapegoat ) and his detractors ( he committed murder , he crossed the privateer-pirate line ) . Somewhere between the rival schools of thought is the idea that someone can be a victim of circumstance and yet still have some degree of culpability . In the end , Kidd seems more worthy of pity than condemnation , whatever his transgressions . Beset below by an unreliable crew and above by fickle financial backers , he charted a narrow and treacherous course that led him , indignant to his dying breath , to Execution Dock , the Admiralty 's infamous hanging place along the Thames River . <p> Born around 1645 , he was a towering , broad-shouldered Scotsman , lusty and quick-tempered . The sea called him early , and by 1689 he was captain of the Blessed William , a Caribbean privateer . Kidd attached his ship to a Royal Navy squadron in the raid on the West Indies island of Marie-Galante ; a fierce sea-fight with French warships followed off St. Martin . Anchoring at St. Nevis afterward , he lost the Blessed William to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail for piracy . Kidd 's recent heroics , however , garnered him a French prize ship courtesy of the grateful governor of Nevis . Kidd headed for new horizons , docking in New York in 1691 . Marriage to a wealthy widow , life in a stately house , burgeoning business interests along the waterfront , and friends in influential circles all soon were his . But privateering remained in Kidd 's blood , and 1695 found him shipping out anew for high-seas profiteering . 3 <p> In London he managed to secure the backing of the newly nominated governor of Massachusetts , the Earl of Bellomont . A prominent Whig Parliamentarian , the earl soon brought a powerful quartet in on the scheme : Sir John Somers , the Duke of Shrewsbury , the Baron of Romney , and the Earl of Orfordlike Bellomont , influential Whigs one and all . But the most impressive subscriber to Kidd 's latest adventure was no less than King William III himself . With the king on board ( to the tune of a 10 percent cut of the spoils ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy , Kidd was auspiciously set . <p> But this would be a privateering expedition with a difference : In addition to legally raiding French shipping ( France and England then being at war ) , Kidd would hunt down and capture pirates currently bedeviling the Indian Ocean . He and his lordly syndicate then would divide up the pirates ' loot . In essence , it was stealing from thieves and then claiming the stolen goods as one 's own . Such slippery logistics would require a new Great Seal of England patent and the signature of the Lord Keeper of the Great Sealwho fortunately and conveniently was Somers , one of Kidd 's backers . 4 <p> Captain Kidd set off down the Thames with a handpicked crew in the 34-gun Adventure Galley in April 1696 . ( He had 70 men signed on thus far and still needed 80 more , whom he intended to recruit in New York . ) Passing a Royal Navy vessel on his way downriver , Kidd neglected to dip his colors , an important custom marking a privateer 's deference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolence ( perhaps borne of having such lofty backers ) earned him a cannonball soaring across the Adventure Galley 's bow . His crew responded by ratcheting up the level of disrespect : They turned and slapped their backsides at the navy vessel . 5 <p> Even before clearing the Thames , Captain Kidd had managed to incur the wrath of the Royal Navy . A press-gang boarded the Adventure Galley and made off with 20 of his best men . Furious , waving his official commission about , Kidd went ashore to protest . The navy did return him 20 mennot his 20 but instead a passel of irascible lowlifes and troublemakers . Off to a bad start , Kidd sailed to New York to round out his crew . The city was at the time a thriving nest of pirates , cutthroats , and sundry unsavory sailor types . Kidd managed to fill the Adventure Galley 's ranks , but it was the textbook motley crew , indeed " men of desperate fortunes , " as Governor Benjamin Fletcher described them when Kidd embarked from New York in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Madagascar , Madagascar to the Comoros Islandsthe Adventure Galley made her way to the hunting grounds by early 1697 . Tropical disease claimed the lives of 30 crewmen , and Kidd culled more recruits along the docks of his Indian Ocean ports of call . The new additions included numerous veterans of pirate crews . The voyage thus far had been a bust , and restless grumblings threatened from the forecastle . <p> Earnest for some plunder , any plunder , Kidd set his sights on the Red Sea and the rich prizes of the Muslim pilgrimage route . " Come boys , " the captain reportedly said , " I will make money enough out of that fleet . " 7 Kidd 's commission did not specify such action , and when he attacked a Mogul convoy on 14 August 1697 , Kidd was flying the crimson flag . It meant " Surrender . No Quarter " in essence , piracy . Edward Barlow , the English captain of the 36-gun Sceptre , one of three European ships protecting the convoy , fired warning shots and hoisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . While he had taken no prizes , he had demonstrated a willingness to exceed the parameters of his commission . <p> Kidd 's men grew surlier , his supplies grew shorter , and his desperation intensified to the point that he even bullied a trading ship flying English colors off Malabar . His men raped and pillaged on the Laccadive Islands . Bad word of mouth about Captain Kidd began to spread through the region , as his lean and hungry crew became more mutinous . The boiling point was reached on 30 October , when Kidd had angry words with a malcontent , William Moore , before smashing in the crewman 's head with a bucket . After Moore died the next day , an unremorseful and still angry Kidd declared he was n't afraid of any legal repercussions from the killing , for he had " good friends in England . " 8 <p> Fortune finally shone on the Adventure Galley on 30 January 1698 , with the capture of the Cara Merchant off the Malabar coast . Here was the ripe prize at last ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bounteous cargo of silks , sugar , opium , iron , saltpeter , gold , and silver . Kidd had fired a shot across her bow and raised French colorscamouflage for hunting French prey . The captain of the Cara Merchant , Englishman John Wright , tried a similar ruse himself to protect his vessel ; he too raised French colors and sent a French gunner in the guise of the ship 's captain with paperwork to parlay . <p> The Frenchman presented Kidd with a French safe-conduct paper . Once he had the pass in hand , Kidd had the verification he needed . This , to be sure , was a legitimate privateering capture , and a rich one at that . Only after claiming the prize did Kidd realize much of the cargo belonged to the East India Company , the ship 's true captain was English , and the French dodge had been merely a safety measure that backfired on the Cara Merchant . <p> But for the time being , Kidd 's restless crew had some plunder at last . Kidd made port , sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made for the pirate 's lair of Madagascar . Also anchored there was the pirate Robert Culliford 's ship , the Resolution . Culliford was the very knave who had stolen Kidd 's privateering vessel out from under him back in his Caribbean days . On a personal and professional level , now was the golden opportunity for Kidd to fulfill his pirate-hunting mandate . He had Culliford outgunned and outmannedor rather , he would have , if the bulk of the Adventure Galley 's crew had n't up and deserted on him , preferring the pure-pirate path that siding with Culliford represented . Rather than attempting to nab Culliford , Kidd instead found himself discussing terms with him in a strained atmosphere of false bonhomie and rum . <p> The Madagascar situation would come back to haunt Kidd . He would argue ( and his present-day defenders will echo ) that he was the victim of a mutinous and then deserting crew . His prosecutors would assert ( and his detractors still echo ) that , if he was supposed to be hunting pirates , why did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention letting him get away ? 9 <p> The Adventure Galley , meanwhile , was rotting and leaking ; rats of both the rodentoid and human variety were abandoning her in numbers . Captain Kidd left her now as well , making the Cara Merchant his main ship ( and renaming her the Adventure Prize ) . With little more than 20 crewmen left , he set sail for the West Indies , to sell more of the captured silks while wending his prize homeward . But when he arrived at Anguilla in April 1699 , Kidd learned the awful news : He was a wanted man . <p> The Cara Merchant , as luck would have it , had been leased out to Muklis Khan , a prominent member of the inner circle of Mogul Emperor Aurangzeb himself . Investors in the ship and her rich cargo were from the highest echelons ; the East India Company 's reputation and its ability to continue its lucrative enterprise were threatened by a single ship 's capture that had become an international incident . The Company was England 's mightiest economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone needed to hang for the Cara Merchant outrage . " Kidd , " noted historian Robert C. Ritchie , " never allowed for the relentless malevolence of the East India Company . " 10 <p> Prodded by the Company , the British government declared Kidd a pirate . The general alarm went out wherever the Royal Navy ensign flew . An all-out manhunt was on , and there would be no pardon for Kidd . It was distressing information to ascertain about oneself while standing at the bridge of a big , blatant , foreign-looking ship that was an inevitable attention-grabber . Kidd believed he was innocent , and he had the French pass to prove it . At the mouth of the Hig u ey River on the eastern end of the island of Hispaniola , he moored the Cara Merchant to trees on the riverbank . He acquired a sloop and raced to New York to clear his name . He did , after all , have influential friends . <p> That the aristocratic consortium backing Kidd dropped him like a hot potato is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Whigs had lost control of Parliament . The Tories saw a chance to embarrass their political foes , and those foes did n't want to stick their necks out for a hunted man . Offering himself up to set the record straight , Kidd was imprisoned , first in New York , then in England . By the time he finally came to trial , he was a reeking , slovenly wreck . The French pass , which clearly justified his taking of the Cara Merchant under his letter of marque , was conveniently misplaced . It did n't resurface until the early 20th century . 11 <p> The High Court of Admiralty found Kidd guilty of piracy and of the murder of William Moore . On 23 May 1701 , he was carted out to London 's Execution Dock along the mud-flats of Wapping . His hanging did n't go well ; the rope broke and his executioners had to hang him twice . Once he was dead , they tied him to a post until the high tide of the Thames had washed over him three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterlogged corpse of Captain Kidd was taken downriver to Tilbury Point , where the Thames meets the sea . After dipping the body in tar , they wrapped it in chains and put it in a cage that was hung from a gibbet . For many years , long after the tar wore off and the flesh decayed , he remained on morbid display , a warning to all contemplating piracy . The historian Ralph D. Paine offered a concise summation that could serve as Captain Kidd 's epitaph : " Thus lived and died a man , who , whatever may have been his faults , was unfairly dealt with by his patrons , misused by his rascally crew , and slandered by credulous posterity . " 12 <p> The search for the Cara Merchant began while Kidd was still languishing in prison . His erstwhile patron-turned-arrester , Lord Bellomont ( whom Kidd had cursed from the gallows ) , sent a ship to the West Indies to track down the prize . It was the first of many fruitless attempts down through the centuries . Kidd 's Caribbean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cargo hold , unmoored the vessel , and then torched and sank her . And there the Cara Merchant remained , in the shallows , undiscovered until 2007 . <p> Her elusiveness was one of the loose ends that fed the Captain Kidd myth over the years . " What happened to his ship ? " commingled with " What happened to his treasure ? " to spawn a body of pirate legendry that refused to die . Kidd had taken some of the loot with him on his last run to New York . No doubt much of it was dispersed as well among those who burned the Cara Merchant . <p> The Cara Merchant herself became one of pirate history 's famous lost ships , her mystique enhanced by the marquee value of her notorious household-name captain . Until recently , private treasure-hunting entities had been searching for her for years , sometimes only mere miles away from where she hid in plain sight . <p> In the end , fate turned the shipwreck 's secrets over to academics rather than treasure-seekers . And preliminary X-rays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic and of human origin ) indicate an abundance of artifacts , offering promising possibilities in the upcoming investigative seasons of 2009 . The 26 cannon are still for the most part neatly stacked in two piles as they had been by the ship 's crew . Anchor parts are also visible . And there is more wood to be sampled and studied ; it is possible that the ship construction will prove to have involved rabbeted joints ( a construction methodology somewhat akin to tongue-and-groove ) . If so , this will be the only 17th-century wreck found thus far featuring this type of jointing , thereby adding to the site 's uniqueness and importance , noted Beeker . <p> While research will continue through 2009 and beyond , Captain Kidd 's shipwreck will not be kept indefinitely off limits to the public . The plan is to open the site to visitation by December 2009 . Supervised and supported by the Dominican Republic 's government and boosted by a $200,000 award announced by the U.S. Agency for International Development in November 2008 , Indiana University will make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of historical and/or biological interest ) a " living museum , " where the policy will be one of " no anchor , no take .

There , in 10 feet of Caribbean blue , lie vestiges of Captain Kidd 's wild and infamous career . An archaeological discovery of such resonance is a magnet of great power . As Fritz Hanselmann observed , " Archaeology allows history to become tangible . " <p> " Everyone wants to know if there is treasure on Kidd 's ship , " said Charles Beeker , " but the true treasure is the ship itself , and the history it represents .

Archival research has identified Cara Merchant as the correct name . <p> 2 . The other two New World pirate shipwrecks thus far discovered are Edward " Blackbeard " Teach 's Queen Anne 's Revenge and Samuel Bellamy 's Whydah . <p> 11 . The suppression of the French pass , notes Charles Beeker , helps explain why the name of the prize ship , Cara Merchant , was wrongly referred to as Quedah Merchant , an erroneous name that cropped up in court references and has survived even up to the recent literature . <p> Mr. Mills is the author of Chesapeake Bay in the Civil War ( 1996 ) and Chesapeake Rumrunners of the Roaring Twenties ( 1999 ) , both published by Tidewater Publishers , and , forthcoming from the Naval Institute Press , The Spectral Tide : Great True Ghost Stories of the U.S. Navy . <h> More Finds from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the Cara Merchant , here are some other notable shipwreck discoveries since 2007 : <p> The Black Swan The Black Swan is the project code name that Odyssey Marine Exploration ( someone there must be a Rafael Sabatini fan ) has given to what may be a 17th-century wreck site discovered off the coast of Cornwall in early 2007 .

The ship has yet to be identified , but early speculation about the HMS Sussex has been refuted by Odyssey ; leading contenders seem to be the Merchant Royal and the Nuestra Senora de las Mercedes . Having yielded some $500 million worth of valuables so far , the site could be the richest sunken treasure ever found .

The result was one of the most devastating air strikes of the Korean War . <p> By any measure , the Kapsan raid was spectacular . U.S. Navy warplanes flew at tree-top level far into North Korea and then repeatedly pummeled a compound where military and political leaders had gathered . The daring 29 October 1951 " decapitation " strike killed more than 500 North Korean and Chinese communists . <p> Brief accounts of the mission have appeared over the subsequent years , and in 1958 the television show Navy Log featured the raid in an episode titled " The Butchers of Kapsan . " But almost all the versions have left out a key part of the story : Intelligence provided by a group of CIA-trained anticommunist guerrillas made the strike possible . <h> Grueling Tempo of Interdiction <p> February 1951 was a transition period for U.S. Navy Task Force 77 ( TF-77 ) , as its air operations shifted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea . The number of naval aviators flying missions at any one time was astonishingly smallfewer than 215 men piloting approximately 150 fighter and attack aircraft . Knowing the likely American targets , the enemy defended them with dense concentrations of antiaircraft artillery and took careful note of U.S. attack profiles , ingress and egress routes , and tactics . <p> The aviators faced a much different environment than during World War II . The tempo was brisk , and the duration of the Korean combat operations were completely open-ended , lasting for weeks or months at a time and putting massive stress on aircrews . In the opinion of many of the pilots who flew in both conflicts , Korean operations were more challenging and intense . <p> By the late summer of 1951 , TF-77 consisted of the USS Boxer ( CV-21 ) , with carrier air group ( CVG- ) 101 ; Bonhomme Richard ( CV-31 ) , with CVG-102 ; and USS Essex ( CV-9 ) , with CVG-5 . The carriers ' aircraft included early Navy jet fightersF9F Panthers and F2H Bansheesbut the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skyraiders and F4U Corsairs . These were killing machines , designed and built with one purpose . They did the carriers ' heavy ordnance lifting and delivered immense firepower . Flying at low altitudes to get accurate hits , the ADs and F4Us would make multiple passes per target , but they paid a high price in aviators and aircraft . <p> CVG-5 , which had served its first Korean tour in 1950 , deployed on the Essex with 75 aircraft for its second in mid-August 1951 . Between 23 August and 19 September , when the carrier was pulled off the line for a rest , the air group flew 1,826 sorties , mostly attacking bridges , railroads , trucks , tunnel openings , and buildings . The toll was high , with CVG-5 losing 15 aircraft . There were 78 instances of enemy ground fire damaging Essex planes . Moreover , seven aviators , one aircrewman , and four flight-deck personnel were killed . And the Essex deployment had four more line periods . The next one began on 4 October , and through 27 October , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat missions from aircraft carriers in 1951 was a dangerous business compounded by effective , dense , and mobile enemy air defenses , which included a relatively new threat : radar-guided antiaircraft guns . Advanced training by Soviet troops came along with the advanced weapons , and the North Koreans and Chinese communists were quickly becoming excellent gunners . With six to eight Navy strikes , as well as numerous U.S. Air Force strikes , per day , they were certainly getting lots of practice . <h> Fighting from Behind Enemy Lines <p> American pilots , however , unknowingly had an advantage : Central Intelligence Agencytrained Korean guerrillas were forwarding information from behind enemy lines about North Korean and Chinese targets . These members of the Young-do , or Y , Unit were trained and funded by the Joint Advisory Commission Korea ( JACK ) the not-so-subtle codename for the local CIA directorate . <p> In mid-1950 , JACK had tasked South Korean Army Captain Han Chul-min with organizing the guerrilla force to attack communist forces , divert enemy resources from front-line operations , recruit potential operatives , and gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . The group 's fighters , like Han , were anticommunists from North Korea . Their first training base was near a POW camp in Pusan . But in late February 1951 , the base was moved to Young-do , an island off Pusan , where the recruits ' instruction was supervised by a U.S. Marine lieutenant colonel assigned to JACK , Vincent " Dutch " Kramer . The Young-do Unit was divided into four operational groupsYellow Dragon , Blue Dragon , White Tiger , and Owleach of which operated in a specific area of North Korea . Teams of the guerrillas , often accompanied by U.S. military personnel assigned to JACK , infiltrated into the north via U.S. Navy ships and by parachuting from Civil Air Transport ( CAT ) planes . Created in China by former Flying Tigers commander Claire Chennault , CAT was a nominally commercial airline purchased by the CIA in 1950 . Three of its aircraft were assigned to support the Korean guerrilla operations . <p> On 25 August 1951 , a 31-man Young-do detachment parachuted down near Kapsan , in northeastern North Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the White Tiger headquarters company , some 30 Y Unit fighters already operating in the area . The united force quickly began operations against communist troops , surprising and decimating a 300-man unit assigned to wipe out the guerrillas . By early September local recruits had boosted the unit 's strength to some 200 men , and the communists redoubled their efforts to wipe out the group . But through September and into October , the White Tigers conducted increasingly successful strikes , inflicting significant damage to North Korean forces . Moreover , the guerrillas had begun forwarding to their Pusan headquarters air-strike target information that was then passed on to TF-77 . <p> Lieutenant Commander J. A. Scholes , flag lieutenant to TF-77 commander Rear Admiral Joseph J. " Jocko " Clark , was instrumental in organizing the procedure . Young-do fighters would radio the target information to Pusan , which would relay it to TF-77 's flagship , the Bonhomme Richard . Navy aircraft would then carry out strikes against the sites . According to Admiral Clark , " This arrangement was most beneficial , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To obtain information on likely targets , the White Tigers relied on their spy network , which included North Korean Army officers and Communist Party officials . In October , some of their agents informed the group of plans for a 29 October meeting in Kapsan of regional North Korean and Chinese military and party leaders to organize and coordinate actions to destroy the Young-do force . White Tigers commander Ji Yong-su radioed the information to Young-do headquarters , and the task of breaking up the meeting eventually fell to CVG-5 . <h> An Elaborate Deception <p> Thus far in the Korean War , Navy aircraft had rarely hit targets as far north as Kapsan . To desensitize the communists to the presence of carrier planes in the area of the upcoming attack and mislead them as to the true target , the Navy used operational deception . On 28 October , CVG-5 led a coordinated strike against industrial targets in Sokhyon , about 35 miles south-southeast of Kapsanclose enough to serve as an excellent decoy . <p> The mission was composed of four F2Hs , eight F4Us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight F4Us , and eight ADs of CVG-15 , flying off the USS Antietam ( CV-36 ) , which had replaced the Boxer . The aircraft made six attack runs . The Panthers and Banshees went in first , strafing and rocketing antiaircraft positions . The Corsairs and ADs followed , bombing specifically assigned targets . <p> Although the planes encountered intense antiaircraft fire , they all returned to their carriers and the attack was a complete success , destroying a large warehouse and five barracks . CVG-5 's action report claimed " 35% of the target completely destroyed , which is considered excellent for the number of aircraft involved . " More important , the attack established the Sokhyon area as a legitimate northern target that might require follow-up strikes . <h> Change of Plans <p> For CVG-5 , 28 October was otherwise a normal , grueling workday . Besides the Sokhyon strike , the air group flew 53 missions against bridge and rail targets . That night began routinely , with the air group 's pilots prepared to attack more bridges and railroads the next day , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special strike group for the Kapsan mission . Sixteen pilots from two squadrons got the nod : eight F4U Corsair aviators of VF-53 and eight AD Skyraider pilots of VF-54 . Between 0330 and 0400 the pilots were awoken and told that their targets had changed ; they were to muster for a new brief . <p> At the briefing , senior officers told the aviators that they were to break up the meeting in Kapsan , about 190 miles to the north , and that " a critical time window had to be met , " Commander Clayton Fisher , VF-53 's executive officer , recalled . " The attack was to commence at 0900 . " The pilots were told to expect minimal air defenses , which they distinctly remembered as being in contrast to their previously assigned mission against highly defended bridge and rail targets . " We had lost the baby of our squadron , Ensign Richard A. Bateman , at the bridges the day before , " Fisher said . A flak burst had blown off a ten-foot wing section from Bateman 's Corsair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was then a VF-53 lieutenant ( junior grade ) , remembered that " We were n't disappointed not to be going back to the bridges . " <p> The pilots , however , did receive some specific warnings : " We were told if you got shot down and survived , we were going to be out of range of our rescue helicopters , " Fisher said . " It was inferred we might be better off shooting ourselves with our .38-caliber pistols rather than be captured . " Some of the aviators also remember the briefers saying that if the pilots were shot down , to " run like hell . " <p> The target was a compound divided into three walled sections , 16 total structures , which included a police station , a North Korean Army battalion headquarters , and the primary target : the Communist Party meeting hallthe largest building in the northernmost section . Each building was constructed of masonry and wood , which offered little protection from the high-explosive and incendiary weapons typically carried by U.S. aircraft . As the aviators reviewed reconnaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguishing landmarks would make target recognition relatively easy . The compound was bounded by large roads to the east and west , and irrigation ditches to the south . A ridge to the east sloped down to the target area . <p> To minimize any chance of detection , the attack force planned to fly at wave-top height until over land , and then at tree-top level . When near the target area , the planes would pop up to their roll-over point for the actual attack . But during the rapid climb , the lead pilots would not be able to see well over the nose of their aircraft , reducing the amount of time to accurately pick out the correct targets . The ridge would help them quickly orient themselves and locate the compound . <p> The pilots were not told that their strike would be accompanied by a simultaneous ground attack by the White Tiger fighters . In fact , the aviators knew nothing of the Young-do Unit . The mission 's senior pilots , however , were told that a U.S. Marine officer would be on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the strike . The " Marine officer " could have been assigned to the local guerrillas , or part of a cover story to protect the source of the target information . <h> The Navy Crashes a Party <p> The Skyraiders and Corsairs launched from the Essex between 0730 and 0745 in clear weather and crisp air . Commander Fisher led the eight F4Us , which were divided into two four-plane divisions . Each Corsair carried a single 500-pound and four 250-pound bombs . Led by Commander Paul GrayVF-54 's commanding officerthe eight ADs were also split into two divisions . Each Skyraider was loaded with two 1,000-pound bombs , one 300-gallon napalm bomb , and eight 250-pound bombs , a massive payload for a single-propeller plane . In all , more than 44,000 pounds of ordnance was assigned for a three-to-four-acre target . If all went according to plan , the results would be devastating . <p> After the planes formed up , they headed toward Sokhyon to take maximum advantage of the previous day 's decoy strike . Maintaining radio silence , the group passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began its climb , or " pop , " to attack altitude . The planes were then eight to nine minutes from the target , too late for the enemy warning systems to identify and assess the threat against Kapsan . <p> As soon as the strike group leveled off at approximately 8,000 feet , the planes began their attack runs . Coming in from the east , with the sun to their backs , the group achieved complete surprise . Because Kapsan had not been a target of major air attacks , any bunkers at the three compounds would likely have been only rudimentary , and on this day they would have needed to protect a very large number of people . <p> Antiaircraft guns would normally have opened fire at this point , initially trying to distract the attacking pilots and then working the solution for a kill . However , just as the pilots had been briefed , there was little or no flak , further supporting the belief that the meeting participants felt totally secure from air attack . This allowed the pilots to make maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinance during multiple passes over a target , instead of salvoing all of it during the initial pass . <p> First , the F4Us came down in division attacks . " I led the Corsairs down ahead of the attack bombers and checked my watch in the middle of my dive , " Fisher said . " It was 0900 . I spotted a tall radio communications antenna mast and then selected the largest building near it for my first target . " After dropping their 500-pound bombs in their first pass over the compound , the F4Us pulled off in a left turn to orbit the target area and wait for the ADs to deliver the massive blows . <p> The Skyraiders then came in and dropped their first 1,000-pound bombs from between 500 and 1,000 feet , also pulling off to the left , and then coming back around to drop their second 1,000-pounders . On their third pass , half the ADs dropped their napalm bombs and the other half strafed . The procedure was reversed on the fourth pass . " The remainder of the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compound and pinpointing the 250s on those sections that had not been completely destroyed . " Added then-Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Herbert Riebeling of VF-53 : " We set up a daisy chain . We went round and round hitting the target again and again . . . just blasting the hell out of it . " <p> After nearly an hour on target , all 16 planes formed up and returned to the Essex . " When left the target , there was nothing left but a smoking mass of rubble , " Gray said . " Pictures showed every bomb except one inside the compound . There was only one wall left standing . " <p> When the bombing had begun , a 19-man White Tigers detachment attacked the police station , freeing 15 young anticommunists held there . Meanwhile , a large number of the communist forces at Kapsan fled into a makeshift air-raid shelter . The delayed fusing of some of the bombs penetrated the bunker with catastrophic results . Commander Fisher was later told that the Marine spotter on the ground " confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first pass when the cellar they gathered in took a direct hit from one of the 1,000-pounders . " In all , the devastating air strike killed between 510 and 530 enemy personnel . <p> Following the recovery of the strike group , Admiral Clark sent the following message : " Essex special strike group today outperformed the man who wrote the book X Well done . " Each of the pilots earned the Distinguished Flying Cross for the mission . North Korean leaders , naturally , reacted to the attack with outrage . According to broadcasts on Radio Pyongyang , they put a price on the heads of the raid 's Navy pilots , referring to them as the " Butchers of Kapsan . " Fortunately for the aviators , none were subsequently captured by the North Koreans . <p> The Young-do guerrillas , however , did not fare as well . Kapsan was the Y Unit 's high-water mark . None of their other operations had as large an impact on the enemy , and the communists ' reaction was predictable . In the aftermath of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and executed , and the guerrilla group became less and less effective . By early 1952 , the White Tigers were defunct .

Convoys crossing the North Atlantic lacked air support in the mid-ocean area , which was beyond the range of land-based Allied aircraft . Although barely a third the displacement of the fleet carriers fighting in the Pacific , escort carriers used in close support of the convoys were able to close the mid-ocean gap . But when the " baby flattops " were cut loose from their convoys to pursue the U-boats wherever they may be , the Battle of the Atlantics wolves became the prey . <p> The U.S. Navys escort-carrier program got its start in December 1940 . On the 13th of that month , Rear Admiral William F. Halsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent a letter to Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark expressing his concern that the entry of the United States into the European war would require all six of the Fleets aircraft carriers to be deployed immediately . This , in turn , would severely restrict both the training of naval aviators and the services ability to transport Army and Navy aircraft to overseas bases . To overcome these handicaps , Halsey recommended the procurement of " suitable merchant vessels and their earliest conversion to auxiliary aircraft carriers . " 1 <p> Interestingly , just a week later , President Franklin D. Roosevelt , in a memo to Admiral Stark by FDRs naval aide , Captain Daniel Callahan , proposed that , in order to increase convoy protection , a 6,000- to 8,000-ton merchant vessel capable of attaining a speed of at least 15 knots be converted into an experimental carrier equipped with a flight deck that could accommodate ten helicopters or ten planes with low-landing speeds . 2 While Admiral Halseys proposal had called for the creation of auxiliary carriers to be used for noncombat purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide antisubmarine protection to convoys at sea . <p> Following a series of January 1941 meetings principally in the CNOs office , it was decided that two Maritime Commission diesel-powered C-3 merchant ships , the SS Mormacmail and Mormacland , could be provided for conversion into carriers ; the U.S. Navy would receive the first ship and the Royal Navy the second . Convinced that the conversion process should take no more than three months , Roosevelt pushed for immediate action . Delivered to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Companys yard on 17 March 1941 , the 10,000-ton Mormacmail was converted to the Auxiliary , Aircraft Escort Carrier USS Long Island ( AVG-1 ) . <p> Commissioned on 2 June , she had a flush flight deck extending 362 feet abaft and above the pilothouse , a catapult installed to launch planes off her port bow , and a single elevator . Designed to carry 16 carrier scouting planes ( SOCs ) , she was also armed with two 3-inch/50-caliber guns on her forecastle and a single 5-inch/51 gun at her stern . Following flight-testing on board the carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ships authorized adding 77 additional feet to her flight deck by extending it forward over the pilothouse. 3 <p> Even as the Long Island was undergoing conversion , in late April 1941 the British Admiralty requested that the United States convert six C-3 merchant hulls into " fighter carriers " for Royal Navy use . The first of these , the Mormacland , began conversion at Newport News in early May , and after delays caused in part by requested British design changes , she was finally commissioned on 17 November 1941 as HMS Archer . She was equipped with the longer 440-foot flight deck , a single elevator , and an overhung navigation bridge . 4 The other five C-3 hulls allocated to the British were under conversion as well , and four of theseHMS Avenger , Biter , Dasher , and Tracker were completed and delivered between the end of March 1942 and end of January 1943 . The fifth converted ship went instead to the U.S. Navy and was commissioned on 3 March 1942 as the USS Charger ( eventually designated CVE-30 ) . 5 <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navys Auxiliary Vessels Board recommended the requisition of 24 additional merchant hulls of the Puget Sound steam-turbine design for conversion as auxiliary aircraft carriers in the Navys Fiscal Year 1942 building program . Following Navy Secretary Frank Knoxs approval , on 30 December 1941 the Maritime Commission agreed to release 20 of its C-3 freighter hulls to the Navy for this purpose . Ten of these were assigned to the U.S. Navy , while the other ten were allocated to the Royal Navy ; as completed they became Auxiliary Aircraft Carriers ( ACVs ) later Escort Aircraft Carriers ( CVEs ) 6 through 25. 6 <p> The ten assigned to the U.S. Navy were Bogue -class carriers ( after the USS Bogue ACV-9 ) . Although built on the same C-3 hulls as the earlier auxiliary aircraft carriers , they embodied alterations that the Admiralty had been recommending since before work on HMS Archer had begun in 1941 . Four of these ten shipsthe Bogue , Card , Core , and Croatan would go on to play important roles in the Battle of the Atlantic as " Hunter-Killer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alterations to the ships included an estimated top speed of 19 knots ; a wider , sturdier flight deck that was 442 feet , 3 inches in length and 80 feet , 10 inches in width ; stronger arresting gear ; and a longer hangar deck that allowed the installation of two elevators . The carriers could accommodate up to 38 aircraft , but 18 to 21 planes were ususally embarked for combat operations . Another notable change was the addition of a small island rising above the flight deck but built out over the side of the ship to keep the landing area clear of obstructions . The island featured an open bridge , lookout platforms , a chart house , and cabins for the captain and the navigator . 7 <h> Organizing for Offensive Operations <p> By the spring of 1943 , Admiral Ernest J. King , commander-in-chief , U.S. Fleet and chief of Naval Operations ( COMINCH/CNO ) , had become convinced of the need to improve the complicated command relationship that existed between the Navy and Army on antisubmarine-warfare ( ASW ) matters . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to best improve this situation . 8 As part of their efforts , on 6 April King appointed Rear Admiral Francis S. " Frog " Low , a highly experienced submarine officer , to be his assistant chief of staff for antisubmarine warfare , and ordered the staff to put all ASW business under his direction . 9 <p> On 20 May , following a period of extended correspondence among the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , King established the 10th Fleet at his headquarters in Washington to take over all U.S. antisubmarine activities , including the operational control of U.S. Army Air Forces and Navy ASW aircraft . 10 King , as COMINCH , initially assumed the duty of commander , 10th Fleet . Although it was thought at the time that another admiral would be brought in to take over the assignment , an appropriate candidate was not available , and as a result King remained the fleets commander for the duration of the war . Meanwhile , Admiral Low , who was appointed the 10th Fleets chief of staff , handled the day-to-day operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic , even as Atlantic Fleet Commander-in-Chief Royal E. Ingersoll and the American coastal Sea Frontier commanders dealt with the actual details of these operations . 11 <p> Thoughts of eventually using auxiliary carriers offensively against the U-boats had been germinating within the COMINCH staff during the spring of 1943 . In one of Lows first memos written upon joining the staff , he had advocated including one auxiliary carrier in each surface-support group at the earliest possible date and using support groups not only for fortifying the defensive screens of convoys but also for " killer operations . " 12 Similarly , in a preliminary document on plans for setting up the 10th Fleet sent to the Joint Chiefs on 27 April , King commented on using mobile forces , which included ACVs and their escorts , for missions that included , " in due course , to operate directly against U-boat concentrations , etc. " 13 <p> The key to using escort carriers effectively against U-boats , however , was determining the submarines approximate cruising locations in an area that comprised many thousands of square miles of ocean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COMINT ) came into play . The Allies had been locked out of reading U-boat radio traffic for most of 1942 after Germanys U-boat High Command ( BdU ) had ordered the addition of a fourth wheel to the Enigma cryptographic machines used when communicating with its Atlantic and Mediterranean submarines . But in January 1943 , a combination of breakthroughs enabled Allied code-breakers to read U-boat radio traffic promptly . This provided the Admiralty and COMINCH headquarters with accurate information on current dispositions of U-boat groups . 14 <p> One aspect of this vital knowledge that proved particularly significant to COMINCH was the at-sea locations of the large German U-tankers sent out to refuel other U-boats . Each Type XIV " Milch ( milk ) cow " U-boat could keep several submarines operating off the coast of the United States for about twice as long as would otherwise be possible . The small 500-ton Type VIIC U-boat , for example , could spend an average of only 16 to 20 days on patrol . If it could be refueled at sea , however , its time on patrol could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because so much of the U-boat fleet was composed of shorter-range submarines , targeting the U-tankers could significantly reduce the operating radius of the overall force . It was for this reason that King pushed to use U-boat location information derived from COMINT to attack Germanys refueling subs . On 27 April , he sent a highly classified message to Britains First Sea Lord , Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound , that stated : <p> While I am equally concerned with you as to the security of " Z " i.e. , communications intelligence information it is my belief that we are not deriving from it fullest value . The refueling submarine is the key to high speed , long range U/boat operations . To deprive the enemy of refuellers sic would at once decrease the effectiveness and radius of entire U/boat deployment . With careful preparations it seems not unlikely that their destruction might be accomplished without trace. 16 <p> Although the Admiralty could not be persuaded to accept this idea , King moved ahead with it on his own volition . <p> Early Contact with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Short , was the first U.S. Navy escort carrier to be deployed in the Atlantic for convoy support . Operating out of Iceland and Newfoundland beginning in early March 1943 , the Bogue ; her embarked squadron , Composite Squadron ( VC ) 9 ; and her accompanying flush-deck destroyers patrolled in support of eastbound Allied convoys but had little success finding and attacking U-boats . Their luck changed in May . At twilight on the 21st , while the Bogue and her escorts were steaming westbound as part of Convoy ON-184 , Lieutenant Commander William M. Drane , CO of VC-9 , spotted the surfaced U-231 some 60 miles ahead of the convoy . After pushing his TBF Avenger into a low-angle glide , Drane released his four depth bombs over the U-boats conning tower as she was submerging . Her bridge wrecked , the submarine was forced to head back to France for repairs . <p> The next day proved even more eventful for the escort carriers airmen . Following partially successful attacks by VC-9 pilots on two U-boats on the morning of 22 May , that afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a high-frequency direction-finder ( HF/DF or " Huff/Duff " ) signal from the Bogue , sighted U-569 just 20 miles astern of the convoy .

Some 30 minutes later , the damaged submarine resurfaced and was greeted by the Avenger flown by Chamberlains relief , Lieutenant Howard S. Roberts . He delivered an accurate spread of depth bombs . U-569s bow rose high in the air before she plunged to an estimated depth of 350 feet . Blowing all her tanks , her skipper , Kapit+nleutnant ( Lieutenant ) Rudolf Bahr , surfaced the boat and allowed the crew to jump overboard before scuttling her . The escort carriers had claimed their first kill . 17 <p> In every regard , May was proving to be a disastrous month for Grossadmiral Karl D+nitzs U-boat campaign in the North Atlantic . That month the deployed subs had sunk only 42 Allied ships while in turn losing 38 of their number , largely to attacks from land-based aircraft . 18 These unsupportable losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those waters , and on 24 May , BdU ordered nearly all of its submarines to leave the North Atlantic and head to an area about 750 miles southwest of the Azores , in order to intercept a U.S.-Gibraltar convoy on or about 1 June . <p> On the 26th , 17 of the U-boats were directed to organize into a wolf pack designated Group Trutz ( Defiance ) and to form a patrol line within a specific area . The Allied COMINT organizations had managed to decrypt the initial order the same day it was sent and eventually decrypted the 26 May message on 7 June . 19 The valuable intelligence not only allowed the British and Americans to divert potentially endangered convoys around the newly established patrol line but enabled them to redeploy the carrier escort groups that had been defending the North Atlantic convoys to the newly threatened area . 20 <h> Cut Loose as a Hunter-Killer <p> Acting on the intelligence , Atlantic Fleet headquarters directed the Bogue group to sail south , with orders to carry out offensive operations in support of North African convoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 May , in company with four flush-deck destroyers , for her first independent operation as a Hunter-Killer carrier . After she reached her initial patrol station , it was several days before her aircraft spotted potential targets . On the afternoon of 4 June , however , VC-9 Avengers surprised and attacked three German submarines U-228 , U-641 , and U-603 in separate actions . Unfortunately , the subs , which were positioned at the southern end of the Trutz patrol line , received only minor damage from the aerial attacks and all escaped . <p> The following morning , though , one of Commander Dranes new F4F WildcatAvenger teams spotted U-217 cruising on the surface , just 63 miles from the Bogue . In a coordinated attack , the fighter , piloted by Lieutenant Richard S. Rogers , dove in for repeated strafing runs on the submarines deck . Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Alexander C. McAuslan , flying the Avenger , then came in to deliver a lethal pattern of depth charges from an altitude of just 100 feet . The stern of Kapit+nleutnant Kurt Reichenbachs boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunged down into the depths . 21 <p> Because Reichenbachs submarine had been the southernmost one in the Trutz line , the Bogue group lost further contact with the U-boats and turned east to support eastbound Convoy UGS-9 . After several days in which no submarine activity was detected , Captain Short decided to look for new targets . On the afternoon of 8 June , VC-9 planes were in the air responding to a submarine communication picked up on the Bogue s HF/DF set when Kapit+nleutnant Helmut Mansecks U-758 was spotted traveling on the surface only ten miles to the west of the group . This boat was the first German sub equipped with a quadruple mount of 20-mm antiaircraft guns in order to fight it out with attacking aircraft . The armament proved successful , and despite the fact that four VC-9 planes attacked U-758 during the course of that afternoon , the damaged sub eventually escaped . <p> Responding to Mansecks request for help , that same day BdU ordered U-460 and U-118 to respond . Both subs met up with the damaged U-758 by 10 June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , the Allies decrypted BdUs earlier message on 11 June , creating a new opportunity . <p> In the late morning of 12 June , one of the Bogue s fighter-bomber teams sighted U-118 a 1,600-ton Type XB minelayer/supply boat on tanker dutytraveling on the surface just 20 miles astern of the Hunter-Killer group . In all , seven of VC-9s planes took part in attacking her before Korvettenkapit+n ( Lieutenant Commander ) Werner Czygans boat finally broke apart and sank . 22 As a postwar **27;179;TOOLONG study commented on the Bogue groups victory , " This was the first of a mounting number of refueler sinkings which . . . not only kept the U-Boat Commands plans throughout the summer in a constant state of uncertainty , but permanently wrecked the supply system on which his strategy was based . " 23 <h> Other CVEs Join the Battle <p> The USS Core , soon to be designated CVE-13 , was the second escort carrier to achieve success against U-boats . 24 The Core , commanded by naval aviator Captain Marshall R. Greer and escorted by three destroyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June on her first war cruise . For the next two weeks her group provided escort support for Convoy UGS-11 , but on 11 July CINCLANT headquarters directed the Core to leave UGS-11 and take over escort responsibilities for westward-bound Convoy GUS-9 , which had been under the protection of the carrier group headed by the Santee ( CVE-29 ) , a Sangamon -class escort carrier . <p> Early in the afternoon of 13 July , one of the Wildcat-Avenger teams from the Core s VC-13 sighted the wake of U-487 , a 1,600-ton Milch cow , cruising some 760 miles southwest of Santa Maria in the Azores . Although surprised by the sudden arrival of the two American aircraft , German gunners quickly recovered and managed to shoot down the Wildcat flown by Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Earl H. Steiger , even as the accompanying Avenger dropped charges that straddled the U-boats foredeck . A second team from the Core , with VC-13 CO Lieutenant Commander Charles W. Brewer flying the Wildcat , was soon overhead . While Brewer dove in for a strafing attack , his companion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blasted into the air , Oberleutnant ( Lieutenant junior grade ) Helmut Metzs U-487 then sank steeply by the bow . <p> The Core s offensive effort was not yet over , however , because at dawn on 16 July , Lieutenant Robert P. Williams , one of the pilots who had attacked U-487 , spotted a German submarine on the surface less than 30 miles from GUS-9 . Diving from a covering cloud bank , he planted four depth bombs that holed her hull near the conning tower and quickly sent Kapit+nleutnant G++nther M++ller-St+ckheims U-67 , a 740-ton sub , down into the depths . 25 <p> Captain Harold F. Ficks Santee was the second escort carrier to draw blood that July . When her carrier group was relieved of supporting GUS-9 on 12 July , it had been directed to sail toward the Azores to seek out U-boats operating in those waters . The Santee s composite squadron ( VC-29 ) was the first escort-carrier outfit equipped with a new antisubmarine weapon : the Mark 24 mine , the intentionally deceptive designation for an airborne acoustic-homing torpedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 14 July , one of VC-29s Wildcat-Avenger teams sighted Oberleutnant Gerd von Pommer-Esches U-160 cruising some 150 miles northeast of the group . Using a new tactic developed for effectively using the homing torpedo , the Wildcat pilot made successive strafing runs , which caused the sub to dive . The Avenger , flown by Lieutenant ( junior grade ) John H. Ballentine , then released the Mark 24 just ahead of the surface swirl left by the diving boat . The torpedo quickly found its target , and U-160 sank to the bottom with all her crew . <p> The morning of 15 July proved to be equally lucky for the Santee s aviators . Kapit+nleutnant Werner Wittes 740-ton boat , U-509 , was spotted on the surface some 180 miles south of Santa Maria . Despite throwing up a heavy barrage of flak , the sub was forced to dive after four strafing passes by the accompanying F4F fighter . Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Claude N. Barton then loosed his Fido . Upon hitting the water , it rushed toward the noise produced by the boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating new weapon that had claimed its second victim was already being distributed to the Allies on both sides of the Atlantic . 26 <p> The fourth CVE to achieve success as a Hunter-Killer carrier was Captain Arnold J. Isbells USS Card ( CVE-11 ) . Aviator " Buster " Isbell and his ships had been providing close support to U.S.-Gibraltar convoys in June and July , but in early August the Card group was directed to hunt for enemy submarines . On 3031 July BdU had radioed two of its subs U-66 and U-664 to rendezvous with U-117 , a Type XB boat on refueling duty , but the Allies had decrypted the orders on 1 August . One of the Card s Wildcat-Avenger teams sighted U-66 on the afternoon of 3 August , but the ensuing attacks failed to seriously damage the boat . <p> Just before midnight three days later , U-66 met up with U-117 . The next morning , 7 August , a single Avenger from the Card s VC-1 spotted the two submarines steaming in parallel while carrying out refueling some 83 miles west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior grade ) Asbury H. Sallenger , dove and delivered a brace of depth bombs , which straddled U-117 , and then machine-gunned her deck before gaining altitude to hover out of range . He had radioed for support , but before help arrived U-66 dove and escaped . But Korvettenkapit+n Hans Werner Neumanns U-117 was not so lucky . Unable to successfully submerge , the boat was attacked by two newly arrived Avengers , whose depth bombs ruptured her fuel tanks , and the sub sank to the bottom . <p> The Card s aircraft scored a second kill on 9 August , when a newly devised three-plane team , consisting of one Wildcat and two Avengers , sighted a surfaced submarine busy recharging her batteries . Kapit+nleutnant Adolf Graefs U-664 was hit by one of two 500-pound bombs dropped by one of the two TBFs and after beginning to dive was blown back to the surface by the explosion of two depth bombs set for shallow detonation that had been dropped by the second Avenger . Graef eventually ordered the boat to be abandoned before she sank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on 11 August , when one of her Wildcat-Avenger teams caught Kapit+nleutnant Hans-Joachim Drewitzs U-525 on the surface . Driven to submerge by strafing , she was finished off by a Mark 24 dropped into her wake . 27 <p> The Hunter-Killer offensive that had been so successful during the summer of 1943 continued throughout that fall . By the end of 1943 , the escort carriers had sunk 24 German submarines , including five U-tankers. 28 And CVE offensive operations were no less effective during 1944 and into 1945 . As Admiral Low stressed in an October 1944 10th Fleet memo , " It is important to note that the CVE support groups accounted for about 60% of all U-boats sunk by U.S. forces in the Atlantic and Mediterranean during the six months April through September 1944. " 29 <p> During the final year and a half of the European war , other CVE Hunter-Killer groups also earned their places in the history of the Battle of the Atlantic . The Block Island ( CVE-21 ) carrier group sank the first of an eventual seven U-boats in late October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , U-549 torpedoed and sank the Block Island the only U.S. carrier lost in the Atlantic during the war . The group formed around the Croatan ( CVE-25 ) also managed to sink seven U-boats in April , June , and July 1944 and April 1945 . Other Hunter-Killer groups included the ones headed by the Guadalcanal ( CVE-60 ) , which sank three U-boats and successfully captured a fourth , U-505 ; Mission Bay ( CVE-59 ) ; Solomons ( CVE-67 ) ; and Wake Island ( CVE-65 ) . <h> In Conclusion <p> Admiral King and his 10th Fleet staff had been enthusiastic about using escort carriers to track down and sink German submarines from the outset . The key factor that made the concept operationally feasible , however , was finding a way to determine where the U-boats could be found . This is where the British and American cryptanalysts ability to overcome the Enigma cipher machine used by BdU for communicating with the German subs played such a valuable role . With cueing from current COMINT information , the escort carrier groups were directed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The initial carrier-planeU-boat actions proved a learning experience for the American aircraft involved . But the end results were successful beyond what could have been expected . In all , escort-carrier groups sank 53 U-boats during the war and helped to decimate Germanys force of U-tankers. 30 It was an amazing accomplishment that became the final chapter of the Battle of the Atlantic . <p> 13 .

Message from COMINCH to Admiralty , Personal from Admiral King to the First Sea Lord , 281628 , 27 April 1943 , " Anti-Submarine Operations . " <h> How to Sink Subs <p> The U.S. naval aviators who flew off escort carriers in search of U-boats were trained in the art of antisubmarine warfare . But they also relied on " lessons learned " by fellow Navy fliers to increase their chances of successfully attacking enemy submarines . <p> The following instructions are perhaps the earliest such Battle of the Atlantic lessons based on the experiences American escort-carrier aviators . Titled " A Discussion of Anti-Submarine Tactics , " they were included as Enclosure A in the USS Bogue s report on furnishing air cover for Convoy ON-184 from 1526 May 1943 . During that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board the Bogue and made the first U-boat kill by U.S. escort-carrier aircraft . The author of the instructions , which are published here with minimal editing , was not listed , but he probably was Lieutenant Commander William Drane , VC-9s commanding officer . <p> The TBF is considered an excellent antisubmarine airplane in view of its depth-charge capacity , endurance , and speed . The latter is a very important item that permits the plane to deliver its attack before the submarine can submerge . This speed also exposes the plane to AA fire for the shortest possible period . This squadron to date has sighted and attacked eight submarines , and every attack was made with the submarine still on the surface . The endurance is of considerable value in permitting the plane to remain on station a reasonable time to await relief . The only disadvantage to this type of airplane is its size when used on ACVs ; however , this is not a serious handicap in view of its many favorable qualities . <p> The .30-caliber tunnel gun has been removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tunnel window used for photographing the attack . There appears to be no necessity for these guns on this type of duty in the North Atlantic . <p> German submarines have recently started using two 20-mm guns for attacking aircraft . Three attacks on separate submarines on May 22 , 1943 , encountered this AA fire . It is therefore recommended that at least two and preferably four .50-caliber guns be mounted in the TBF wings . This appears necessary for this duty and would no doubt be of considerable value in other types of duty . <p> The type of attack preferred by this squadron is to use cloud cover , sun , or other elements to the maximum for concealment . The attack is made in a long power glide at maximum speed when at considerable distance ; however , on approaching the vicinity of the submarine the speed must be reduced to 180200 knots to reduce the possibility of a ricochet . One submarine possibly escaped this squadron because of ricochets , although the flat-nosed depth charges were used and dropped with the plane in nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final stage of the attack it is recommended that the wheels be lowered to reduce the speed to 160170 knots , then raised to clear the tunnel window for the photographs . <p> The plane is pushed over to about a 20-degree dive and steadied on the point of aim when the depth charges are dropped . The advantage of this final push over and steady aim permits the bombs to be dropped with remarkable accuracy . Another advantage is that the aim is steady long enough to permit the emergency release to be pulled after the firing button to ensure that all bombs have dropped . This is standard procedure in this squadron . <p> The best angle of attack is believed to be from 10 to 20 degrees from the centerline of the submarine and preferably from astern . A beam shot is avoided if absolutely possible . The speed of the TBF has permitted ample time so far to choose attack position , especially when concealed in the clouds . <p> The depth charges are set for a depth of 25 feet and a spacing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our previously favored 50 feet and the 100 feet recommended by the Fleet Air Arm Anti-Submarine School , Balleykelly , Northern Ireland , which all TBF pilots of this squadron attended . This spacing seems to be ideal for our type of attack , since our dive far shortens this interval considerably . Also if the submarine has already disappeared it makes a longer spread over the possible submarines position , thus increasing the chances of hitting . <p> During the approach the pilot and radioman must check all switches in addition to the other routine requirements for dropping charges . When the radioman has completed his required duties he mans the camera at the tunnel window . The turret gunner uses the gun camera on all attacks to supplement the large camera . He also uses the turret gun if personnel are in the conning tower . <p> After dropping the depth charges , the plane makes a sharp left turn to facilitate observation and the taking of photographs . After marking the area and completing the contact report , the plane climbs to sufficient altitude to permit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact report is made during the approach , if time permits . This is important in that the ship will have a submarine warning in case the plane should get shot down . <p> It is assumed that the dawn and dusk patrols are the most important patrols to the welfare of the convoy and that submarines are most likely to be encountered on these flights . The experience of Bogue aircraft to date regarding submarine defensive tactics seems to be for them to remain on the surface and fight back . In view of possible antiaircraft fire , it is desirable that fighter planes accompany the TBF aircraft on these particular flights if conditions permit . If fighter support is used it is mandatory that some policy be laid down to coordinate the action of the fighter aircraft upon sighting and during the approach and attack . Without this discipline the missions are doomed to failure . <p> Some facts must be borne in mind : Two planes in formation can be seen at far greater distance than a single plane . Observation from the aircraft by the additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attention of the fighter pilot must be directed toward station keeping . Maneuverability of a fighter is one of its prime assets , but radical maneuvers of an aircraft will attract the attention of surface observers more readily than a plane on a steady course . Maneuvers often condense the vapor in humid air , greatly facilitating detection . Concealment is a primary factor in antisubmarine search . Fighters must not destroy advantages . <p> It should be appreciated that except for the possibility of antiaircraft fire , the antisubmarine aircraft could complete the mission on its own , and therefore , the fundamental mission of the fighter is to counteract AA action , and that action will only develop during the latter and crucial stage of the approach . The responsibility for control of the fighter must rest upon the antisubmarine aircraft since it has the responsibility of the fundamental mission . There should never develop a situation in which the action of the fighter results in the failure of a successful attack . <p> While it is desirable to close distance as quickly as possible when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be avoided , as discussed previously . If the fighter dashes madly in without signal and drives the submarine down prematurely , those few sacred seconds might spell defeat . The antisubmarine aircraft may wish to use clouds , sun , or other means of concealment during the early stages of the approach . The fighter must not compromise this strategy . The situation will dictate the strategy , and the antisubmarine aircraft must dictate the action . <p> During the approach the fighter should ease out on the beam of the antisubmarine aircraft about 500 to 1,000 yards and on signal when about 1,500 yards from the objective increase speed and strafe the submarine from three to five seconds before the depth charge attack . Interference with the depth-charge attack must be avoided . <p> Teamwork is essential , and this only is obtained by a lot of practice .

Phillip London and CACI International <p> When developing their character , junior officers should look to naval leaders who embraced the philosophy of stoicism . <p> Vice Admiral James Stockdale is a naval legend and an American hero . A U.S. Naval Academy graduate renowned for his leadership capability as well as his fortitude and courage as a prisoner of war , Stockdale is an example of leadership for many young naval officers . His leadership principles rest on the foundations of stoicism as set forth by the Roman philosopher Epictetus . While it is unlikely that most naval officers will experience the hardships of being a prisoner of war , the concepts of stoicism can be applied to everyday leadership in practical ways . In fact , military leadership calls for stoic leadership , as a naval officer can not let emotions influence actions . An officer must follow all legal orders to the best of his or her ability whether in agreement or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of stoicism worked for Vice Admiral Stockdale while he was prisoner of war then these same principles will benefit naval officers in all leadership roles . <p> Leadership is complex and difficult , which is illustrated by the thousands of classes , books , and seminars that focus on the subject . Numerous theories exist on leadership , and countless styles abound , with a correspondingly high number of definitions . The Oxford English Dictionary defines it as " the action of leading a group or organization . " However , this simple definition does not encapsulate the true nature of leadership . Difficult to define , the quality is much easier to recognize , especially in individuals . <p> The history of naval services provides many excellent examples of leadership , such as Medal of Honor recipients Vice Admiral Stockdale and Lieutenant Michael Murphy , as well as Captain David Marquet of the USS Santa Fe ( SSN-763 ) , and Captain Paul X. Rinn of the USS Samuel B. Roberts ( FFG-58 ) . All these men exhibited signs of stoic leadership , accepting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlin other words , the external and the internal . <p> An Issue of Character <p> The basis of stoicism is the development of character and self-discipline to overcome destructive emotions . What lies beyond our control is the external , such as the actions of other people , events , and reputation . What lies in our control is the internal , such as our own opinions , actions , and desires . Recognizing the external and internal is the first step in stoic leadership . <p> The continued development of character is essential in stoic leadership . In a speech to the University of London , Stockdale quoted Epictetus , noting " You must labor to improve either your own governing principles or externals , you must work hard either on the inner man , or the things outside ; that is , play the role of a philosopher or else that of a layman. " 1 One must continually focus on improving character to become the best person possible . The time spent as a junior officer is an excellent opportunity to grow and develop ones character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those we lead and to ourselves . <p> Another aspect of developing character is the experience of failure . At one time or another , all junior officers will failregardless of their background and education . This failure can be something small , such as a division failing their inspections , or larger , like a newly commissioned ensign conning a ship at night . Stockdale said , " The challenge of education is not to prepare people for success but to prepare them for failure . " 2 Failure is the crucible in which character is developed , and that is where leaders are forged . Stockdale went on to say , " I think that its in hardship and failure that the heroes and the bums really get sorted out . " 3 Failure is only negative if chosen to be viewed that way ; otherwise , failure can be used as a means to improve oneself . It provides a chance to grow and develop character , especially under the guidance of a mentor . <p> Mentorship is essential for leadership development , and within the stoic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius , one of the greatest military leaders of the Roman Empire , attributed all of his good characteristics and values to his mentors who taught him . 4 All leaders , especially junior officers , should have such mentors . Mentorship is immensely valuable in passing along wisdom and experience to others , with Epictetus writing , " One of the best ways to elevate your character immediately is to find worthy role models to emulate . " 5 Mentorship allows us to further develop our leadership and character by evaluating our decisions and discussing our faults openly without embarrassment . <p> To What End ? <p> Leading sailors is a difficult taskone that requires fortitude and preparation . Junior officers are the first step in the officer chain of command for young sailors and are directly in the spotlight . Stoic leadership ensures that junior officers will lead well . Specifically , stoicism is beneficial in three areas : It provides the ability to focus on what one can and can not control , promotes and encourages discipline , and allows junior officers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often stereotyped as a cold philosophy that eliminates emotions , in essence stoicism concerns itself with realizing what one can control and accepting the things one can not . Stockdale said , " Uniquely to the stoic , the only good things of absolute value are those that lie within the control of his will . " For an officer , the externals could be deployment schedules , promotions , and orders from a superior . The internals that can be controlled are behavior , the training and readiness of subordinates , and job performance . We can not control the actions of foreign countries or even of our own politicians . We may influence events , but they are not directly under anyones control . However , the duty of commissioned officers dictates that we perform our jobs to the best of our ability for the defense of the nation and that we have the utmost control over ourselves . <p> Stoicism rests on a foundation of discipline , which is the cord that binds together leadership and followership . Without discipline , one can neither lead nor be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over our emotions and actions . Epictetus wrote , " Evil is a by-product of forgetfulness , laziness , or distraction : it arises when we lose sight of our true aim in life . " All militaries are effective because of discipline . The decline of the Roman army was largely due to the decline of discipline within the ranks . Discipline begins with the most senior officer and ends with the most junior sailor . We can not expect our own subordinates to exercise discipline if we have none . In his Discourses , Epictetus states , referring to soldiers , that " If you neglect your responsibilities when some severe order is laid upon you , do you not understand to what a pitiful state you bring the army in so far as you lies ? " 6 Stoic leadership ensures that we exercise discipline over ourselves first and our subordinates second . <p> Professionalism is the heart of a naval officers career , and the ability to master ones emotions allows professionalism to flourish . Breaches of professionalism often result from an excess of negative emotions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stoicism calls for the control of ones emotions , and Stockdale noted that " the stoic thinks of emotions as an act of will . " 7 This eliminates the notion that the inner self is not under ones control , allowing for the proper execution of leadership and ensuring professionalism is maintained . A pilot can not properly execute his mission if he is deathly afraid of being shot down . Viewing emotions as an act of will allows military leaders to control his or her emotions and lead in times of crisis and to lead morally in times of peace . One must properly control their emotions in order to keep their professionalism consistent and high . <p> Levels of Leadership <p> A strong senior leader is necessary for any unit , but one person can not completely control everything . A ships captain can not possibly dictate to every subordinate how specifically to do a job . In his book , Turn the Ship Around , Captain Marquet describes his leadership philosophy behind commanding the USS Santa Fe , pointing to a leader-leader structure that ensures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Using this philosophy , Marquet was able to take the poorest-performing submarine in the Navy and transform the Santa Fe into one of the highest performing . 8 Captain Rinn of the Samuel B. Roberts also utilized aspects of this philosophy , which led to his crew properly handling the damage-control situations after the ship struck a mine in the Persian Gulf . The Samuel B. Roberts was able to successfully clear the minefield while remaining prepared to fightwithout any loss of life . Both Captains Marquet and Rinn were able to recognize that they could only do so much by themselves and empowered their crews . <p> An important aspect of junior-officer leadership is the ability to lead those who are beside them . Here , stoic leadership is invaluable . A junior officer needs to recognize two separate issues . First , he or she is only fully in control of his or her actions . Second , a junior officers reputation is not decided by the officer but by others . These two separate issues play a large role in peer leadership . <p> Junior officers must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they influence the reputation of the naval services and their peers . However , there is a tendency to be influenced by group behavior , which can be either positive and negative . Every junior officers actions contribute to group behavior , and all must be on guard to ensure those actions positively influence their peers . The best leadership guidance is often through example . <p> Second , junior officers should not excessively worry about reputation , as they have little control over it . Instead , they should concentrate on acting honorably and their reputation will follow . Epictetus wrote , " Let the quality of your deeds speak on your behalf . We cant control the impressions others form about us , and the effort to do so only debases our character . " 9 A virtuous person will have a virtuous reputation , but one without virtue will have a negative reputation . Worrying about reputation will make one want to be liked and may lead to bad decisions . As officers , our duty is not to be liked . Instead , our duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being a naval officer is a life-changing experience . We have the possibility to influence and lead . Doing so virtuously allows for the ability to not only change our lives but to change the lives of others . This is a great responsibility , and we must lead with a sense of duty . This requires character , strength , and perseverance . We control the fate of our nation and the fate of those under us . However , we are not the first to lead , and can find guidance from such leaders as Vice Admiral Stockdale , Captain Rinn , Captain Marquet , and Epictetus . With their guidance , junior officers can become great leaders and perform their duty for their country . <p> The concepts of stoic leadership can help everyone lead , especially junior officers . An excellent example of someone who embodied character and leadership is Lieutenant Michael Murphy . After goat herders discovered his unit in the mountains of Afghanistan , he chose to let the herders go free even though they had compromised his position . He made this decisionwhich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was fighting for the principles he believed in . While he and his team were surrounded by the enemy , he walked into a field of fire to meet his death so he could call for help for his men . <p> Such a sacrifice demonstrates the moral selflessness that all leaders should have . Heroes and leaders emerge in times of crisis and trouble .

But was the contest ultimately a losing endeavor for each side ? <p> After 100 years , the Anglo-German naval arms race leading up to World War I remains controversial . It was not the sole reason for the conflict , as arms races do not necessarily lead to open fighting . In the 1860s , the Imperial Navy of France engaged in a rival buildup of oceangoing ironclad-frigates with the Royal Navy of Great Britain . There was no war . And the nuclear arms racethe Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Unionlikewise tended to preserve peace as much as it escalated tensions . <p> The role of battleships as frontline strategic weapons platforms was also far from clear at the beginning of the 20th century . First Sea Lord Admiral Sir John Fisher declared that " no preponderance in ships of inferior fighting quality can make up for a deficiency in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation which must be supreme at sea , an adequate force of modern battleships is essential . " But he also bemoaned the lack of attention given to submarines . It would not be long before these were applied offensively ( not just for coast defense ) as their technological capabilities improved . 1 <p> So was the Anglo-German naval arms race of battleshipsand then dreadnoughtsan epic mistake ? If Great Britain " won " the race , well before 1914 , how had she nearly lost the war ? After a century , can we say that the " Queen of the Seas " was indeed the battleship , or had the very notion of classic naval supremacy become fatally misleading in modern warfare ? <p> When the German Second Reich was declared in 1871 , the Prussian army had swiftly and decisively crushed French arms , Emperor Napoleon III had been captured on the field of battle at Sedan , and Paris was under siege , soon to fall . Although the French navy was second only to Great Britains , it played virtually no role in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by amphibious landing was dismissed as far too risky . German coastal defensesfortifications , mines , and shallow-draft coastal ironcladswere just strong enough to deter a French naval bombardment of German ports , and they kept the French fleet harmlessly out to sea , blockading very little . <p> Under the leadership of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck , Germany soon became the leading military power in Europe . German industry , trade , and population also boomed . The notion of German national growth as synonymous with overseas colonial expansion coincided with the accession of Wilhelm II as kaiser in 1888 and the forced retirement of the 75-year-old " Iron Chancellor " two years later . Whereas Bismarck had wielded the German army to maintain the balance of power in Europe , and the peace , Wilhelm became convinced of Germanys Weltpolitik her new role in shaping world affairs . By 1897 the German foreign secretary , Count Bernhard von B++low , declared Germanys right to " our own place in the sun . " This suggested an impending conflict of interests with other colonial powersespecially with Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " sun never sets . " <p> The kaiser was Queen Victorias grandson and had cultivated a love-hate relationship with the Royal Navy . Having witnessed fleet reviews off the Isle of Wight with his " Uncle Bertie " the Prince of WalesWilhelm especially admired the symbolic power of the latest ironclad battleships . 4 <p> Throughout the bulk of the 19th century , Britains foreign and strategic policy vis-+ -vis Europe was to maintain the balance of power by actively undermining the development of any one dominant military state . Closely associated with this was to guard against the rise of any powerful rival at sea . If France combined naval supremacy with her large army then the Royal Navy might lose command of the English Channel , and the British Isles would be threatened with invasion . Conversely , the French were more concerned with the Royal Navy overexerting British influence in the Mediterranean , blockading French Atlantic ports , and isolating French coloniesfrom Algeria to Indochinain case of yet another Anglo-French conflict . Russia , too , developed her powers of naval defense to a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> All three major powers developed oceangoing battle fleets of ironclads as " capital ships . " But only Britain felt the need to counterbalance the traditional military strengths of France and Russia with something close to a " two-power " standard at sea . In other words , the Royal Navy had to feature enough powerful men-of-war to beat an allied coalition of powers against Britain , if need be . Here it was also expected that some form of clash at sea likely would be between battle fleets . The whole balance of power at sea , and across Europe , might thus be decided in a single afternoon . <p> This was the fleet that Wilhelm saw , and envied . If it did not place Great Britain in a commanding position worldwide , it at least guaranteed her " splendid isolation " from European and American affairs since the 1860swhen coastal assault had become too risky and rival powers were more concerned with protecting their own interests locally . Even so , the ship-of-the-line remained firmly embedded in the public mind as a diplomatic bargaining tool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hold Germanys expanding global trade and colonies hostage during a crisis , its landlocked continental army was irrelevant by comparison . This was sea power at work . And it seemed to give proud Britannia the edge . <p> Despite his background in developing fast torpedo boats for campaigns against ironclad battleships , Captain Alfred von Tirpitz in 1890 became an ardent champion of a distinctly blue-water German navy . This new force , he argued , would naturally revolve around a core of several battle squadrons each with eight capital ships . Each vessel would also employ the latest advancements in heavy guns , armor plating , and speed . Tirpitz soon had the ear of Kaiser Wilhelm , and by 1897 he was appointed secretary of the Imperial German Navy . <p> Both men had in the meantime become enthusiastic students of the writings of American Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , whose analytical masterpiece , The Influence of Sea Power upon History 16601783 , had been published in 1892 . Not only did Mahan stress that real national greatness could be exclusively achieved by " commanding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain ) , but that the best way to gain this control was to build up a strong , well-trained battle-fleet navy and then aggressively seek out and smash the main enemy fleet as soon as possible . A long-term naval war , a guerre de course of commerce warfare , was not the key to victory , Mahan argued . <p> Tirpitz and Wilhelm took this reading of Age of Sail history to heart . " Naval power is essential , " Tirpitz wrote the kaiser in 1899 , " if Germany does not want to go under . " 5 In this light , Germanys future survival as a dominant European land power now was seen as dependent upon her mastery of the seas . Not surprisingly , the German army thought this was a ludicrous waste of time and resources . So did the German Reichstag , which nominally controlled the imperial budget . <p> The subsequent Tirpitz Plan for overhauling the navy was similar to the alarmist Naval Defence Act that Britains Parliament had passed in 1889 . The Admiralty had warned that unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire would not be able to withstand a hostile Franco-Russian alliance . A whole new navy centered around 8 battleships of a single class ( as opposed to a slowly accumulating " fleet of samples , " which had characterized the previous 40 years of armored warship designs ) , accompanied by 38 cruisers as well as torpedo boats , was approved in one lump gratuity vote of 20 million . The ship-of-the-line had evolved into the ironclad , which had evolved again into the Royal Sovereign class battleship , armed with 13.5-inch breech-loading turret guns . <p> Tirpitz pressed for a naval law that would also lay down a whole class of modern battleships at a time . Given Germanys rapid growth in industry and trade , and thus the expansion of her own imperial interests , a navy " for defense " was desperately required . While France and Russia might be deterred by the German army , Great Britain would only respect a strong navy to contend with in diplomatic power plays . Here the German fleet only had to be strong enough to damage the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely the Royal Navy would not risk the British Empire for the sake of commanding the North Sea , Tirpitz convincingly theorized . The law passed in 1898 . Germany would become a modest naval power closer in scale to Russia than either Great Britain or France , which should be enough . <p> Nevertheless , well before any of their battle squadrons were afloat , the Germans soon found themselves at odds with British imperial interests over the Second Boer War ( 18991902 ) . The kaiser had already exacerbated Anglo-German relations by sending a telegram to Paul Kruger , the president of the Transvaal Republic , congratulating him on his repulse of the infamous Jameson Raid by British soldiers of fortune . The popular press in Britain responded by attacking German " meddling " in South Africa . <p> When Royal Navy warships stopped three German merchant vessels off the coast of the war zone to look for contraband of war , the German public was equally outraged . Tirpitz saw this as the proverbial thin edge of the wedge ; conflict with England was increasingly likely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need many more battleships . The ensuing Naval Law of 1900 doubled the number of capital-ship squadrons and put Germany closer on a par with the French navy . This radically altered the balance-of-power equation in Europe . <p> After a visit to the massive German naval dockyards and arsenals at Kiel and Wilhelmshaven in August 1902 , an Admiralty official concluded Germany " must be regarded as a possible enemy " and that " it is no longer safe to dispense with a modern and powerful fleet in home waters . The maintenance of a large fleet in the Mediterranean and the China Seas does not guarantee us against German attack . " 6 Moreover , as Count Paul Wolff Metternich , the German ambassador in London , recounted to thenGerman Chancellor von B++low , " those Englishmen who suspected the German fleet of no directly aggressive intentions against England had reflected that supposing England were entangled in a war elsewhere the German fleet could be used as a means . . . for obtaining British concessions to Germany . " German neutrality in future wars might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coaling stations , for instance . " 7 Despite his nephews protests , King Edward VII foresaw endless extortion of the highest order . <p> Britains response was twofold , and decisive . Under the auspices of Fishers own scheme the decades-old imperial squadrons stationed around the world were weaned off and the heaviest units concentrated in a Home Fleet . Closely aligned with this strategic redeployment was the diplomatic finalization of an Entente cordiale with France in 1904 and 1911 . By offering immediate protection to Frances Channel coast against any German incursion , Britain could then concentrate its battle-fleet navy in the North Sea , while France could mass its own naval forces in the Mediterranean , from Toulon , against the other Triple Alliance powers , Italy and Austria-Hungary. 8 This was a major political realignment that Tirpitz had not anticipated . ( In fact , he thought it impossible given the Anglo-French naval rivalry that characterized the previous two centuries . ) Given this new arrangement , with the Triple Entente formalized in 1907 to include imperial Russia as well , it was practically impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much less wrest control of the North Sea or English Channel from the Royal Navy . Despite Russian naval losses in the Russo-Japanese War , the threat of new enemy battleships launched from Kronstadt , St. Petersburgs naval port , and descending on the German Baltic coast meant that at sea Germany would be faced with a two-front war against Britain and her allies . The entry of the Ottoman Empire ( Turkey ) as another Central Power in 1914 would hardly offset this difficulty , even as it opened a second front against Russia in the Black Sea . 9 <p> The race ought to have ended there . All talk in Germany of winning a naval war against Britain should have ceased . But of course it did n't  . Instead , Tirpitz persuaded the kaiser to intensify efforts to build an even larger , updated fleet that would hopefully help offset France and Russias " encirclement " of Germany by applying ever more naval pressure on Britain , as diplomatic leverage . The German armys alternative to cope with a two-front war was the notorious Schlieffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutral Belgium . <p> By 1905 battleships featured a mix of heavy guns for fighting other battleships and faster-firing secondary turrets and barbettes to ward off torpedo craft . Battle ranges were still well under 10,000 yards . A hail of fire , even if mostly inaccurate , was still considered decisive at short ranges . At Manila Bay ( 1 May 1898 ) American Commodore George Deweys squadron engaged the Spanish as close as 2,000 yardspractically Civil Warera distances . And at Tsushima ( 2728 May 1905 ) Japanese Admiral Heihachiro Togo pressed his attack at 6,000 yards ( 3.4 miles ) , although the 12-inch guns of his flagship Mikasa ( which had been built in the U.K. ) could feasibly reach targets at more than 15,000 yards ( 8.5 miles ) . By then it was clear that the battleship that could inflict damage at the greater range , with the heaviest possible shells , would quickly destroy her opponent . <p> Britains King Edward VII class battleships ( 19035 ) mounted four 12-inch guns in two main turrets . But HMS Dreadnought , ordered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous battleships secondary array of 9-inch and 6-inch guns in favour of ten Vickers 12-inch guns with a host of 3-inch QF 12-pounders for defense against torpedo-boat attack . The Germans quickly followed suit . Their Nassau -class dreadnoughts mounted 12 11-inch Krupp guns . The race intensified over the next seven years , both sides dropping predreadnoughts and adopting all-heavy-gun dreadnought-type platforms as the new standard ship-of-the-line ; coal-driven reciprocating engines likewise quickly evolved into oil-fueled steam turbines . However unwelcome the news of the Dreadnought was in Germany , Wilhelm later recalled , it also created a more level playing field for all sides since " England had robbed her enormous predreadnought force , upon which her great superiority lasted , of its fighting value . " Now the German navy was " forced , nolens volens , to follow England along this road . " 10 <p> J ust prior to World War I , the Admiralty was convinced the Anglo-German arms race in battleships was no longer a serious concern . " We could match every German Dreadnought battleship in the line20 in allby a British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior in all others , without employing any British ship older than the Ajax 1912 . " Some 18 dreadnoughts would be in surplus , " equal in strength to the whole German line of battle . " 11 In the end , not only was British shipbuilding still on top of Germanys , but British political will had given the Royal Navy a blank check for home and imperial defense to ensure Britains naval supremacy . <p> As storm clouds gathered over Europe , Tirpitz had already lost much of his influence ( the kaiser too ) and Germanys limited resources were devoted once again to preparing the army for a two-front war against France and Russia . The Imperial German Navy manifestly had not kept the peace through counterdeterrence ; it had made things worse . Germany was isolated , and Bismarcks vision of his country acting as the great peace broker in world affairs had fallen by the wayside . Lines of German dreadnoughts , impressive as they were , had only destabilized the existing order , not rewritten it on German terms . Could they even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Churchill would later pronounce that only Admiral Sir John Jellicoe , commanding the British Grand Fleet , could " lose the war in an afternoon " defeated in a clash with German dreadnoughts and battlecruisers in the North Sea . British strategy against Germany had already determined that the best course against that happening was not to rush in and attack under unfavorable circumstances , thereby rejecting Mahans ideas in many respects . <p> In 1907 Fisher requested that resident British naval strategist Captain George Alexander Ballard outline several war-plan contingencies against Germany . A keen student of naval history , Ballards Plan A looked all the way back to the Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century . By choking off Dutch commerce at the English Channel , the enemy fleet was obliged to come out and fight close to English shores and bases , thereby giving the Royal Navy a crucial advantage . 12 <p> Ballard was convinced of the need of an " observational " blockade miles off the enemy coast , because of modern risks ( mines , submarines , etc . ) . This was later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way across the North Sea off the Orkney Islands . British cruisers would similarly block off the English Channel and guard the vital supply lines feeding a British Expeditionary Force in France . If Germany , frustrated , attempted to interfere with British command of the North Sea or English Channel , then it would only give the Royal Navy " the much desired opportunity of fighting a decisive action , " noted one laconic report from 1911 . <p> Well after war with the Central Powers broke out , and the Western Front had ground down into trench warfare and strategic deadlock on land , naval analyst and historian Sir Julian Corbett also argued against the notion of " Bombardment of Coast defences with the object of forcing enemy fleet to sea . " 13 The way to hastily lose a maritime war against a continental enemy was with foolish naval frontal assaults . <p> The Royal Navy meanwhile would lose 5 battleships to Germanys 1 in the North Sea ( mostly to mines and torpedoes ) , 3 to 1 in battlecruisers , 9 to 2 in cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 in armed merchant raiders . Only in submarines did Germanys reported 77 losses exceed that of Britains 26 . ( In the Mediterranean , British and French forces lost 11 battleships to 3 , and 6 cruisers to 2 . ) <p> The battleships proved to be an expensive liability in modern warfare . " The creation of sea-power needed the labour of a whole generation , " Tirpitz bitterly complained after the war , " and this amount of time fate did not allow us. " 14 But clearly a blank check from the Reichstag would have only resulted in more dreadnoughts , not submarinesand these were the quieter , unseen men-of-war that seriously undermined Britains ability to sustain the war effort . <p> While the Royal Navys distant blockade was winning the war at sea on the surface , the U-boat campaign nearly won it from below . Prewar German submarines such as U-21 had a range of more than 11,000 miles and were crewed by only 35 officers and men . By December 1915 a meeting of Britains Treasury Emergency Standing Committee approved funding that amounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwelcome , unforeseen danger : 3 million for only 1 new battleship , but double that amount for 34 more destroyers and a further million for 12 " patrol boats or sloops. " 15 <p> U-boats sent upward of 12 million tons of Allied shipping to the bottoma seemingly impossible figure for an " accidental " weapons system that was modified to engage in full-scale commerce raiding after the wars outbreak . Hence a February 1918 Admiralty report admitted " a great scarcity of suitable material and . . . imperfect knowledge of submarine warfare " going into the conflict . Unless " maximum output " of shipbuilding on the part of both Great Britain and the United States was realized , turning masses of unskilled men and women into educated workers , " not only will the losses continue to exceed production . . . but we shall never reach an equipoise . Such an eventuality can mean nothing less than losing the war . " 16 <p> All this only begs the question , what if Kaiser Wilhelm and Admiral Tirpitz had forgone the posturing show of forceof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force instead ? Rather than attempting to clumsily overpower Britannia with superior guns and armor , Germany might have deftly kicked the legs out from under it . After all , Allied maritime , naval , industrial , and financial resources were even more staggering than Allied tonnage sunk . The Admiralty reported a strength of 22 dreadnoughts and 40 predreadnought battleships in August 1914 , but despite war losses the Royal Navy ended the conflict with 33 dreadnoughts alone . Light cruisers had gone from 64 prewar to 89 in commission by the November 1918 armistice , while the number of destroyers nearly doubled , from 219 to 409 . " Our view is that the resources of the Allies for production and transport are greater than those of the Germans for destruction , " noted Alan Garrett Anderson , the newly appointed controller of the Royal Navy , in August 1917. 17 <p> This was therefore not about limited conflict firmly resolving political differences in a single day with a greater number of superior weapons , something neither the British nor German people at home wanted to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Admiralty , for " had we used the Navys bare fist instead of its gloved hand from the beginning , we could in all likelihood have shortened the war .

The minority camp , led by Mitchell , advocated on behalf of establishing an independent service for aerial warfare . He contended that air power would serve a purpose beyond supporting the Armys ground movements , and that gaining and maintaining preeminence of the skies required an entirely autonomous branch with indigenous manning , personnel , logistics , and acquisition duties . His opponents , on the other hand , favored integrating aviation into the existing services . Budgets were tight , and Army brass were eager to garner additional funding streams . <p> Ultimately , the politics of the day prevailed , and the Armys forceful lobby succeeded in preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for insubordination , and in 1926 the Air Corps Act created the U.S. Army Air Corps .

The postwar legislation created the Department of the Air Force and at 65 years old , that force is the most formidable aerial warfare branch in the world . <h> Deja Vu <p> Today we find ourselves in an almost identical situation with cyberspace .

" Unlike the Army of the 1920s , though , the Air Force lost the bureaucratic battle for control of cyberspace . In 2008 , the Defense Department denied its permanent activation in favor of a joint organization , and in 2010 the Pentagon officially stood up the U.S. Cyber Command ( CYBERCOM ) and designated it at initial operational capability status .

SOCOMs official history cites the opposition of Admiral William Crowe , then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special operators have navigated an interagency environment alongside intelligence-community counterparts since their founding . Those who fear redundancy between a distinct cyber branch within the armed services and its closest intelligence-community partner , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , should look no further than SOCOMs relationship with the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) . While military special operators have established their own organic intelligence-gathering capabilities , and the CIA has recently enhanced its kinetic capabilities , the two organizations enjoy a mutually symbiotic relationship . Further , a dedicated cyber branch would assuage the tension that SOCOM endures between administrative and operational control of its personnel . In this respect , a single branch for cyber warfare would better facilitate manning , training , and equipping forces for the conduct of operations . <h> Modernizing Joint for the Next-Gen Warfighter <p> Operational art is achieved through the convergence of otherwise opposing worldviews . The joint environment facilitates this healthy ideological clash by mandating the cohabitation of diverse military disciplines for the purpose of tactical , operational , and strategic planning . Wargaming , course-of-action development , center-of-gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room full of different-colored uniforms . Currently , in the joint world , the Army offers its perspective from land operations , just as the Navy does the sea and the Air Force the air . This forced meshing of domain-related views has proven highly valuable for meeting combatant commanders intent for planning in all domains . Anyone who has worked in a joint environmentfrom the Joint Staff scripting strategic doctrine down to a Joint Operations Center churning out tactical orderswould agree that intellectual diversity is paramount to mission success . <p> The problem , however , is that no one service specializes in cyberspace operations . Because cyberspace is now an established military domain , combatant commanders are eager to integrate a new institutional perspective into military plans . Today , cyber planners from the Army , Navy , Marine Corps , Air Force , and Coast Guard fill the institutional gap . At a time when the doctrine for cyberspace operations is still immature , these personnel are not only ideologically biased by their operational pastbe it on land , at sea , or in airbut they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as long as Americas cyber warriors belong to big Army , Navy , or Air Force , they will always be at least partially influenced by their experiences in another domain , thus depriving joint operations of an institutionally untainted warfighter . Further , having cyber assets in each branch produces unnecessary redundancy ; in an era of increasing threats amidst austerity , having a branch dedicated to cyber with streamlined financial accountability makes economic sense . Cyber warriors across the military equipped with institutional cohesion amongst one another better serves U.S. national-security objectives than those same cyber warriors maintaining institutional allegiance to an existing branch . <p> Before we can fully modernize the joint environment , though , it is critical to recruit and train Americas military to operate on the 21st centurys digital battlefield . As with any battlespace , the case for a U.S. Cyber Force starts with peopleand Americas cyber warriors demand more than just their own uniforms . Perhaps surprisingly , the vast majority of CYBERCOMs military personnel are experiencing cyberspace for the first time in their careers . Helicopter pilots , chemical officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acquisition specialists occupy CYBERCOMs ranks . These personnel enter the cyber trenches at all levels of leadership with little to no related experience , so the command invests heavily in expensive training regimens to mitigate gaping proficiency holes . The long-term return on investment is strikingly minimal , however , as most personnel rotate out after three years to an entirely different discipline . The lucky few who received prior training from their respective branches are typically influenced by their services legacy doctrine , thus inducing confusion among the joint ranks . For example , cyber soldiers typically default to information-operations doctrine , whereas cyber sailors often view cyberspace operations through the lens of electronic warfare . <h> Civilians Also Occupy the Cyber Trenches <p> In addition to military personnel , civilians also occupy the cyber trenches . While the Air Force failed to take ownership of the cyber domain in 2008 , it did gain the majority stake of civilian personnel management . Through no fault of its own , though , the Air Force lacks the requisite human-resources capacity to acquire and retain the nations best technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build and market a brand that attracts an entirely different civilian than the Air Force is accustomed to targeting . To compete with the private sector in an increasingly lucrative field , the DOD must offer attractive incentives . In this respect , the Pentagons uptight and hierarchical culture is hardly preferable to the free-spirited and flat cultures that characterize the sunny offices of Palo Altos technology start-ups . Today , the Air Force does not even offer Senior Executive Service ( the civilian equivalent to generals and admirals ) positions at CYBERCOM , so upward mobility is capped . <p> Recruiting the appropriate military personnel is equally important . " The Few , The Proud , The Marines , " is a great slogan for attracting young infantry candidates seeking to tackle a specific mission and share in a storied heritage of elite warriors , but it hardly appeals to the wily hacker types who must populate the cyber trenches . Therefore , the Corps cyber component , Marine Forces Cyber Command , is compelled to choose cyber warriors from among its existing ranks of Devil Dogsthe same Marines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in dapper uniforms donning shiny swords . As a general proposition , <p> Marines are of course much more accustomed to navigating amphibious terrain than global highways of fiber-optic cables or the Washington Beltways network of bureaucrats . Imagine , though , if the U.S. Cyber Force landed a commercial spot during the Super Bowlor better yet , an advertising deal with World of Warcraft ? How about 30-second ads on YouTube videos from the Black Hat hacker convention ? Even Don Draper of Mad Men fame could not resist the creative potential of such a brand . Today , CYBERCOM does not even have a public-facing website , let alone a Twitter or Facebook account to target the 20-somethings who never knew a world without computers . Only a new service is capable of generating enough brand appeal to recruit and retain Americas next-generation warfighter . <h> Thinking Ahead <p> The U.S. Cyber Force would be a drastic but timely innovation for Americas military . A dedicated branch would be smaller in size than the Marine Corps with comparatively low physical-fitness standards and noticeably relaxed grooming standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bear the likeness of G.I. Joe . The uniform of the day might resemble that of a conservatively dressed Googlerthe branchs motto artfully inscribed across the chest in MD5 hash . <p> With the other services looking to downsize , technically apt military personnel would get first dibs on populating the new ranks . In addition to absorbing existing people , raising the new cyber branchs profile would attract a diverse pool of patriotic technologists , ranging from high school hackers to Silicon Valleys computer scientists . The cyber trenches must include pure geeks , with an unparalleled command of coding , and emotionally intelligent social scientists who are equally comfortable with technology and policy . Operating in cyberspace necessitates deft maneuvering to navigate the dizzying ambiguities of a virtual domain while overcoming the stifling stovepipes of Washingtons bureaucratic behemoths . Shunning divergent personalities from the military apparatus is a parasitic posture ; by engendering commonality in wearing the cloth of our nation , all military branches will be better suited to integrate cyberspace capabilities . Accordingly , the U.S. Cyber Forces non-techies are critical to facilitating the convergence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indispensable to advancing the Americas interests in cyberspace . <p> As with any major organizational revision , the skeptics will inevitably voice concerns . Antiwar activists will warn of provoking the militarization of cyberspace , and privacy advocates will object on the basis of recent accusations of domestic surveillance . Other opponents will tacitly acknowledge the sound logic but will be intimidated by the daunting prospect of change . In reality , the path to a new service would be gradual . The next logical step is dividing the bureaucratic relationship between CYBERCOM and NSA , principally by appointing exclusive leaders for each organization and then cementing the commands autonomy by granting it unified combatant command status , thereby releasing it from the oversight of the Omaha-based U.S. Strategic Command . A fully empowered and independent functional combatant command is a halfway house on the way to an independent service branch . <p> Of course , the U.S. Cyber Forces mission would be strictly governed by the longstanding tenets of the Posse Comitatus Act , just like any other branch of the armed services . In fact , establishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go a long way toward allaying the concerns of civil libertarians by bringing greater transparency to the cyber domain and subjecting the service to a whole host of oversight mechanisms , as well as more clearly delineated funding streams . As far as domestic cyberspace is concerned , the U.S. Cyber Force would have no jurisdiction whatsoever in the United States ; in fact , perhaps its time to learn from aviation again and consider modeling a domestic cyber-security agency on the Federal Aviation Administration . <p> Military institutions do not dictate the degree to which a domain constitutes a venue for warfare ; rather , militaries merely react logically to changes in state and non-state behavior . In the case of both airspace and cyberspace , technological innovation was the primary driver of behavioral change . With the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of hyper-connected technologies , we are once again on the beach at Kitty Hawk . The Wright Brothers spent three years there experimenting with flight and now , more than three years after then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates commissioned the U.S. Cyber Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigadier General Billy Mitchells wisdom extends beyond just airspace ; it pertains to all domains of warfare .

But the key to understanding why the surprise assault was so successful lies in realizing what the Japanese did right . <p> Pearl Harbor . Of all the aspects of the attack on that 7 December 1941 Sunday morning-including its treachery , swiftness , daring , and skillful execution-none seems more compelling than the assault 's total surprise . This element is even more striking , knowing that just prior to the attack , a U.S. Army radar site at Opana Point , on Oahu , tracked incoming aircraft , and the Navy discovered a foreign submarine at the entrance to Pearl Harbor . Add to this mixture that American code-breakers were reading Japanese diplomatic messages of all types , and it seems simply incredible that Japan could pull off a thorough surprise attack . <p> Yet it did precisely that . How Japan could do so has intrigued Americans ever since . Vast literature , written mostly from an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing answers to the same questions : How did the Japanese arrive in secret , and why were the Americans caught so off guard ? Not unexpectedly , these writings mostly dwell on American errors and shortcomings and usually treat Japanese planning and preparations for the strike in an abbreviated , sometimes dismissive manner . Even a standard history such as Gordon Prange 's At Dawn We Slept concludes with 11 pages recounting American failures , while giving Japanese efforts three paragraphs , one of which attributes a major place to " unadulterated luck . " 1 Proponents of the Pearl Harbor conspiratorial thesis reduce the Japanese to mere puppets , acting unconsciously to the whims of President Franklin D. Roosevelt ( and , according to a few , British Prime Minister Winston Churchill ) . 2 <p> While the air assault that morning was , in the words of Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Husband E. Kimmel , a " beautifully planned and executed military maneuver , " it was the Japanese preparations that allowed the Pearl Harbor Task Force , the Kido Butai , to approach Hawaii undetected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preliminaries , the attack would have never succeeded . <p> Comprehending Japan 's prewar change in naval strategy and how the Japanese combined four major parts of the assault plan-denial and deception ( D&amp;D ) , radio intelligence ( RI ) , cryptology , and operations security-is critical to understanding how the Japanese were able to pull off the attack . These components often complemented each other . One part would lead , reinforce , or extend another , and lessons learned during training and exercises sorted out which techniques worked . Simply put , how the Japanese prepared for the attack is what assured their success that morning , and it is likely the Americans could have done nothing to alter significantly the outcome of the attack . <h> Switching from Defense to Offense <p> Strategy is the script nations write for themselves that dictates subsequent policy and plans . Japan 's pre-eminent interest after World War I was to expand and preserve economic hegemony in East Asia , principally China . But to fulfill that strategic aim , Japan would face opposition from colonial powers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain an economic " Open Door " in China and protect its island possessions . In the years prior to Pearl Harbor , Japanese-American relations were marked by confrontations over Japanese expansion into China , the seizure of Manchuria , and a buildup of naval forces and facilities in the Pacific . <p> Japan 's naval strategy closely followed its national aims . It envisioned a two-part mission : support operations to expand to the south into Southeast Asia and the Netherlands East Indies , while protecting the Home Islands from an expected attack by the U.S. Pacific Fleet , which might threaten Japan directly or its commercial supply routes . <p> The effective spearheads for the Western Pacific foreign policies of both nations were their respective navies : the Pacific Fleet and the Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) . Both countries expected and trained for eventual conflict . For the Japanese , though , the naval strategy it adopted for most of the two decades prior to 1941 was essentially defensive in nature . While elements of the IJN would be engaged elsewhere to the south , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in the home waters around the Japanese archipelago and await the expected riposte by the reinforced Pacific Fleet . Once the American ships deployed , the Japanese fleet would sortie out and seek a " decisive battle " somewhere in the mid-Pacific region . 4 <p> As ship technology advanced and Japanese carriers acquired more punch from more capable aircraft , the location of the climactic clash moved eastward until , by the late 1930s , the Japanese Naval General Staff ( NGS ) planned for it to occur near the Mariana Islands , some 1,400 miles southeast of Japan . Ironically , and with implications for Pearl Harbor , American plans fit neatly together with the Japanese expectations . American naval planners , in War Plan Orange and its various permutations , would send the reinforced Pacific Fleet across the Central Pacific to meet the Japanese Combined Fleet somewhere near the Marshall or Caroline Islands and destroy it before moving on to the Philippines and the eventual investment of the Japanese Home Islands . 5 <p> The Japanese strategic defense scenario remained a fixture in their fleet exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly through radio intelligence and reports by naval attach ? <p> s , was aware of this plan . As early as 1927 , American radio monitors and traffic analysts had plotted the IJN annual grand maneuvers and determined that the Japanese strategic posture was largely defensive . 6 This intelligence estimate , which continued into 1941 , convinced the U.S. Navy 's leadership that Japan 's main battle force would remain in home waters and await the U.S. Pacific Fleet 's move west . American naval war planning , epitomized in WPAC-46 under Admiral Kimmel , counted on this inaction and called for an advance across the Central Pacific once hostilities began . 7 <p> In January 1941 , however , Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto proposed the idea of a sneak attack on Pearl Harbor . In essence , he overturned more than two decades of Japanese naval strategic thinking . The Japanese NGS opposed this idea for nearly nine months before yielding to Yamamoto . Planning , training , and war games in September 1941 revealed technical and operational shortcomings that needed to be fixed if his plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not detect the shift in thinking . American radio intelligence continued to analyze Japanese naval activity in 1941 within the context of the old defensive strategy . U.S. analysts assumed the carriers and most of the battle line would remain in Japanese home waters . All Yamamoto needed was some way to convince the Americans to continue to think that way . <h> Covering Up the Strategic Change <p> The key to the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor-specifically , what enabled the Pearl Harbor Striking Force to reach its launch point undetected ( and totally unsuspected ) by the Americans-was Tokyo 's radio denial-and-deception actions . Significantly , these activities simply were not just a " bag of tricks " meant to bemuse U.S. naval radio intelligence . Rather , they constituted a function of the change in Japanese strategy and were meant to convince the Americans that there had been no change from defensive to offensive intentions . <p> Two observations about Japanese D&amp;D further explain its success . First , the impetus for the IJN 's elaborate radio ruse was its awareness of the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier , in March and June 1941 , when carriers had been dispatched south to support Tokyo 's policy toward occupied French Indochina , Japanese radio intelligence discovered that the British monitoring site in Hong Kong had identified and tracked the large ships . ( It is not known if the Japanese realized that American naval radio intelligence had done so as well . ) Alerted to the vulnerability of its communications to foreign RI , the Japanese naval command was compelled to devise a counterplan. 8 <p> Second , the radio D&amp;D program began in mid-November 1941 on the heels of a weeklong communications drill-a series of scheduled radio contacts between selected ships and stations . 9 The deception was intended to appear to American radio monitors in the Philippines and Hawaii as a continuation of the same communications exercise . The drill had begun as the ships of the Kido Butai moved to a rendezvous point in the Inland Sea of Japan . The deception phase kicked in as the ships of the task force " buttoned up " on their way to the Kuriles on 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hawaii and the Philippines intercepted about a dozen transmissions-no messages , just calls and radio " chatter " -seemingly from the IJN carriers . This paucity of monitored emissions worked to Japan 's advantage since it reinforced an American perception that Tokyo 's carriers were in home waters and largely inactive , which was reported in Communications Intelligence Unit summaries to Admiral Kimmel as " nothing on the carriers " or " no information . " Kimmel would report to various hearings that these periods of silence or inactivity were nothing new ; at least eight times in the previous six months it was uncertain where the ships were because of few or no transmissions. 10 <p> As the carriers ' apparent transmissions were picked up by the U.S. Navy monitoring station at Corregidor , the Philippines , direction-finding ( DF ) gear was used to plot lines of bearing on the their call signs . 11 The resulting lines crossed over the Japanese naval bases of Sasebo , Kure , or Yokosuka , which suggested the carriers were at these bases . For American naval intelligence analysts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lines verified the conclusion that the carriers were still in home waters as expected , refitting , training , or preparing for the expected emergence of the Pacific Fleet from Pearl Harbor . 12 More important , these lines of bearing also coincided with results obtained on the carriers ' transmissions from August through November 1941 , as the IJN operated in the waters around the southern Home Island of Kyushu. 13 <p> Whatever projections U.S. naval authorities had about the activities of the IJN in late 1941 , they included no sense of an immediate threat to Pearl Harbor by Japanese carriers . Their own radio intelligence confirmed this . <h> Monitoring American Radio Traffic <p> The role of Japanese radio intelligence , primarily by the IJN , but also the small part played by Japan 's Post , Telegraph , and Telephone ( PT&amp;T ) Ministry , has remained largely unknown to Americans . Most narratives mention a small team on board the Kido Butai 's flagship , the carrier Akagi , which listened to Hawaiian commercial stations for any alert . But that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence is information that can be gleaned from communications excluding cryptanalysis . RI is derived from the " externals " of messages and the transmission of such traffic , such as message priority , call signs , and radio direction finding . In a useful analogy , radio intelligence is like studying the envelope and delivery method of a letter . We can learn who sent it , the date , relative size , and the delivery system . But any conclusion based on RI is largely inferential and can be misleading without corroborative intelligence . <p> For years before the Japanese Navy began to grapple with Yamamoto 's idea for a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor , the IJN 's radio intelligence section had monitored U.S. Pacific Fleet exercises and activities . While the Japanese intercepted and studied the communications of other fleets in the Pacific , such as the Royal Navy and Soviet Pacific Squadron , the Pacific Fleet was its priority target . Like most major navies , Japan had established an RI capability early in the 1920s . Radio intelligence was handled in the " Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Staff , which used listening posts on various Japanese-held islands . Tokyo also dispatched merchant ships with special monitoring teams on board to track annual U.S. fleet exercises . 14 <p> In late May 1940 , President Roosevelt ordered the Pacific Fleet to remain in Pearl Harbor after the completion of Fleet Problem XXI . ( The fleet had been based in San Diego , California , with Pearl Harbor serving as an advanced deployment base . ) Roosevelt hoped it would act as some sort of deterrent . 15 An unexpected result of the move , however , was that the Pacific Fleet 's communications were now within range of the Japanese RI station on Kwajalein . Listening in on Pearl Harbor , this unit , the First Detachment of the Sixth Communications Unit , was able to gather much more intelligence than before the transfer . Additional information came from Japan 's PT&amp;T Ministry , which monitored commercial telegrams and radio telephone calls by Pacific Fleet Sailors to their families on the mainland . Sailing schedules , supply-train arrivals , unit manning , and ship locations were available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleet headquarters communications with Navy outposts on Midway , Guam , Samoa , and Johnston Island . <p> Into the summer of 1941 , as plans for the attack on Pearl Harbor advanced , the IJN beefed up its radio-intelligence coverage of the American military presence in Hawaii . Two more stations , on Saipan and near Tokyo , now covered the communications of the Pacific Fleet and the U.S. Army Air Corps in Hawaii . A new RI command structure in Tokyo organized the effort with a greater emphasis on ship identification and direction finding . Daily reports from Kwajalein , which included listings of U.S. Navy call signs for its ships and shore stations , were passed to Tokyo . Call signs for ships such as the USS Arizona ( BB-39 ) , Enterprise ( CV-6 ) , and Astoria ( CA-34 ) were noted . 17 The Kwajalein DF station tracked the routes of American aircraft flying among the U.S. Pacific bases , but more important , it tracked reconnaissance flights around the Hawaiian Islands . The results revealed that the flights were almost exclusively to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the direction from which the Kido Butai would approach , remained uncovered . <p> Radio intelligence supplemented reports from Japanese agent Takeo Yoshikawa , who operated out of the consulate in Honolulu . His information was the primary intelligence source for the IJN on Pearl Harbor , but his tenure was precarious . At any time he could be compromised and shut down . Also , his reports were limited . He provided little information on U.S. air activity around Hawaii , his intelligence could take up to two days to reach the Kido Butai , and he had no way of monitoring radio communications . When the attack came , his role would end . Japanese RI , however , could compensate for all the shortcomings . <p> The U.S. Pacific command did not miss the spike in Japanese DF activity . A daily Traffic Intelligence Summary presented to Admiral Kimmel noted that since October Japanese DF nets were extremely active . The 28 November edition carried an assessment by Commander Edward Layton , Kimmel 's fleet intelligence officer , that the Japanese DF was " getting results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DF messages encrypted in a special cipher , Layton could not have known that they contained information on the critical holes in the American aerial reconnaissance around Hawaii . <p> One further aspect of Japanese RI against Hawaii occurred in late 1940 as the U.S. Army Signal Corps was testing a new speech-scrambler system for radio telephone calls between Honolulu and San Francisco . Designed by AT&amp;T , this A-3 device was already in use between Washington and U.S. embassies in Europe . When the scrambler was turned on for the test , an operator in Japan broke in and asked if something was wrong with the channel , because Tokyo could not understand the voice transmission between the two American terminals . This indicated that the Japanese PT&amp;T Ministry was monitoring calls between Honolulu and the United States . 19 <p> As the Japanese strike force approached the Hawaiian Islands , it was receiving current radio intelligence via a Tokyo naval broadcast ( which it did not need to acknowledge by radio ) , from monitoring and DF units at three land sites , as well as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just to commercial broadcasts from Honolulu but naval and air communications as well . Additionally , numerous Japanese Sixth Fleet submarines dispatched earlier to scout the area and attack U.S. ships carried small radio-intercept teams , whose mission was to provide intelligence to the submarines . 20 <p> The Japanese RI effort would keep the Kido Butai informed of any changes to the status of U.S. forces in Hawaii and warn the task force if its presence was known . <h> Breaking the Japanese Codes <p> Japanese cryptology , like its radio-intelligence program , began in earnest after World War I. The IJN opted for codebooks and charts . It further encrypted messages by using auxiliary systems such as transposition ciphers , which scrambled the code groups according to a key . Thanks to a combination of good cryptanalysis and the purloining of copies of these early codes , American code-breakers from the Navy 's OP-20-G broke and exploited the encrypted messages for about 15 years . <p> In mid-1939 , the IJN brought in a new general purpose operational code , designated AN by the Americans . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital cipher to encrypt them . American naval code-breakers had made limited progress on this system when the Japanese replaced it in December 1940 with a new code , designated AN-1 , with more than 50,000 code groups . <p> The mistaken claim that the AN-1 code was being " read " or exploited at the time of Pearl Harbor is based on out-of-context quotes and numerous technical misunderstandings of the U.S. code-breaking process . A review of the monthly progress statements of the U.S. Navy 's code-breaking section , OP-20-GYP-1 , shows minimal recovery of the code-only about 8 percent of the 50,000 code groups had been recovered . The U.S. Navy could not glean intelligence from messages encrypted with AN-1 until early 1942 , and even then , the results were fragmentary at best . 21 No intelligence about Pearl Harbor could come from this source . <p> The Americans , however , could exploit encrypted Japanese diplomatic messages to a great degree , though not quite as much as imagined by later historians . From late 1939 to mid-1940 , Japan introduced new diplomatic ciphers to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and several manual systems , including the J-19 enciphered code . Within 1.5 years , these systems had largely succumbed to American Army and Navy code-breaking elements . Still , the rates for exploitation of these messages were not that high . From 1 November to 7 December 1941 , 59 percent of all Purple messages between Tokyo and Washington and 16 percent of J-19 were translated . 22 <p> Japan 's own code-breaking effort was another story . While Japanese naval cryptanalysts could make no headway into the primary U.S. naval systems , Tokyo could read American diplomatic systems , including old codes such as the Brown and Grey series . Unknown to the Americans , however , Tokyo also could read the high-level system M-138 strip cipher . Considered secure by the Americans , the system had been compromised in 1940 , and the Japanese Foreign Ministry was able to read many significant American diplomatic dispatches prior to hostilities . 23 It is still unclear what advantage the Japanese gained from this ability . <h> Keeping the Secret <p> Operations Security ( OPSEC ) consists of all measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , is denied to an enemy . Although defensive in nature , certain OPSEC techniques , such as quarantine , can be proactive . <p> For the Japanese , securing the secret of the Pearl Harbor operation meant instituting security measures to restrict access to knowledge of the attack to only those who had " the need to know " as well as to keep anyone-foreign or domestic-away from Kido Butai training areas , facilities , or personnel . <p> From the beginning of the planning for the Hawaii operation in early January 1941 until the summer of that year , the IJN kept information about the plan limited to small groups of officers within the operations and command staffs of the Combined Fleet , the Naval General Staff , and the First Air Fleet . By August and September , as preparations intensified , more people within the IJN learned of the plan . Army and civilian leaders were alerted to the plan late in 1941 . It is possible that the senior Army leadership learned of the plan by August and cabinet officers in early November , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Japanese diplomats in Washington and Honolulu were not informed of the attack , which was the best way to ensure they sincerely relayed Tokyo 's insincere negotiating points . <p> Within the IJN , the 700 printed copies of Yamamoto 's Combined Fleet Top Secret Operations Order No. 1 of 5 November 1941 to the IJN did not carry the annex for the Hawaiian operations . The majority of senior officers of the Kido Butai were not officially notified of the plan until 17 November , when Yamamoto held his last conference with the task force commanders . The rest of the crews were not told of the attack until the ships reached the anchorage at Tankan Bay in the Kuriles on 23 November . There , all mail and communications between the sailors and Japan were curtailed . 25 <p> Interestingly , Japanese OPSEC around the plan extended to their enciphered diplomatic and naval messages . Tokyo 's diplomatic traffic included references to activity in Southeast Asia and a probable starting date for the campaign , 8 December ( Tokyo time ) as " X-day , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoshikawa 's reports from Honolulu were no different than those from other sites such as Manila and the Panama Canal-detailed intelligence but no mention of an attack . Encrypted operational , weather , and training messages meant for the Kido Butai never openly mentioned Pearl Harbor ; the plan and target could only be inferred from the postwar decrypts . <p> Japanese restrictions against prying attaches and diplomats proved effective . Areas around Kyushu as well as the southern island 's navy yard and training areas had been closed off to foreign observation . By 17 November , the American ambassador to Tokyo , Joseph Grew , informed Washington that security was so tight in Japan that the embassy could no longer be counted on to provide an effective war warning . 26 Japanese newspaper stories about the navy had been censored . Foreign ships approaching training areas near Kyushu had been stopped . Potential adversaries ' ships were escorted out of the area , while one , a Filipino freighter , was boarded , its radio sealed and seized , and the ship sailed to Naha , Okinawa. 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

In Washington , the same frame of mind existed among the political , naval , and military leadership . Washington and Honolulu were aware of the Japanese threat to attack areas in Southeast Asia . Reports had come in of Japanese troopships and escorts moving south toward Malaya and of aerial reconnaissance over the Philippines , developments indicating plans in that region . But Pearl Harbor ? A surprise attack was not part of the calculations in Honolulu or Washington . <p> This unpreparedness had nothing to do with an imaginary conspiracy high within the U.S. government . The reason was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intelligence they had received , almost exclusively , from U.S. radio intelligence and diplomatic code-breaking . The intelligence told them the Japanese were moving south and hostilities were likely to begin soon , but Pearl Harbor was not in danger . The best available intelligence on the only real threat to the Pacific Fleet , the Japanese carriers , indicated they were in home waters . This is what Admiral Kimmel reported to the Roberts Commission soon after the attack . So certain was he that there was no threat , he had held back patrol planes to have them ready for the expected order to execute an offensive plan , WPAC-46. 28 <p> In Washington just a few hours before the attack , the Office of Naval Intelligence handed its estimate of Japanese naval forces to the secretaries of State , War , and the Navy . It placed all of the IJN 's fleet carriers at home .

" Likely recalling the incident of the Japanese listening in on the A-3 scrambler tests , he instead chose to send the information in a telegram . 30 <p> All of this is not to say the Japanese did not make mistakes or tempt chance . They did . The part of the attack plan that called for midget submarines to infiltrate Pearl Harbor nearly ruined the surprise . The carrier task force sailed east " blind . " Submarines meant to scout ahead were pulled back because of high seas , and the Kido Butai 's air chief , Commander Genda Minoru , decided against air reconnaissance because the planes could get lost , ask for a navigational beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Still , the Americans never pierced the shroud the Japanese Navy draped over the Pearl Harbor attack . Due to the sparse information , intelligence officers like Edwin Layton may have occasionally been uncertain of the carriers ' location , but at no time did he or others have any indication of the approaching Kido Butai . The Japanese completely fooled U.S. intelligence . <p> The implication of that is a far more sobering conclusion than any imagined conspiracy , for it revealed that a knowledgeable and technically adept opponent could effectively negate apparent advantages held by the American intelligence community . So effective was the Japanese denial-and-deception campaign that , when asked during a Pearl Harbor investigation when he finally again heard from the carriers , the chief of the Communications Intelligence Unit in Hawaii , Commander Joseph Rochefort , could only reply , " The 7th of December .

A vast armada of U.S. ships , from carriers and battleships to destroyer escorts , suffered staggering losses from kamikaze attacks . Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher 's flagship , the Bunker Hill , right , took two kamikaze hits within 30 seconds , setting off fuel explosions that killed more than 350 of her crew . <p> The three-month battle for Okinawa in spring 1945 was an epic struggle . It pitted the U.S. Fifth Fleetone of the mightiest armadas the world has seenagainst thousands of Japanese kamikaze suicide aircraft , flown by young volunteers intent on crashing into U.S. ships for the glory of their emperor and the survival of their country . Strategic planners in both Washington and Tokyo anticipated that the Okinawa campaign would forecast the tactics and slaughter to be expected on an even larger scale when the Allies finally invaded the Japanese home islands . Yet , the battle for Okinawa had its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attrition that claimed an average of 3,000 lives each day , among the antagonists as well as the native Okinawans . In the simultaneous air-sea combat waged offshore , the Japanese sought to prove their disciplined suicide pilots could defeat the technological superiority of the U.S. fleet . At the end of the 90-day ordeal , the fleet prevailed , maintaining its ' round-the-clock support to the Tenth Army ashore , even while sustaining the loss of more sailors and ships than in any other conflict in the Navy 's history . Reviewing the losses , Admiral Raymond A. Spruance , commanding the Fifth Fleet , described the battle for Okinawa as " " a bloody , hellish prelude to the invasion of Japan . " " 1 <p> The campaign began with an exchange of preemptive strikes that gave notice the war at sea had become decidedly more dangerous the closer the U.S. fleet approached Japan . Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher assembled the fast carriers of his vaunted Task Force 58 in Ulithi Atoll the second week of March to commence final preparations for Operation Iceberg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitscher convened a conference with his principal subordinates on board his flagship , the Essex ( CV-9 ) -class fleet carrier Bunker Hill ( CV-17 ) . <p> Mitscher and his superiors , Admiral Spruance and Fleet Admiral Chester W. Nimitz , commanding the Central Pacific Theater , shared a concern about the increasing lethality of the Pacific War . Peleliu , Luzon , and Iwo Jima had been unexpectedly costly , exacerbated by the enemy 's increasing resort to suicide attacks . The initiation of Japanese kamikaze attacks against U.S. ships , first in the Philippines , then at Iwo Jima , posed an undeniable threat to fleet operations in support of an amphibious campaign . Mitscher warned his task group commanders to expect hundredspossibly thousandsof suicide planes in the Ryukyu Islands . <p> Mitscher 's warnings were prophetic . At the same time he convened the meeting on the Bunker Hill , an old adversary , Vice Admiral Matome Ugaki , commanding the Japanese Fifth Air Fleet , said farewell to a group of volunteer flight crews preparing for a long-distance , one-way mission from Kyushu to attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast . Ugaki , who had served as chief of staff to the legendary Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and later commanded the battleships during the Battle of Leyte Gulf , had devised Operation Tan , a preemptive strike against Mitscher 's fast carriers . <p> Admiral Ugaki launched his 24 bombers the morning of 11 March . Bad weather and mechanical problems en route thinned the numbers to a handful , but one suicide bomber swept into the lagoon just after sunset , spotted the USS Randolph ( CV-15 ) loading ammunition under spotlights , and crashed into her flight deck aft , destroying 14 aircraft and setting her ablaze . It was a sobering introduction to the operation . <p> Three days later , Mitscher 's Task Force 58 sortied from Ulithi , heading north , intent on launching a preemptive strike of its own against Kyushu 's many airfields . Ugaki 's reconnaissance aircraft shadowed the U.S. carriers as they approached Kyushu , warning the Japanese in time for them to disperse and camouflage most of their aircraft . Pilots in the U.S. fighters making the first sweep were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing how exposed his carriers were in Japanese waters , but he extended his penetration to allow additional daylight raids against likely kamikaze airfields . The enemy made him pay . Japanese bombers hit the fleet carriers Wasp ( CV-18 ) and Franklin ( CV-13 ) on 19 March with devastating results . The Wasp lost 200 men killed , but the Franklin hit by two bombs while refueling and rearming her planes on the flight decksuffered terrible damage and the deaths of more than 700 men . Raging fires detonated the exposed ordnance , including new 11.75-inch Tiny Tim rockets . Hundreds of men were blown into the sea . " " The Franklin was a huge mass of explosions , flames , and a tremendous column of smoke , " " recalled Commander Thomas H. Morton , gunnery officer of the battleship North Carolina ( BB-55 ) , steaming astern of the stricken carrier . " " There must have been hundreds of her crew in the water . . . some had jumped , some had been blown over , and some were badly injured . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight to save his crippled carrier . Retaining a skeleton crew on board , Gehres evacuated hundreds of wounded men , suppressed the fires , stopped the flooding , and welcomed a tow from the cruiser Pittsburgh ( CA-72 ) . Through their efforts , the Franklin became the most heavily damaged U.S. carrier to survive , making her slow but determined way to New York under her own power , an extraordinary 12,000-mile voyage home . <p> Task Force 58 fared poorly in a sea fight for the first time since its creation more than a year earlier . Mitscher withdrew from Japanese waters , carefully shielding his cripples . With the Okinawa invasion barely ten days ahead , Mitscher sensed the Fifth Fleet was in for the fight of its life . <p> Anticipating the U.S. invasion of Okinawa as a final stage before the ultimate invasion of the homeland , the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters ordered the formation of suicide forces designated " " Special Attack Units . " " These were principally kamikazes , but their number also included vessels and small craft of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Kamikaze pilots were volunteers from both services , often mere teenagers flying substandard airplanes . Hundreds of them perished en route from storms , maintenance failures , or poor navigation . Combat air patrols and fleet antiaircraft fire from U.S. forces took a major toll . Yet , despite the attrition , an average of one in every five kamikazes who launched against the Fifth Fleet succeeded in crashing into a U.S. ship or causing shipboard damage by a near miss . <p> Even without the kamikazes , Okinawa presented a difficult objective for the Fifth Fleet . Protected by a barrier reef , offshore minefields , and submerged obstacles , the island was defended by an experienced field army reinforced with additional heavy artillery units . <p> Spruance took the threat seriously but planned the assault with confidence . Vice Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner , commanding the amphibious task force under Spruance , had prevailed against the Japanese in every major assault from Guadalcanal through Iwo Jima . Many of his captains were veterans of earlier difficult campaigns . Several ships , including the World War I-vintage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the more recently commissioned Allen M. Sumner ( DD-692 ) -class destroyer Laffey ( DD-724 ) , had played significant bombardment roles in the Normandy landing the previous year . <p> Spruance gave Turner the mission of landing the Tenth Army on Okinawa 's southwest coast on L-Day ( the overlapping assaults of Iwo Jima and the Philippines dictated a landing designation other than " " D-Day " " for Okinawa ) . Turner conducted extensive advance operations to clear minefields , bombard inland defenses , and seize the outlying Kerama Retta islands as a fleet repair and replenishment harbor . Turner also distracted the Japanese 32nd Army with an elaborate , division-level , decoy landing on Okinawa 's opposite coast . <p> These preliminary measures helped produce a nearly flawless landing on L-Day , 1 April 1945 . Under the protection of a heavy air and naval gunfire bombardment , Turner landed four divisions abreast with such well-orchestrated precision that 60,000 men were ashore and in possession of the key airfields by sunset . Navy Captain Ernest M. Eller , observing the landing from the flagship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " spectacular . Seeing four divisions land at once along several miles of beaches is quite a sight , like a giant cavalry charge afloat . " " 3 From Kyushu , Admiral Ugaki recorded in his diary , " " By evening the whole beach area had fallen with amazing swiftness . " " 4 <p> More significant , so carefully did Turner 's air and surface forces shepherd the massive flotillas of troop-laden transports that no Japanese bombers or kamikazes were able to disrupt the most vulnerable component of the main assault . Ugaki 's kamikazes fared better the following day , severely damaging the attack transport Henrico ( APA-45 ) , under way for a subsidiary landing with the 77th Army Division . But the Japanese had missed a prime opportunity to kill concentrated numbers of assailants before they stormed ashore . Captain Elliott B. Strauss , commanding the attack transport Charles Carroll ( APA-28 ) , recalled , " " The Japanese were foolish not to go after the transports , rather than the destroyer screen , because if they had actually sunk a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force much more . " " 5 <p> The fleet had landed the Tenth Army impressively , but the much more difficult part of the campaign became the ten-week struggle to support the troops ashore with naval gunfire and carrier air strikes while delivering a steady supply of ammunition , fuel , water , rations , and reinforcements . The protracted mission left the Fifth Fleet on a short tether around Okinawa , its ships not exactly sitting ducks but ever vulnerable to Japanese air raids . <p> Admiral Ugaki , as expected , attacked the U.S. fleet with hundreds of individual kamikazes and conventional bombers . In an unwelcome surprise for the invaders , he also launched ten different attacks by massed kamikazes , called kikusui ( " " floating chrysanthemums " " ) , with as many as 355 planes at a time , a nightmarish threat to the fleet . The Japanese also tried to enhance the effectiveness of the kikusui attacks by combining them with parallel distractions such as a major counterattack of the 32nd Army or the suicidal sortie of the super-battleship Yamato . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six months earlier during Battle of Leyte Gulf had heightened the adrenalin flow of every U.S. sailor in the fleet . Now the enormous warshipbereft of carrier air support and nearly starved for fuelno longer inspired fear . Dispatched on a desperate one-way suicide mission to Okinawa , escorted only by small task unit that served more as honorary pallbearer than as a protective screen , the Yamato posed little threat to the Fifth Fleet . Mitscher 's air groups intercepted the flotilla far from Okinawa , sinking the Yamato in less than an hour with bombs and aerial torpedoes . Ugaki briefly mourned the loss of his former flagship , recording in his diary , " " My dear Yamato finally went down in the China Sea . . . . " " 6 <p> Spruance , Turner , and Mitscher had greater concerns . On 12 April the Japanese launched their first oka , a piloted , rocket-boosted , suicide glider capable of diving at speeds of 500 miles per hour . The first oka hit the destroyer Mannert L. Abele ( DD-733 ) with such force that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychological stress of U.S. sailors struggling to shoot down kamikazes grew worse over time . The suicide aircraft and conventional bombers struck the fleet relentlessly . In daylight , some sailors manning the topside 40-mm guns on board the radar picket destroyers actually would see the faces of the kamikaze pilots in the last split seconds before their planes exploded . Kamikazes frequently attacked by moonlight , appearing as ghostly apparitions , " " like a giant bat gliding in , " " recalled 19-year-old Signalman First Class Nicholas Floros , an antiaircraft gunner on a medium landing ship at Okinawa. 7 Admiral Spruance , whose flagship USS Indianapolis ( CA-35 ) sustained heavy damage from a kamikaze just before the landing at Okinawa , described the nighttime raiders as " " witches on broomsticks. " " 8 Destroyer captains under attack desperately maneuvered their ships broadside to diving kamikazes to minimize the target depth and maximize clearance for all three main gun mounts . More kamikazes always seemed to be in the queue , some " " flaming like a torch " " in their death throes , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous fireball . The explosions did terrible damage , killing and burning many of the crew , blowing men topside overboard and trapping engine room gangs below decks . Dozens of ships went down ; many more limped back to the protected waters of Kerama Retto , only to be scuttled on a beach or abandoned and towed back out to sea as decoys . " " Those kamikazes scared the hell out of people , " " admitted Lieutenant Jerome H. King Jr. , the main battery officer aboard the light cruiser Mobile ( CL-63 ) . 9 When Commander Julian Becton conned his destroyer , the Normandy veteran Laffey , into Kerama Retto to replenish her ammo , the twisted and blackened wreckage of ships that littered the shoreline appalled him . One officer described the scene as " " an elephants ' burial ground . " " Becton said it felt like " " moving down the aisle in the middle of a hospital ward full of mangled and crippled casualties . " " 10 <p> Admiral Spruance fought back . He ordered the fighters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's combat air patrols , increased the frequency of Mitscher 's carrier raids against Kyushu 's airfields , and assigned Vice Admiral Sir H. B. Rawlings 's four Royal Navy carriers the mission of suppressing kamikaze fields in Formosa and the Sakishima Gunto islands . Spruance also launched amphibious landings to seize small islands off the coast of Okinawa to serve as extended fighter direction and early warning radar sites . From his forward headquarters in Guam , Admiral Nimitz prevailed on the Joint Chiefs of Staff to divert B-29 bombers from their daily raids on Honshu to pound Kyushu 's airfields . Nimitz became increasingly concerned about the fleet 's losses to Japanese air attacks and impatient with the Tenth Army 's slow progress in the land campaign . In late April he flew to Okinawa to urge Lieutenant General Simon B. Buckner to expedite his advance . Buckner bristled at what he considered unwarranted tactical interference by the theater commander . Nimitz retorted , " " I 'm losing a ship and a half a day . So if this line is n't moving within five days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can all get out from under these stupid air attacks . " " 11 <p> Buckner glowered at the threat , because " " getting the line moving " " was much easier said than done . Okinawa 's narrow width and transverse ridgelines offered only two offensive options . Buckner could continue grinding south into the teeth of the Japanese defenses , or he could use his considerable amphibious capability in a series of seaborne envelopments behind enemy lines . The appeal of the second alternative escaped Buckner , whose only previous experience with amphibious operations occurred when he observed Army landings in the Aleutian Islands in 1943 . Nimitz , a bold gambler in the Marshalls and a hard-hearted executor of the bloody Peleliu assault , declined to press the issue at Okinawa , perhaps leery of spiking the casualty count even higher despite the time-saving benefits . There the issue died . Nimitz departed , and Buckner resumed his frontal assaults . The campaign lurched forward , advancing only a few hundred yards each bloody day . Meanwhile , Japanese kamikazes continued to savage the Fifth Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea . <p> The Laffey ' s turn for picket duty came due . Commander Becton 's veteran crewmen prided themselves on their gunnery , but on the morning of 16 April they very nearly met their match . The destroyer arrived on station just after Admiral Ugaki unleashed the third kikusui attack , a swarm of 165 suicide planes . Several conventional bombers and 22 kamikazes attacked the Laffey over a span of 80 minutes . Becton 's gunners surpassed themselves , shooting down at least nine Japanese planes , but the ship suffered six kamikaze strikes and four bomb explosions . Heavily damaged , afire and barely afloat , and with more than 100 casualties among the crew , the Laffey kept her few remaining guns firing until the end . When the frenzied attacks finally ceased , Commander Becton gratefully accepted a tow back to Kerama Retta , " " the elephants ' burial ground . " " Miraculously to all who saw her ravaged superstructure and gun mounts , the Laffey survived and later commenced her long journey back to Seattle . <p> Kamikaze pilots with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation , seeking the carriers and battleships . One such pilot crashed into Mitscher 's flagship , the Bunker Hill , setting fires that killed more than 350 of the crew , knocking the big carrier out of the war . Mitscher transferred his flag to the battle-scarred carrier Enterprise ( CV-6 ) , only to abandon " " The Big E " " two days later when she in turn sustained a major kamikaze crash . Mitscher wound up on board the Randolph , freshly returned from damages sustained at Ulithi the day the campaign began . Gallows humor surfaced . Other carriers put out the word that Mitscher , now considered a bad luck Jonah , would not be welcomed aboard . British carriers with their steel decks fared better , withstanding several direct hits but avoiding the raging fires that ensued on the wooden decks of the U.S. ships . Battleships , with their thicker armor and bristling antiaircraft batteries , also fared well . Electrician 's Mate First Class Edward E. Logue watched a kamikaze attack his battleship New York on 14 April . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " " and his wings tore loose on the mainmast leg and the turret . He went right through there and left his wings on our deck , and the fuselage and him went in the drink on the other side . " " 12 <p> Veteran sailors were grateful that the Japanese had not launched these massive kamikaze attacks earlier in the war , especially at Guadalcanal , where the U.S. invasion fleet was much smaller and its antiaircraft target acquisition and gunnery so comparatively primitive . A crucial improvement in surviving battle devastation at sea since the early campaigns was the enhanced proficiency of shipboard damage control teams , then being trained by civilian firefighters at every major naval base . " " Friendly fire " " was an inevitable by-product of low-flying kamikazes attacking a crowded anchorage . Operational accidents took a further toll . During the second night after the landing , the destroyer Franks ( DD-554 ) experienced a glancing collision with USS New Jersey ( BB-62 ) in which the battleship 's anchor sliced off the port side of the destroyer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Bak Jr . raced to his station , but " " when I got to the bridge , my God , half the port side of the bridge was sliced away . . . . It was just like a knife going through at a 45 angle . " " 13 <p> The Fifth Fleet endured each catastrophe , rightfully earning the post-battle accolade " " The Fleet that Came to Stay . " " Their delivery of fire and logistic support to the Tenth Army never flagged . Hospital ships did yeoman work , despite the kamikaze crash on the USS Comfort ( AH-6 ) on 28 April that killed or wounded 60 patients , Army nurses , and crewmen . Carrier flight deck crews launched repeatedly , recovered , refueled , rearmed , and relaunched aircraft under harrowing conditions . Sailors throughout the fleet typically went to General Quarters an hour before dawn , nursing a mug of black coffee . Those still alive and afloat at day 's end thanked their lucky stars and slept lightly , awaiting the klaxon foretelling a night attack . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 36 ships sunk , 368 damaged , 4,900 men killed or drowned , another 4,800 wounded , 763 aircraft lost . Among the 145 ships sunk or so heavily damaged as to be out of action for 30 days or more , four were lost to mines , five to suicide small craft , three to coastal batteries , and 133 to Japanese air attacks . In the fighting ashore , the Tenth Army sustained nearly 40,000 combat casualties , plus an additional 26,000 " " non-battle " " casualties , primarily combat fatigue cases . Tens of thousands of Okinawan civilians died in the fighting . The terrible cost of seizing Okinawa influenced top-level planning for the invasion of Japan , scheduled to begin 1 November 1945 with an amphibious assault by the U.S. Sixth Army on southern Kyushu . Admiral Nimitz , who had favored the invasion plans in late April , changed his position a month later amid soaring Okinawa losses and intelligence reports of thousands of kamikaze planes and suicide boats being assembled for the defense of Kyushu . In June , President Harry S. Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the declaration that he wanted to prevent " " another Okinawa from one end of Japan to the other .

The Navy delayed repairing the ravaged ship until some 93,000 people could visit " " The Ship That Would Not Die " " and sense for themselves the fury of the kamikaze attacks and the fortitude of her crew .

With 3,700 British troops on standby in Cyprus , President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered two U.S. Marine battalion landing teams ashore . Among them was 21-year-old Sergeant Dick " Gunner " Driggs , who is now a retired Marine Chief Warrant Officer-5 . " Our mission was to ensure there was no interference with the Lebanese government by outside countries , " Driggs said . " Our rules of engagement were not to shoot back unless we had a clear target . " According to this description , the Marines ' 1958 mission was much the same as the one they were ordered to carry out in 1982 . <p> The 1958 operation was validated on 23 October when the Lebanese formed a government that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later to the day , the Corps would suffer its greatest loss of life in a single action since Iwo Jima when its Beirut barracks were blown up . <p> Eisenhower 's initiative delayed the Lebanese civil war until late 1975 .

As the conflict continued , Palestinians flowed in through Lebanon 's porous borders , with the Palestinian Liberation Organization using the country as a sanctuary where it could regroup and refit for hostile incursions into Israel . <p> In 1982 Israel struck back at the PLO by invading Lebanon . After the Israeli forces closed in on Beirut , the Lebanese government requested a multinational force to oversee the Palestinian fighters ' withdrawal from the city and to set up a permanent base of operations for future elements of the international force . U.S. Marines of the 32d MAU , along with French and Italian troops , began arriving in Beirut on 20 August . Israeli forces , meanwhile , dug in outside the city .

On 29 September , the Marines arrived back in the city , again joining French and Italian forces . <p> Relative calm returned until 18 April 1983 , when explosives hidden in a delivery van detonated near the front of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut , collapsing the building and killing 46 people , including 16 Americans . Fighting between Lebanese Christian and Muslim militias gradually escalated as the U.S. forces trained and equipped the Lebanese Armed Forces , which were increasingly perceived as a pro-Christian , anti-Muslim force . <p> By late summer , Muslim sniper and mortar fire was targeting the Marines .

Fourteen other Marines received shrapnel wounds in the " untargeted " attack . <p> On 13 September , President Ronald Reagan authorized Marine commanders in Lebanon to call in air strikes in support of embattled Lebanese Armed Forces units fighting Druze militiamen in the Shouf Mountains at Suq el-Gharb . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger vigorously opposed the new policy , fearing it would make American troops far more vulnerable . " I urged as strongly as I couldapparently not strongly enoughthat we should n't be there , that we should take those troops out . . . at the very least put them on ships offshore , " Weinberger later said .

During a meeting at the U.S. Embassy , its public-affairs officer , Jon Stewart , asked me to prepare a similar response for the State Department . Unfortunately , events rapidly escalated before either the Departments of Defense or State could respond . <h> A Fatal Step is Taken <p> At 0845 on Friday , 16 September , small-arms fire had erupted around the Marine positions at Beirut airport . The Marines went to the highest level of readinessCondition 1which meant that we would be in full combat gear and hunkered down in our bunkers .

The USS Bowen ( FF-1079 ) responded by opening fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and control centers . <p> At 0428 on the 19th , the ambassador 's residence again came under attack . Condition 1 was ordered at 0935 , and at 1004 the USS Virginia ( CGN-38 ) , John Rogers ( DD-983 ) , and Bowen began a gunfire barrage in support of the Lebanese Armed Forces troops pinned down at Suq el-Gharb . Meanwhile , the USS New Jersey ( BB-62 ) was steaming toward Lebanon , soon to add her big 16-inch guns to the bombardment . <p> Colonel Geraghty would later testify that " The support that was provided at Suq el-Gharb was , in my opinion , a departure from our neutral peacekeeping role to direct support of the Lebanese Armed Forces . " We anticipated some form of hostile response and knew that a sustained artillery barrage could easily pound our positions into dust . A series of grenade fraggings , car bombings , and sniping events that followed resulted in only minor injuries . Then , on 14 October Staff Sergeant Allen Soifert was killed by sniper fire as he drove a jeep on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day stressed increased security as the 24th MAU 's deployment drew to a close . On the 16th , helmeted , heavily armed men wearing Syrian camouflaged uniforms and red headbands appeared across from where Soifert had been killed . That evening belligerents probed Alpha Company positions at the Lebanese Science and Technical University building , wounding three and killing Captain Michael J. Ohler . <p> Friday , 21 October , was a solemn day as Rabbi Resnikoff conducted memorial services for Sergeant Soifert , the first Jewish Marine killed in Beirut . The next day , however , spirits were lighter . A Liberty ship departed for Cairo with Marines , Sailors , and Soldiers on board bent on a bit of R&amp;R . Others gathered along the north ridge behind the BLT building to listen to a country-western " MegaBand , " compliments of the USO , and eat pizza prepared by the crew of the USS Iwo Jima ( LPH-2 ) . That evening was punctuated by random .50-caliber machine-gun fire along the Shouf Mountains and at Khaldeh Junction to the south . I retired early , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my French hosts on Sunday . <h> The Bombing 's Aftermath <p> As I approached the steps leading down to the BLT barracks early on the 23rd , I found myself whispering , " God , how could you let this happen ?

Body parts were scattered about , 30 feet in the air an ammo box jutted from a palm tree , and a dozen or so Marines who somehow survived the horrific blast stood silently in shock facing the rubble . Pulverized gray cement covered everything as far as one could see . Time and space do not allow a description of the full impact . But within the rubble 241 of America 's finest220 Marines , 18 Sailors , and 3 Soldiershad been sacrificed in a noble but naive quest for peace .

" We were providing the stability that was allowing the various factions in the military and the government to begin to pull together .

When interviewed by ABC News in 1998 , he said : " We have seen in the last decade the decline of American power and the weakness of the American Soldier , who is ready to wage Cold Wars , but unprepared to fight long wars .

Naval Institute 's Maritime Strategy Supplement , Secretary of the Navy John Lehman presents a strong case for both peacetime and wartime requirements for 15 carrier battle groups to implement the Maritime Strategy laid out by ex-Chief of Naval Operations Admiral James Watkins in the same supplement . <p> In support of the Maritime Strategy , the Navy plans to commission large , nuclear-powered aircraft carriers ( CVNs ) at least until the late 1990s . Like their predecessors now in operation , these ships should have useful lives of 40 years or longer . The ongoing service life extension program ( SLEP ) , designed to add 10-15 years of service , is scheduled for even the most recently commissioned CVNs , which should keep 15 large carriers operational for the next 40-50 years . This commits a large percentage of the Navy budget for the next half century , and thus implies that the Navy has decided that the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost a half-century , will continue in that role for another half-century . <p> The critic questions this decision ; history tells him that any dominant weapon system is eventually countered . Further , dominant weapon systems are a form of technology fruition and therefore show the same trends . The process of introduction , acceptance , dominance , obsolescence , and demise of weapon systems - notably capital ships - has become progressively shorter . <p> In various forms , the galley ruled in the Mediterranean for more than 1,000 years . Its contemporary , the Norse longboat , had a similar reign in northern seas . Both were gradually driven into extinction by the evolution of the Western European sailing warships . The reign of the sailing " ships of the battle line " lasted about 300-400 years . They were replaced over a relatively short span of time by steam-driven ironclads . Within the next 50-60 years , the dreadnought ushered in the era of the heavily armored , centerline gun battleship . Reigning only for about 40 years , the dreadnoughts were abruptly dethroned by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now been the capital ship for more than 40 years . <p> The proponent counters that such a broad brush of 2,000 years of naval history does not establish a case ; moreover , that only recent history is relevant . Since World War II , the dominance of the large aircraft carrier is well documented . <p> Since the late 1940s , the Navy 's forward-deployed carrier battle groups have played a key role in U. S , posture and in the resolution of nearly every crisis . In the major cases where overall deterrence failed - Korea and Vietnam - carrier battle groups clearly displayed their warfighting ability . <p> The territorial integrity of the Middle East and the vital oil supply lines to the West depend heavily on the combination of the Sixth Fleet carrier battle groups and the presence of at least one battle group in the Indian Ocean . There is no other U. S. force-naval or otherwise that could continuously maintain a credible stabilizing and deterring presence in this volatile area . <p> The critic insists that each of the long line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impending doom which were invariably first ignored , then discredited , and , finally , frantically countered by the proponents of the reigning queens . The results were almost always disastrous . <p> When King Philip of Spain decided to send an invasion armada against England , he was wise enough not to use his fleet of Mediterranean galleys . However , he was not wise enough to prevent the Armada from carrying two vestiges of the galley , both of which contributed to the Armada 's doom : his ships carried the heavy , short-range guns characteristic of ( and probably transferred from ) galleys , and were manned predominantly by soldiers . They were no match for the nimble English men-of-war manned by seamen firing lighter but longer-range guns . True , the sea claimed most of the Armada , but the English ships not only thwarted the invasion , they forced the Armada to attempt to return home by the long , treacherous route around the British Isles rather than run the gauntlet of English ships in the English Channel . <p> At Hampton Roads , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the single Confederate ironclad , the CSS Virginia . Only the arrival of the ungainly ( and , until then , unpopular ) Monitor saved the day . While the ensuing duel was indecisive , the two large , centerline guns of the Monitor signaled the end of the 80- , 100- , and 120-gun ships of the line . <p> The German shift to submarine warfare in World War I , signaled by the sinking of three British armored cruisers in one hour by a single submarine , provided warning of a new and deadly form of naval warfare . The belated British response proved to be an expensive lesson . <p> In World War II , the sudden loss of two British battleships to Japanese air attacks helped to seal the doom of Singapore , Malaysia , and Indonesia . This shock , the U. S. battleship disaster at Pearl Harbor , and the momentous U. S. victory at Midway forced both navies to belatedly attend to naval air warfare and antiaircraft defenses . While the battleship continued to play a role , notably in shore bombardment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> As George Santayana wrote , " He who fails to learn the lessons of history is doomed to repeat them . " One of the reasons that the carrier appears to be destined for such a long reign is that , since the carrier duels and island campaign of World War II , she has not been seriously challenged in conflict . The performance of carriers and carrier aircraft in Korea and in Vietnam was commendable , but there was no enemy challenge to the carrier herself . <p> Today , clear and growing threats to the carrier battle group ( CVBG ) include long-range bombers armed with air-to-surface missiles , submarines and surface ships equipped to fire antiship missiles , and even land-based missiles . <p> It is not clear what will ultimately dethrone the carrier . There are several potential challengers : nuclear-powered submarines , surface effect and/or SWATH ( small waterplane area twin hull ) ships , land-based aircraft , and long-range smart missiles launched from a great variety of platforms . <p> An apparently overlooked or ignored quote from Aviation Week and Space Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) may provide a hint of one of these possibilities : <p> How about a future force of AV-8B ( or follow-on ) V/STOLs deployed from several modest-sized surface effect or SWATH ships ? Given some development funding now , they could be fielded in significant numbers in 20-25 years . Battle groups of such forces might be more survivable and therefore a more credible deterrent than the planned CVBGs . <p> Recent studies , analyses , simulations , war games , and fleet exercises point to a current need to assemble forces of three or four CVBGs in order to survive against concerted Soviet threats in key areas around Eurasia . Table I in the Secretary of the Navy 's 600-ship Navy article indicates a wartime need of four CVBGs in the Sixth Fleet and five in the Seventh Fleet versus 1.3 and 2.0 average peacetime CVBG deployments , respectively , in these areas . These are signs that , within this threat spectrum ( which is growing both qualitatively and quantitatively ) , in a rapidly developing future crisis , the few peacetime forward deployed carriers may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may have to be withdrawn until they can be reinforced , thereby giving the enemy the initiative in these key areas . These same signs point to an even more vulnerable posture against future nuclear threats . Shades of Billy Mitchell and the " Gun Club ! " How do you hope to cope with the steady + growth of such problems for 40 or 50 more years ? " You , Mr. Proponent , have the burden of proof , and please do n't tell me that the solution is to commit ourselves to building and SLEP-ing more , bigger , and better carriers . " <p> " You , Mr. Critic , are very sketchy and selective with your history and with your arguments , " responds the proponent . The Spanish Armada was not even commanded by a sailor . It would not have worked with whatever kind of fleet Philip sent . England has not been successfully invaded by anyone , by any means , in 1,000 years . <p> The Union forces at Hampton Roads did not choose its predicament . They came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , they learned it too well : the U. S. Navy overemphasized the very limited monitor design for the next two decades . <p> The U.

The Japanese attack ( and the next six months of the war ) clearly demonstrated two things : <p> + Do not get caught by surprise attacks an objective to which our forward deployed carrier groups provide a crucial contribution . <p> + The beginning of the carrier age : This was not another of the critic ' s long chain of evolutionary changes in naval warfare . It was revolutionary . It began a whole new evolution based on aircraft carriers and carrier aircraft . We have since seen the application of nuclear propulsion , supersonic jet aircraft , and electronic warfare to our CVBGs . These changes are the history that is relevant . What went before is not . <p> Perhaps most importantly , the critic seems to ignore the significant improvements introduced into carrier battle groups . The defense-in-depth posture works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparable F-14-Phoenix interceptor-missile combination ; the Aegis cruiser ; the dedicated , direct support nuclear submarine ; and several other effective forms and layers of antiair , antisubmarine , and antisurface warfare . We are deploying large numbers of a variety of missile systems in rapid-fire vertical launchers , steadily advancing in all forms of electronic warfare , and keeping pace with all known and realistically projected threats to carriers . <p> The critic infers that we are not giving adequate attention to new systems and new technology ; he is wrong . For example , the Tomahawk missile system dilutes threats to the carrier by spreading our offensive counter threats across the entire combatant fleet . We are carefully considering all of the various designs for advanced naval platforms and aircraft . Wisely , however , we are not betting the future of our country on longshots . We will first ensure that we build , maintain , and modernize the requisite numbers of our proven performer-the carrier battle group . <p> If Congress and the public can be convinced to commit the necessary resources to build our carrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then provide the additional funding necessary to develop and prove some of the more promising advanced concepts , we are prepared to do so . We will not , however , risk weakening the Navy in these perilous times by diverting critical funds and resources in order to " take a flier " on unproven concepts . <p> In short , according to the proponent , the critic 's arguments lack substance and definition . Until he can support his claims of impending doom and define an alternative that can match the versatility and staying power of the carrier battle group , the burden of proof rests with the critic . <p> " True , " says the critic , " the Spanish Armada had no admiral , but then the overall English command was also entrusted to a landsman . " Yet , had the Armada consisted of comparable , modern fighting ships , it would surely have given a better accounting of itself . And the Union ships were not at fault at Hampton Roads ; U. S. naval planners were . The same is true of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and during World War II . <p> The proponent 's argument about " tracking the threat " is specious . The +studies , analyses , simulations , war games , and exercises referred to are generally set in the 1990s . These evaluations incorporate all current and programmed improvements , and generally conclude that , even with these advances , we will need to assemble forces of three or four carrier groups in order to survive and then counter the initial onslaught of current and expected Soviet threats almost anywhere around Eurasia . Hence the wartime requirements outlined in Secretary Lehman 's article . Fulfilling wartime requirements assumes no significant initial losses by the one-third of these forces that is continuously forward deployed . For the next decade or so , there may be good reason to feel comfortable with such an assumption . However , committing the lion 's share of our naval budget and , maybe more important , naval thought to the assumption that for the next half century - in the face of growing , evolving , and perhaps unforeseen threats-our requirements for naval forces will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I can muster . <p> There is another sure lesson from naval history . The imminent demise of any " dominant " weapon system is invariably signaled by the onset and blossoming of the process of involution-the process of turning inward . When the design , equipping , manning , operation-indeed the whole philosophy of a ship-reaches the point where the de facto mission has become survival , and all else is subordinate , doom is approaching . <p> Hence , some of the last vestiges of the Mediterranean galley were huge , unwieldy quadriremes and quinquaremes with several hundred galley slaves and hundreds of troops . Similarly , the sailing ship met its fate as an elaborate , ornate , and cumbersome 100-120 gun , 1,000-man ship of the line . The last battleships were almost impregnable to any but the largest shells , and they bristled with antiaircraft batteries ; their complement had grown to almost 3,000 . Each , in turn , of these queens fell victim to longer-range offensive systems . <p> A modern , nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with her air wing on board has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily growing threats , an ever- increasing percentage of the funds , resources , and brain-power poured into an aircraft carrier is devoted to her survival . Other very expensive resources in the battle group around the carrier , notably the Aegis cruiser and the Los Angeles ( SSN-688 ) -class nuclear submarine , were specifically designed to defend aircraft carriers . Involution has set in . <p> It is time to pursue some alternatives , even if this requires some future diversion of funding and other resources . This need not have any impact on our current or planned near-term posture . <p> " You , Mr. Proponent , must recognize that the burden of proof is yours " says the critic . " The inexorable march of technology and events is making the burden heavier . The longer you wait the more distasteful it will become . Time is against you . " <p> The proponent counters : " You are still speaking in generalities and dodging the facts . What about the spread of offensive power in the Tomahawk that you have chosen to ignore ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the Soviets decided to build some ?

Unfortunately , in the areas where it may really matter , we ca n't pose the kinds and levels of threats to their carriers that they can to ours . Nor can we make quick losses of three or four carriers such a devastating blow to their maritime strategy . <p> " Perhaps the message that we should be getting from Soviet carrier building programs is that they now feel assured that we will doggedly stick to our carrier and CVBG support programs for another 50 years .

While this may challenge their anticarrier strategy , they have had 40 years to work on the problem ( which probably explains our current emphasis on self-defense ) . Given another 40 or 50 years , they should get pretty good at it . <p> " Incidentally , whatever the reasons for and merits of the current Soviet large carrier program , it is worth recalling that the Japanese completed and deployed the Yamato ( quite ineffectively ) long after they taught us the value of aircraft carriers and signaled the end of the reign of battleships .

Naval aviation can not take the offensive from shore ; it must go to sea on the back of the fleet . <p> Naval air did go to sea on the " back of the fleet " during the interwar years , 1919-41 . However , Admiral Moffett 's vision of naval aviation as the " brunt of attack " was not to become reality until World War II . In 1941 , naval air was still viewed as an auxiliary , although an important one , to the battle line . Clashes at sea , it was thought , would ultimately be decided by the firepower of the heavy-gunned , thick-armored ship of the linewith help from the fragile airplane . The evolution in the thinking of how to best use planes came during the fleet problems of the 1920s and 30s when concepts were tested , modified , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its unfolding . <p> The experience of naval aviation in World War I provided some basis from which to proceed . From shore stations at home and overseas , American naval aviators flew seaplanes , flying boats , and dirigibles on antisubmarine patrol and convoy duty . For ship-based air operations , however , the U. S. Navy had to draw on the experiences of the Royal Navy for guidance . <p> During World War I , the Royal Naval Air Service ( RNAS ) operated floatplanes from seaplane carriers and wheeled aircraft from platforms atop battle cruiser gun turrets and from a makeshift carrier . From these ships , RNAS aviators flew scouting missions for the fleet , conducted air-to-air combat against Zeppelins , spotted gunfire during shore bombardment , projected power ashore with bombing raids on Zeppelin sheds , torpedoed merchant ships , and in 1918 conducted unsuccessful attacks with light bombs against the well-armored Turkish battle cruiser Yavuz Sultan Selim ( ex-German Goeben ) . In short , ship-based air had demonstrated during the war its considerable potential for future utility . The U. S. Navy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . <p> One of the earliest to be implemented , along with scouting , was the spotting of the fall of shot . In March 1919 , the battleship Texas ( BB-35 ) conducted a shoot using ship and aerial spotters . Spots from the plane were far superior to those from the ship . This skill showed the battleship admirals that aircraft were valuable assets to have at sea , withthe fleet , instead of ashore . Planes not only helped to find the target , they helped to put ordnance on it . <p> Prior to the Texas shoot , in January 1919 , the General Board of the Navyan influential advisory body of senior naval officers reporting directly to the Secretary of the Navyhad taken up the question of the future of aviation in the fleet . In April 1919 , in an interim report of its findings , the board recommended the conversion of a collier to a flush-deck ( i.e. , continuous deck ) carrier for the operation of wheeled-as opposed to float-airplanes . In June , the board reported that aircraft were " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " naval air service must be established . " Not everyone agreed . For example , the Chief of Naval Operations opposed the concept of ship-based air and the conversion of the collier . <p> This early postwar opposition to ship-based naval air was transitory . By 1922 , the air policy of the Navy directed that the development of ship-based air would be the principal effort of the naval air service . The post-1922 force structure reflected this policy . At the close of World War I , all the Navy 's planes were shore-based with over one-half of the entire inventory being of the big , flying boat type . In 1922 , flying boats ( all but a handful were based ashore ) comprised 62% of the combat ( non-training , non-experimental ) inventory . In the 1930s , aircraft of all types assigned to ashore commands ( excluding those in **28;235;TOOLONG status ) made up less than one-fifth of the combat force . 6 This force structure shift during the interwar years denotes a Navy air arm that had broken its World War I tie-down chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the fleet , as had been envisaged in 1922 . In addition to this policy , the years 1921-22 were important ones in the development of carrier warfare . <p> In 1921 , the Navy and the Army conducted at-sea bombing tests against old American and surrendered German ships . Under noncombat conditions very favorable to the conduct of the attacks , General Billy Mitchell 's bombers did what he claimed they could do before the test they sank a battleship , the ex-German Ostfriesland . The underwater concussive effect produced by the near misses of 1,000- and 2,000-pound bombs had done what the RNAS had failed to do with light bombs against the comparable Goeben . As a contemporary commentator opined : " The bombing testswere perhaps more responsible for the awakening of the Navyto the possibilities of bombs than any other influence . There is no argument so strong as a practical and successful test.The Navy , however , was not convinced . <p> The Navy believed the tests were inconclusive due in a large measure to Mitchell 's interference . So in 1924 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . The target this time was a more modern and more formidable ship than the Ostfriesland . The uncompleted Washington ( BB-47 ) , a battleship hull laid down in 1919 , was due for scrapping under the terms of the 1922 Naval Armament Limitation Treaty . Although unfinished , the Washington withstood repeated torpedoing , bombing , and underwater explosions and finally had to be sunk by gunfire . Thus , the results of the series of bombing tests conducted in the early 1920s were ambiguous-providing support for the views of both the " gun club " and of the air zealots . These tests did , however , spur the development of ship-based aviation , and this was due in some part , to General Mitchell 's ardent advocacy of the superiority of air forces over surface forces . <p> Mitchell also had contributed unintentionally to another factor important to the evolution of naval air warfare , and this was the creation of the Bureau of Aeronautics ( BuAer ) in 1921 . BuAer was formed to an extent as a reaction to Mitchell 's espousal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Navy and Army . BuAer provided naval air with what it had lacked before-centralized direction of the design , procurement , planning , operation , and administration of aeronautics in the Department of the Navy . The creation of the bureau also gave the aviators a flag officer representative at Navy headquarters . The first chief of the bureau was Rear Admiral Moffett . He was an ex-battleship captain and a non-aviator ( in 1922 , he became the first naval aviation observer ) . Moffett was also an accomplished administrator , having overseen the expansion of the Great Lakes Naval Training Station during the war . During his 12 years as chief , Admiral Moffett earned the title of the " Father of Naval Aviation . " He died in office , at sea , in the crash of the airship USS Akron ( ZRS-4 ) on 4 April 1933 . Organization , coupled with Moffett 's talented and continuous leadership , did much to send Navy air to sea on the back of the fleet . <p> Another step in getting naval aviation to sea was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrier , the USS Langley ( CV-1 ) , the ex-collier Jupiter . The Langley served as a test bed for carrier aviation in preparation for the coming of the two " real " carriers , Lexington ( CV-2 ) and Saratoga ( CV-3 ) . Both of these ships were commissioned in late 1927 from battle cruiser hulls that had been due for scrapping under the 1922 treaty . The treaty also limited U. S. carrier tonnage to 135,000 tonsa limit that was not reached , primarily for budget reasons , until 1940 with the commissioning of the seventh carrier , USS Wasp ( CV-7 ) . <p> In the Navy 's view , the 1922 treaty , with its 5:3 ( United States to Japan ) ratio in capital ship tonnage and its non-fortification clause proscribing further defense improvements in American bases west of Hawaii , exacerbated an already deteriorating security situation in the Western Pacific vis-a-vis Japan . " The General Board had decided as early as 1921 that Japan was the future enemy of the United States . " Of particular concern to the Navy planners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Marshalls , and Carolines ; for these Japanese mandates sat on the flanks of the sea Lines of communication to Guam and the Philippines . Japanese submarine , fleet support , and air bases , once established on these islands , would have to be destroyed in order to defend or recover America 's Far East possessions . In the absence of land air bases within range , neutralizing these island bases and the defending Japanese fleet would require seagoing air power . Thus , the perceived threat in the Western Pacific established a need for carrier air . Satisfying this need would take advances in technology , and it would take dollars . <p> The primary technical problem to be solved was the development of a combat-effective , carrier-based strike aircraft : <p> To be a main offensive system for combat and not merely a harassing agent during the preliminaries , carrier strike aircraft would have to carry a reliable torpedo or 1,000-pound bomb . Less of a weapon load was little threat to a large armored warship , including a carrierA combat radius of at least 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's carriers . Finally , the strike aircraft needed a top speed near that offighters . Slow speed over the enemy fleet madebombers easy targets for defending fighters . <p> Aeronautical engineers and scientists would not provide this type of performance until the late 1930s . <p> Besides the advancements needed in endurance , payload capacity , speed , weaponry , and reliability of the frame and engines , many other improvements were required in such areas as communications , navigational aids , arresting and catapult systems , fuels , and landing gear . All of this took timeand money . <p> During the interwar years , BuAer 's portion of the President 's budget request for the Navy rose from 4% in 1923 to 9% in 1930 , dropped to 6% by 1935 , but rose again to 10% by 1940 . These budget data show that despite differences of opinion on how to use Navy air , there was considerable support for the air arm at Navy headquarters . <p> The " external " factors that most affected the development of naval air thought were the early decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of the plane to the battle line , the bombing tests in the 1920s , and the Japanese threat . Sending planes to sea meant thinking about how best to use them : scouting , spotting , and bombing demonstrated the utility of the plane , and the threat provided the impetus for learning to use aircraft at sea . Inherent to the conceptual development process were the competing views of the " gun club " and those of the air proponents . Those views were to be tested during the fleet problems of the interwar years . <p> The fundamental doctrinal questions at issue during the fleet problems were the same as those being asked ashore . Was the airplane just the eyes of artillery or could it supplementor perhaps supplantthe artillery ? That is , was there more to the airplane than simply finding the target and directing ordnance thereon ? Why could n't the airplane strike the enemy meaningfully and , perhaps , independently of surface action ? Aviators ( at sea and ashore ) thought so . The Navy gun clubbers ( and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Prior to the first official participation by the Langley in a fleet problem ( Fleet Problem V in March 1925 ) , there was much supposition as to what sea-based air could or should do ; but , without a carrier , there was little experience . The most ardent air enthusiasts , both aviator and non-aviator , argued the carrier , with its main battery of airplanes , would replace the battleship and its gun battery as the " backbone of the fleet . " The more moderate , like Moffett and many of the gun clubbers , believed air control over the opposing forces was essential to the main attack by , and defense of , the ships in the battle line . Indeed , this latter view was the one stated in the tactical instructions for aircraft in 1924 . By the mid-1920s then , there were few in the Navy who did not recognize the potential value of sea-based air to the fleet , even if they perceived that value differently . <p> During Fleet Problems I-IV ( 1923-24 ) , sea-based air participation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " constructive " carriers ) and from aircraft tenders . Beginning with the Langley in Fleet Problem V , carrier air played more and more a part in the problems as the number of carriers participating increased from one in the mid-1920s to four in the late 1930s . When the last of the pre-World War II problems ended in 1940 , the U. S. Navy had a substantial base of exercise experience upon which to formulate carrier operations . <p> What emerged from the testing of concepts in the 17 fleet problems of 1925 through 1940 was a transformation in the accepted use of carrier air . From being employed mainly as the " eyes of the fleet " in the problems of 1925-28 , carrier air was acknowledged in subsequent problems to be capable of performing two additional and importantif conflictingfunctions . These were ( 1 ) operations independent of the battle line in the form of the fast-carrier task force for conducting strikes ashore and at sea and ( 2 ) air operations in direct support of the battle line so the battleship could close , undamaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The battleship admirals knew from the bombing tests of the early 1920s and from the fleet problems that planes could damage their ships ; hence , they were reluctant to detach the carriers with their protective air screen from the battle line . Also , when the carriers did operate without the battleships , the problems had shown the carrier to be vulnerable to attack by the opposing battle line . Thus , the Beet problems of 1930s demonstrated to the Navy 's satisfaction the mutual dependence of the carrier and the battleship , the consensus being neither could prevail without the other . <p> The burden of proof for independent carrier operations , however , had been on the air zealots , and in the fleet problems they had not shown convincingly that carrier air could be decisive in itself . Consequently , for the most part , fleet doctrine from the late 1930s through 1941 called for carriers to accompany the combatant groups ( the battle line and/or the scouting force ) and for carrier flying stations to be within gun protection range of the battleships and cruiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into World War II , while mutual dependence was recognized , the carrier was to support the battleship and not the other way around . <p> The conduct of the fleet problems and the force structure trends during the 1930s indicate that this carrier-air support was offensive . Between 1931 and 1940 , the ratio of carrier aircraft having a prin1ary fighter mission to those designated as strike ( torpedo planes and bombers ) decreased from about 2.5:1 to approximately .5:1 . Had the emphasis been on providing defensive air cover for the battleship , fighters would have likely remained predominant . <p> It is clear from the force structure and from the problems that the aviators intended to defend the battleship by striking the enemyhis carriers and his battleshipsrather than by intercepting him in the air . Air control , for the support of the battleship , was to be primarily achieved by destroying the enemy 's floating air base , not by shooting his planes down . This offensive concept had appeared as early as 1924 and was repeated in the early 1930s . It was certainly doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year states the following : " It is highly improbable that control of the air can be gained by employing aircraft to shoot down enemy aircraft . The surest and quickest means of gaining control of the air is destruction of enemy carriersby bombing attacks . An identical statement is in the 1941 version . <p> Thus , the U. S. Navy entered World War II with a tactically offensive carrier-air doctrine for the defense of the battle line . When the bulk of that battle line sank at Pearl Harbor and the carriers survived , the aviators got , by circumstance , their chance to implement what they had argued so strongly for during the interwar years-task force strike operations built around the fast carrier . Their readiness to execute such operations was the result of a long and difficult process , one which had been fraught with technological , doctrinal , and institutional issues . <p> Commander Gravatt is currently assigned as the Chief , National Security Policy Branch of the Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell Air Force Base , Alabama .

@@21175842 @1175842/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> 70 Miles of Cold , Hard Road <p> Six decades ago the 1st Marine Division battered its way to one of the most startling achievements in the history of warfare : a full-scale withdrawal that left the enemy in tatters . <p> As the final month of 1950 approached , the 1st Marine Division found itself at a desolate mountain reservoir in North Korea . Snow blanketed the rugged terrain . Temperatures of 25 degrees below zero were routine . Worse , the Marines were surrounded , and the numerically superior force of Chinese soldiers was bent on annihilation . The lone avenue of escape was a treacherous , single-lane road leading to the port city of Hungnam70 miles distant . The Korean name for the reservoir was " Changjin . " On the maps from Japan it was labeled " Chosin . " <p> Five months earlier , on 25 June , the North Korean Peoples Army ( NKPA ) had invaded South Korea . The communist troops quickly captured South Koreas capital , Seoul , and pushed South Korean and United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the southeastern coastal city of Pusan . Even as additional U.S. forces were arriving in Pusan , South Korea seemed on the verge of collapse . Then , on 15 September , Americans landed at Inchon , on South Koreas northwest coast . General Douglas MacArthurs bold plan to recapture Seoul and sever the enemys lines of communication and supply was a surprising success . Within days , reinforced U.N . forces at Pusan counterattacked , breaking out of the perimeter . The momentum that the landing and the breakout created led many to believe the conflict would be short and U.S. troops would be " home by Christmas . " <p> MacArthur failed to decisively exploit this success , however , opting to send X Corps ( the 1st Marine Division and the U.S. Armys 7th Infantry Division , under Army Major General Edward " Ned " M. Almond ) to the eastern side of the Korean Peninsula for two amphibious landings . On 26 October , Major General Oliver P. Smiths Marines landed at Wonsanto be welcomed by Bob Hope and his USO ensemble . The Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October . <p> MacArthurs plan was one of a grand " pincer " movement , with Almonds X Corps sweeping north from the east to the Manchurian border ( defined by the Yalu River ) , while the Eighth Army made a parallel sweep northward from the southwest . Those halves of the great pincer were separated by the large Taebek Mountain range ; MacArthur made the Eighth Army responsible for the logisticsthough not commandof the independent X Corps . Within the next month , frustrated small-unit commanders would see orders change several times as they witnessed the entry of the Chinese army into the war and as they experienced the rapid onset of a brutally cold winter . <h> A Gathering Storm <p> In early November , Chinese communist forces crossed into North Korea and engaged MacArthurs troops , but then seemed to melt away . The U.N . forces continued their advance to the north . The Chinese reappeared , however , near the end of the month , and the Eighth Army was having trouble . Almonds forces were redeployed in that direction to alleviate the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 November . At the time the 1st Marine Division was arrayed around and between a few villages along the mountainous upper reaches of the narrow road that wound from Hungnam to the 10-mile-long Chosin Reservoir . <p> During its movement north earlier in November , the division had maintained a slow , methodical pace . Smiths cautious advance aggravated Almond , but Smith had a sound rationale : It kept the divisions lines of supply and communication from becoming unduly overextended.On 27 November , the 5th and 7th Marine regimentsactually composite units called regimental combat teams ( RCTs ) began their attack from Yudam-ni to relieve the pressure on Walkers Eighth Army to the west ; they quickly ran into their first heavy Chinese resistance just a few miles from the reservoir . The Chinese soon attacked all along the road to Hungnam , the Marines main supply route ( MSR ) , severing it in several locations . The division maintained a defensive posture until 30 November , when headquarters gave the order to withdraw . Recognizing that his division was both surrounded and fragmentedthe Chinese were inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MSRSmith told reporters that the Marines would not be withdrawing , but rather " attacking in another direction , " given that it is impossible to withdraw when one is surrounded . ( His statement was quickly embellished into a fictional quotation often rendered as , " Retreat , hell ! Were just attacking in another direction . " ) <p> With a few U. S. Army and British Royal Marine attachments , the 1st Marine Division then began its inspiring 13-day , 70-mile fighting retrograde , or " breakout . " Most of the 20,000-plus men ( along with their equipment and more than 1,400 vehicles ) were successfully evacuated despite the odds against them . Nature cruelly battered them with snow , ice , and subzero cold as they traversed the narrow mountain road . The Chinese hurled against them a determined , numerically superior force , whose stated mission was the complete destruction of the 1st Marine Division . The Chinese not only failed in that missionthey were soundly defeated . <p> At the outset of the fighting , the Marines already had subunits in defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Yudam-ni , Hagaru-ri , Koto-ri , and Chinhung-ni ( north to south ) . As they moved through those outposts they consolidated forces , evacuated wounded , and received supplies and reinforcements , all under a blanket of protective close-air support from Marine and allied aircraft . The final 35 miles of the trekfrom Chinhung-ni to the port of Hungnamwere traveled rapidly with little enemy resistance . By the evening of 11 December the men of the 1st Marine Division were eating hot chow in Hungnam . <p> That the Marines managed a stunning breakout from the Chosin Reservoir death trap is well known , the stuff of legend . Yet often overlooked , outside the military classroom , is the fact that it had not been merely a mad , desperate dash to safety . Rather , the withdrawal comprised a series of attacks that in aggregate made up a well-planned , superbly led campaign . In two weeks time , a division of Marines had battled out of harms way . The enemy they left behind had been rendered ineffective as a fighting force . <p> What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feat ? The lore of Chosin Reservoir is liberally laden with tales of raw courage and selfless sacrificecontributing factors , to be sure . But in the big-picture sense , the 1st Marine Division succeeded because it had been well-trained and well-led , and because its members remained dedicated to the mission and one another . It succeeded because it executed the key functions of warfighting extremely well . This is the story of that success , as viewed through the prism of just three of those functions : command and control , maneuver , and logistics . <h> Command and Control <p> The 1st Marine Division had many subordinate and supporting units , and fellow warriors from all U.S. services and U.N . forces contributed to the operation . MacArthur kept his Far Eastern Command headquarters in Japan , but Almond , the X Corps commander , was based in-theater and quite mobile thanks to the jeep and helicopter . Almond wore two hats , serving both as MacArthurs chief of staff and as the commanding officer of X Corpsan unusual and unnecessary situation . Smith believed that Almond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X Corps commander would blindly follow any orders from his legendary boss without question . 1 MacArthur , for his part , had remained overconfident and in denial of the developing situation until the Chinese army re-entered the conflict with a massive onslaught in late November . His supreme self-confidence led him to question his civilian masters ; President Harry S. Truman relieved him of command in 1951 . While Smith saw Almond as a MacArthur " yes man " and an overly ambitious self-promoter , the aggressive Almond viewed Smiths careful , measured style of leadershipand his cautious advances in the fieldas indecisive and frustrating . <p> The helicopteralthough at the time in Marine Corps service for fewer than three yearsplayed a crucial role in Smiths ability to exercise effective command and control on the battlefield . Smith used the helicopters of Marine Observation Squadron ( VMO ) 6administratively part of the 1st Marine Air Wing but operationally attached to Smiths divisionto overcome the difficult terrain and the wide dispersion of his forces . He made frequent command-liaison movements by helicopter , enabling him to physically view his forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advice , and personally issue orders to subordinates . Smith physically located his command post so as to be as close to the action as prudence would dictate , moving his CP from Hungnam to Hagaru-ri on 28 November by helicopter , the only viable means to do so as the Chinese had severed the MSR . He fortified his position at Hagaru-ri as RCT-5 and RCT-7 conducted the breakout from Yudam-ni from 30 November to 4 December . His CP then relocated south ( again via helicopter ) , first to Koto-ri on 6 December , then finally back to Hungnam on 10 December as the long column trudged the final miles down the mountain road . Writing to Marine historian Lynn Montross in 1953 , Smith noted that " Subsequent to the Chinese onslaught of November 27th , the helicopter became a vital factor in the proper exercise of command functions . " 2 <p> VMO-6 helicopters also had made their mark in other ways , such as assisting isolated Fox Company in its renowned five-day defense of Toktong Pass , midway between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and without radio communication there would be no way to call for artillery fire , direct close-air support , or coordinate the airdrop of supplies . Sikorsky HO3S-1 helicopters , under fire , dropped batteries and supplies to the Marines at Toktong Pass . ( Overall , throughout the campaign , the division was well supported with many radios , but communications wire and cable that had been installed north to Hagaru-ri was cut on 28 November and not repaired . 3 ) <p> From Smith down , Marine officers enjoyed excellent command relationships and shared trust and confidence in their men , a trust and confidence that was reciprocated . The majority of the commanders were seasoned World War II veterans who genuinely cared for their men . That esprit extended to all reaches of the Marine air-ground team , including pilots , engineers , and Navy corpsmen . Smith and the other commanders had full confidence in their men ; Marines in the lower echelons had faith in their leaders and in each other . Smith recalled , in an interview in 1973 : <p> After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was conducted . It was found that many men with toes or parts of toes absolutely black had never reported to medical installations during the course of the breakout , and had somehow made the march to the coast . They just did n't  want to leave their buddies. 4 <p> Just as the leadership and loyalty were strong , so , too , was the command and control outstanding in most every respect during the breakout . Transmitted orders from Smith and his unit commanders were frequent , short , and precisely written . Forward air controllers and tactical air-control parties for directing fixed-wing aviation support were well placed and efficiently employed . The divisions leaders had a plan , and they were determined to succeed . <p> General Sung Shih-lun led Chinas 9th Army Group , probably a force of about 12 divisions . It had been tasked with annihilating the 1st Marine Division . Little is known to the Western world about the specifics of the Chinese armys smaller-unit command relationships , but for the most part the troops displayed outstanding motivation , morale , and competency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structure in the sense that most members of a military force do , but he was obedient to obvious higher authority and dedicated to the communist cause . <p> While troops were well disciplined , the army overall was inflexible . Suggestions from the bottom up rarely were heeded ; mission-type orders did not exist . Captured Chinese documents blamed " tactical rigidity and a tendency to repeat costly errors " on unsatisfactory communications technology : <p> Our signal communication was not up to standard . For example , it took more than two days to receive instructions from higher-level units . Rapid changes of the enemys situation and the slow motion of our signal communication caused us to lose our opportunities in combat and made the instructions of the high level units ineffective . Our radio stations were frequently interrupted . . . . We succeeded in the separation and encirclement of the enemy , but we failed to annihilate the enemy one by one . The units failed to carry out the orders of the higher echelon. 5 <p> The Chinese frequently used whistles , horns , bugles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Puzzlingly , those attacks routinely were directedagain and againat the Marines strongpoints rather than at their weaknesses . <h> Maneuver <p> A fighting withdrawal , an attack in another direction , a retrograde , a retreat , or a breakout : Call it what you will , there is no doubt that the 1st Marine Divisions determined movement from Chosin Reservoir to Hungnam will remain an inspirational and instructional campaign of significant interest for years to come . Part of the success has to be attributed to Smiths thoughtful decisions as X Corps made its way northward during early November . He proceeded slowlyadvancing at an average rate of just a mile a day between 10 and 23 November , staging men and stores along the way . 6 This was to stockpile supplies ( particularly at Hagaru-ri ) , preserve his fighting potential , and allow the busy 1st Marine Regiment to close the gap from the south and protect the MSR from Koto-ri to the coast . <p> Colonel Victor H. Krulak , G-3 of Fleet Marine Force Pacific , sent a message to Headquarters Marine Corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the Chinese springing their trap : <p> Actually , the keynote of what they have done is this : they were not caught off base . They could forecast the impending situation in the 1st Marine Division . They expected exactly this to happen and they were ready for it . They were not surprised . 7 <p> Almond , however , had not seen the situation coming . When Smith approached him with a request for X Corps to construct an airstrip at Hagaru-ri " to bring in supplies and take out possible casualties , " Almond replied : " What casualties ? " 8 Undeterred , Smith directed his engineers on 19 November to begin construction of an airstrip capable of supporting C-47 transports . The dedicated engineers worked day and night scraping the frozen ground to build what soon became vital to the Marines ability to maneuver . <p> Once Smith was ordered to pull back , Almond directed him to burn or otherwise destroy the divisions equipment and evacuate as quickly as possible . Smith disagreed : " Now look . We are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight with , so I 'm not destroying anything . " 9 Almond conceded ; the breakout began . Twenty years later , Smith reminisced : <p> How did they think we could operate with everybody trying to run to the sea coast ? We had a definite plan . We had two regiments at Yudam-ni , and we were going to defend there until we got orders to come out and fight our way from Yudam-ni to Hagaru-ri and join up what was there and fight from Hagaru-ri to Koto-ri and pick up what was there , then fight from Koto-ri to Chinhung-ni . At each place you would get rid of your wounded and you would gain a few troops . 10 <p> After RCT-5 and RCT-7 made it to Hagaru-ri on 4 December , Smith wisely ordered a day of rest . The southward advance toward Koto-ri continued at dawn on 6 December and did not haltday or nightexcept as enemy action dictated . " Since it was necessary to fight most of the way , " Smith said , " the speed of the column , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 11 <p> The Marines would position screening forces on the surrounding high ground to protect the column and call in close-air support ( CAS ) within a band approximately ten miles wide , but they would sometimes give up the high ground if it helped strengthen their lines and improve their overall combat power . They moved under the cover of almost-constant CAS . Although there were more aircraft on station during daylight than during the 16 hours of darkness , " night heckler " aircraft did provide some protection from nightly Chinese harassment , and napalm was the ordnance of choice around the clock . The Marines expertly integrated all available fires to support their maneuver , broke through the enemys frequent roadblocks , and protected each other despite the overpowering urge to succumb to the self-preservation instincts most were experiencing in the Arctic-like environment . <p> The Chinese were excellent , at the outset , at stealth and surprise , moving quietly at night and hiding well during the day . That allowed them to cross the Yalu River and move south in great numbers undetected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimized the effectiveness of U.S. daytime CAS and significantly limited the ability of VMO-6s observation planes ( OY Stinsons ) to accurately conduct aerial reconnaissance . But their tactics degraded as the battle wore on and they became cold , tired , and hungryand it became clearly evident in their performance : <p> There was no stealth in their approach ; they came in erect , sometimes walking , sometimes at a slow run . In repeated attacks on the same position , their initial line of advance became a beaten path , and there was little or no variation in their application of fire . 12 <p> The Chinese relied heavily on roadblocks , but lacked substantial supporting arms ( they had lots of mortars , but little artillery and no air support at Chosin ) . Thus unable to defend against the constant fire from the sky , they could not stop the Marines withdrawal . After the initial attacks of RCT-5 and RCT-7 on 2728 November , near Yudam-ni , the Chinese chances of success lessened , as American forces were able to regroup . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chosin campaign may have been different . But once the breakout commenced and the 1st Marine Division gained momentum and consolidated its forces as it moved south , the scope of Chinese maneuver would not be enough to stop it . <h> Logistics <p> The airstrip at Hagaru-ri was not yet complete , but on 1 December American C-47s began using it to ferry in supplies and reinforcements and to evacuate the wounded . Helicopters , so critical for command and control , also played a role in resupply and casualty evacuation . But the fledgling choppers minimal lift capability and the high altitudes in the theater made the larger-capacity fixed-wing transports essential . By 6 December , more than 4,500 casualties had been evacuated by air , and 600 replacements had joined the Marines at Hagaru-ri . Smith later wrote : " I think this is indicative of Marine Spirit . Everybody was put in the fight . " 13 Not only did fresh troops join the battle , but the removal of casualties from the area made it much easier for those left behind to maneuver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to care for the wounded . <p> As the evacuation of the wounded from Hagaru-ri was occurring , planes from the Far East Air Force dropped prepackaged loads " Baldwins " of weapons , ammunition , and supplies on a daily basis . The Marines at Koto-ri began receiving more supplies in anticipation of the columns arrival there . The airdrops were not always on target , nor did the deliveries always contain exactly what the Marines on the ground needed , but they were adequate and arrived regularly enough to help immensely . <p> One particular airdrop briefly attracted worldwide media attention . Just south of Koto-ri , about a third of the way down the mountain , the Chinese blew a 24-foot section of bridge . It was at a critical location ; with a sheer drop down the mountainside there was no way around the gap . The decision was made to airdrop sections of a treadway bridge . The drop was completed on 7 December , but it took until 9 December to get the sections to the gap . There , engineers repaired the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many newspapers . The Washington Post carried war correspondent Marguerite Higgins account on 8 December under the headline : " 16-Ton Bridge Is Air-Dropped To Help Marines Cut Way Out . " <p> Throughout the breakout , vehicles carried only drivers , gunners , and corpses . All able-bodied men were ordered to make the movement on footan order necessary to protect the column from close-in attacks , especially at night , and an order that was a source of pride for the men of the 1st Marine Division in years to come . The armor was almost always at the rear of the column , for fear that a disabled M-26 tank would block the entire divisions movement down the one-lane MSR . That planning paid off : On 10 December the seventh tank from the rear ( out of 44 tanks ) had its brakes lock . The stall facilitated a Chinese attack on the rear of the column . 14 The Marines took casualties , but in the end held off the enemy , disabled the blocked tanks as best they could , and continued down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the recently repaired treadway bridge . <p> Cold-weather gear and equipment for the Marinesgiven the extreme climateoverall was satisfactory , with a few exceptions . Considering the lack of planning ( or cold-weather training ) prior to the campaign , the 1st Marine Division was about as well clothed and supplied as possible . Tentage was abundant , allowing for heating tents to be set up whenever feasible . Weapons worked , for the most part , in some cases simply because of the ingenuity of the average Marine when it came to maintaining the moving parts in below-zero temperatures . <p> A serious and consistent problem was with the footwear , the now-infamous " shoe-pac . " The boot worked well at Inchon and elsewhere , but in the cold of Chosin it became a genuine hazard . It consisted of a laced leather upper and a rubber shoe and sole . Foot perspiration that accumulated during marching or attacking would freeze during any period of inactivity , inviting frostbite if not remedied . ( Of nearly 2,700 non-battle casualties during the breakout , roughly 2,000 were frostbite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 15 ) C-rations were available , but many men suffered severe , even incapacitating , gastrointestinal problems from eating partially frozen food because of the rations tough-to-heat packaging . Canteens regularly burst as water expanded into ice , and canteen caps often cracked . But all in all , the 1st Marine Divisions logistics support was leaps ahead that of the Chinese . <p> The Chinese had a logistics capabilityit simply was not adequate to sustain their army in the fight . Troops carried a variety of small arms and ammunition from a number of nations ( including the United States ) , but they did n't  carry enough ammunition into battle . Generous with their use of automatic weapons in an attacksometimes too generousthey often were forced to break contact when they ran out of ammo . Interrogations of civilians and prisoners revealed that the Chinese generally maintained supply dumps about 30 miles to their rear , but those were mostly for strictly " military " gear . Individual soldiers were expected to forage for meals once their meager rations had been exhausted . 16 <p> Although the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked gloves or mittens , and few had winter boots . Canvas gym-type shoes were common . All of the captured enemy soldiers complained of the cold , and most were extremely hungry . Estimates based on several sources ( such as POWs and captured documents ) put the enemy frostbite rate somewhere between 80 to 90 percent .

Once a year , elements of the Fleet sortied from their home ports and joined together to take part in an annual fleet problem that was designed to test various aspects of naval warfare in order to better prepare for conflict . In late April 1936 , the Fleet departed its West Coast ports for Fleet Problem XVII , to be conducted in the Pacific off Panama . The problem was divided into five phases intended to test strategic , tactical , logistical , and communications abilities . After several weeks of strenuous maneuvers that required constant alertness and attention to duty , the commander-in-chief of the U.S. Fleet , Admiral Joseph M. Reeves , took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that each ship could conduct the time-honored ceremony known as " Crossing the Line , " which he knew would be a refreshing interlude and a morale booster for the men . <p> Entering King Neptunes Realm <p> The Crossing the Line ceremony , one of the oldest customs at sea , is a rite of passage for landlubbers and seamen alike who have never before crossed the equator , or line . In the boisterous ceremonies that accompany a ships crossing , the " pollywogs , " those on board who have never crossed the line , are initiated into King Neptunes realm in a series of hazing rituals conducted by " shellbacks , " those who have already experienced this tumultuous rite of passage . The practice is believed to have evolved from Viking rituals , which were passed on to the Anglo-Saxons and Normans . <p> Early Crossing the Lines had a fairly serious purpose : to test new crews to see if they could endure the hardships at sea . Ceremonies in the 17th century were particularly rough , but in later years the festivities provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , as now , it was primarily a crew party , with the participantseven those being tormentedfinding certain psychological satisfaction in the sport . With rank and position forgotten , everything is topsy-turvy . For one hour an ordinary seaman in the guise of Neptune becomes the most powerful man on board . <p> According to custom , the ceremonies are orchestrated and run by King Neptunes court , headed by Neptunus Rex himselftraditionally the oldest or most senior shellback in the crew . Other members of the " royal court " assist him , including Davy Jones , the mythological evil spirit of the sea ; Her Highness Amphitrite , often a young seaman in a costume of seaweed and rope ; the scribe ; the doctor ; and the barber . Other members often include the royal baby , usually the fattest man in the crew wearing only a diaper ; the navigator ; the chief bear and his assistants , the latter of whom perform the dunkings ; the chaplain ; jesters ; and the devil . The royals also have a secretary , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose job is to enter the names of the candidates to be sentenced by the court . The kings entourage also includes a judgeDavy Jones sometimes performs this functionwho passes sentence on the pollywogs . <p> Admiral Reeves , known as " Bull " from his football- playing days at the U.S. Naval Academy , had his first encounter with King Neptune 38 years earlier while serving as assistant engineer in the battleship Oregon during the vessels record-making 14,000-mile run from the West Coast around the tip of South America during the Spanish-American War of 1898 . The revelry started at 0830 the morning of 31 March when several outlandishly dressed seamen representing King Neptune , his queen , and their entourage of shellbacks mystically appeared on board . The royal couple paid their respects to the ships captain , Charles E. Clark , who then asked and received permission to bring his command into Neptunes domain . <p> The king , a noble-looking old sea dog with an untwisted rope serving as his hair and beard , thumped the deck three times with his trident and ordered the initiation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were led to a hinged chair where they were covered with a lather made of oil , molasses , flour , and saltwater , applied with a large paintbrush and then shaved by the royal barber using a three-foot wooden razor . Before the victim could escape , the chair was tilted back , dropping him onto a canvas chute where he was pummeled with rubber hoses on the way to the dunking tank , where an old salt playing the part of the doctor pushed him under . <p> Officers were offered a less honorable , but more comfortable way out : They could purchase immunity by paying a large ransom in beer . Its not known what option Reeves selected , but the number of officers taking this route of escape led King Neptune to become so inebriated he was unable to deliver his farewell speech . Instead , he stood up on the forecastle repeating the phrase " I am satisfied " again and again as he swayed back forth before being mercifully led away by members of his court . <p> The esteemed rituals conducted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shaving , which represents a farewell to childhood innocence for most men , was originally connected to manhood . In more recent times , seamen regard the shaving ceremony as a beauty treatment : No one may enter Neptunes kingdom without first having a haircut . Dunking was a form of baptism that cleansed the neophyte so that he would be fit to be accepted into the new society of shellbacks . Since no one may enter Neptunes kingdom unless he is sound and healthy , it was the doctor who pushed him under . Once baptized , a sailor is exempt from again undergoing the initiation ritual . When the occasion demands , the best way to prove his status as a shellback is to produce a certificate attesting to that fact , like a real baptismal certificate issued by a church . These unofficial documents are printed in the ships print shopif it has oneor obtained from commercial sources . <p> Crossing the Line En Masse <p> Admiral Reeves was well aware of the fate awaiting the fleets pollywogs when on Tuesday 19 May 1936 he issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This command was part of the traditional Crossing the Line ritual , as it was customary for Davy Jones to appear on board the night before the ship was to cross the equator with a message to the ships captain from His Majesty Neptunus Rex , stating at what time he wanted the ship to hove to to receive the royal party . Davy Jones reception usually takes place after dark and is an impressive spectacle , with him coming over the bow in a boatswains chair or up a forward hatch amid the glare of searchlights and the spray of fire hoses . <p> That night , crew members who had never crossed the equator would have been served summons or subpoenas from Jones to appear before the royal court on the morrow to be initiated in the mysteries of King Neptunes Royal Domain .

The reading of some of these offenses at initiation before sentencing added much to the hilarity of the occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next days ceremony on board the battleship Pennsylvania ( BB-38 ) , Admiral Reeves flagship , tradition and imagination can fill the gaps .

As soon as King Neptune and the royal party appeared on deck , the " Jolly Roger , " the kings personal flag , would have been broken out and a bugle sounded while the officers and crew were called to quarters . In a general description of what might occur in the revelry that followed , the Navy notes that " the pollywogs wogs for short , would be put through a series of initiation rites involving harrowing and often embarrassing tasks , gags , obstacles , physical hardships , and generally good-humored mischief " all of which were meant to entertain the shellbacks and degrade the pollywog . <p> On board the heavy cruiser Astoria ( CA-34 ) , the secretary of the royal court recorded that the pollywogs were subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray <p> The barber to slice and rake them measly stubble <p> The slime and squirt gun to test their inside <p> The tank to fill them with salt and break their brittle bones . <p> After undergoing these degrading and embarrassing hardships gleefully conducted under the auspices of the ships shellbacks , the pollywogs were inducted into the " Solemn Mysteries of the Ancient Order of the Deep , " becoming full-fledged shellbacks . <p> As a keepsake to memorialize the occasion , an unknown entrepreneur struck a commemorative medalsimilar in form to the official campaign medals issued by the U.S. Navy for service in World War Ithat was apparently offered for sale .

In the Southwest Pacific , General Douglas MacArthur had captured most of New Guinea . Admiral Chester Nimitz , his counterpart theater commander in the Central Pacific , had seized Kwajalein and Eniwetok in the Marshalls , followed by Saipan , Tinian , and Guam in the Marianas . The Japanese were desperate to stem both tides . By September they anticipated MacArthur would soon invade the Philippines , most likely in concert with a Nimitz offensive in the Japanese-owned Palau Islands . <p> During the Pacific war , the Palaus provided a sheltered passage for Japanese oil tankers steaming north from the Dutch East Indies to the Home Islands , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local air bases . The linchpin protecting this vital flow of oil was the two-mile-by-six-mile island of Peleliu , and there the Japanese built the largest bomber strip in their Pacific islands . <p> Peleliu 's strategic location caught the attention of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff as they selected Pacific campaigns for 1944 . They found other objectives in the Palaus , including Ulithi , whose deep-water lagoon could provide a fleet staging anchorage for future assaults on Iwo Jima and Okinawa , and Angaur , Peleliu 's smaller neighbor , whose flat terrain might yield a future bomber strip . But the Joint Chiefs accorded highest priority to seizing Peleliu 's bomber field . The planners reasoned that capturing Peleliu would remove a significant Japanese threat to MacArthur 's seaborne invasion of the Philippines and establish U.S. air superiority throughout the Palaus . These assessments spawned Operation Stalemate , the code name for the forcible seizure of Peleliu , Angaur , and Ulithi . <p> The rapid advance of American forces in 1944 forced Japan 's Imperial General Headquarters ( IGHQ ) to redeploy certain veteran infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered Pacific islands such as Peleliu . Major General Sadae Inoue 's 14th Division departed the frigid Ussuri River region and arrived in the steamy Palaus in April . Inoue deployed most of his troops on the large island of Babelthuap , posted a battalion on Angaur , and ordered the reinforced 4th Infantry Regiment , commanded by Colonel Kunio Nakagawa , to defend Peleliu . Nakagawa had a keen affinity for defensive warfare . At his request , Japanese mining and tunneling engineers arrived to convert hundreds of fissures and crevices in the steep slopes of the Umurbrogol into a series of mutually supporting strongpoints . <p> The Joint Chiefs assigned Operation Stalemate to the Central Pacific Forces of Admiral Nimitz , with a mid-September target date . Nimitz entrusted the mission to Admiral William F. " Bull " Halsey , commanding the U.S. Third Fleet , and selected Marine Major General Roy S. Geiger to command the assault troops of the III Amphibious Corps . Geiger former enlisted rifleman , pioneering Marine aviator , and distinguished commander of the " Cactus Air Force " on Guadalcanal was well-qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peleliu Geiger 's III Amphibious Corps consisted of the 1st Marine Division , commanded by Major General William H. Rupertus , and the Army 's 81st Infantry Division , the " Wildcats , " led by Major General Paul J. Mueller . The veteran Marines would lead the assault on Peleliu . The well-trained Wildcats , as yet unblooded , would initially assault Angaur and Ulithi and then reinforce the Marines . <p> The outcome of the opening battle for the Umurbrogol would reflect the strengths and weaknesses of General Rupertus . Few general officers in the Pacific could match his eight months of experience leading troops in close-quarters jungle fighting at Guadalcanal and Cape Gloucester . Yet the experience also bred overconfidence . Rupertus expected the Japanese to defend Peleliu with the same predictable tactics of 1942 : stiff initial resistance followed by a spectacular but sacrificial banzai attack ending the battle . As he confidently announced to his Marines embarking for the Palaus : " This will be rough but fast . We 'll be through in three days , maybe two . " <p> The division commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unique terrain and the capabilities and intent of the enemy . Unfortunately intelligence collection and analysis for Stalemate was the worst of any amphibious campaign of the war . Not until D-day after naval gunfire and air strikes had burned away much of the island 's vegetation did the landing force discover the upthrust spires , narrow canyons , and sheer cliffs of the Umurbrogol that dominated the airfield and landing beaches . No other extreme terrain in the Pacific war not even Iwo Jima 's Mount Suribachi would cost U.S. forces so much time and blood to seize and hold . <p> Other intelligence shortfalls surfaced . Although the Marines knew that 10,000 Japanese defended Peleliu , they had little information about their quality . It took too long to realize they were facing one of the oldest regiments in the Imperial Japanese Army , an outfit full of pride and tradition and superbly led by Colonel Nakagawa , who would become one of the most formidable opponents the Marines ever fought . Nor were the Leathernecks forewarned of the matrix of 500 caves in the Umurbrogol escarpments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another significant intelligence failure occurred on the operational level . For all its code-breaking success to date in the Pacific war , U.S. naval intelligence failed to intercept an urgent message in mid-August from Japanese IGHQ ordering island commanders to abandon the standard doctrine of defense at the water 's edge . Transmitted shortly before Peleliu , IGHQ 's " Defense Guidance on Islands " established a new doctrine of prolonged attrition increasing the lethality and length of Japanese resistance in order to erode the will of the American people to continue the war . Commanders could " disrupt " enemy landings with light forces , but they were ordered to preserve the main body in interior strongpoints , forcing the enemy into costly frontal assaults . Wasteful banzai counterattacks were now forbidden . <p> The first Americans died at Peleliu during 12 - 14 September as the advance force commenced naval shelling , carrier air strikes , minesweeping , and underwater demolition team operations .

Invisible from the sea and fortified with concrete , the bunker 's 25-mm machine-cannon crew surprised the assault waves with close-range flanking fire , raking the sides of thin-skinned LVTs with high-explosive incendiary and armor-piercing tracer shells . Stricken vehicles lurched to a stop in the shallows , fires quickly billowing as survivors scrambled over the gunwales .

The Marines rose from the sand , followed the surging armored vehicles through openings in the dunes , and fanned out , the 7th Marines bearing right , the 5th Marines advancing straight ahead to the edge of the runway , and the 1st Marines sidling left uphill , slowed by what would become an epic 36-hour battle by Hunt 's K Company to hold the Point against Japanese counterattacks . <p> Naval gunfire improved exponentially once shore fire-control parties landed and began adjusting fire . The deep waters seaward of Peleliu 's reef allowed the ships to close within a mile .

The Japanese tank crews died fighting , and the Marines probably felt as good at that moment as they ever would on Peleliu . <p> By sunset on D-day , the Navy and Marines had landed 10,000 troops , their tanks , and most of their field artillery .

Unlike the Marines ' desperate D-day toeholds on Tarawa , the Leathernecks on Peleliu had established a fully functional , two-mile-wide beachhead . <p> For the 1st Marine Division , these achievements came at the price of more than 1,100 casualties , including 200 killed . Yet the first day 's losses at Peleliu measured less than D-days at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Iwo Jima ( 2,400 ) . <p> The Peleliu airfield fell to the 5th Marines on the second day . Soon a Marine fighter squadron landed and quickly began launching its napalm-loaded Corsairs in direct support of infantry attacks in the highlands . Major General Mueller meanwhile landed two regimental combat teams of the 81st Division on Angaur and overwhelmed the Japanese garrison in four days of fighting . The 323rd Regimental Combat Team seized Ulithi Atoll without losing a man . <p> On 28 September the 3d Battalion , 5th Marines , including Eugene Sledge , executed a shore-to-shore amphibious assault against nearby Ngesebus Island . The crossing , fully supported by Marine Corsairs , naval gunfire , and Army and Marine field artillery , was a small masterwork of joint teamwork . Ngesebus fell in two days . Geiger announced the completion of Stalemate 's amphibious phase , releasing most of the ships to support MacArthur 's imminent invasion of Leyte . <p> The situation in the highlands of Peleliu , however , was painfully different . The new disciplined tactics of the Japanese baffled General Rupertus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the shadowy infiltrators with blades in their teeth at night . Enduring temperatures as high as 115 degrees , the Marines struggled to overcome an endless array of Japanese caves in broken terrain that forced them into frontal attacks . Each dawn brought a renewed attack order . Artillery and naval guns shelled the heights as the dwindling infantry platoons scrambled upward . Overpowering each cave was a tactical triumph , quickly spoiled by an outburst of fire from a new quarter . <p> Colonel Chesty Puller 's 1st Marines had taken the brunt of the initial fighting for the southwestern parapets ( nicknamed Bloody Nose Ridge ) . Few Marines had experienced more combat missions than the aggressive Puller , already a legend with four awards of the Navy Cross . Yet he , like Rupertus , kept expecting the Japanese line to crack , prompting the battle-ending banzai charge so common in the Solomons . <p> General Rupertus was hobbled by a broken ankle and could not climb the ridge to see for himself what the 1st Marines were facing . He impatiently ordered Puller to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became appalled by Puller 's cumulative casualties and Rupertus ' rigidity and finally intervened . He ordered Rupertus to relieve the 1st Marines immediately with Colonel Hanneken 's 7th Marines and directed General Mueller to land the 81st Division on Peleliu prepared to fight in the Umurbrogol . <p> In five days of brutal fighting Puller 's Marines had seized 144 caves at the cost of 1,749 casualties , one of the highest regimental losses of the Pacific war . Lieutenant Bruce Watkins of the 2d Battalion , 1st Marines lost 32 of his 41-man platoon in the repeated assaults , including several men blown up by errant friendly fire from a Navy ship . Watching the regiment 's depleted ranks file past , he concluded , " We were a remnant rather than a regiment . " Captain Everett Pope of the 1st Battalion , 1st Marines would earn the Medal of Honor for leading his decimated company through the nightmarish defense of Hill 100 but remained forever haunted by having to leave his dead on the exposed ridge for two weeks , a sacrilege the Marines had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5th Marines and the three Wildcat regiments took their turns in the Umurbrogol and fared somewhat better , steadily driving Nakagawa 's remaining defenders into a small , yet nearly unassailable pocket . Each regiment paid an exorbitant price for its limited progress . <p> Admiral Halsey visited the island to learn why the battle was taking so long and costing so much . His escorts led him to a vantage point near the Umurbrogol , but the Japanese scattered the entourage with a mortar barrage . Shaken but uninjured , Halsey reported the incident to Nimitz : " It is a slow process in digging the rats out . Poison gas is indicated as an economical weapon . " It was a gratuitous suggestion . Both men knew President Franklin D. Roosevelt opposed the use of poison gas . <p> The 1st Marine Division lost its combat effectiveness after five weeks of assailing the Umurbrogol .

Unable to dig fighting positions in the coral , the Wildcats formed long lines and lugged buckets of beach sand to the ridge tops , providing the assault companies the protection of " moveable foxholes " sand bags that could be inched forward after each advance . They used block-and-tackle rigs to haul small artillery pieces up the cliffs for direct fire missions against Japanese caves in the adjacent cliff . <p> Finally , resorting to medieval warfare tactics , they painstakingly constructed an enormous earthen ramp to breach the ramparts of Colonel Nakagawa 's last command post . As the ramp rose ever higher , Nakagawa sent a final message to General Inoue : " Our sword is broken and we have run out of spears . Request permission to burn our colors . " Nakagawa committed ritual suicide just before the first Army tank roared up the completed ramp and burst into his perimeter . <p> In the final count , about 10,900 Japanese fighters died defending Peleliu and Angaur ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands cost the 1st Marine Division and the 81st Army Division 9,615 total casualties , including 1,656 killed . The casualty lists shocked the nation . Most Americans had never heard of Peleliu , and they struggled to understand the strategic imperative for such a Pyrrhic victory . <p> Seizing Peleliu yielded certain benefits , but none could justify the cost . Capturing the bomber strip helped protect MacArthur 's 20 October invasion of Leyte . Long-range bombers from Angaur provided limited tactical support to subsequent Philippine operations . The U.S. possession of Peleliu effectively bottled up some 40,000 Japanese troops in Babelthuap , Yap , and the western Carolines . Ulithi Atoll provided a valuable fleet anchorage for the final campaigns of 1945 . Moreover , the 1st Marine Division learned critical lessons in cave assault and tank-infantry coordination on Peleliu that enhanced its combat effectiveness on Okinawa . <p> The Battle of Peleliu began brilliantly with one of the finest division-level , opposed landings of the Pacific war , but then came the bitter hemorrhage of fighting an unexpected war of attrition on terms largely dictated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Pacific Fleet and much faster tactical adaptability from their senior commanders ashore . Survivors and historians will long debate whether the Joint Chiefs could have achieved their objectives and avoided the high casualties by neutralizing Peleliu 's airfield with land-based and carrier air strikes .

On an early fall night in 1923 , the U.S. Navy lost more warships in ten minutes than it did to enemy action in World War I. <p> The essential creed of the early- to mid-20th century destroyer driver was speed . Lightly armored and gunned , his ship depended on swiftness to deliver her most potent weapons-torpedoes . This nurtured a style of command that emphasized determination and self-confidence . In wartime those qualities could achieve the impossible , while in peacetime the same attributes contributed in no small measure to one of the U.S. Navy 's most significant disasters . Like many calamities , a clear chain of events can be followed that lead unerringly to the final act on 8 September 1923 . No single link was necessarily fatal . Modify or change any one of them and the tragedy disappears . Change none and , on this occasion , 23 lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warships was destroyed . <p> The trail began with the successful completion of the summer 's Pacific Battle Fleet maneuvers in the Puget Sound area , to be followed by the participants ' return to their homeports . For the 18 ships ( a 19th was in dry dock ) of Destroyer Squadron Eleven ( DesRon 11 ) that meant a run along the California coast to San Diego after a stop in San Francisco . They were Clemson-class vessels laid down between 1918 and 1919 , averaging 314 feet long , with a 32-foot beam , and a displacement of 1,250 tons . Driven by two high-power and two low-power turbines-and characterized by four tall thin funnels-their book speed topped 32 knots . Each had an authorized crew of 131 , but because of postwar budget cutbacks most were operating 20 to 30 percent below full complement . <h> Wring ' em Out <p> On the afternoon of 7 September , Captain Edward H. Watson , DesRon 11 's commander , met with his principal officers in the wardroom of the tender USS Melville ( AD-2 ) , flagship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kittelle . General orders for the next day 's transit to San Diego were discussed , and the officers learned some good news . Because of the Navy 's budget economies , fuel consumption had been carefully rationed . Destroyers had not been allowed to exceed 15 knots when cruising or making passage between ports , but the new fiscal year had opened the spigots enough that Admiral Kittelle granted permission to use the trip to San Diego for a 20-knot run to test cruising turbines . <p> Kittelle 's order was the first link in the tragic chain of events . The issue was not the order itself , but how it was interpreted . When DesRon 11 departed San Francisco on 8 September , it was joined by Destroyer Squadron Twelve ( DesRon 12 ) , commanded by Captain James H. Tomb , who had received the same directive . Tomb 's flagship was the USS McDermut ( DD-262 ) , whose skipper recollected that Tomb considered Kittelle 's instructions to be " permissive rather than a requirement . " 1 In contrast , Captain Watson viewed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Tomb 's interpretation , Watson wanted to make the San Diego passage in record time . A collision during the recent fleet maneuvers involving a DesRon 11 ship had cast a shadow over the squadron that Watson perhaps hoped to erase by executing an exemplary speed trial . <p> Watson also discussed radio direction-finding ( RDF ) protocols for the two-year-old electronic navigational aid system . Before its invention , plotting a ship 's location depended heavily on topographical or astronomical sightings . If none were available , the navigator calculated the ship 's position through dead reckoning ( DR ) with careful estimates of distance covered since the last solid fix and the course followed , allowing for his ship 's speed as well as the effect of winds and currents . RDF held the promise of greater accuracy . <p> A series of long dashes was transmitted from the shipboard radio and received by a land-based RDF station . Rotating a loop antenna , the RDF technician aligned the device to receive the greatest transmitted energy ( loudest signal ) . Visually , this put the loop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass card at the base of the loop provided a bearing to the transmitting ship . A weakness in the new technology was that , in 1923 , there was no means of determining from which side of the loop the signal originated . The operator thus had two bearings-180 degrees apart-to relay to the transmitting ship . <p> In a perfect world , a ship out of sight of land would have simultaneous access to at least two RDF stations . The intersection of their two bearings would indicate the ship 's position . Coverage along the southern California coast in 1923 , however , was thin , with just one RDF station available at any given point . RDF service was open to all shipping-commercial , private , or military-so Watson instructed his officers that only his flagship , the Delphy ( DD-261 ) , would handle that communication . The others would maintain their watches over the squadron and general command frequencies , but avoid that used by the RDF station . Given the high traffic volume and the fact that the RDF staff could only manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual request . However , on this particular operation , Watson 's stipulation would have unexpected and fatal consequences . <h> The Squadron Sets Out <p> As DesRon 11 prepared to depart San Francisco on the morning of 8 September , its 18 ships was reduced to 15 . Two had left at midnight in the company of the squadron tender because of engine problems that prevented them from working up to 20 knots . A third destroyer , the Reno ( DD-303 ) , had permission to add smoke prevention to the testing program and was proceeding independently . Once at sea , the 15 destroyers were divided into three divisions . <p> When DesRon 11 sortied shortly before 0700 , the Delphy was operating without her gyrocompass , which had broken down , forcing the officers to rely solely on the magnetic compass . Later analysis determined that this resulted in a two-degree course error on the landward side , by itself not a critical matter . Also , the Delphy was playing host to a civilian guest passenger , Eugene Dooman , a career diplomat who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watson would later insist that Dooman traveled with the full knowledge of Admiral Kittelle , although stories persist that he was on board without proper authorization . Dooman had insights into the current state of the Japanese Navy that greatly interested the captain . Their long conversations would prove to be a serious distraction once the squadron headed for San Diego . <p> From 0900 to 1100 DesRon 11 and DesRon 12 engaged in short-range battle practice , after which they set course for home . DesRon 11 was in Squadron Cruising Formation #5 , each division in column , the three columns running abreast with the flagship leading from the center . On departure , Lieutenant Commander Donald T. Hunter , the Delphy 's captain , had assumed primary navigational responsibilities in addition to conning the ship . His action relegated the navigator , Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Lawrence Blodgett , to an uncomfortable supporting role . Hunter was a highly regarded navigator who had taught the subject for two years at the U.S. Naval Academy . But all his training and experience had matured before RDF appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hunter also shared Watson 's commitment to completing the 20-knot run . Blodgett quickly discovered that any navigational suggestions erring on the side of caution would not be welcomed on this trip . <h> Down the Coast by Dead Reckoning <p> Masters of vessels traveling between San Francisco and San Diego memorized the five lighthouses marking the course : Pigeon Point , Point Sur , Point Piedras Blancas , Point Arguello ( with the Navy 's nearby RDF station ) , and Point Conception . Besides fixing a vessel 's position with certainty , visual sightings of two successive lighthouses provided navigators with a critical check of their dead-reckoning calculations . Estimating the influence of winds and currents on any particular day was as much an art as a science , so comparing a DR computation with a position established by visual sightings helped more accurately to assess the error factor . On this day , Pigeon Point was sighted one mile to port at 1130 . What no one realized then was that this would be the last solid fix obtained on the journey . <p> For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons for the exercise became apparent when two of its members dropped out of formation , although both were able to rejoin their divisions after completing repairs . <p> At around 1330 the airwaves began to crackle with urgent messages after the detached Reno encountered a lifeboat with survivors from the steamer SS Cuba , which had driven onto the rocky shore of western San Miguel Island , 23 miles south of the Santa Barbara Channel . The Reno 's division chief , Commander Walter G. Roper , promptly called Watson on the radiotelephone for authorization to assist with the rest of his group . When Watson refused ( deciding that one destroyer was sufficient ) , Roper pressed the point , and the discussion grew somewhat heated . Eventually Roper yielded , knowing that many of his fellow captains were listening on the ship-to-ship party line . This put Roper , a voice of authority among the squadron 's officers , in something of a huff . <p> At 1415 Commander Hunter called the Point Arguello RDF station for a bearing and was told he bore 167 degrees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to disparage the RDF system he found one , as the operator 's reading put the Delphy south of Point Arguello when she was still on approach from the north . A requested repeat produced a bearing of 162 degrees . A call for the reciprocal correctly put the ship to the northwest at 326 degrees . The Point Sur lighthouse was passed as this was happening , but the distance and a coastal haze prevented its sighting . That made verification of the next lighthouse , Point Piedras Blancas , even more important . When Lieutenant Blodgett suggested , however , that the inshore division be authorized to move closer to the coast for that purpose , Hunter did not allow it , presumably since it would force that division to reduce speed . The squadron was now proceeding solely based on Hunter 's dead-reckoning calculations . <p> The commander knew the route well and was certain he could guide the squadron into the Santa Barbara Channel . A number of factors , however , undermined his calculations . The destroyers were operating in a heavy following sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the propellers to broach . This prevented an accurate accounting of the prop revolutions , which were the basis for calculating the ships ' speed . At points in the journey , Hunter would work with an estimate of 21 knots , when the actual passage through the water was closer to 19 . Also , the winds were blowing more briskly than usual from the west-southwest which , coupled with a strong onshore current , added to the steadily accumulating navigational errors . <p> With Lieutenant Blodgett relegated to muttering his complaints to silent subordinates , Captain Watson became the best check on Hunter 's estimates . But the commander , fully engaged in his discussions with his civilian passenger , made only brief visits to the bridge . Such was his respect for Hunter 's navigational acumen that he merely received the information given him and did not process it . Hunter , for his part , took Watson 's silent nods as affirmation of his calculations . <h> Throwing Caution to the Wind <p> Following receipt of the reciprocal reading at 1438 , nearly four hours would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In that time DesRon 11 lost another ship when the John Francis Burnes ( DD-299 ) had a boiler problem that forced her to drop out of formation , not to rejoin . During the same period , Commander Tomb in the McDermut ( whose DesRon 12 trailed DesRon 11 ) requested three bearings and was concerned enough about the difference between his DR estimates and the RDF data that he slowed his squadron to 15 knots . <p> Almost two hours later , at 1627 , the Delphy signaled Squadron Cruising Formation #18 , which put the unit into a single , line-ahead column formed on her . Additional instructions set the cruising order : Division 33 followed by 31 and then 32 . Around 1700 the sun made a brief appearance through the overcast , but when Hunter tried to use his sextant he could not locate the horizon because of haze . At 1700 Watson ordered the running lights turned on . <p> Denied all visual checkpoints since Pigeon Point at 1130 , Watson and Hunter had one more tool available that would have indicated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoaling to the coast , but this meant slowing down because the equipment could not operate at 20 knots . It would have been possible to instruct the trailing destroyer to do this and rejoin the formation , but neither Watson nor Hunter gave it serious consideration . Watson was focused on setting the speed record , while Hunter was thoroughly satisfied with his DR calculations . <p> At 2000 Hunter radioed the squadron position to Admiral Kittelle , but the commander neglected the standard practice for the lead navigator to check his calculations beforehand with the squadron division commanders . Nevertheless , other calculations were being made . The individual ship captains and division commanders following the Delphy had an obligation to protect the safety of their charges , so the prohibition against monitoring the RDF channel was widely ignored . <p> In some cases the radio operators broadly tuned their units to cover the RDF frequency as well as the pair they were supposed to monitor ; in others , one of the two channels was ignored . On several bridges the estimated positions differed by miles from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reading . The discrepancies were deemed insignificant , and there was an assumption that the flagship had access to better data . So the column rushed on , blindly angling closer to the coast and not progressing as far south as imagined . <p> The Stoddert ( DD-302 ) , of Division 32 , broke protocol at 2011 and 2032 by requesting RDF bearings and was given readings of 326 and 330 degrees , which put her northwest of Point Arguello . The fact that the flagship did not reprimand the Stoddert implies that permission had been granted . One theory is that the Delphy 's radiotelephone was then in use , which could interfere with her radio signals , so Lieutenant Blodgett ( Hunter being momentarily absent ) called on a colleague for help . What is known is that the Delphy monitored the information given the Stoddert . <p> At 2039 Commander Hunter sought a new bearing and was given 330 degrees . Convinced that once again the RDF technicians had gotten it wrong , he demanded the reciprocal and received 168 degrees . ( Curiously , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was heard and logged by a Division 32 ship . ) Above Point Arguello the coast fell away to the northeast , while below it bent to the southeast , so it was possible for a southward-passing vessel to receive a bearing in the 300s as it approached , changing to the 160s as it moved away . That led credence to Hunter 's acceptance of the reciprocal reading . In fact , he was so convinced that they were well south of Point Arguello that he voiced a worry that the squadron might be heading for San Miguel Island , which had already claimed the Cuba . Lieutenant Blodgett tried anew to express concerns but was overruled by Watson and Hunter . Believing Hunter 's estimates to be correct , Watson determined that the squadron would reach the Santa Barbara channel entrance at 2100 , at which time they would make a 95-degree turn , pivoting the column to the east at 20 knots . <h> The Fatal Turn <p> Commander Hunter 's dead reckoning put the squadron south of Point Arguello at the Santa Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyers was three miles north of the station and just 1 1/2 miles offshore . At 2058 another bearing gave a reading of 323 degrees . Since this placed the ships north of Point Arguello aimed right at the station , Hunter ignored it . <p> Promptly at 2100 the Delphy made the eastward turn . For reasons never explained , the flagship did not signal the course change , causing momentary confusion as her 13 consorts hurriedly replicated the maneuver . A fog bank blanketed the coast , and about two minutes later the flagship was swallowed by the murk . Running 300 yards or so behind was the S. P. Lee ( DD-310 ) , followed next by the Young ( DD-312 ) . Unknown to all on board , they were heading directly to the rocky cliffs marking a rugged stretch of shore known variously to the locals as Point Honda , Honda Head , Honda Mesa , or just plain Honda . <p> On sea charts the area was marked Point Pedernales , taken from the early Spanish description of the area , como un pedernal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this coastal stretch consisted of a steep 60-foot bluff that allowed little beach area . Scattered seaward were a devil 's brew of rough-surfaced boulders , knife-like submerged pinnacles , and intermittent reefs . Wave action along the exposed point was constant , and with the wind and current this day , the breakers were especially powerful . Honda had claimed ships before , but always one at a time . On 8 September the victims arrived in a neat and orderly queue . <p> Although the Delphy and the S. P. Lee were the first to enter the fatal zone , it was the Young that became the first casualty when , at 2104 , she sliced along a submerged pinnacle reef , ripping open her starboard side , causing her to capsize in a matter of minutes . At 2105 the Delphy crashed bow-first into the unyielding stone , forcing the S. P. Lee to sheer to port and shudder to a stop . In an instant , Hunter 's worst fear-that they had struck San Miguel Island-seemed to have been realized . Watson ordered two radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " Nine turn " ( a simultaneous 90-degree turn to port ) . His intent was to direct the rest of the ships to the north , where he believed the deep Santa Barbara Channel lay . It was followed by a blinker signal , barely visible for a short distance : " Delphy aground . " <p> The warning came too late for the Woodbury ( DD-309 ) and the Nicholas ( DD-311 ) , which successively grounded on the Honda rocks . That accounted for all of Division 33 . Next into the chute was Division 31 with the Farragut ( DD-300 ) leading . Startled by the sight of the vessels ahead suddenly skewing wildly and stopping short , the Farragut 's skipper slowed , stopped , and then went emergency full astern . This caused a sideswipe collision with the next in line , the Fuller , which careened past and slammed against several rocks , killing all power . The damaged Farragut managed to work her way to deeper water . Behind them the Percival ( DD-298 ) and Somers ( DD-301 ) took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although the Somers suffered serious damage clearing the area . Less fortunate was Division 31 's tail-end Charlie , the Chauncey ( DD-396 ) . By the time her escape measures began to take hold , the ship was gripped by a powerful outgoing undertow that shoved her against the upturned Young , whose port propeller blades ripped into the Chauncey 's engine room , causing an immediate loss of power . In that instant the Chauncey , too , was doomed . <p> Next in line was Division 32 , with the Kennedy ( DD-306 ) followed by the Paul Hamilton ( DD-307 ) , Stoddert , and Thompson ( DD-305 ) . Still nursing a bruised ego over Watson 's refusal to let his ships assist the Reno , Roper paid close attention to the final intercepted bearings sent to the Delphy and had already opened the distance from the rest of the squadron when he saw the confusion ahead . Something bumped the Kennedy 's bow , which caused her captain to back full and take a sounding . They were at seven fathoms , dangerously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Stoddert would join the ships on the rocks as she made to pass the Kennedy , but Roper bellowed through his megaphone for her to resume station astern of the flagship . None of Division 32 's ships suffered any damage , except for taut nerves and shock . It should be noted that DesRon 12 , whose commander had no compunctions about slowing to take soundings and who trusted the RDF bearings , made an uneventful transit to San Diego . <h> Rescue and Survival <p> Seldom had so many seamen been subjected to such an abrupt transition from calm to crisis . One moment the crews were at normal duty stations in a standard cruising formation , and the next they were fighting for their lives . It is a tribute to the training , discipline , and courage of the U.S. Navy Sailors on those seven doomed destroyers that the next phase of the story was , in many ways , their finest hours . <p> For most of the skippers the first response was to preserve their ships , efforts that quickly proved futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not an easy proposition with the seas running high and a heavy fog blanket . The captain of the Nicholas , stern-first near the shore and pinned against rocks on her starboard side , made the decision to keep his crew on board until daylight . For all the other skippers the moment came sooner or later to abandon ship as the grinding of wave and rock flooded more and more compartments . There were numerous acts of heroism and sacrifice as men struggled against a surging sea slicked with leaking oil to fix rescue lines to the nearest solid ground . <p> The crews of the Woodbury and Fuller , aground the farthest from shore , found a temporary refuge on large boulder-like chunk of lava afterward called Woodbury Rock . It was a miserable perch ; most of the Sailors were in their skimpy sleeping gear , the water was cold , and the wind bitter . A few fires were started as much to raise spirits as to spread heat . The crews of the Delphy and Chauncey found precarious succor on a narrow ledge at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few bold Sailors clawed their way up , dropped lines , and began the backbreaking process of hauling their mates to the relatively flat top , which daylight revealed was linked to the mainland by a narrow natural bridge . It was a story repeated with variations a short distance to the north , where the S. P. Lee 's crewmen were able to establish a raft ferry to the shore , followed by a difficult ascent . <p> The men of the capsized Young carried out the most desperate battle for survival . Already there were fatalities ; several Sailors were trapped below when the ship rolled , and others washed to their deaths as they emerged on deck . The survivors found themselves clinging to the ship 's slippery port side , many holding desperately to openings created by smashing porthole windows . Lines were fashioned to knit the survivors together , all in an area six- to eight-feet wide and 25-feet long . The closest land was 100 yards away , the same jagged rock that was providing dubious sanctuary to the Delphy crew .

Eventually , and after great efforts , the Young 's crew were brought on board the Chauncey and then transferred to the rocky isthmus . <p> The disaster took place along a remote area whose principal improvement was a branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad . Fifteen miles to the northeast was Lompoc , the area 's largest population center . The RDF station and lighthouse at Point Arguello were just south of the incident . Once a railroad work crew based at a Honda mesa section house was alerted to the developing tragedy , word was spread by human courier and telegraph . The scope of the suffering was overwhelming with nearly 800 weary , shocked , and exposed Sailors , almost every one badly gouged after crawling across the sharp lava rock . Over the next two days the destroyermen were fed , clothed , treated , and sent by special trains to their home port at San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the final roll calls were taken , 23 squadron Sailors had perished , three from the Delphy , the rest from the Young . Given the circumstances , the miracle was that the number had not been much higher . Adding to the mystery surrounding these events , Watson 's civilian guest was surreptitiously transported from the site and lost to history for 40 years . Then , for 19 days beginning 17 September , a Court of Inquiry sifted through testimony and evidence . It recommended 11 officers be bound over for a general court-martial : Watson , Hunter , and Blodgett from the Delphy ; the two commanders of the divisions suffering losses ; and the captains of each wrecked ship . At the same time the court cited 23 officers and men for their outstanding performance saving lives after the groundings . <p> The court-martial convened in early November , charged with hearing the largest number of cases ever brought before a single naval judicial body . After weeks of hearings and testimony , the court found three officers guilty : Captain Watson , Lieutenant Commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nicholas . Rear Admiral S. S. Robison set Roesch 's conviction aside , but Watson and Hunter each lost their chance for any future promotion . Politics muddied the waters when Secretary of the Navy Edwin Denby , under a cloud for corruption , played to the public galleries by officially disapproving the not-guilty verdicts , though his action had no force of law . <p> We now know that Blodgett 's testimony was a careful tissue of half-truths . Omitted from the official record were his rising concerns over the squadron 's navigation . In return , Hunter publicly accepted sole responsibility for charting the fatal course . Much more was left unsaid . No explanation was ever given for the Stoddert 's two improper bearing requests . Small discrepancies between the log kept by the RDF station and several DesRon 11 ship logs remain unreconciled . There were also mishandlings of official documents , including the disappearance for many years of Blodgett 's trial transcript . <p> Watson and Hunter closed out their naval service in minor posts before each retired in 1929 . Of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two eventually commanded battleships and the others went on to valuable careers . No major changes were made to operational procedures because of the accident . Ironically , because of treaty restrictions , a large number of Clemson-class destroyers were in mothballs , so the Navy easily reconstituted the decimated squadron . <p> As for the wrecks , after stripping the stranded ships of critical weapons and records , the Navy put them up for salvage , managing to engage several amazingly inept companies who failed to clear the coast of the once lethal warships . Finally , the sea and naval engineers removed the major debris from view , although odd pieces remain to this day . Presently overlooking the disaster site is a modest memorial consisting of a salvaged anchor from the Young and a small plaque listing the ships that were lost . <p> While it would be easy to lay the entire blame on Hunter 's shoulders , he was not alone in inviting the tragedy . Watson 's fixation on making a record 20-knot passage along with his badly divided attention and failure to supervise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing concerns , and the silent acquiescence of the other squadron officers to course positions some believed in error all played a part . So , too , did uncertainties surrounding the new RDF technology , the effect of unusual weather conditions , and minor equipment problems . <p> At virtually any point along DesRon 11 's track from San Francisco to the jagged Honda cliffs some intervention might have changed the outcome , but there was none . In the end , we are left with the caution voiced by a naval officer who reviewed the case : " The price of good navigation is constant vigilance .

This is the war of HBO 's miniseries Band of Brothers Hitler , D-Day , and the Holocaust . The average American memory of the Asian-Pacific war seldom ventures beyond Pearl Harbor , Iwo Jima , and Hiroshima if that far . Potentially the single-most important and enduring achievement of the new HBO miniseries The Pacific will be to inspire a long-overdue reawakening to the strategic importance , sheer scale , and unsurpassed savagery of the wars unleashed by Japan . It should also afford a portal through which later generations will recover an understanding of the American people 's consciousness of their World War II enemies . <p> Japan , having seized Manchuria in 1931 , continued to subjugate swaths of China until July 1937 , when full-scale war between the two countries erupted . To Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of millions , the Chinese people refused to yield to foreign conquest as they had for more than a century . Instead , China grimly continued to resist . The struggle generated appalling visual imagery and horrifying accounts from missionaries that trumped both the vast racial divide and American isolationism in setting the United States on a collision course with Japan . It culminated in the Pearl Harbor attack quickly followed by Germany 's declaration of war on the United States . <p> These momentous twin strokes fused together what had been two separate wars , in Europe and in Asia , and also thrust a united and impassioned America into the war . It 's impossible to overstate the importance of this sequence of events to the outcome of the whole global struggle . If the Chinese had quit the war before 1941 , Japan may have joined Germany in overwhelming the Soviet Union . Further , there would be no clear route to a resolute American entry into the war . <p> The Asian-Pacific aspect of the conflict also rendered one other signal contribution to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , German commanders urged a coordinated Axis strategy of a German advance down through the Middle East to link up with a Japanese naval thrust across the Indian Ocean . This would sever the last connection between China and its allies , ending its participation in the war and freeing up large Japanese ground forces for the Pacific or for use against the Soviet Union . It would likewise collapse Great Britain 's position in India and the Middle East , a devastating blow almost certain to bring down Prime Minister Winston Churchill 's government , and eliminate the Allies ' supply route through the Persian Gulf , along which the United States shipped the majority of Lend-Lease armaments destined for the Soviets . The American victories at Midway and then Guadalcanal , however , foreclosed what loomed as the Axis powers ' last realistic chance to win the war . <p> The date of the Pearl Harbor attack additionally affords a benchmark for gauging the European and Asian-Pacific conflicts . Adolf Hitler 's Germany needed roughly 28 months to conquer an expanse of the globe spanning four time zones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months from December 1941 , imperial Japan burst from her stalemate in China to master territories from the borders of India in the east ; across Southeast Asia , China , and Korea ; northeast to the Aleutian Islands ; and southward to New Guinea and the Solomon Islands . The empire blanketed seven time zones and included about 400 million people . <p> If this portrait of the scale of the Asian-Pacific war constitutes a revelation to contemporary Americans , full grasp of the savagery of that conflict likewise provokes surprise . There are no certain figures for the overall death toll in World War II . Published totals now customarily range from 50 million to 65 million the fact that even today there is no agreement on deaths to within 10 million to 15 million is stunning . The toll in the Asian-Pacific theaters is generally placed between 17 million and 27 million . Thus , at least a third and possibly closer to half the conflict 's worldwide deaths occurred in the Asian and Pacific areas . <p> Further proof of the Far Eastern conflict 's savagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to military deaths in the European and the Asian-Pacific wars . Because Nazi Germany has , for good reason , become a symbol of evil , most Americans assume the proportion of civilian deaths was much higher in Europe . The reality is that the ratio in Europe is somewhere between 1 to 1.3 noncombatant deaths for every military death . In the Asian-Pacific theaters , however , 3 to perhaps as many as 5 noncombatants died for each combatant who was killed . Moreover , approximately 90 percent of those noncombatant deaths were not Japanese . The number of civilians killed in all the bombings of Japan , including the atomic blasts , only runs between 2 and 4 percent of all noncombatant deaths in the Asian-Pacific theaters . <p> Without a doubt , the clash between Germany and the Soviet Union featured mass barbarities and the widespread killing of prisoners of war . In the Pacific , however , imperial Japan adopted a bastardized version of the ancient Bushido warrior code between the 1920s and 1941 that inculcated the norm for every Japanese serviceman that surrender was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airman , and sailor , battle could only end in victory or extinction . Between 1937 and 1945 , there was no organized surrender of any Japanese unit in any skirmish , battle , or campaign . That 's a record utterly without historical parallel for a nation-state . Thus , the elemental force propelling the Pacific war into the unsurpassed depths of savagery was not race , but culture . <p> There is yet another startling disconnect between American memory and actual history . While the American public during World War II grasped the importance of stopping Hitler 's grand design of world conquest and they knew generally of the ruthlessness of Nazi Germany , only a minuscule number of Americans prior to April 1945 comprehended the reality of what is now referred to as the Holocaust . As late as November 1944 , a Gallup poll showed that while three out of four Americans acknowledged Jews as Hitler 's special target , only 3 percent believed that the Nazi regime had killed even as a many as one million Jews . The overwhelming majority of Americans placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credited the scattered accounts of mass , industrialized-scale murder . It was only in April 1945 , as British and U.S. forces overran concentration camps in Germany , that the reality of what Nazi Germany had perpetrated hit the vast majority of the American people . <p> In stark contrast to contemporary U.S. attitudes about Hitler 's Germany stands American knowledge about Japan . From 1937 to 1941 , the American public was showered with graphic imagery from China of Japanese savagery ; some images depicted bestiality so extreme that they were not published . By contrast , Germany made sure no such damning visual evidence escaped its orbit . Thus , prior to Pearl Harbor , the American people had no reason to judge Hitler 's Germany as inherently more evil than Japan ; if anything , the reverse was true . This perception reflected an important reality . When Hitler attacked Poland in September 1939 , his regime had at most killed tens of thousands . As of that date , Japan had slaughtered literally millions of Chinese and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin 's death toll likewise was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only moved into the millions range in the second half of 1941 . <p> Millions of viewers will approach The Pacific with one urgent question : How does it compare indeed can it compare with Band of Brothers ? At one level the parallels seem obvious . Both view the war through the eyes of men in one unit . Band of Brothers followed the paratroopers of E Company , 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment , 101st Airborne Division . The Pacific follows three main figures each serving in a separate infantry regiment of the 1st Marine Division : Robert Leckie ( 1st Marine Regiment ) , Eugene Sledge ( 5th Marines ) , and John Basilone ( 7th Marines ) . <p> What is counterintuitive about this chasm between a company and a division as the " unit " is that the average viewer will more swiftly bond with the Marines in The Pacific . Even fervent admirers of Band of Brothers confess that it takes multiple viewings to sort out all the individuals from part one to part ten . The Pacific immediately introduces the three central Marines and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . The viewer quickly recognizes " Runner , " " Hoosier , " and " Chuckler " with Leckie ; J. P.

The key exception to this pattern is Sid Phillips , who links Leckie ( Sid 's one of his buddies ) and Sledge ( Sid 's childhood friend from Mobile , Alabama ) . The structure translates directly into rapid and intense emotional investment with the characters . Added to that is the high tension the series produces by demonstrating early that there 's no guarantee any particular Marine will survive . <p> The Pacific displays the same meticulous attention to technical detail and special-effects wizardry that characterized Band of Brothers . As with the earlier miniseries , fanatics will find the rare misstep along the way , but uniforms and equipment , language and weapons ' effects overwhelmingly meet the extraordinary detailed standards set by Band of Brothers . The action sequences are , in my opinion , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jungles or Pacific islands compelled combat at extremely close range . The second is that , unlike the Germans , the Japanese chose to fight predominantely at night . While their predilection for nocturnal combat rested on tactical considerations , psychologically it also recruited man 's most primitive fears . The depiction of the struggles in darkness presents a far tougher cinematic challenge that the production brilliantly surmounts . <p> The Pacific also excels in another key dimension . Few would suggest that the Japanese were a more menacing battlefield foe than the Germans or that fighting in Europe lacked daunting physical challenges . But virtually all World War II veterans agreed that the physical rigors of fighting in dense , damp , and terrifying jungles in the Pacific and the absence of any trappings of civilization set apart combat against the Japanese . Thus , one of the triumphs of The Pacific is the graphic re-creation of that incredibly alien and depressing environment . <p> Viewers of The Pacific will note that it 's even more relentless than Band of Brothers in maintaining the perspective of front-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but inevitable consequences . Absent is much context of the larger picture , like strategy , the campaigns fought by the U.S. Army and Australians , or even air and sea battles fought in conjunction with the Marines ' struggles ashore . Moreover , some will argue that the Japanese appear stripped of all humanity . It 's true that there 's no extended treatment of any individual Japanese nor could there be under the terms of the fighting dictated by Japan . But even within those limits , the sophisticated script harbors a telling collective picture more nuanced than simply a collage of targets or tormentors . And the wrenching sequences on Okinawa , where large numbers of civilians are horrifically caught in the middle of the battle , refute any argument that only the Marines earn sympathy . <p> The Pacific will be a cultural event on the level with Band of Brothers . It can and should provoke thought and controversy . But even as a committed admirer of Band of Brothers , my ultimate verdict must be that The Pacific is grimmer and greater .

Terry Kerby cranked the hatch shut , and we settled into position in front of three small ports , gazing into the blue water while the LRT team slowly ballasted their craft . As the LRT sank and leveled , they undid the lashings for the Pisces V , and Terry piloted the vessel off the submerged deck . <p> We watched the sonar screen as the Pisces V slowly descended , the water going to deep blue and then black as the temperature dropped . Our first dives were on a pair of familiar targets , two Japanese Type A midget submarines , one of them sunk by the crew of the USS Ward ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of National Marine Sanctuaries Maritime Heritage Program works closely with the National Park Services Submerged Resources Center to monitor the Ward midget as a war grave and historic site .

Unlike HURLs 2005 discovery of the I-401 , sister ship of the I-400 , there was no intact conning tower with the subs identifying hull number painted on it . The aft deck gun remained in place , though , as did the stern . The hull was imploded , the aft hatch popped open . The damage to the bow also was evidence of a violent sinking ; the bow of the submarine was detached , twisted off to port , and the exposed torpedo tubes so badly mangled it would take hours of carefully studying video of the dive to discern that there were indeed the characteristic eight tubes , four over four , that armed the bow of the I-400 . <p> Flying solo without another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant we did not venture too close to the wreck or off to its sides , where loose piping and cables might have snagged us .

As the HURL team prepped the Pisces V and LRT , and then readied them for winter lay-up , Steve and Terry joined Hans and me as we pored over old photographs and drawings as well as the footage and still photographs from our dive .

The impact imploded the unflooded or partially flooded stern and tore the bow free . The submarine settled on more or less an even keel in some 2,300 feet of water but miles away from the rough coordinates the Navy provided . This was likely deliberate . A nascent Cold War foe , the Soviet Union , was demanding access to the I-400 and I-401 on the grounds that any Japanese military technology should be made available to all Allied powers .

Between the two world wars , several nations experimented with launching aircraft from submarines , but only the Japanese navy actually flew submarine-launched aircraft during World War II . Missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-25 against Oregon forests in August 1942 . These were the only air strikes against the continental United States during the war . <p> Design of the I-400 began in 1942 , with plans calling for a surface displacement of some 4,500 tonsalmost twice that of the largest submarine built for the U.S. Navy , the Argonaut ( SM-1/SS-166 ) , completed in 1928 . The Japanese craft was to carry two large floatplanes that would be launched by a catapult built into the outer hull structure . Subsequently , the envisioned submarine was enlarged to carry three aircraft plus parts for a fourth . <p> The submarine had a large conning tower incorporated into a hangar structure . Forward of the tower was an 85-foot , 4-inch catapult track , slightly offset to starboard . A folding crane forward could recover floatplanes that came alongside the submarine . Aircraft could be warmed up in the long , narrow hangar while the submarine was submerged through a system circulating heated lubricating oil . <p> An Aichi M6A plane would be pulled from the hangar onto the catapult , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aircraft would then be armed and launched . Four trained crewmen could prepare a plane for flight in about seven minutes . <p> Deck guns and torpedo tubes were fitted , providing the submarines with potent self-defense/attack capabilities . Other I-400 features included radar and snorkel . The craft could carry sufficient fuel to cruise farther than any non-nuclear submarine37,500 nautical miles at 14 knots on the surface . <p> The I-400 program originally was to provide 19 aircraft-carrying submarines , the I-400 through I-417 plus one unnamed unit . The lead boat was laid down on 18 January 1943 . As the war progressed , Japanese shipbuilding programs were continually cut back , and only three of the submarines were completed , the first , the I-400 , in December 1944 , and the others in January and July 1945 . The final one , the I-402 , was modified during construction to serve as a submarine tanker to carry oil from the East Indies through the U.S. submarine blockade to the Home Islands . <p> In 1943 the Japanese began developing plans for the I-400 and I-401 plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Panama Canal .

Abandoned on an isolated beach in 1869 , the rusting Sub Marine Explorer is one of the oldest surviving submarines known to exist . The deep-diving boat was built in Brooklyn in 1863 - 65 . After successful trials in New York 's East River in 1866during which her inventor , Julius Hermann Kroehl , and his backers unsuccessfully tried to sell the craft to the U.S. Navythe Explorer embarked on a new career in Panama . <p> In early 1867 , her owners , the Pacific Pearl Company of New York , partially dismantled the boat , shipped her piecemeal by steamer to Panama , and then transported her across the isthmus to the Pacific coast on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explorer for dives to harvest pearls and pearl oysters from the depths of Panama Bay . <p> Born in 1820 , Kroehl was a brilliant engineer who had immigrated to New York in 1844 from his native Prussia . After a career that included working as a daguerreotype photographer , iron manufacturer , and engineer ( he had a leading role in building New York 's Crystal Palace and a cast-iron firewatch tower that remains standing in New York City 's present-day Marcus Garvey Park ) , Kroehl turned his attention to undersea blasting and harbor clearance in 1855 . While working to clear obstructions in the East River , Kroehl met New York inventor Van Buren Ryerson , who showed him a unique diving bell that Ryerson called his " Sub Marine Explorer . " Using compressed air and a water-ballast system , Ryerson 's bell convinced Kroehl that such craft were the means to work in and conquer the underwater world . <p> During the Civil War , Kroehl first served as a civilian naval contractor and later as an acting volunteer lieutenant in the U.S. Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of New Orleans , he was unable to clear a path through hulks and chains blocking the Mississippi River at Forts Jackson and St. Philip . Later that year he was assigned to harbor clearance and underwater blasting on the James River and off Wilmington , North Carolina . <p> Back on the Mississippi and serving under Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter in 1863 , Kroehl participated in the Vicksburg campaign , but his naval career ended when yellow fever nearly killed him . During his recuperation in Washington , D.C. , he remembered Ryerson 's diving bell , and with backing from a group of prominent businessmen and politicians , he designed a submarine that incorporated many of Ryerson 's principles but was remarkably different . <p> The completed craft , also named the Sub Marine Explorer , was 36 feet long and 10 feet in diameter . Made of cast and wrought iron , the boat displaced 80 tons . While she shared some similarities to the Alligator and another contemporary U.S. submarine , the Intelligent Whale , the Explorer featured a novel design and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into three areas : a compressed air chamber lying beneath the hull 's turtleback-shaped upper hull , an interior working chamber for the crew , and a series of ten ballast tanks . To dive , a steam tender filled the high-pressure chamber with compressed air up to 200 psi . With the chamber charged , Kroehl and his crew opened seacocks from a central control station and simultaneously flooded the tanks to start the submarine 's descent . As the water rushed in , the air it displaced bled into a series of discharge pipes that fed through a central manifold and then exhausted out a valve in the conning tower . Kroehl trimmed the boat by regulating the flooding and with blasts of pressurized air to expel seawater from the ballast tanks . <p> Once at depth , Kroehl allowed enough pressured air into the working chamber to equalize with the ambient sea pressure . This allowed the crew to open hatches in the bottom of the submarine and work on the seabed , collecting oysters and pearls . A hand-cranked propeller generated up to four knots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refreshed the air . To surface , enough pressurized air would be released to blow the tanks dry . The Explorer made a series of successful dives , but without Kroehl , who died in Panama 's tropical climate in September 1867 after his fever returned . <p> The Explorer ' s only flaw was not one of design but of execution . The effects of pressure on the human body were not fully understood , nor was how to combat decompression sickness , also known as caisson disease or the bends . In 1869 , following a series of dives off Isla San Telmo , the submarine crew was stricken with what newspapers reported as " fever , " while local oral tradition suggests they died after making four-hour-long dives to more than 100 feet and then quickly resurfacing . Contemporary newspaper accounts confirm the dangerous dives and lengthy exposures to pressure . That definitely led to decompression sickness , which can be fatal . <p> The Explorer was left in a San Telmo cove and her identity eventually forgotten until a chance rediscovery in 2000 . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mystery submarine visible only at low tide and of a craft rumored to be a Japanese two-man midget submarine abandoned after an aborted World War II attack on the Panama Canal . The truthrevealed after archaeological documentation and consultation with historians Eugene Canfield , Richard Wills , Mark Ragan , Henry Silka , and Robert Schwemmerwas far more interesting . Since 2003 , I have led successive expeditions to San Telmo resulting in a series of detailed plans of the Explorer that now resides in the Historic American Engineering Record collection in the Library of Congress , more than 300 pages of historical and archaeological documentation , two documentary films , and calls from interested parties to rescue the rusting , battered craft from the surf and place her in a museum . <p> Whether or not a rescue materializes , we have learned a great deal from the wreck of the Explorer and in doing so have placed her and her long-dead inventor in their proper place as pioneers in the long saga of successful submarine development . If not for the problems with pressure sickness ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and Kroehl 's untimely death , I am convinced he and his Sub Marine Explorer could have given later submarine inventors John Holland and Simon Lake a run for their money as they took the stage in the last quarter of the 19th century . <p> Mr. Delgado is director of the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada , and cohost of National Geographic International television 's The Sea Hunters .

While these sorties were of little strategic significance , alert naval strategists may have noticed their " back-to-the-future " quality . As the U.S. military " rebalances " to the Asia-Pacific theater , the Russian Navy is pivoting back into the same European waters it became very familiar with during the Cold War . Russia apparently is deploying , and intends to continue to deploy , its navy into the vacuum created by the United States absence in the Mediterranean Sea . America should respond by adding various shipsan afloat forward-staging base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to the guided-missile destroyers ( DDGs ) we plan to home-port in the European theater in 2014 and 2015 . <h> Cold War Chessboard <p> The new U.S. strategy , commonly labeled the Defense Strategic Guidance , characterizes the worlds regions as follows : Asia-Pacific will be the new strategic center of gravity ; the Middle East will continue to be in turmoil and unstable ; Africa and Latin America will become low-cost and small-footprint theaters ; and Europe , our principal partner , will become the theater from which we will rebalance since it has become a producer rather than a consumer of security . 1 Accepting the realists vision of power politics , we are the stage managers of the Russians move to the Mediterranean , as our departure from the area triggered their arrival . <p> Past generations of American sailors viewed their Med deployments as opportunities to be central players in the naval portion of the Cold War with the Soviet Union . Although a small , confined space , the Mediterranean attracted large numbers of advanced warships from both sides . There was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this enclosed area . Indeed , the United States even had plans to do a reverse-pivot , redeploying three American carrier battle groups from the Pacific to the European theater should NATO war plans be executed . No group was without its Soviet " tattletale , " which reported all the carriers movements to Soviet fleet headquarters and was poised and positioned to launch cruise missiles . Similarly , NATO antisubmarine-warfare forcesair , surface , and subsurfacewatched every movement of Russian subs operating near Europe . <p> Those heady days have long since passed . The Soviet 5th ( Mediterranean ) Eskhadra , sometimes as big as 3050 ships and submarines , largely melted away with the fall of the Soviet Union . At the same time , NATOs war plans were superseded by the need to station American naval forces in areas central to conducting the war on terrorism and responding to global instability . This made the Mediterranean not much more than a transit stop for Atlantic Fleet warships en route to the Persian Gulf , Indian Ocean , and Gulf of Aden . The combination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean , once the planets maritime center of gravity , bereft of any navy of serious consequence for most of the 21st century . <h> The Bear Reappears <p> Russian President Vladimir Putin , never shy of taking advantage of an opportunity to expand his countrys international influence , became keenly aware of the Mediterranean power vacuum several years ago . He was equally aware that his naval fleet had been emasculated by years of neglect . Naval inventories were a shadow of their former selves , and readiness levels were precariously low . Since then , Russia made sizable improvements to its fleets size and readiness and stepped up patrols in the region , roughly coinciding with the escalation of tensions in Syria . During the past calendar year , the Black Sea Fleet alone conducted 17 operational voyages and 39 port visits in the Mediterranean , spending 650 days at sea . 2 <p> In January 2013 , Russia conducted its largest naval maneuvers in the Mediterranean since the end of the Cold War . During his visit to the Black Sea Fleet in February , Russian Defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core of all essential dangers to Russias national interests " and that continued fallout from the Arab Spring increased the importance of this region . 3 Shortly thereafter , he showcased a new Russian naval policy by announcing the decision to establish a Navy Department task force in the Mediterranean " on a permanent basis . " 4 <p> The details of that move became a hot discussion topic in the Russian military press . Many believe the Black Sea Fleet will provide the permanent core of the task force owing to its proximity to the region , with the missile cruiser Moskva its likely flagship . However , other naval experts point to the Northern Fleet as the main source of ships , as it has the most numerous and modern vessels . Russian naval officials will also consider Pacific Fleet and Baltic Fleet ships for inclusion . <p> The underlying consensus of the unclassified press reporting is that there will be around ten modern warships from various Russian fleets operating permanently in the Mediterranean . This force will be under the tactical control of an afloat staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operationally by Navy staff in St. Petersburg . Commander Admiral Viktor Chirkov added that the number of ships in the task force could be enlarged to " to include nuclear submarines , " and the carrier Admiral Kuznetsov was also rumored to become part of this force , despite her midlife upgrade scheduled for years end . 5 This permanent task force is already working to schedule future exercises with any interested NATO navy in the Mediterranean littoral , as well as with Israel and China . Precise timelines for deployments are necessarily vague and somewhat tied to Russian access to logistical and maintenance support in the region . <p> Russia also has yet to nail down which Mediterranean ports it will use . Its naval base in Tartus is its only one outside Russian territory ; with ongoing military developments in Syria , naval officials are considering other locations as their primary regional port . Unofficial rumors suggest Russia is considering ports in Cyprus , Montenegro , and Greece in addition to Syria . Of these , Cyprus has gotten the most attention , owing to the close economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fotiou acknowledged a close relationship with Russia but denied any discussion about a " permanent base " in Cyprus for Russia . 6 He did not , however , rule out a relationship in which the Russian Navy could use port facilities , much as the U.S. Fleet does in many European countries . <h> Why Move to the Med ? <p> The Russian naval movement back into the Mediterranean can be explained by a number of rational calculations ; however , no one of them is either conclusive or persuasive . This realignment is perhaps best understood by a simple confluence of supply and demand . From a supply perspective , after talking about rebuilding its defense forces for many years , Russia has finally begun to do so . The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute lists Russia at a comfortable third in global defense spending , behind the United States and China , with an impressive 113 percent growth over the past decade . The Russian Navy shipbuilding and modernization account is receiving an increasingly large share of national defense appropriations , amounting to more than $132 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additionally , Russian shipyards are finally delivering vessels to the fleet . Russia has reported that the " Navy will receive 36 warships in 2013 , an unprecedented number in Russias history . " 7 This statement should be taken with a grain of salt , because it includes a large number of very small craft , yet one can not deny that larger ships Yasen -class submarines , Steregushchiy -class frigates , Gorshkov -class corvettes , Ivan Gren class amphibious ships , Dagestan -class gunships , and Borei -class ballistic-missile submarinesare also beginning to become operational . Russias desire to expand its fleet has also resulted in the purchase of Mistral-class amphibious assault ships from France , a dramatic increase in Russian naval-school enrollment , and significant growth in cruise-missile production . All told , the Russian Navy is showing signs of growth in geographical deployments , inventory , and sophistication . <p> On the demand side , Russian President Vladimir Putin insistently asserts that the drastic upgrade in Russias defense forces is a logical response to U.S. and NATO efforts to " tip the strategic balance , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe . 8 Putin further contends that Russian military responses must be " well calculated and quick . " Any responsible Russian naval adviser would naturally point out that " quick " suggests the need for forward presence . <p> Why does the Mediterraneana body of water with no Russian seacoastqualify for this even more aggressive response ? Firstly , Russias only exit to the open ocean for its Black Sea Fleet is the Mediterranean . Russia also has long-standing economic ties to many regional states , including Greece , Libya , Cyprus , and Algeria , and is buying or selling arms with a number of the Mediterranean littoral states , including France and Algeria . Another consideration is the logistical node in Tartus , a location of increasing strategic importance during this period of ongoing Syrian conflict , especially if Russian citizens need to evacuate the country . Finally , the Russian Navy would be able to increase its readiness and develop more sophisticated training by operating in the Mediterranean during the winter months . 9 <p> However , no one of these is sufficient to invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most likely logic behind this naval movement to the southwest is probably the iron law of power politics : Nature abhors a vacuum . The regional NATO navies have been suffering an inexorable decline for years . The French and Italian naval orders of battle are shadows of their former selves , while NATOs Standing Maritime Groups are spending less time in the Mediterranean . This is partly attributable to diminishing inventories , and also to NATOs counterpiracy Operation Ocean Shield , conducted in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean . Americas European allies are more willing to leave the theater simply because NATO proclaimed that the European theater has diminished in strategic significance . In effect , the West has placed a low-cost " for rent " sign on very valuable property , and Putin has responded like any canny investor . <h> A U.S. Response ? <p> American strategy would do well to consider the Mediterranean not a European subregion , but rather the nexus of the Middle East , North Africa , and Southern Europe . Thus , our allotted military force there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must also recognize the economic constraints faced by the Pentagon and operate with " economy of force . " Furthermore , the United States should take into account balance-of-power considerations , informing the Russians that there is , in fact , no security vacuum in the region . <p> The U.S. Navys current presence in the Mediterranean does not match the strategic capabilities called for by the NATO Maritime Strategy during a time of instability and violence ( as is the current state of affairs given recent turmoil in Libya , Egypt , and Syria ) . 10 While the Maritime Strategy emphasizes the need for information sharing , interdiction missions , improved maritime-domain awareness , and potential mine-warfare and special-forces insertions , the United States and its NATO allies are instead creating a ballistic-missile defense ( BMD ) network ( the European Phased Adaptive Approach , or EPAA ) in accordance with agreed-upon NATO policy . The core of the alliances second phase of EPAA is the insertion of four BMD-capable Aegis DDGs to be home-ported by pairs in Rota , Spain , in 2014 and 2015 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect our European allies from small ballistic-missile attacks from " rogue " states , notably Iran . However , should these ships , in the performance of their designated role , be Americas sole naval presence in the Med , we could be walking in exactly the wrong strategic direction . In fact , the NATO BMD capability is likely to provoke more Russian naval activity than it deters . <p> The Russians have been very clear that any American deployments supporting BMD will be viewed as a challenge to their nuclear strategic force . The United States would be better served by downplaying the BMD role and accentuating all the other high-end military capabilities the U.S. Navy brings to the table . Its unsurpassed antiair- and antisubmarine-warfare capabilities should , in turn , evoke a NATO desire to conduct more multinational naval exercises with the United States . The deployment patterns of U.S. ships in the region should take them to the Eastern Mediterranean when a clear ballistic-missile threat occurs . Otherwise , they should act as an all-purpose , permanent American Mediterranean task force . The naval capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. high-end response to crisis and conflict in the regions of the Mediterranean littoral , from Gibraltar to the Suez . Significantly , this home-port change need not come at an exorbitant price to American taxpayers . In fact , U.S. naval leadership has characterized it as an efficiency , not an expense . 11 <p> Additional home-port changes also would be a good idea . The United States should augment the DDGs following the examples set by both the 5th and 7th Fleet areas of operation . First , to respond to the need for capability against terrorism and illicit transnational trafficking , the United States should establish an AFSB in the Mediterranean , which would then be easily employable in any of its subregions. 12 Such a ship , along the lines of the 5th Fleets USS Ponce ( LPD-15 ) , would be a cornerstone for evacuation operations and special-forces insertions , while providing the helicopter capability crucial to any humanitarian-assistance operation . Her capabilities would be closely aligned with NATO Maritime Strategy as well as the requirements posed by both African Command and Central Command . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mine warfare , Americas growing fleet of LCSs could be employed much as we are doing in Singapore for the 7th Fleet . Their beauty is not just that they should be available in large numbers , but their small size , low maintenance cost , and ability to get into Europes small and shallow harbors make them ideal for the 6th Fleet commander . To complement the homeporting of destroyers in Spain , the AFSB would be best situated in the central Med , co-located with the 6th Fleet command ship in Italy , while the LCSs would be best positioned in the Eastern Med , preferably in Greece or Turkey . <p> The cost of moving this small handful of ships to the Mediterranean , while not trivial , would not begin to compare with the cost of rebalancing to the Pacific . The benefit , however , would be substantial . First , the message to our closest allies in NATO couldnt be clearer : We are making European security a high priority , while still keeping " economy of force " in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized in the U.S. National Security Strategyat an affordable cost . Signaling our support to NATO allies now will likely pay off in the future : It is precisely these allies to whom we are most likely to turn to for assistance down the road . Along with assurance , we also gain credibility and persuasiveness when asking our allies to spend more on defense in NATO forums . <p> Second , this low-cost Mediterranean force pays a triple dividend in that it responds to the strategic challenges faced by three geographical commanders : Central Command , African Command , and European Command . Finally , the Russians will see a powerful naval response , and not one necessarily aimed only at them . Most important , they will perceive that a security vacuum no longer exists in the Mediterranean . <h> Prudent Strategic Choice <p> For several decades , the Russian Navy has disappointed in its ability to do what navies aim to do : assure allies , show the flag , project power , and influence power balances . Today , however , this meager but growing force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and others have vacated on a permanent basis . The reasons behind Moscows move are manifold , but certainly one is pure opportunity based on NATOs absence . While its actions rarely match its rhetoric , Russia has decidedly amped up its presence in the Mediterranean at the same time NATO allies appear to have lost their motivation to control this region . <p> Many American policymakers decry the negative consequences of removing all troops from Afghanistan , but this is what we and our allies have nearly done in the Mediterranean . A small naval reinvestment in the Mediterranean would be a very prudent strategic choice for both deterring Russian ascendancy in the region and demonstrating American commitment to European allies . In other words , a stronger U.S. presence in the region would be a low-price offering with the potential for a significant strategic return on investment . <p> 12 .

From this altitude we could both fend off fighter planes and attack shipping . However , there was a fog bank lying on the water and I could go in to the coastline only so far . I was then concerned about running into a hill or mountain , as my forward visibility was virtually nil . We then turned to the southwest and proceeded down the coast . <p> This portion of the patrol was flown about 100 feet above the water and about three to five miles offshore .

With the engines set at 45 inches of manifold pressure and 2,500 rpms , and assisted by a tail wind , our attack speed was about 235 knots .

With the contents preserved electronically , they will be available to Members now and in the years to come to access , use , and enjoy . <p> A s the 20th century dawned , the United States of America stepped into a new position on the world stage . The Indian Wars had end ed in the previous decade . Manifest Destiny was complete . <p> Electricity was rapidly expanding through American cities . By 1900 the United States was the worlds leading agricultural producer , dominated the global petroleum industry with major oil fields in Kansas , Illinois , Louisiana , Oklahoma , and Texas , and Andrew Carnegie had the worlds largest steel mill in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . Marconi and the Wright Brothers were making real progress in their experiments with radio and powered flight . As Alfred Thayer Mahan predicted ten years earlier , America began looking outward . <p> With victory in the Spanish-American War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worlds naval powers . Alongside this military development , a series of Worlds Fairs expanded the American peoples consciousness of the rest of the globe , and the start of the Progressive movement drove political discussion about governments role both at home and internationally . As technological development accelerated and globalization began to drive international commerce , the officers of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps faced the start of a challenging but exciting decade . In 1900 the pages of The Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute , the premier journal of naval and maritime thought , began to reflect the new realities of a new century . <p> The first 25 years of Proceedings , with the writings of luminaries like Admiral Stephen B. Luce , Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan , and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt , made the case for why the nation needed a powerful Navy . From 1900 to 1909 a shift began in the writing and thinking in Proceedings that focused on how to use the Navy as much as why the nation needed one . A new crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Sims , Bradley Fiske , and Edward Beach , among others , would lead reform in the Navy and Marine Corps and eventually rise to the highest levels of command in World War I. <p> The breadth of subjects covered in the first decade of the 20th century is staggering , and demonstrates the healthy and sometimes contentious state of naval debate during the period . In the short space available it is impossible to cover all of them . The following highlights appear to be particularly relevant for todays readers . However , there is an incredible wealth of material here for further study by both historians and officers interested in their profession . <p> Throughout the period Proceedings remained a focal point for the discussion of contemporary naval operations . Articles in the opening years of the decade continued to examine the results of the Spanish-American War to determine ways to improve both tactically and operationally . Mid-decade there was heavy discussion of the Russo-Japanese War , in particular lessons to be learned from the Battle of Tsushima . But there were also articles on Navy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Boxer Rebellion . <p> One of the subjects that dominated the early years of the decade and continued at a low simmer , was discussion of coastal defense and the introduction of self-propelled torpedoes and torpedo boats . The threat of the Spanish fleet descending on the East Coast of the United States was a severe restriction on the Navys war planning in 1898 . In the pages of Proceedings , officers explored the need to be able to contest an enemys access to the American coastline and deny areas to opposing fleets . Starting with the very first articles published in the period , Lieutenant R. H. Jacksons 1900 General Prize-winning " Torpedo Craft : Types and Employment " and Lieutenant L. H. Chandlers " The Automobile Torpedo and Its Uses , " swarming torpedo boats and the game-changing weapon called the automobile torpedo inspired creative new ideas from the worlds rising naval power . <p> While the fleet had grown significantly in both size and shape during the preceding 25 years , much of the Navys organization remained stagnant . Military conservatism was alive and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a multitude of calls for reform from the junior and mid-grade ranks so strongly represented in the pages of Proceedings . Numerous articles made the case for improved training for new officers and sailors and suggested new ways to deliver it . There were also several Marines who wrote articles advocating adoption of more rigorous drill manuals and reorganization of the Marine Corps at both the company and regimental levels . <p> According to several authors , the promotion and personnel system for officers was in dire need of reform . Starting with Lieutenant Richard Jacksons 1905 article " Promotion , Present and Prospective " a healthy debate erupted over the subject as many argued for the introduction of merit-based promotion by selection , rather than simple seniority , and others contested the idea . In 1906 the General Prize was awarded to Commander Hawley Rittenhouse for his essay " Promotion by Selection " which set the tenor for the debate that continued well into the next decade . <p> But Proceedings authors werent just writing about organization and training or anti-access operations . The technology of naval warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the future of the battleship seemed to dominate the journals pages for the entire decade . Starting with Captain Asa Walkers article " With Reference to the Size of Fighting Ships " in 1900 , the debate centered around the balancing of speed , armor , and size of the guns . Contributions came from as far away as the United Kingdom and Italy . Lieutenant Homer Poundstone , who wrote two articles on the subject , would become a central figure in the discussion both with the Institute and in Washington , D.C. <p> The climax of the give and take occurred in 1905 and 1906 , when Captain Mahan and Lieutenant Commander Sims presented dueling views on the value of the all-big-gun battleship . The arguments were so comprehensive and compelling that both articles were entered into the record of the U.S. Senate during naval debates and they were reprinted in newspapers and magazines around the country . In 1907 the debate came to life when the Royal Navy made its new all-big-gun battleship HMS Dreadnought the flagship of the Home Fleet , and the U.S. Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1900 to 1909 were dominated by the writing of junior officers . It is interesting to note that during the period only three active-duty admirals were published in its pages . Under the guidance of Phillip Alger , a civilian professor at the Naval Academy who took over as editor in 1903 and served well into the next decade , Proceedings became the center of vital naval reforms needed to set the stage for American ascendance on the worlds oceans . It was the birthplace of ideas that would set the course for a new naval century . <p> Lieutenant Commander Armstrong is a naval aviator and a member of the U.S. Naval Institutes Editorial Board .

@@21175889 @1175889/ 61078 @qwx261078 61082 @qwx261082 <h> Proving the Power of Iron Over Wood <p> Often overshadowed by her smaller , turreted nemesis , the ironclad CSS Virginia inaugurated a new era in naval warfare . <p> When the CSS Virginia slowly steamed down the Elizabeth River on 8 March 1862 , the tide of naval warfare turned from wooden ships to armored , internally powered vessels . Little did the ironclads crew realize that its makeshift warship would achieve the Confederacys greatest naval victory . The trip was regarded by many to be simply a shakedown cruise . Instead the Virginia s aggressive commander , Flag Officer Franklin Buchanan , made the voyage a trial by fire that proved the power of iron over wood . <p> The full story began in 1854 when the steam frigate Merrimack s keel was laid at Charlestown Navy Yard near Boston . The ships most notable feature was her screw propeller , which required her engines to be installed below the waterline , where the propulsion system was protected from shell fire . Launched in 1857 , the Merrimack was quickly acclaimed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval architecture . " Even though she was considered the " finest vessel of war of her class that had ever been constructed , " the ship rolled badly , which lessened her strength as a gun platform , and her engines were a constant problem . Consequently , she was placed in ordinary on 6 February 1860 at Gosport Navy Yard , across the Elizabeth River from Norfolk , Virginia . <p> When the secession crisis erupted nearly a year later , Gosport fell into disorder . The yards 68-year-old commandant , Flag Officer Charles Stewart McCauley , was rumored to have taken to drink and often was ridiculed as being too old for active command . Upon Virginias adoption of an ordinance of secession on 17 April 1861 , the yard was surrounded by local pro-Southern citizens demanding that Gosport be surrendered to the commonwealth . Despite his orders to get the Merrimack out of the yard , McCauley ordered the naval facility and most of the ships assigned there to be burned and abandoned on 20 April . <p> The morning after the blaze , the Virginians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among the rubble , scuttled ships , and charred buildings , the Confederacy was able to find the wherewithal to create a challenge to the U.S. Navy . The Federals had left with such great haste that their destructive work was far from complete . More than five warehouses filled with naval supplies survived the flames . The Federals also abandoned a tremendous array of ordnance , including 1,085 heavy cannon and more than 250,000 pounds of powder . Numerous facilities , including the foundry , machine shop , granite drydock , and several workshops remained untouched by the blaze . More important , the retreating Federals failed to destroy the infrastructure that would enable the Confederacy to construct vessels to counter the Federal blockade . The Richmond Daily Enquirer gloated over the abundance of equipment and supplies , claiming that " we have material enough to build a navy of iron-plated ships . " <p> Flag Officer French Forrest assumed command of the yard on 22 April . Only a few years younger than McCauley , Forrest was known as a " blusterer of the real old-tar school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reorganizing Gosport . It was quickly discovered that several ships were not total losses ; the sloops Germantown and Plymouth , as well as the Merrimack , all appeared to be salvageable . The Merrimack was raised and placed in drydock , but the question remained what to do with the burned and blackened hulk . <h> The Confederacys Iron-Armored Ship <p> Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory understood that the nascent country required a new type of warship to challenge the Union Navy . On 10 May 1861 he told the Confederate Congress : " I regard the possession of an iron-armored ship as a matter of the first necessity . Such a vessel at this time could traverse the entire coast of the United States , prevent all blockades , and encounter , with a fair prospect of success , their entire Navy . " <p> To achieve his goal , Mallory decided the best option was to convert the Merrimack into an ironclad . He assigned the project to C.S. Navy Lieutenant John M. Brooke , Naval Constructor John L. Porter , and Chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloped casemate with the ships ends submerged . Because marine engines could not be quickly constructed in the South , Williamson advised reusing the Merrimack s condemned engines . Porter agreed that Brookes concept could be applied to the Merrimack s hull , and he developed plans and set to work reconfiguring the frigate as an ironclad . <p> The new ship would have a total length of just over 262 feet and a draft of 22 feet . Porter supervised the removal of all the Merrimack s remaining upper works and then cut the ship on a straight line from bow to stern at the berth-deck level . Soon the main gun deck was laid and the casemate began to take shape . This structure would be the ironclads most distinctive feature , beginning 28 feet from her bow and extending aft 172 feet . The fantail continued another 56 feet . The casemate sides were sloped at a 36-degree angle to deflect shot , but the acute slope allowed only 7 feet of headroom and a beam of 30 feet . The roof was grated to provide ventilation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yellow pine and white oak . Three hatches provided access to the 14-foot-wide hurricane deck , and the front of the casemate featured a conical iron pilothouse . <p> The sides of the casemate consisted of a 4-inch-thick layer of oak laid horizontally , an 8-inch vertical layer of yellow pine , and a 12-inch horizontal layer of white pine , all bolted together . The structure was then sheathed with two layers of iron plates , 2 inches thick by 6 inches wide , the first laid horizontally and the second vertically . The juncture of the casemate and the hull was an obvious weak point , so Porter devised a displacement that would submerge the knuckle two feet below the waterline . To help protect the ships hull , a course of one-inch-thick iron plate extended to a depth of three feet around the vessel and the casemate eaves were extended two feet . <p> While the ship was being reconfigured , Brooke was working with Tredegar Iron Works in Richmond on the production of rifled cannon as part of his effort to arm the Merrimack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bands welded around the breech to resist the greater pressure of firing rifled projectiles . Brooke also invented explosive shells and , more important , an elongated , armor-piercing wrought-iron bolt for both the 7-inch and 6.4-inch versions of his rifled cannon . <p> Because Mallory wanted the Merrimack armed with the finest possible heavy cannon , Brooke proposed that she carry a broadside battery of six IX-inch Dahlgren smoothbores and two 6.4-inch rifles . Two of the Dahlgrens were hot-shot guns , and a special furnace was installed in the engine room to prepare shot for these weapons during combat . A 7-inch Brooke rifle rested on a pivot mount at each end of the casemate , where the structure was pierced by three gun ports . In addition to this armament , a 1,500-pound cast-iron ram was attached to the ships bow . <h> Commissioning , Crew , and Commander <p> The Confederates were in a rush to finish the ship ; news of the construction of several Union ironclads meant that the South might lose its armored advantage if their vessel was not quickly put into action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production , but the reconfigured ship finally was launched on 17 February 1862 and commissioned as the CSS Virginia . She appeared to be a powerful warship ; however , there were several defects . Her ram was poorly mounted , and Porter had miscalculated the vessels displacement , which resulted in her riding too high in the water . Ballast was added to lower her . Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones , the Virginia s executive officer , was still displeased and believed that the ironclads hull required additional protection . ( The " ap " in Jones name is a Welsh patronymic meaning " son of . " ) <p> Jones also needed to recruit a crew . He was able to assemble an excellent group of officers , including Lieutenants Robert Dabney Minor , Hunter Davidson , John Taylor Wood , and H. Ashton Ramsay , but most of the available seamen in the South had joined the Confederate Army . Jones assigned the recruitment of sailors to Wood , who was a grandson of former President Zachary Taylor and nephew by marriage to Confederate President Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men from local Confederate units . The ships complement of 350 men was not filled until 6 March , when 39 men of the United Artillery Company ( Co . E. , 41st Virginia Infantry ) , commanded by Captain Thomas Kevill , volunteered for service . <p> To command the Virginia and the other warships of the James River Squadron , Mallory selected Franklin Buchanan , a 46-year veteran of the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Naval Academys first superintendent . The Maryland native was an excellent choice , " hailed with great satisfaction " by the ironclads crew . " A typical product of the old-time quarter deck , " John Randolph Eggleston , one of the Virginia s lieutenants , wrote of Buchanan . He was " as indomitably courageous as Nelson and as arbitrary . " <p> Workmen were still completing the conversion when Buchanan arrived at Gosport Navy Yard on 24 February . That day Mallory , who expected great things of both Buchanan and the ironclad , wrote the commander that the " Virginia is a novelty in naval construction , is untried and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ram are regarded as formidable , and it is hoped that you may be able to test them . Like a bayonet charge of infantry , this mode of attack , while most distinctive , will commend itself to you in this present scarcity of ammunition . " The Confederate Navy secretary also suggested that if the ironclad could " pass Old Point near the mouth of Hampton Roads and make a dashing cruise on the Potomac as far as Washington , its effect upon the public mind would be important to our cause . " <p> Such a bold move could bring victory at a time when the Confederacy was reeling from defeats in Tennessee and along the Carolina sounds . Mallory was convinced " that the opportunity and the means for striking a blow for our Navy are now for the first time presented . " The secretary concluded his letter by stating that " Action , prompt and successful actionnow would be of serious importance to our cause . " <p> Mallorys instructions were not lost on Franklin Buchanan , who on 4 March reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He selected Newport News Point as his target , but his hopes for a joint army-navy attack were dashed by the unwillingness of Major General John Bankhead Magruder , commander of the Confederate Army of the Peninsula , to cooperate . Undaunted , Buchanan still intended to take his ironclad into action as quickly as possible . A gale forced him to call off attacks on 6 and 7 March , as the Virginia needed calm waters in which to operate . <h> Day of Destiny <p> On 8 March the weather cleared , and Buchanan prepared the Virginia for action . Her casemate was coated with tallow ( ships grease ) , which Jones thought would increase the tendency of projectiles to deflect off the structure . Buchanan had his flag officer pendant hoisted , and at 1100 the Virginia steamed away from the quay . As she made her way down the Elizabeth River , accompanied by her gunboat consorts Beaufort and Raleigh , both sides of the riverbank were " thronged with people . " The Virginia s surgeon , Dinwiddie Phillips , commented , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel appearance , and desirous of witnessing our movements through the water . " He added that " Few , if any entertained an exalted idea of our efficiency , and many predicted a total failure . " <p> Meanwhile , the Virginia s crew became aware of problems with the ship . " From the start we saw that she was slow , not over five knots , " Lieutenant Wood later commented . " She steered so badly that , with her great length it took thirty to forty minutes to turn . . . . She was as unmanageable as a water-logged vessel . " <p> As the ironclad entered Hampton Roads , the Federal fleet , including five major warshipsthe sloop Cumberland ( 24 guns ) and frigates Congress ( 52 ) , Minnesota ( 47 ) , Roanoke ( 42 ) , and St. Lawrence ( 50 ) were visible in the distance arrayed between Newport News Point and Fort Monroe . Undaunted by such a force , Buchanan informed his crew : " Sailors in a few minutes you will have the long awaited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . Remember that you are about to strike for your country and your homes , your wives , and your children . The Confederacy expects everyman to do his duty , beat to quarters . " <p> Midshipman Hardin Littlepage recalled Buchanan reminding everyone that " many Confederates had complained that they were not taken near enough to the enemy and he assured us that there should be no complaint this time , for he intended to head directly for the Cumberland . " Buchanan concluded his exhortations with the admonition : " Those ships must be taken . . . . Go to your guns . " <p> Even though the Federals knew about the Confederate ironclad project , they were surprised by the Virginia s appearance . As the ship cleared the Elizabeth River , a crewman on board the Congress , anchored near the Cumberland off Newport News Point , noted , " I believe that thing is a-comin down at last . " To the Union sailors , the Virginia looked like " the roof of a very big barn belching forth as from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ironclad headed for the Cumberland . As she passed the Congress , the Virginia delivered a devastating starboard broadside of shell and hot shot into the frigate . She then slammed into the Cumberland s starboard quarter , losing her ram in the process but leaving an enormous hole in the sloops side . Shot and shell from Union warships and shore batteries harmlessly bounced off the Virginia s casemate while she exchanged broadsides with the sinking Cumberland . As the Virginia steamed upriver for deeper water to execute a turn , she destroyed two Union transports moored along a wharf . <p> After making the long , slow turn , the ironclad pulled to within several hundred yards of the Congress , which had grounded , and shelled the frigate into submission . But when Union gunners and troops ashore kept up their fire , Buchanan , who sustained a bullet wound , ordered hot shot fired into the Congress , which was soon in flames . Continuing eastward , the ironclad fired into the grounded Minnesota and St. Lawrence before anchoring off Sewells Point for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the U.S. Navy . Besides the destroyed Cumberland and Congress , Union losses that day included a steam frigate damaged , a sailing frigate slightly damaged , a tug sunk , another tug damaged , two transports destroyed , a transport captured , and 247 men killed . <p> Crossing Hampton Roads the next morning to finish off the Minnesota , the Virginia encountered the Monitor , which she battled to a draw . Armed with no solid projectiles except hot shot , the Confederate ironclad was unable damage her opponent except for a shell that struck the Monitor s pilothouse . <p> Robert Minor , who was wounded in the first days fighting , wrote : " It was a great victory . . . . The IRON and the HEAVY GUNS did the work . " However , Catesby Jones viewed the two-day battle as only a partial success . He noted that the " destruction of those wooden vessels was a matter of course especially so , being at anchor , but in not capturing the ironclad , I feel as if we had done nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginia s actions on 8 and 9 March vindicated Mallorys faith in the Confederate ironclad , and the secretary believed that the ship had won " the most remarkable victory which naval annals record . " While Mallory hoped that the Virginia could strike Northern ports such as New York , Buchanan , who was promoted to rear admiral , thought that the ironclad was unseaworthy , " by no means invulnerable , " and should be used only to defend Norfolk . <p> Following the 9 March engagement , the undefeated Virginia s mere presence accomplished that task . Moreover it disrupted Union Major General George B. McClellans plans for his Army of the Potomac to march on Richmond by way of the Virginia Peninsula . The senior U.S. Navy officer on the scene , Flag Officer Louis M. Goldsborough , was fixated on the Virginia and rumored to be suffering from " ram fever " or " Merrimac on the brain . " Consequently , he declared the James River closed to Union naval operations and refused to attack the Confederate water batteries on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goldsborough believed , was to focus on keeping the Virginia in check . Therefore , instead of naval forces outflanking the Confederate defensive line across the lower peninsula , McClellan was forced to besiege it . That delayed the Union march on Richmond by a month , giving Confederates time to redeploy troops to defend their capital . <p> After the Battle of Hampton Roads , the Virginia s damage was repaired . Because Buchanans wound was slow to heal , Flag Officer Josiah Tattnall replaced him as commander of the James River Squadron . The 67-year-old officer had served in the U.S. Navy from 1812 until February 1861 . Lieutenant William Parker of the gunboat Beaufort described him as the " beau ideal of a naval officer " and possessing " all the traits found in heroic characters . " Yearning to battle the Monitor , he steamed the Virginia into the Roads on 11 April , but no engagement ensued . <p> An opportunity for another ironclad battle arose on 8 May when the Monitor shelled Sewells Point . But when the Virginia emerged from the Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time was running out for the Virginia . Confederate forces abandoned their lower peninsula defenses on 3 May , leaving Norfolk isolated . During a visit to Fort Monroe to push for a Union advance up the James , President Abraham Lincoln orchestrated the capture of Norfolk on 10 May . The Virginia was left without a port and , because of her great draft , the warship could not be effectively lightened to enable her to steam to Richmond . Consequently , she was run aground off Craney Island and scuttled . Tattnall sadly telegraphed Mallory , " The Virginia no longer exists . " Lamenting the ships loss , crew member Richard Curtis reflected that it was " a sad finish to such a bright beginning . " <p> The CSS Virginia was without question the most successful Confederate ironclad . She won the race , albeit for just one day , for naval supremacy in Hampton Roads , thereby becoming the first armored warship in modern history to sink another warship . The Virginia s brief career ended ingloriously , yet the Confederate ship achieved everlasting fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as Franklin Buchanan wrote , " of iron-clad warfare at sea . " Indeed , the Virginia and her antagonist , the Monitor , ushered in a new age of naval design when they fought in Hampton Roads . Although the brilliant Swedish-American inventor John Ericssons Monitor is generally credited as being the ship design of the future , the Virginia s ramming of the Cumberland and total destruction of the Congress proved the power of iron over wood . <p> John V.

An American Indian word meaning " swift water , " Merrimack is the name of a 110-mile river that begins in New Hampshire .

The following recollection of that bloody encounter is based on former Naval History editor Fred Schultz 's interview with him , which appeared in the June 2002 issue . <p> What I remember most about my service is the day I got shot . It was on 2 January in 1944 . The 3d Battalion , 7th Marines in which I was a member of L Company , 2d Platoon and the 3d Battalion , 5th Marines were to do a sweep in front of the lines at Cape Gloucester on New Britain . <p> We 'd been on patrols out there a number of times , had the perimeter set up , and were to clear the front of 1st and 2d battalions of the 7th . I was a scout . We advanced about a half-mile or a mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicular to our line of advance and into the perimeter . As we got near , the other scout and I saw that the ground was very level until we reached the edge of the declivity that led down to the creek . <p> The creek itself was probably 10 to 15 feet wide . We did n't know at the time the Japanese had dug their pillboxes into the side of the bank , on the opposite side , just below the lip . We could see several Japanese soldiers . We did n't know whether they were decoys or what , but they seemed oblivious to our approach . <p> We checked with the squad leader , who said , " Open fire ! " So we opened up on them . Within a minute or less , all hell breaks loose . <p> The machine-gun squad supporting us was not set up when we moved off the lip and down the creek bank . The slope was probably about 45 degrees . I was on my haunches when all of a sudden the gun immediately opposite me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started off to my left and got immediate hits . At that point , they hit the gunnery sergeant off to my left . Then they started searching back toward me and the guys to my right . <p> The first bullet hit me in the left elbow . It felt like a sledgehammer . Probably fortunately , it pulled me somewhat to the left . The next round hit me in the right shoulder and lodged in my chest at about the tenth rib . They were hitting men all over . Our machine gun never got set up . Both BAR ( Browning automatic rifle ) men in our squad were killed . Our battalion commander lost control of the situation . The 2d and 3d platoons of L Company were pinned down , and we lost , dead and wounded , probably 60 percent . In a matter of about five minutes , our squad alone had five killed and six wounded , one of whom subsequently died . <p> I was lying downhill on the creek bank , and I did n't know whether I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted around and numb . I knew the shoulder wound did no nerve damage because I could see the bullet hole . So I lay there a while . <p> We tried to get corpsmen to come up , but they could n't . So finally , I started to get up , and I did n't know how to do it . I tried to turn myself around , but not being able to use your arms makes it even more difficult to get on your knees . <p> So I was thrashing around , trying to get at least pointed uphill , when the Japanese see the movement . They open fire again , and this time they hit me through the left buttocks and shoot off the left side of my heel . It feels like a whip hitting me . <p> That was the only time I got angry . I 'd been pretty cool up until then , trying to figure how to get out . We knew they did n't take prisoners , but I was wondering why they were shooting at a wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I shouted some epithets at them . <p> Then I lay there probably two hours . I noticed it was getting dark , but it was only about noon . I began to wonder if I was dying . To my right , I saw Private Floyd Martin behind a log . I yelled , " Martin , can you get my helmet out of my eyes ? I ca n't see . " <p> He said , " I 'm afraid I ca n't do it , but I 'll see if I can reach you with my rifle . " He reached over with his rifle and was able to use the barrel to knock my helmet upward . So then I could see and watch . The Japanese fire the same way we do , probably one tracer to three ball , so I can tell where the gun immediately opposite me is firing . <p> Another gun was to my right , not immediately in front of me . The guy with the gun immediately opposite me , in the pillbox , evidently sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . <p> At a time like that , you do n't realize you can get superhuman strength . I was able in some way to turn myself at least partially sideways , so I could get a little roll . I got myself up and walked on my knees to where the bank leveled off . Off to my right I could see the machine-gun squad , who never got set up . If they 're not all dead , they 're all dying by that time . The Japanese gunner sees me , but he ca n't get his gun low enough to hit me . <p> I 'm next lying on my back after falling . I could see the tracers , which looked like they were very close to hitting me . By this time , our platoon leader was killed trying to get people out . Some men were going to get medals that day , and it 's questionable whether others should . Lieutenant Thomas J. O'Leary , a New York Irishman , was the commander of the weapons platoon . He and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they do n't get any medals . <p> So the two came up to me . They had to lie flat and push with their feet , because they could n't crawl ; that 's how low the tracers were . Hartman inched around and gave me a shot of morphine . O'Leary said to me because I 'm lying with my head toward them " We can not get on our knees . Can you stand it if we pull you by your dungarees ? " I said , " Yes , any way to get me out of here . " So they had to move using only their toes , as they 're lying perfectly flat , and pull me probably 30 yards before they were able to get on their knees and move me to a battalion aid station , about 300 yards back . <p> There , they put me on a stretcher and just like you see them doing in the stills from World War II or in Vietnam they stuck a rifle with its bayonet in the ground and from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearers later hauled me probably a half-mile . Japanese mortars fire , and the bearers dropped me . They finally got me to a jeep , which they needed because of the mud . Gloucester has the heaviest rainfall average in the world : 400 inches in the rainy season . <p> I stayed in the regimental aide station for 2 .5 days . By that time shock set in and I have very little memory of it . They were not able to get planes to the strips , so they evacuated us on an LST ( tank landing ship ) . The LST has probably the worst smell I ever smelled in my life . Some of about 250 guys had n't had a bandage changed in 2 .5 or 3 days , like me . Nothing stinks like blood .

To put this into context , one simply has to reference " The Aegis Weapon System , " a 2009 Naval Engineers Journal article by Joseph Threston on the history of Aegis , which includes a time line of significant events starting with the establishment of the Advanced Surface Missile System ( ASMS ) project in November 1963 and ending with the intercept by the USS Lake Erie ( CG-70 ) of an errant U.S. satellite in February 2008 . <p> While with most stories , one needs to start at the beginning to truly understand the significance of an accomplishment , this story starts at the end of Mr. Threstons timelineDecember 2007 to be specificand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adaptability of the Aegis weapon system and the AN/SPY-1 radar , to the needs and demands of national policy . This story also demonstrates the critical skills and expertise of the engineering community at Lockheed Martin who are the leaders of combat system , radar , and ballistic-missile defense ( BMD ) engineering , as well as the missile-systems engineering skills of Raytheon . <h> The Question <p> We were in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii , and in the final stages of reviewing our readiness to execute " Stellar Kiji " the first Japanese BMD flight mission ( JFTM-1 ) . Out of nowhere , we were asked how feasible it would be for Aegis to shoot down a satellite . Our initial answer was that this capability existed if certain modifications were made to the weapon system , and that those modifications would be driven by the mission and specific target characteristics . We completed our readiness review for Stellar Kiji , transitioned to the Pacific Missile Range Facility ( PMRF ) , and started the mission countdown . While at PMRF , we assembled a technical team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Systems , the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ( JHU APL ) , and the Naval Surface Warfare Center ( NSWC ) Dahlgren and Port Hueneme Divisionsto examine feasibility of a satellite shootdown at a greater level of detail . That team produced a list of " unknowns , " which required data to give an unqualified answer to the question of our capability . <p> On 17 December 2007 , during the Stellar Kiji test event , the Japanese guided-missile destroyer Kongo successfully detected , tracked , and engaged a medium-range ballistic-missile target launched from PMRF with the Aegis BMD weapon system . The Aegis weapon system guided the Standard Missile-3 ( SM-3 ) Block IA to a successful intercept outside the Earths atmosphere . JFTM-1 was the first such event in which a Japanese ship engaged a ballistic missile . This was a major milestone in the growing cooperation between Japan and the United States . Following the mission and quick-look data reduction , we departed Hawaii for a well-deserved holiday leave . JFTM-1 had been the programs fifth flight mission in an extremely busy year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afterglow of success , until . . . <h> Operation Burnt Frost <p> It was early January 2008 when we received a phone call asking for us to meet with " the customer " in Chantilly , Virginia , to examine potential courses of action to neutralize a National Reconnaissance Office Satellite named USA 193 . This satellite had been launched on 14 December 2006 but had become uncontrollable after reaching orbit . Because the satellite failed so soon after launch , 1,000 pounds of hydrazine fuel was still present . As the satellite had no power , the tank and fuel it contained were presumed to be frozen . Analyses by others indicated the tank would survive reentry and , if it were to land in a populated area and release its contents , pose a serious risk to human life . <p> Preferable courses of action to neutralize USA 193 were rapidly narrowed down by the Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) to three options for the mission now known as " Operation Burnt Frost . " The options were to use ground-based missile defense , terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not yet been selected as the preferred solution , we prepared as if it would be . The time line was being driven by the satellite descent , and we had approximately six weeks to engineer and implement a solution . We began to conduct reversible design activities so as not to preclude the use of Aegis BMD if so ordered . A few early decisions kept the Aegis BMD option open : <p> 1 . Three SM-3 Block IA missiles had recently completed final assembly and checkout , were accepted by the government , and were being prepared for shipment . Although we did not yet know the extent of the design changes , we assumed some change would be necessary to the missiles designated for the mission . Given the tight schedule , we did not have sufficient time to pull missiles out of fleet inventory , nor did we have time to build new rounds . The only prudent course of action was to stop the shipment of the three recently accepted rounds in order to accomplish necessary modifications when designed . <p> 3 .

The establishment of a design precept to reduce risk by minimizing configuration changes , and limiting change to software . Each change brought along a tail of rigorous testing to ensure errors or regressions were not introduced , and there was insufficient time to qualify hardware changes . By minimizing change , we could ensure due diligence in the test program within the compressed schedule . <p> 5 . The decision to execute the mission as closely as possible to the process used for test events the MDA was already conducting . This would bring procedures and instrumentation that were already in place to bear with little or no learning curve . <p> A week later , the Surface Navy Association National Symposium was being held in Crystal City , Virginia . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hendrickson , was in attendance . The Lake Erie was the ship designated to conduct most of the Aegis BMD test events . The crew had the experience , and the ship had the right instrumentation to execute Burnt Frost as it was ultimately designated as the primary firing ship for the mission . The USS Decatur ( DDG-73 ) was designated as the secondary firing ship . Captain Hendrickson accompanied us to Lockheed Martin for the first design review and discussion of possible concepts of engagement for the mission . Three concepts of engagement were prepared by Lockheed Martin based on the AN/SPY-1 data collected at CSEDS . A preferred concept was selected , and a proof-of-concept effort began . After repeatable results were demonstrated , the preferred concept of engagement became the procedure that would be followed for the mission , and guided the design changes and configuration that was ultimately employed . <h> Aegis BMD Delivers <p> As the MDA evaluated all three engagement options available , they concluded that Aegis BMD had the flexibility to accomplish the mission objectives , the mobility to cover various orbital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary altitude with the required lethality . In addition , the choice to use Aegis BMD was in large part due to its successful track record of 13 out of 15 attempts at shooting down ballistic missiles . This set in motion a myriad of simultaneous and coordinated efforts : The missiles were prepared to accept a new software program concurrent with a design review held at Raytheon Missile Systems ; testing of the mission configuration at CSEDS ; delivery of media and training of the crews ; authorization testing by NSWC Dahlgren and safety approval by the WSESRB ; exercising the mission procedures between JHU APL , CSEDS , and the participating ships ; preparations at PMRF for both the mission and ability to coordinate with combatant commanders ; arranging shipment of the modified SM-3 missiles ; tasking of national assets to collect additional data on the satellite ; and thousands of model runs at JHU APL , Lockheed Martin , Raytheon , and at the tasking of the MDA , national laboratories . <p> On 14 Februrary 2008 , the Lake Erie and Decatur onloaded the modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the mission . Following their sortie , Deputy Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General James Cartwright made a public announcement that the United States intended to shoot down USA 193 . In this announcement he described several criteria as to when , how , and why the satellite would be shot down . The major objective was to reduce the risk to space , air , and terrestrial platforms . He explained that they would wait for the space shuttle to land , so the potential harm to the vehicle would not be a factor . Next , they would wait until the satellite was close to reentry to limit the amount of space debris created . Finally , one of the most challenging requirements for Aegis would be to prevent the satellite from entering the Earths atmosphere because of its non-aerodynamic characteristics , making it extremely hard to intercept . He suggested that these criteria gave them an eight-day window to successfully complete Operation Burnt Frost . <p> On 20 February Secretary of Defense Robert Gates approved the mission . " Weapons free " authorization was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missile was fired . The Aegis weapon system guided the missile to intercept , using data from AN/SPY-1 and other sources to provide fire-control data prior to release of the kill vehicle . After AN/SPY-1 detected and tracked the satellite and the Aegis weapon system provided the last guidance update , the SM-3 kill vehicle was released . It intercepted USA 193 at a closing velocity in excess of 22,000 miles per hour and at an altitude higher than 150 miles . Instrumentation confirmed destruction of the hydrazine tank and the risk it posed . <p> The team had just averted a near-disastrous situation for the world . <h> The Long Road to Burnt Frost <p> The ability to engineer and execute Operation Burnt Frost was not just happenstance . It was a crescendo in a long heritage of excellence beginning with the ASMS Project . <p> When the project began in 1963 , the Surface Missile System Fleet consisted of the Terrier , Tartar , and Talos systems , known as the " 3 Ts . " They suffered from problems in reliability , insufficient firepower , slow reaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive maintenance to remain ready for use . Correcting these shortcomings ultimately became cornerstones and major objectives of the Aegis program . The mission also evolved from one designed to primarily counter manned aircraft , to one of countering cruise-missile threats . At the time , no one could have considered BMD to be a mission , or the ability to destroy a satellite as a design objective . <p> In the early 1990s , President George H. W. Bush ( and subsequently the Clinton administration ) shifted the military strategy from national missile defense to theater ballistic-missile defense . This shift brought to reality the use of Aegis in the missions of tactical regional BMD andwith the United States withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile ( ABM ) Treaty of 1972a strategic sea-based ABM capability . The Navy began research that essentially formed the basis of the Aegis BMD program , culminating with the first intercept of a ballistic-missile target using the Aegis weapon system and an SM-3 missile on 25 January 2002 . <p> President George W. Bush signed National Security Policy Directive ( NSPD ) 23 on 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed with fielding an initial set of missile-defense capabilities . Furthermore , NSPD 23 stated the intent to begin operating initial capabilities in 2004 and 2005 , to include ground-based interceptors , sea-based interceptors , additional Patriot ( PAC-3 ) units , and sensors based on land , at sea , and in space . The United States concurrent withdrawal from the ABM Treaty cleared the way for a strategic sea-based BMD capability . <p> It is a credit to the design of the weapon system , and particularly the AN/SPY-1 radar , that Aegis remained relevant to this new imperative in the national military strategy . Although the system provided the basic building blocks , it was the experience and depth of the engineering workforce that allowed us to harness the inherent capability of AN/SPY-1 far beyond the original design intent , to adapt the basic weapon-system design to this new mission , and to flex yet again to accommodate the national tasking to neutralize USA 193 . This infrastructure that was developed as a necessary and integral part of the Aegis program , enabled the transformation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operation Burnt Frost . To date , Aegis BMD has accrued an enviable record of 28 intercepts in 34 at-sea attempts , not including the success of Operation Burnt Frost . <h> We Ai n't  Done Yet <p> The Aegis weapon system has continued to reinvent itself as the nations priorities and military strategy have evolved . It was an integral part of how the United States achieved initial defensive operations in 2004 by fielding a strategic long-range surveillance and track capability centered on AN/SPY-1 in support of ground-based missile defense , and achieving limited defensive operations with the fielding of a tactical regional-engagement capability in 2005 . The capability has grown from being able to counter simple , liquid-fueled , short- and medium-range unitary threats , to complex , solid-fueled , short- , medium- , and intermediate-range separating threatsas well as ballistic missiles in their terminal phase . Cooperative development with the government of Japan of a 21-inch variant of the SM-3 , as well as corresponding advancements in the Aegis weapon system , is well under way . <p> Aegis BMD capability is part of an integrated air- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aegis modernization , and will be carried forward to the new construction program beginning with the USS John Finn ( DDG-113 ) . And now , Aegis BMD is the centerpiece of the Obama administrations " European Phased Adaptive Approach " and will field Baseline 9 capability ashore with Romania as the first host nation in 2015 . <p> As the awareness of Aegis BMD has grown , so has the demand from the combatant commanders for Aegis BMD forces . The Aegis BMD forces that can be fielded have two dimensionscapacity and capability . While modifications to the in-service fleet remain the fastest way to create capacity , the number of ships that can be modified depends on the capability desired . In general , capability against simpler threats requires fewer ship modifications and increases the number of ships that can modified in a year . The equation is simple : As the complexity of the threat increases , the complexity of the necessary ship modifications increases , limiting the number of ships that can be modified in a year . The time to field Aegis BMD capability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide our forces the ability to perform the Aegis BMD mission , it will require continued development to provide capability to counter the anticipated threat , and a mix of capabilities added to the in-service fleet through CNO availabilities and robust modernization , in combination with new construction for the foreseeable future . <p> Rear Admiral Hicks retired from the U.S. Navy in November 2009 and at the time was the Program Director , Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense , U.S. Missile Defense Agency .

This conflict , however , would feature hardly any of the hallmarks of the earlier Pacific war - no ship-on-ship duels , no massive carrier battles , no large-scale submarine operations .

Truman directed the U.S. Seventh Fleet , based at Subic Bay in the Philippines , to head north into the troubled waters off the Asian continent . The Pacific Fleet commander , Admiral Arthur W. Radford , transferred operational control of the Seventh Fleet to Commander Naval Forces , Far East , Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy , headquartered in Tokyo . The fleet 's first mission was to prevent the conflict in Korea from spreading throughout the Far East by discouraging Mao Tse-tung 's Chinese communists from invading the island of Taiwan , occupied by Chiang Kai-shek 's Chinese Nationalist government . <p> As the aircraft carrier Valley Forge ( CV-45 ) , heavy cruiser Rochester ( CA-124 ) , and eight destroyers steamed close to Taiwan , carrier aircraft made a show of force by flying between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Korean War , Seventh Fleet surface warships , patrol planes , submarines , and carrier task forces kept watch off China to discourage the People 's Republic from invading Taiwan . Faced with this powerful deterrent , Mao ruled out an invasion of the island . Similar U.S. naval forces patrolled the sea and sky between the Soviet Union 's Far East military bases and the Korean combat theater . The visible display of U.S. naval might then and later in the war also caused Soviet leader Joseph Stalin , who had endorsed the North Korean aggression , to think twice about militarily supporting the invasion . He limited the extent of his country 's air support and warned his forces not to attack U.S. and United Nations warships off Korea . <p> The U.S. Navy and allied naval forces took full advantage of their power to seize and maintain control of the seas around Korea . At the outset of the war , the North Koreans had sent a merchant ship loaded with 600 combat troops on a nighttime mission to capture the critical South Korean port of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Korea ( ROK ) Navy spotted the ship and sent her to the bottom . Shortly afterward , on 2 July , the U.S. cruiser Juneau ( CL-119 ) , British cruiser Jamaica , and British frigate Black Swan intercepted North Korean torpedo boats and motor gunboats off the east coast of South Korea and destroyed five of the communist combatants . <p> On 3 July , aircraft from the Valley Forge and the British carrier Triumph attacked the capital and war-making heart of North Korea - Pyongyang . The attack-plane squadrons bombed hangars , fuel-storage tanks , runways , nearby bridges , and rail yards . The Navy 's new jet fighter , the F9F Panther , registered the service 's first aerial victories of the war when Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Leonard H. Plog and Ensign Eldon W. Brown Jr . shot down two North Korean Yak-9s . <p> An even more vital task , however , was to help stop the North Korean Army from destroying desperately fighting U.S. and U.N . ground forces and conquering the entire peninsula . American and allied cruisers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marine carrier-based air units struck communist troops and supply convoys heading south farther inland . At the same time , the ships of the Navy 's Military Sea Transportation Service ( MSTS ) rushed reinforcements and supplies from the United States and Japan to U.N . troops holding a small corner of the peninsula around Pusan . <p> The onrushing communist divisions would have pushed U.N . forces into the sea or forced a bloody withdrawal like the World War II evacuation of Dunkirk had it not been for the fleet 's support . A sad fact was that U.S. forces in the Far East were woefully unprepared to fight a war in the summer of 1950 . Initially , the only available American troops were in Japan - four understrength , undertrained , and unready Army infantry divisions and a sprinkling of naval and air units .

With the agreement of the South Korean government , Admiral Joy tasked U.S. Navy Commander Michael J. Luosey with exercising temporary operational control of South Korea 's navy . Luosey quickly organized inshore patrol sectors on the southern and western coasts , moved South Korean Marine forces to critical areas , and helped stiffen allied maritime defenses . Only recently established , the ROK Navy compensated for its small size by fighting with determination throughout July and August .

Following a week of bloody , street-to-street fighting , the 1st Marine Division liberated Seoul , the South Korean capital . <p> The amphibious units at Inchon suffered 3,500 killed , wounded , and missing , but they inflicted 20,000 casualties on the enemy . Of greater strategic significance , the successful Inchon landing compelled the badly battered North Korean People 's Army to flee north across the 38th parallel and brought about the liberation of South Korea . <h> Advance and Retreat <p> General MacArthur hoped to complete the destruction of the enemy army with another amphibious assault , this time at the North Korean port of Wonsan on the Sea of Japan . Once the Navy had landed the X Corps there , the troops were to advance to the Yalu River and North Korea 's borders with the People 's Republic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the communists had filled Wonsan Harbor with between 2,000 and 4,000 Soviet-made magnetic and contact mines . Several U.S. and South Korean mine-clearing vessels were sunk before the task force opened a safe passage into the port . Meanwhile , hard-charging South Korean troops reached Wonsan . Finally , on 25 October 1950 , the 1st Marine Division under Major General O. P. Smith landed and pushed into the looming and foreboding mountains of North Korea . <p> The Navy 's inherent mobility and dominance at sea proved a boon to the allied cause not only in battlefield success but also in failure . The latter occurred when " volunteers " of the communist Chinese People 's Liberation Army , which had crossed into Korea in October , emerged from the snow-covered mountains of North Korea in November 1950 and surprised Army , Marine , and South Korean units . The X Corps , comprising the 1st Marine Division , the U.S. Army 's 3rd and 7th divisions , and three South Korean divisions , had to fight their way back to the coast in below-freezing temperatures and fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea ( CV-47 ) , Valley Forge ( CV-45 ) , Princeton ( CV-37 ) , and Leyte ( CV-32 ) and from several escort carriers heavily bombed and strafed Chinese troops attacking the withdrawing U.N . troops . <p> During these air operations to support their beleaguered comrades on the ground , Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Thomas Hudner , Ensign Jesse Brown , and two other F4U Corsair pilots from the Leyte flew around the Chosin Reservoir in search of enemy troops . Brown soon reported that his plane was losing oil pressure , and he had to crash-land in the trackless , ice- and snow-covered mountains . The force of the impact separated his aircraft 's engine from its fuselage and badly crumpled the plane . While he survived the crash , Brown was seriously injured and trapped in the cockpit . Hudner called for a rescue helicopter , but he knew it would take 30 minutes for the aircraft to get to the scene , so he decided to go to the assistance of his friend and squadron mate . <p> Hudner crash-landed his own Corsair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his aid . The lieutenant covered the ensign 's head with a spare wool cap and wrapped his hands in a scarf . Using an axe , Hudner tried to free the pilot from the cockpit but every attempt failed . When the rescue helicopter arrived , the pilot told Hudner they had to leave the mountains before dark or they were in danger of crashing . With Brown unconscious and most likely already dead from his injuries and the cold , Hudner realized he had to leave his friend behind . They had done all they could for Jesse Brown , the first African-American naval aviator to die in combat . President Truman awarded Hudner the Medal of Honor for his brave attempt to save his comrade 's life . <p> As this drama unfolded in the mountains , most of the X Corps ' Marines and Soldiers had fought their way to the coast . As the retreating troops came within range , the battleship Missouri ( BB-63 ) , cruisers Rochester ( CA-124 ) and St. Paul ( CA-73 ) , and numerous destroyers and rocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground forces . U.S. and allied surface ships fired more than 23,000 rockets and 16- , 8- , 5- , and 3-inch rounds at communist units bold enough to approach the evacuation port of Hungnam . <p> On 24 December 1950 , Rear Admiral James Doyle 's Combined Task Force 90 completed the withdrawal by sea of 105,000 troops , 91,000 civilian refugees , 350,000 tons of cargo , and 17,500 military vehicles . Later that day , Navy demolition teams leveled the port facilities at Hungnam to deny them to the enemy , and the fleet steamed south . The units withdrawn from North Korea with most of their equipment were soon preparing to re-enter the fight for the preservation of the Republic of Korea . <h> Naval Power from the Air and Sea <p> By the spring of 1951 it was clear to both sides that neither would be able to achieve a decisive military victory on the Korean Peninsula without risking World War III . As a result , the communist and U.N . belligerents dispatched military representatives to Kaesong and later Panmunjom near the 38th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . delegation that also included Rear Admiral Arleigh Burke , a future Chief of Naval Operations . The military-to-military talks , however , were stymied over the release of prisoners of war and other contentious issues and dragged on for another two years . In the meantime , communist and U.N . forces fought bloody battles back and forth across the 38th parallel , seizing and then giving up territory ; Seoul changed hands four times during the war . In contrast to the rapid advances and retreats of 1950 , World War I - like trench warfare characterized the fighting in 1951 , 1952 , and 1953 . The contending ground forces slugged it out on the barren , wind- and snow-swept mountains of central Korea . <p> A vital mission of naval air power during this so-called " static war " phase was to bring the conflict to the North Korean rear areas and prevent heavy weapons , ammunition , supplies , and construction materials from reaching enemy troops along the front line . The Seventh Fleet 's Task Force 77 and Task Force 95 did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 of which would serve in the Korean War , while the latter included one light and four escort carriers . Navy combat squadrons operated from the carriers , and Marine aviation units flew from both the escort carriers and shore bases . The naval aviators piloted F9F Panther and F2H Banshee jets and the workhorses - propeller-driven F4U Corsairs and AD Skyraiders . <p> The fleet 's fighter squadrons battled for control of the air with hundreds of communist MiG-15 jets and other combat aircraft flown by North Korean , Chinese , and Soviet air crews , and shot down 13 of them . Lieutenant Guy P. Bordelon became the Navy 's lone Korean War ace when he downed five enemy " Bedcheck Charlies , " aircraft that flew over U.N . lines at night and dropped bombs to disturb the sleep of the troops . <p> The attack squadrons focused their attention on enemy locomotives and rolling stock , bridges , tunnels , supply depots , power-generating dams on the Yalu River , and other vital targets . In one of the war 's most dramatic and unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carlson 's Navy Attack Squadron 195 , flying from the Princeton , breached the Hwachon Reservoir dam with air-dropped torpedoes . The squadron was thereafter nicknamed the " Dambusters . " <p> Providing on-call , close-air support to troops on the front line was another critical responsibility of the carrier- and shore-based units . By the end of the war , naval air crews had flown 275,000 sorties over Korea , which represented 53 percent of the close-air support strikes and 40 percent of the interdiction missions flown by U.S. Air Force , Navy , and Marine Corps planes . Naval aircraft dropped more than 178,000 tons of bombs , triggered over 274,000 air-to-ground rockets , and fired more than 71 million cannon rounds . <p> Combat power projected from the sea came from another source - the battleships , cruisers , destroyers , and rocket vessels of the Seventh Fleet . Marines and Soldiers facing Chinese " human wave " assaults eagerly sought fire from the 16-inch guns of the World War II - built battleships Iowa ( BB-61 ) , Missouri ( BB-63 ) , Wisconsin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fleet 's surface warships also ranged along the Korean coast shelling communist railways , roads , supply caches , and troop concentrations . Allied estimates credited U.S. and U.N . surface ships , which fired 4 million rounds of naval gun ammunition , with killing 28,000 enemy troops and destroying thousands of buildings , trucks , bridges , and supply dumps . Enemy counterbattery fire failed to sink even one U.N . warship . <p> The prodigious air effort and its complementary surface-force bombardment operations undoubtedly denied the enemy vital munitions and saved the lives of thousands of American and allied soldiers fighting to take or hold ground at the 38th parallel ; however , it did not completely cut the enemy 's supply lines or prevent him from launching devastating offensives . Tens of thousands of North Korean civilians and military engineers repeatedly put bombed rail lines , bridges , and supply depots back in operation . Nighttime often cloaked communist supply movements . Moreover , enemy antiaircraft fire brought down 559 Navy and Marine aircraft , and MiGs claimed another five . The Korean War experience demonstrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power would not be a war-winning instrument . That lesson would have to be relearned 15 years later in the skies over Southeast Asia . <h> Off North Korea 's Coasts <p> Throughout the Korean War , U.S. and allied naval forces denied the enemy use of the sea to transport troops and supplies . Control of the sea also allowed the U.N . command to threaten amphibious landings in the rear of the communist armies fighting along the 38th parallel . Burned once at Inchon , the enemy took the threat seriously and deployed large units along both coasts , where obviously they posed no danger to U.N . troops farther south on the front line . To keep the enemy guessing , the Navy conducted several naval feints and demonstrations . In Operation Decoy during October 1952 , for instance , Seventh Fleet carriers , battleships , cruisers , and destroyers attacked communist defenses around Kojo , and the amphibious force operated as if to land the Army 's 1st Cavalry Division near Wonsan . The Chinese and North Koreans rushed forces to the coast to defeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special operations forces ashore on both coasts of North Korea and on many of the islands in nearby waters . The so-called " Siege of Wonsan " from 16 February 1951 to the end of the war prevented the communists from using North Korea 's most important port on the Sea of Japan . U.S. Navy underwater demolition teams , or frogmen ; U.S. Marines ; and British and South Korean naval commandos frequently blew up highway bridges , supply dumps , railroad tracks , and railroad tunnels behind enemy lines . <p> A number of U.S. naval leaders took the initiative to take the fight to the enemy in the waters off northeastern Korea . Commander James A. Dare , commanding officer of the destroyer Douglas H. Fox ( DD-779 ) , used his ship 's whaleboats offensively , as other resourceful officers had done throughout the Navy 's history . He armed his best officers and Bluejackets with 75-millimeter recoilless rifles , small arms , demolition charges , grenades , radios , and tools for destroying fishing nets . At night they sortied in their boats five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas H. Fox ' s radios and surface-search radar ) to capture North Korean fishing boats and their crews . Operation Fishnet disrupted local fishing activity and denied the enemy sustenance as well as providing the fleet with vital intelligence on enemy gun positions and troop deployments . The American Sailors also put some psychological pressure on the enemy . The night before May Day 1952 - 1 May is an especially important date in the communist world - the Douglas H. Fox 's whaleboat Sailors planted an American flag on a muddy island at the mouth of Hungnam Harbor . When the sun rose on the big day , the enemy soldiers ' first sight as they looked eastward was Old Glory snapping in the breeze . <p> For U.S. and allied military forces to fight successfully on a peninsula almost 5,000 nautical miles from the West Coast of the United States and contiguous to the enemy nations of China and the Soviet Union required a massive U.S. Navy resupply effort . Hundreds of Military Sea Transportation Service troopships , freighters , and tankers were necessary to deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trucks , ammunition , and fuel necessary to continue the war . During the three-year conflict , MSTS transported 5 million passengers , more than 52 million tons of cargo , and 22 million long tons of fuel . <p> Another herculean task for the Navy was keeping its aircraft carriers and surface ships on station and in the fight off the Korean Peninsula . To do this , fleet oilers , ammunition ships , and stores ships delivered their precious cargoes directly to the combatants through underway replenishment . <p> The Korean War was no exception to the rule that Marines and Sailors fight and sometimes die as members of a team . Navy Seabees helped build airfields ashore for Marine aviation squadrons , and Navy doctors and hospital corpsmen served in combat with Marine riflemen . Typical of these corpsmen was Hospitalman Richard Dewert , who was shot rushing to the aid of a wounded Marine . Despite his wounds , Dewert returned to the field of battle three times to help other downed men but was finally killed by enemy fire . Hospitalman Dewert was awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Responsible for the care of wounded and injured Sailors and Marines , ashore and afloat , the Navy deployed the hospital ships Consolation ( AH-15 ) , Haven ( AH-12 ) , and Repose ( AH-16 ) to the combat theater . The vessels were staffed by hard-working and skilled medical professionals , including members of the Nurse Corps . The advent during the Korean War of helicopters enabled the speedy transportation of patients between ship and shore . <p> Helicopters also proved especially well suited to retrieving air crews from the sea . Aviation Machinist 's Mate Second Class Ernie L. Crawford , crewman of a helicopter operating from the heavy cruiser Rochester ( CA-124 ) , was awarded the Navy Cross for heroism in saving a downed , unconscious pilot . Crawford got the naval aviator safely into the rescue " bird " and then floated alone for 20 minutes in the freezing ocean while he awaited the helicopter 's return . <p> In short , the Navy was essential to the U.S. and U.N . effort in the first major conflict of the Cold War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 1950 to 27 July 1953 , when the belligerents finally signed an armistice at Panmunjom . Combat took the lives of 458 Sailors and wounded another 1,576 ; 4,043 officers and enlisted personnel succumbed to injury or disease . Without the selfless dedication to duty of Navy men and women ashore and afloat , United Nations forces would not have been able to achieve the war 's primary goal - to preserve the independence of the Republic of Korea and the freedom of its citizens . <p> Edward J.

Assigning Commander Jack Towers , a superb navigator , as plane commander of the NC-3 proved to be a master stroke when his record-breaking flight became a voyage , some 200 miles shy of its destination . <p> Early U. S. naval aviators had to struggle to gain acceptance within the surface line , proving their worth first as naval officers , and second as fliers . Since the handful of these pioneers had little opportunity to navigate or conn ships after earning their wings before or during World War I , the non-flying Navy had no reason to alter its skepticism over the airmen 's seagoing skills when the war ended . No reason , that is , until the spectacular voyage of the NC-3 . <p> The NC ( Navy-Curtiss ) flying boats were designed and constructed during 1917-19 to bridge the Atlantic , origi nally to conduct antisubmarine operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aviation . Although the idea was to fly nonstop between anchorages , their 44-foot , 9-inch-long compartmentalized hulls were designed by Commander Holden C. " Dick " Richardson of the Construction Corps to withstand landings in the swells of the open oceanand to take off again . If they could not take off , the boats could at least make headway afloat with their engines . <p> The Navy treated the May 1919 expedition of the NCs as a naval rather than a purely aeronautical enterprise . Seaplane Division One was formally commissioned on 3 May at Naval Air Station ( NAS ) Rockaway on New York 's Long Island-the first time that airplanes had ever been so " commissioned " as ship-like entities . Commander John H. " Jack " Towers , Naval Aviator Number Three , commanded the three-boat division and also doubled as plane commander and navigator of the flagship , the NC-3 . Jack Towers , 34 , had been a superb navigator in the Naval Academy ( Class of 1906 ) and later on board two battleships . The skipper-navigators of the NC-1 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pat " Bellinger and A. C. " Putty " Read . <p> The immense flying boats , each powered by one pusher and three tractor 400-horsepower high-compression Liberty engines , took off from Rockaway on 8 May . By steady flying , and after a couple of touchdowns at sea for repairs and refueling layovers at Halifax , Nova Scotia , all three reached Trepassey Harbor , Newfoundland , by sundown of 15 May . From there , the boats prepared to take off for the Azores , some 1,320 miles to the southeast . This leg , the longest of the journey , would be followed by shorter legs to Lisbon , Portugal , and Plymouth , England . <p> In addition to navigator-plane commander Towers , the flagship NC-3 carried five stalwarts of the naval aviation community . Commander Towers selected Commander Richardson , Naval Aviator Number 13 , as senior pilot because of his intimate knowledge of the hull . Richardson , who at 41 was the eldest crew member , had been taught to fly by Towers . His co-pilot , Lieutenant David H. McCulloch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had joined the wartime Naval Reserve Flying Corps . Both men had worked with the NCs since the inception of the prototype . <p> The other three crewmen were each specialists . The officer responsible for the expedition 's radio gear , including the flagship 's wireless , was the erudite , stocky Lieutenant Commander Robert A . Lavender , 29 . The engineer , 26-year-old Chief Boatswain Lloyd Ray " Dinty " Moore , was a qualified naval aviator and had joined the crew highly recommended as the best aviation mechanic available . Towers had chosen Lieutenant Junior grade ) Braxton L. Rhodes , 26 , to be reserve engineer because of his knowledge of the Liberty engines . The crews of the NC-1 and NC-4 were equally competent . <p> Weather conditions over the North Atlantic had been Commander Towers ' greatest concern , so he was gladdened when his weather experts advised immediate departure for the Azores on the afternoon of 16 May . Destroyers were stationed every 50 miles along the course to aid in navigation and to render assistance should any of the planes need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meteorologists ' forecast called for partial low clouds and possible occasional showers to begin at the position of the eighth destroyer , the Walker ( DD-163 ) , and for light winds after station number 12 , the Meredith ( DD- 165 ) . Towers was advised to fly above the clouds . The first transatlantic flight promised to be relatively easy . <p> The three flying boats taxied out into Trepassey Harbor , but Richardson could not lift the NC-3 off the water . The 28,300-pound load was just too heavy , meaning that something would have to go . Towers ordered Richardson to taxi back to the tender Aroostook ( CM-3 ) and informed reserve engineer Rhodesall 185 poundsthat he would have to leave , much to Rhodes ' disappointment . This also meant that the entire engineering load shifted to the shoulders of Chief Moore . Floorboards , a mail bag , extra tools , and extra drinking water also wentand , over the fervent protests of radio officer Lavender , so did a 26-pound emergency radio transmitter . <p> These tradeoffs that Towers believed essential worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwich mean time , followed immediately by the NC-4 and the NC-1 . Next stopthe harbor of Ponta Oelgada , San Miguel Island , in the Azores . Their expected flying time , " with present wind conditions during night , " according to Navy weather forecasts , was 19 hours . <p> Flying into the night , Seaplane Division One climbed to 1,000 feet and followed the line of destroyers and their bright , skyrocketing star shells without difficulty . The appearance of thin clouds at destroyer station number three , the Buchanan ( DD-131 ) , surprised Towers , but he took the flagship above them to 4,000 feet , where he profited by the bright three-quarter moon and the stars , which assisted his navigation . <p> As the flying boats approached the Meredith , however , the clouds began to thicken . It was 0545 on 17 May and the three planes were eight hours from Trepassey . Towers could still see the NC-1 , while Lavender intercepted messages from the NC-4 indicating she was " on course and well ahead . " But the NC-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> At 0623 , soon after Towers sighted destroyer number 13 , the Bush ( DD-166 ) , day began to break , revealing a thick cloud mass below . Towers had Lavender signal the Bush and called ahead for a weather report from number 16 , the USS Hopewell ( DD-181 ) , one of five destroyers with a weather officer on board . He requested that star shells continue to be fired and radio compass bearing signals be transmitted to assist his navigation . Towers did not see any further star shells , however , and the heavy cloud cover soon obscured destroyer number 14 , the Cowell ( 00-167 ) . The NC-3 began making slight course changes , while the NC-4 and the NC-1 maneuvered independently . <p> Towers decided to descend to try and spot destroyer number 15 , the Maddox ( DD-168 ) . At 0707 , he called his pilots on the intercom and had them plunge 2,000 feet through a small hole in the clouds . Towers recounted later : <p> " We found the weather slightly hazy and threatening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to atmospheric laws , the winds up high were more from the north , and had been making allowance for this , but of course there was no way of telling how much allowance to make . " <p> With the NC-3 at 1,500 feet and Towers looking to the north for the Maddox , his pilots checked in with him . One had spotted the shape of a vessel to the southwest . Towers later said , " I could not believe we had been set to the northward , but a look through the glasses showed that the ship was war-colored , and I decided it was No. 15 . " The rain had prevented him a clear view . Assuming the Maddox was in proper position , he said , " I changed course 20 to Southerly to pass within sight of No. 16 and pass over No. 17 , " the Hopewell and Stockton ( 00-73 ) , respectively . Towers and the latter 's captain later decided that the vessel sighted had been the gunboat Marietta ( PG-15 ) , heading home from European duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the NC-3 was actually heading off to the southeast , well away from the destroyer station line . <p> Towers had Lavender transmit position reports every half-hour , but unknown to the crew , the radio 's ground wire broke just after the plane passed beyond the Stockton . Though they could receive , their own transmissions were no longer being heard . <p> The weather thickened with fog , occasional high winds , and steady rain squalls , at times " so bad that we had to turn and run before them , " Towers said . " We made frequent attempts to get above them , but they seemed to extend all the way up to the heavens . " Visibility occasionally dropped to less than 100 yards , until even the wing tips were hardly visible , making navigation and flying extremely difficult . Towers did not know whether the NC-3 " was north or south of No . 17 , so we changed course 10 to northward to run parallel to the proper course , hoping that the weather would clear and No. 18 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plane " side-slipped " once , but stability was easily restored . It also had to detour around impenetrable rain squalls , flying at about 1 , 000 feet . <p> After a night of steady flying , the three flying boats were faced with more horrendous weather . From the radio traffic Lavender reported that Read and Bellinger were having equal difficulties . Towers had his pilots try different altitudes , but as soon as they escaped the fog , they struck clouds and then bursts of rain . The NC-3 's pilots , Richardson and McCulloch , already tired , now worked together . Richardson kept an eye on the wing tips while working the ailerons to keep the plane in trim , and McCulloch stayed on course by manipulating the rudder and elevator . McCulloch later reported : <p> " At times I sat close to the windshield and did not mind the rain so much , but the Commanding Officer and other pilot suffered from rain striking them in the face . We all expected the heavy raindrops to break our propellers , but fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constant pelting of rain on the pilots ' faces made them drowsy . " The medical officer at Rockaway had both forewarned and forearmed me for such an emergency , " Towers said , and he administered two small doses of strychnine every hour to Richardson , who was in poorer shape than McCulloch . Richardson was finally compelled to take a rest , though he later recovered and returned to the controls . By this time , the forward visibility had deteriorated to less than 100 yards . <p> Throughout the morning , Towers strained his eyes looking for the three highest mountain peaks of the AzoresCorvo , Flores , and Pico . The furthest island beyond them in the 2S0-mile chain of islands was San Miguel and its port of Ponta Delgadathe NCs ' destinationwhere the tender Melville ( AO-2 ) waited . <p> At 1305 , or an hour before noon local time , a sudden lull in the storm enabled Towers to catch sight of the sun through the haze . He took a quick sighting on it with his sextant , although the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon rocked with the plane . When he worked out the sighting , however , he got a line of position passing through Pico , near the small island of Fayal , which offered the harbor of Horta as an emergency landing place . There also lay the old cruiser Columbia ( CA-16 ) , moored as an emergency tender . <p> Discounting his hasty sighting of the sun , Towers figured the NC-3 was 50 miles southwest of Pico . " I decided to head up this line , 60 to the northward , for a while and hope for a break in the weather , " he said . <p> All hands kept a sharp lookout as the haze closed in again , the noonday sun only barely visible . Dinty Moore came forward from his station aft to say that they had only two hours of fuel remaining . Towers pondered his options , among them the advisability of landing , stopping their engines , getting a radio bearing , and proceeding again . The more he thought about it , the more this seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his perch in the bow and crawled back to the cockpit , where he wrote his idea on a pad , holding it up for McCulloch to read . Detailed discussion was impossible over the roar of the engines . Both pilots decided it was a wise plan , according to McCulloch , with Richardson assuring Towers that the two men had easily landed the plane in the waters off Delaware . Looking down from 500 feet , they believed that the surface of the sea , though only faintly visible , appeared sufficiently solid for a landing and takeoff . <p> Towers decided to land . After more than five hours battling the storms , the crew would welcome any respite . Having consumed most of the fuel , the plane would be light enough to take off again . Lavender began transmitting SOS signals and their position , but with the radio ground disconnected , none of his appeals were heard . <p> Richardson recalled : " Weswung round in a spiral to a landing and approached the surface cautiously , then picking a suitable opportunity , throttled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center engines . " But then , in Towers words , <p> " We realized just as we were about to touch that there was a big sea running . It was too late to pull up . We touched the top of a big roller and jumped from that wave to another , then slid down the face of the second one with high velocity , and took the approaching wave with a very heavy blow . " <p> The crunch they felt on impact left no doubt as to the seriousness of the damage . Towers even " expected the hull to collapse , " but Richardsons design was up to the test of its sturdiness . <p> Coming to a stop at 1330 , the NC-3 had logged 15 hours 24 minutes in the air from Trepassey . The five men scrambled over their flying boat to discover the forward center tractor engine support struts badly bent " like a bull-dogs legs , " Richardson saidsome main struts broken , and the hull seriously damaged above the water line , with a slight leak under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crew took a few minutes to rest . <p> Towers shot the sun again , and Lavender got a radio bearing on the Columbia , fixing their position 34.5 miles southwest of Horta . Lavender also now discovered and reconnected the parted radio ground wire . The crew moved their wind-driven wireless generator to a position behind the port engine , which gave it wind power to continue sending SOS signals and their position 100 miles out , but no transmissions were acknowledged . <p> Lavender learned from the busy air waves that the NC-4 had landed safely in the Azores , but that the NC-1 was also down north of the course and that a search for her was under way . The crew also heard inquiries about their own whereabouts . But to their chagrin , the destroyer searches were being undertaken between station numbers 16 and 18400 miles too far to the west . Towers reckoned instead that the NC-3 was opposite destroyer station number 23 . But no one seemed to be listening on the NC-3s frequency . <p> All hands on board assumed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running the port engine in the 10- to 12-foot wind-whipped waves caused the plane to plunge forward heavily into the approaching seas until Towers finally had to shut it down . Without the engine , no radio signals could be sent out , only received . Suddenly , unloading the small emergency radio to lighten the ship before takeoff from Trepassey took a heavy toll . <p> The crew realized that if they were to be saved , they would have to do it . First , they took stock of their supplies : a few water-soaked sandwiches that had fallen into the bilge upon landing , five cakes of chocolate , and six small tins of emergency rationsall nourishing but not palatable . Even less tasty was the fresh water , available only from the four 11-gallon radiators , thick with iron rust and engine oil . Another weight-saving measure , the discarding of extra water , again had come to grief . <p> Next , they set their course and headed toward the shipping lane between Fayal and San Miguel to the northward in hopes they might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastward-blowing winds might push them toward San Migueland Ponta Delgada , more than 200 miles away . <p> At 2000 , Towers established two-hour watches for himself and his four crewmen , assigned them duties , and secured the ship , putting the precious Very pistol and flares into his pockets lest they be lost should the plane suddenly sink . The crew tightened wires loosened during the landing and rigged the U.S. flag upside down as a distress signal . Although no one had slept during the previous nights long flight , all hands turned out in this struggle for survival , snatching only a few minutes of shuteye between watches and emergencies . The wind was then running between 65 and 70 miles per hour , varying from the southwest to northwest . Towers decided to sail the boat stern first , with the hull acting as centerboard . <p> To keep the NC-3 headed into the approaching seas , Towers played out two canvas buckets from a wire cable . He did not use the planes regular heavy sea anchor for fear it would cause too great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The drift did not exceed 15 miles per hour , enabling Richardson and McCullochtrained navigators and seamento use the controls to head off the wind as much as four points . Despite the high winds and seas and " the general wrecked condition of the wings , " the crew avoided getting too far off wind , steered the NC-3 into the big rollers , and kept her from being swamped . <p> Through the night , waves and rain pounded the NC-3 . But in spite of the gale force winds , Towers made sightings of the moon and the star Arcturus through holes in the clouds at 0530 on 18 May . These gave him a good fix ; from which he could see that the boat was making progress , but toward the east rather than the north . <p> Dawn brought a heavy storm out of the north-northwest , with 45- to 50-mile-per-hour winds , a driving rain , and steep swells up to 30 feet . The flying boat began to yield to this pounding as first the wooden ribs of the lower left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally the lower elevator snapped . Water began collecting in the wings fabric cavities and dragging them under , so Richardson and Moore crawled out to punch holes in them through which the water could pass . Later the two men inched themselves out again to cut away the broken lower wing and control column , which banged against the hull , threatening to cause a puncture . <p> Towers and Moore used the planes hand pump to clear the water from the leaking hull . At one point , they attached the hose from the pump to the center oil tank and poured oil over the side " to smooth out the seas . " This worked , except that the oil drifted away too fast , so they stopped . Also , Towers wanted to conserve his oil for possible use in the engines to power the radio and perhaps to assist in guiding the plane . <p> The real calamity occurred at 0900 when a heavy cross sea carried away the NC-3s port wing pontoon , jeopardizing the planes stability should it roll to port . Moores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken out , and each man took turns wearing it , strapped on to the outer starboard wing to keep that down , and the port wing top clear of the water . Between doing this , standing watch , and continuously pumping out the hull , there was time for little rest . At Towers command , each man rotated duties : two hours at the controls , one hour of " sleep , " one hour on the starboard wing , more sleep , and then back to the controls or to send distress signals over the wireless . <p> With the high seas further breaking the ribs of the lower wing , Towers thought of using such flotsam to determine the flying boats speed through the water . At 0930 , he began his calculations by dropping a piece of rib or other wreckage over the stern ( up front ) and marking the time it required for the hull to drift past . Knowing the length of the hull ( just shy of 45 feet ) , he then computed the speed in knots . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan ( BB-27 ) but it worked . <p> One half hour later , the violent waves broke off the canvas buckets serving as an anchor . In its place , the crew put out their big sea anchor , but it had been made by " someone who knew little about the force of the sea " and it was torn to pieces at once . Then they cast a piece of torn wing fabric as an anchor , but that too carried away . Next , they tried using a smaller piece and attached a doubled-up trailing antenna wire of the radio as the anchor cable . This held . <p> At midday , more havoc erupted when the lower elevator disintegrated from the force of a steep wave . Pieces from it threatened the guy wires and hull until it was swept away completely . <p> At 1330 , however , the air cleared sufficiently for Richardson to notice the dim outlines of Picos 7,600-foot peak through clouds off to the northwest . Towers got a bearing and sextant altitude of the peak plus a meridian altitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dead reckoning from his earlier sightings and estimated drift : the NC-3 was 35 miles southeast of Pico . Rigging Lavenders radio and starting the port engine to give it power , they transmitted their position , but without response . Meanwhile , the surging engine caused the boat to turn around and almost capsize from the cross seas . Some of the men wanted to use the engines to try to buck the sea and head north , but Towers overruled the notion , reasoning that the maneuver would have swamped them . <p> Then the 60-miles-per-hour wind shifted toward the northwest and began to blow the NC-3 away from land . The crew decided to work toward San Miguel by taking advantage of every lull in the waves to head off a little ( to leeward ) and make a course slightly across the wind . The more attempts Richardson and McCulloch made at this , the more successful they became . The thought of losing sight of land , Pico , and spending another night of uncertainty at sea was an unsettling prospect . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 45 knots continued to blow , and the sea swells remained enormous , at times reaching 30 feet . Some waves even curled , causing the flying boat to coast like a surfboard at a 20-knot clip . Towers said , " Although we had not discussed the subject , none of us expected to live through the night . " Towers , like his shipmates , kept himself awake most of the evening hours " by smoking and getting cold water dashed on me by the waves . " The rusty , oily radiator water and the chocolate cakes provided minimal nourishment , and McCulloch got seasick . <p> After moonrise near midnight , Towers used the sextant to get " a good cross between Arcturus and the moon , and checked it with sights of Vego , Denub , and Polaris , " the north star . Then he took his turn out on the starboard wing , where the wires and bolts had to be continually tightened against the seas heavy blows . <p> Towers admiration for his colleaguesnone of whom got more than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and McCulloch were both at the controls practically all night , " he said . " Moore was everywhere . " Towers remembered : <p> Well after midnight I called Lavender , who was getting a little sleep aft , and he took my place on the wing . I crawled down under the pilots seat to rest , but sleep was hopeless when you were one minute standing on your head , the next plunging feet down steep sloping waves and expecting to have the whole plane disintegrate . Eventually the water got so deep in the hull that I was flooded out , and Moore , Lavender , and I spent the next six hours pumping . The water was nearly two feet deep in the hull . One man had to lie in the water down under the gasoline tanks to keep debris from stopping up the suction while the others pumped , then we would change so the wet man could get warm . <p> Their hands all became badly swollen from this endless task . <p> Richardson soon learned to steer the plane with less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This held the port wing up , gave the craft better stability , and meant that a man did not always have to be kept out on the starboard wing . Richardson reported later : <p> " This was important , for all hands had had little sleep , and it was dangerous for the man on the wing tip . If he should fall asleephe could be washed overboard with almost no chance of recovery , as we were averaging 12 knots astern at the timeWe found that each wave crest had to be tackled individually and square to the crest . " <p> This task was difficult , since the wind changed continuously , and the waves could not be seen far ahead in the darkness , Even the phosphorescence of the white caps led the men 's tired eyes to imagine these as ship searchlights . <p> In the midst of these labors , the dawn of 19 May broke , a little clearer but with winds and seas only slightly more moderate . Towers realized that the NC-3 was almost in striking distance of San Miguel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course for the island , although a two-hour squall detoured them southward . San Miguel was considerably off the wind , but by careful operation of the controls , the pilots found they could gradually work to northward . At 0930 , Towers knew he was on course after obtaining a good longitude line from shooting the sun . He computed their speed at six knots by again throwing wreckage over the stern and marking the time . <p> About 45 minutes later , Moore sighted land astern that is , ahead , with the NC-3 heading stern first-which Towers calculated was 44 miles away . It had to be San Miguel . Towers recalled : <p> " The effect on all hands was astonishing . After two days without seeing any sight of a vessel and expecting to go down at any moment , to have land in sight ! I saw that if the wind held in direction , and we could continue to head three points off , slightly more to the north , we could make it . It was still rough , and we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to make shore . But there was hope , spelled with a great big H. <p> " The first thing I did was to go down in the hull and rescue my uniform hat from the bilge where it had fallen two days before . I had seen no further use for it , so I had just let it stay there and float about . The next was to unload from my pocket the waterproof package of Very 's signal cartridges , and the Very 's pistol . We continued to pump , but with a different spirit . All hands suddenly realized hunger and thirst . Realization of fatigue was to come later . Unanimous vote decided on bacon and eggs as the best food in the world of which they had none . I took some photographs of the personnel and of the NC-3 . The idea of refusing assistance if offered then came , and we promptly hoisted our flag right side upand hoisted our pennant . " <p> In spite of heavy rain squalls which suddenly returned , the crew worked slowly to within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Towers laid course down to Ponta Delgada . This took most of the day . Finally , at 1612 , some seven miles from port , Lavender stuck his head out from the hull and announced , " They have seen us ! " His radio receiver had erupted with messages " flying about like mad . " No one on shore or at the anchorage had imagined the NC-3 to have been so far to the east . Her appearance off the harbor entrance was a dramatic climax to her ordeal . <p> Moments later , at 1625 , the fliers saw " a big smudge of smoke and spray , " as the USS Harding ( DD-91 ) came dashing out . Towers grabbed the plane 's Aldis lamp and blinked out a signal for her to stay clear , but to be ready to render assistance if called upon . The destroyer answered , " It 's a miracle ! It 's a miracle ! " But the ship passed so close to the NC-3 that its wash created waves , forcing McCulloch and Moore to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then a big wave carried away the starboard pontoon , being dragged along by one wire , and the boat nearly went under . The crew finally cut the pontoon free , and Richardson started the center pusher engine . The NC-3 crabbed in under the eastern end of the breakwater and into the harbor . <p> " That place was perfect bedlam , " Towers said . " Whistles were blowing , flags flying everywhere , and boats chasing about like mad . It looked like a comic moving picture , but it certainly looked good to us . " Under a 21-gun salute from the Portuguese citadel and rocket and bomb bursts , the NC-3 twice barely escaped capsizing in the harbor . Then Towers accepted help from two clumsy whaleboats from the tender Melville ; these helpers , however , became fouled in the surviving jury-rigged sea anchor . The NC-3 reached her moorings at 1830 . An admiral 's barge whisked the men ashore . <p> The crew had already learned by radio that the NC-4 had succeeded in reaching the Azores by air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Horta , 153 nautical miles shy of Ponta Delgada , and 1,206 miles out of Trepassey . But Towers and the NC-3 had achieved 1,240 miles before landing at sea . Read had even landed seven minutes before Towers , and Bellinger and the NC-1 in waters off to the northwest just before that . So the NC-3 had set the record for nonstop distance and endurance15 hours , 24 minutes in a 1,240-mile flight , plus more than 53 hours afloat over a course of another 205 miles . <p> Towers and hi s crew had performed magnificently both as seamen and as aviators-still managing to reach Ponta Delgada first ; the NC-4 remained fogbound at Horta . Still , the NC-3 had failed to arrive at the Azores by air and was too wrecked to go on-the same fate suffered by the NC-1 , whose crew had been rescued by a passing Greek merchantman . The main reason for the NC-3 's defeat had been the inaccurate weather forecast . The initial storm on the morning of 17 May had confused Towers into thinking he was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . Then , the decision to alight had proved unfortunate , as it had for the NC-1 's Commander Bellinger , though no one on the NC-3 or the NC-1 had been able to see how high the sea had been running . Even if the NC-3 had managed to stay airborne and on course in the murk , it was likely that it would have plunged into one of the Azores ' beclouded mountainsides ; Commander Read had nearly done just that in the NC-4 before sighting land . <p> The epic voyage of the NC-3 was over , though the transatlantic fli ght of Seaplane Division One was not . The NC-1 sank while under tow , but Commander Read and the NC-4 completed the crossing to Europe , the first aircraft ever to accomplish the feat . As glorious as this achievement was , senior flag officers were equally impressed by the performance of Towers and his NC-3 crew , referred to by Rear Admiral Richard H. Jackson , the U. S. naval commander in the Azores , as the " most remarkable exhibition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. P.

But in 1925 , the voyage of the NC-3 was even surpassed when Commander John Rodgers , Naval Aviator Number Two , and his crew of four landed their PN-9 flying boat 1,841 milesout of San Francisco and sailed it some 450 miles to Hawaii in ten days .

" In reality , the Navys deferral first occurred in 2010 , and the Pentagon has punted on making an investment decision each year since . This berth is a key step toward solidifying a U.S. Pacific presence ; in June 2012 , thenSecretary of Defense Leon Panetta announced that by 2020 , the Navy would position 60 percent of its Fleet , including 6 of 11 aircraft carriers , in the Pacific . Yet today the supporting infrastructure is not in place . Fortunately , building the carrier-capable berth is not a complicated engineering feat . As recently as 2008 , a modern carrier pier was constructed in Yokosuka , Japan , to facilitate the arrival of our lone forward-deployed aircraft carrier , the USS George Washington ( CVN-73 ) . This $67 million project entailed wharf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dredging to support a deeper draft . Construction in Guam is similarly doable , and 2020 is fast approaching . So why has the Pentagon continually failed to act on this relatively straightforward strategic imperative ? <p> In part , congressional inaction may be the reason . While its up to the White House and the Departments of State and Defense to craft the overall strategy , Congress funds the key initiatives that underpin its successful execution . Guam sends only one non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives , making it unlikely that military construction on the island receives the same level of attention as do the job-creating projects in the 50 U.S. states . <p> Pearl Harbor offers the Navy its westernmost carrier-capable berth on sovereign territory today . This is , thus , its last major repair and reloading port before entering the Western Pacific . The U.S. territory of Guam is more than 3,300 nautical miles farther west than the Hawaiian Islands . Its proximity to potential hotspots in East Asia would allow transient U.S. naval forces a significantly shorter sail in and out of theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pentagons continual punting regarding Guam may be an incomplete analysis of all potential berthing locations on the island . In 2010 , the Joint Guam Program Office conducted an environment impact study on 13 potential construction sites , but eliminated 85 percent of those from the selection process before the requisite environmental analysis was completed . Effectively , this left policymakers with only two locations to consider . The entire analysis never accounted for the costs of overcoming the elimination criteria versus the pricetag of complying with environmental regulations . For example , an available berthing site to the west of Guams commercial port was ruled out because of security concerns that primarily stem from its location outside of DOD-owned land . But the costs of adding force protection were never calculated , so policymakers could not make valid comparisons . Combined with the high expense of environmental compliance in the recommended sites , this incomplete analysis has contributed to the Pentagons delayed decision-making . <p> A threefold approach is necessary . First , the Pentagon must appoint an independent body to complete the Aircraft Carrier Berthing analysis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination criteria at the previously ruled-out sites should be compared with the price of meeting environmental regulations . Then policymakers will have all available options . <p> Next , innovative cost-sharing models should be explored to fund construction . The Port Authority of Guams long-term modernization plan calls for the eventual construction of a new 900-foot pier to support the increasingly large post-Panamax container ships . If a larger dual-use pier were constructed , the Navy could share expenses with the U.S. Transportation Command and Department of Transportations Maritime Administration . The Navy strategy only calls for an aircraft carrier to be in port for a maximum of 63 days per year . This means that large commercial vessels could use the facility the other 302 days . <p> Finally , the Asia-Pacific Oversight Series in the House of Representatives must take ownership of this issue .

Even though experts have proved she 's not that old , after restoration and renovation the ship returning to Baltimore 's Inner Harbor is a treasure by any measure . By 1852 , the 38-gun sail frigate Constellation , launched in Baltimore , Maryland , in 1797 , lay old and rotting in the Gosport ( Norfolk , Virginia ) Navy Yard . She had been laid up there since 1845 , after nearly 50 years ' outstanding service in peace and war . As part of its shipbuilding plan for 1853 , the U.S. Navy had decided to construct a new sail sloop-of-war ( or corvetteto use the French designation adopted by the world 's navies ) rated at 22 guns and to perpetuate the name Constellation in her . 1 The Navy 's history with its steamers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery ; other ships were very poor , and most were considered just adequate . 2 William A. Graham , Secretary of the Navy from August 1850 to June 1852 , did not believe the Navy needed a large number of new ships . By summer 1852 , of four steamers authorized in 1847 , three were finished and one nearly was completed ; two more new ships also were completing . Graham was not a steam enthusiast and he felt sailing warships still were viable . He recommended in 1851 that the Navy build one steamer and one sailing ship yearly and by doing so keep abreast of developments in shipbuilding . 3 Graham 's successor was John P. Kennedy , who served until the end of President Millard Fillmore 's term in March 1853 . He advocated some steamers , but nothing was done . Instead , it seems , Graham 's plan was implemented because in 1853 and 1854 work began on a new sail corvette ( Constellation ) and a new steam frigate ( Franklin ) . When James C. Dobbin became Secretary of the Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he let the Constellation ' s building proceed while he prepared his proposal to Congress requesting large steam frigates. 4 For bureaucratic reasons , the Navy considered the Constellation and the Franklin to be " rebuilds " of their older predecessors so that money allocated already for ship-repair purposes could be used rather than having additional new-construction funds appropriated . Ship timber already in storage was also available for use . In reality , what " rebuilding " meant was that the old ship was broken up for scrap and a new one built to a new design , using both new and prestored materials . Accordingly , the old frigate Constellation was scrapped in early 1853 . The keel of the new corvette of the same name was laid at the Gosport Navy Yard on 25 June 1853 , and she was launched on 26 August 1854 . After fitting out , she was commissioned for service on 28 July 1855. 5 61084 @qwx261084 61077 @qwx261077 <p> Mr. Barnard has been a civil servant with the state of Maryland and a member of the U.S. Naval Institute since 1975 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore , Maryland , he resides currently in nearby Timonium. 61075 @qwx261075 61081 @qwx261081 61079 @qwx261079 <p> Last of the Sailing Corvettes <p> A controversy over whether today 's Constellation is one of the U.S. Navy 's first sail frigates or ...

Expeditionary warfare seems to form a category all its own ; it does not fit into any of the above and also defies easy definition . The DOD Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms does not even include it , while the Department of the Navys Naval Expeditionary Warfare Vision 2010 revolves around the concept without ever explaining what it means . 1 The ever-helpful Wikipedia describes it as " the organization of a states military to fight abroad , especially when deployed to fight away from its established bases at home or abroad . " 2 <p> The latter half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps would not have engaged in expeditionary operations if the Warsaw Pact had attacked the West in the 1980s , because the battle would have been around its home bases in Germany . But when it deployed to Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm , it certainly met the definition . Distance is not the only consideration , however . A 1934 lecturer at the Armys Command and General Staff School recognized that critical elements in an overseas expedition were " when can it be ready , and how to find the troops , equipment , and supplies . " He noted that often the force " will be required without delay , as the result of an unforeseen situation , and probably not as part of a war plan . It may be an improvised emergency measure . " 3 In sum , expeditionary warfare remains an elusive and somewhat malleable concept , but throughout history it has been a vital component of national power . <p> The history of expeditionary warfare goes far back in time . An early account of such an operation is Homers Iliad . The ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that naval forces are almost inherently expeditionary by naturethe sole exception being when they operate purely in homeland coastal defense . That American Marines would engage in expeditionary warfare was nearly a foregone conclusion from the moment they came into being . When the Navy needed a landing force , experience in the use of small arms made Marines a main part of the action ( with sailors providing substantial numbers and also manning any heavier guns ) . And almost always those landings were far from home . <h> The First Expeditions <p> Just four short months after the Continental Marines were ordered into existence , they participated in their first expedition . A fleet sailed to New Providence Island in the Bahamas with the goal of capturing much-needed gunpowder . The ships deposited Captain Samuel Nicholas , his 234 Marines , and 50 sailors on shore on 3 March 1776 . Equipped with nothing more than small arms and carrying no provisions , they occupied two undefended forts over the course of two days . But the force ashore had not moved fast enough to seize the gunpowder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the first night as they rested at the first fort . More aggressive leadership , better-conditioned troops , and coordinated operations with the ships and boats would have made use of the initial surprise achieved to gain all the objectives the first day . <p> In July 1779 , three companies of Continental Marines would spearhead another seaborne expedition dispatched to destroy a naval base being built by the British in Penobscot Bay , Maine . The initial landing went well , but overly cautious leadership resulted in a stalemate ashore and at sea and this time led to disaster . When a more powerful British fleet arrived , the Americans attempted a hasty withdrawal , only to see all their vessels captured or destroyed , with surviving sailors , militiamen , and Marines attempting to escape overland . <p> The next expedition of consequence would ultimately be enshrined in the opening line of the " Marines Hymn . " In November 1804 , Lieutenant Presley N. OBannon , seven enlisted Marines , and diplomat William Eaton went ashore in Alexandria , Egypt . Their audacious goal was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek and Arab mercenaries , they trekked 600 miles across the desert , forestalling several mutinies along the way . On 24 April 1805 , the Marines led an assault , supported by the guns of a U.S. naval squadron , that seized the fortress of Derna . Two weeks later , they helped repel an attack by 1,200 Tripolitan soldiers . Aggressive leadership , determination , discipline , and coordination between ships and shore had outweighed numerous challenges and achieved tactical success . The Derna campaign also highlighted an aspect that frequently plays a significant role in expeditionary operationscreative initiative that leverages available combat power to make it more effective . <p> Whereas New Providence and Penobscot Bay were planned landings launched from fleets assembled for the purpose , the presence of Marine detachments on Navy warships patrolling around the world would result in their repeated use for a wide variety of pop-up missions , making them an expeditionary force in readiness simply because they were in position to respond to unexpected crises as they occurred . From 1816 through 1835 , Marines landed in Florida , Cuba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Peru to protect American interests . <p> Wars against Seminole and Creek Indians brought a new wrinkle to the Marine expeditionary repertoire . It began typically enough with the Marine detachments of two ships landing in Florida on 22 January 1836 to reinforce an Army fort anticipating an attack . But then President Andrew Jackson accepted Commandant Colonel Archibald Hendersons 21 May offer of a regiment to assist in the widening conflict . Although no such Marine unit existed , by 1 July Henderson had assembled troops from Navy-yard guard detachments ( another ongoing Marine mission ) and put them in the field in Georgia . The ability to bring together widely dispersed manpower and rapidly form it into an effective fighting force would become another hallmark of Marine expeditionary warfare . <p> The war with Mexico beginning in 1846 demonstrated the power of seagoing Marines and sailors formed as naval infantry to dominate a wide area with their inherent mobility .

In the process the unit added the " Halls of Montezuma " to the opening of the " Marines Hymn . " <p> The Corps played only a minimal role in the Civil War , fought at home , but in the years immediately before and after Marines handled an increasing number of brush-fire contingencies of greater scale and complexity than those preceding the Mexican War . Although the Corps still lacked many attributes of professionalismsuch as written doctrine , advanced military education , and formal training programsit benefited in another respect from the size of ships detachments , which emphasized small-unit leadership among junior officers and NCOs to a degree uncommon in most military organizations . <h> A Landing-Force Doctrine <p> In the final two decades of the 19th century the Navy underwent a revolution as it began to acquire steel ships ( 1883 ) , established the Naval War College ( 1884 ) , and bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seabased on his earlier lectures as well as his 1890 book . The combination of steam and steel technology , as well as national interest in global power , further increased the importance of naval operations ashore . Steam propulsion required bases to support the coaling of ships . While that could be accomplished in any port in peacetime , in the event of war the United States would have to seize bases or harbors suitable for the purpose . An expeditionary Navy thus demanded a readily available expeditionary landing force . The increasing interest in preparation for operations ashore by naval forces was apparent by 1884 , when the North Atlantic Squadron conducted a three-day exercise with a naval brigade of 660 officers and men ( one-sixth of them Marines ) . The official report of the event noted : " Landing forces are among the most important subjects to which they naval officers may give their attention . " 4 <p> The transition to greater professionalism brought the first written landing-force doctrine . The Navy had published Exercises in Small-Arms and Field Artillery in 1852 , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move troops in standard formations . It did not cover tacticswhen to use various formations or how to accomplish any task not involving drill movements . In 1886 the Navy printed The Naval Brigade and Operations Ashore by Marine Lieutenant Howard K. Gilman , a true compilation of tactical doctrine from various sources . The author noted in his preface : " While fully realizing that there are many officers in the service of greater experience , and far more competent to prepare a work of this kind than myself , yet , as no such work has hitherto been prepared , I trust that this one may meet with the approval of , and be of practical benefit to , the service at large . " 5 <p> That emphasis by the Navy and the Marine Corps proved farsighted , as the scale of operations ashore and the level of Marine participation therein continued growing . The importance of the Isthmus of Panama to U.S. trade , coupled with Panamanian unrest under Colombian control , resulted in repeated Marine deployments to that area . In March 1885 ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within a space of two weeks the Corps assembled two battalions in New York City and got them to the isthmus . Interventions in Panama , Nicaragua , and other Central American and Caribbean countries would become routine in the years to follow . <p> The Spanish-American War brought the new requirement for coaling stations and landing forces to the fore . On 7 June 1898 , 80 Marines from ships detachments conducted an amphibious reconnaissance of Guantanamo Bay , Cubaa possible coaling site for the U.S. fleet blockading the Spanish squadron in Santiago . Three days later , a Marine battalion ( formed , as usual , from Navy-yard garrisons ) landed to seize the bay . The rapid deployment of the Marine unit and its equally rapid victory stood in contrast to the Army , which had marshaled a much larger invasion force with great difficulty , suffered more than 2,600 deaths due to disease before even departing the States , and conducted a chaotic landing in Cuba against no immediate opposition . 6 Although the Army ultimately was successful in its operations ashore , the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national leaders . Meanwhile , ships detachments were active against the Spanish in other theaters , landing in the Philippines , Guam , and Puerto Rico , as well as handling unrelated brush-fire emergencies in China , Samoa , and Nicaragua . <h> A Growing Force for Growing Demand <p> In no time at all the Marine Corps had found itself nearly overwhelmed by expeditionary service , and it doubled in size to 6,000 men to meet the need . The burgeoning Filipino rebellion necessitated the deployment of small Marine battalions to the Philippines in 1899one in May , a second in September , and a third in Decemberall soon organized into the 1st Regiment . In May 1900 , two ships detachments went ashore in China and moved overland to Peking to guard the U.S. Legation from the antiforeign Boxer movement . Most of the 1st Regiment shifted from the Philippines to China to participate in the international relief force for the Legation Quarter during August . In October the 1st Regiment returned to the Philippines and joined the new 2d Regiment in continuing operations against the rebellion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marine battalions deployed to Panama to protect that new nation after its break with Colombia . In mid-September 1906 , a ships detachment and then a Marine battalion landed in Cuba to deal with a rebellion there . By 10 October , when the first U.S. Army units arrived on the island , nearly 3,000 Marines organized into six battalions were already there . By 1912 , when the Marine Corps deployed two regiments to a new crisis in Cuba and another regiment to Nicaragua , it had expanded to nearly 10,000 men . It also had created the Advance Base School to train personnel for seizing and ( primarily ) defending the expeditionary bases required by a Navy that was now truly global in its size and scope of duties . In late 1913 the Corps established the Advance Base Force , its first permanent organization dedicated to an expeditionary mission . <p> While Europe became embroiled in World War I in 1914 , the Marine Corps became even more enmeshed in the Caribbean and Central America . In April three Marine regiments and reinforcing sailors captured the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rebels . They held the city until Army troops began arriving at the end of the month . The Corps sent a brigade to Haiti in July and August 1915 to put down a revolution there . A U.S.-Haitian treaty signed the next month tasked the Corps with creating a constabulary force to maintain order . It would continue that mission for almost two decades and participate in numerous small-unit skirmishes with rebels for the next several years . The following year Marine units occupied Santo Domingo after significant fighting to establish a stable government and constabulary there . <p> The use of Marine-led local forces to fight a counterinsurgency campaign ensured that the operations in Haiti and Santo Domingo remained primarily expeditionary in character even though the deployments stretched over many years ( until 1934 and 1924 respectively ) . Most elements operated on a shoestring , out in the countryside far from any support . When rebellions flared beyond the ability of those forces to handle them , regular Marine units deployed from Navy ships or the United States to reinforce them . <p> In April 1917 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , already fully engaged around the world , put together a regiment from Navy-yard garrisons and quieter Caribbean deployments . It sailed for France in June ( on the same day that the first Army combat units departed the States ) . Another regiment joined it in October , and they formed into the 4th Brigade , which ultimately numbered more than 9,000 men . The outfit did not see any action until the following spring and fought its first major battle ( Belleau Wood ) almost a year after the first elements deployed . By that point the operation had lost much of its expeditionary character , so the main impact of World War I was to further burnish the fighting reputation of the Corps , provide impetus to the expansion of its aviation component , and increase its overall size to an unprecedented 75,000 men ( and , for the first time , a handful of women ) . <h> Formalizing Forces and Their Roles <p> Demobilization after that conflict dramatically reduced the Marine Corps in size , but it maintained a floor around 20,000 men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had remained in existence throughout World War I and even deployed for a time to the Caribbean , became the East Coast Expeditionary Force in 1919 . A counterpart , designated the West Coast Expeditionary Force , stood up at San Diego the same year . Both were designed as brigades with artillery and aviation elements . <p> With the new titles , the Corps not only embraced the expeditionary function , but indicated that the commands would perform a wide array of functions beyond seizing and defending advance bases . They might fight alongside the Army in a major land campaign , battle insurgents in third-world countries , or conduct amphibious assaults ( a mission drawing increasing focus in the Navy and the Marine Corps as those services contemplated a potential Pacific war with Japan ) . Beginning in 1924 , the expeditionary forces routinely embarked with the Fleet to participate in annual exercises . The Corps also acquired equipment and weaponssuch as pack howitzers ( designed by the Army to be broken into parts and carried on mules ) that were best suited to easy movement ashore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Quantico beginning in 1920 provided the first professional higher-level education for Marine officers beyond occasional attendance at Army or Navy programs . While the Quantico institutions ( a Field Officers Course primarily for majors , and a Company Officers Course for senior lieutenants and captains ) initially were a warmed-over version of Army courses , the concentration of instructors and students naturally facilitated discussion of uniquely Marine approaches to tactics . <p> The strategic focus of the two services also further diverged and emphasized the need for Marine-specific doctrine . The Army , already nearly two decades removed from its counterinsurgency experience in the Philippines , focused increasingly on fighting another continental war and garrisoning overseas possessions such as the Philippines and the Panama Canal Zone . The Corps , meanwhile , faced ongoing guerrilla campaigns in the Caribbean and the need to seize bases for the Navy . Both became primary topics in the Marine Corps Gazette , the nascent professional journal for Marines . <p> Expeditionary operations began spiking again in 1926 as several ships detachments landed in Nicaragua and another went ashore in China to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deployment of a Marine regiment to Shanghai ( where it would remain through 1941 ) , as well as a brigade to Tientsin and a brigade to Nicaragua . A peace treaty between factions in the latter nation again assigned the Corps the mission of establishing a constabulary force . One rebel leader , Augusto Sandino , refused to lay down his arms and would lead a rebellion lasting through the end of the Marine intervention in 1932 . <p> Captain Merritt Edson personified the impact of these counterinsurgency campaigns on the Corps . He landed on Nicaraguas sparsely inhabited east coast with his 56-man ships detachment in March 1928 . Realizing that the Coco River was the only trafficable route into the forbidding interior where Sandino holed up , Edson ended up leading three operations up the wild waterway . The first was a six-man reconnaissance patrol that lasted 18 days and penetrated 260 miles . The second was a two-month combat patrol that made no contact and served only to demonstrate the difficulty of operating far from sources of supply and support . Near the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of nearly 100 men , all embarked in native dugout canoes and occasionally resupplied by Marine aviation . His relentless pursuit resulted in several skirmishes with Sandino and the establishment of a patrol base in August in the heart of the enemy lair , where he would keep the rebels off balance and on the run for seven months . His creative solutions to tactical and logistical challenges made him a leading thinker on counterinsurgency operations . 7 <h> From Small Wars To Amphibious Assault <p> In the early 1930s the Marine Corps Schools began the task of compiling formal doctrine for both counterinsurgency and amphibious assault missions . Edson influenced the first via discussions with his former commander in Nicaragua , Major Harold Utley , who published a treatise on " Small Wars " in the Gazette . That subsequently served as the basis for the Marine Corps Schools 1935 manual , Small Wars Operations . 8 In 1940 Edson would almost single-handedly rewrite a new version , modeled on his Nicaraguan experience , dubbed the Small Wars Manual . <p> With the end of interventions in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided back seat . The schools devoted a considerably larger and broader effort to devising a Tentative Manual for Landing Operations , published in 1934 . Coupled with the formal re-designation of the Expeditionary Forces as the Fleet Marine Forces at the end of 1933 , the Corps began focusing much more heavily on the amphibious-assault mission and direct support to naval campaigns . But with both publications in hand , the head of the schools proclaimed : " For the first time since the founding of the Marine Corps Schools the entire course of instruction is based on our missions and our jobs . " 9 <p> The onset of World War II in 1939 set the Marine Corps on a course for unprecedented expansion . It reached a strength of 65,000 before the United States officially entered the war in December 1941 and peaked at nearly 500,000 by the end in 1945 . The conflict was almost entirely one expeditionary operation after another for the Corps , beginning with the deployment of a brigade to Iceland in June 1941 through the landing of occupation elements in Japan on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely the six-month campaign on Guadalcanal . Launched on a shoestring with inadequate supporting forces and hanging in the balance at several points , the Marines turned the tide on the ground against the Japanese , puncturing their vaunted aura of invincibility . <p> The Army necessarily engaged just as actively in expeditionary operations around the globe during the war , but afterward became enmeshed in occupation duty in Japan and Germany . The Marine Corps reinvigorated its expeditionary roots in January 1948 when it deployed its first battalion on board transports to serve as the landing force of the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean . This instituted a practice of continuously maintaining combat ready units afloat around the globe in order to respond to any crisis that might arise . <p> When the Korean War broke out on 25 June 1950 , the deployment-centric Corps proved more ready than the Army for the sudden conflict . In time-honored fashion , the Marine Corps cobbled together forces from units afloat and ashore and manpower squeezed from Navy yards and other garrison functions . The effectiveness of the 1st Marine Brigade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war ensured that the Corps would survive as a major institution in the U.S. military . <p> In the late 1950s the Marine Corps formally resumed use of the term " expeditionary " in labeling its commands and developed the equipment and doctrine to create expeditionary airfields in a matter of hours where there was no existing runway . That emphasis contributed to Marines landing first in Lebanon during a crisis in 1958 , providing the first ground-combat troops in Vietnam in March 1965 , and arriving first in the Dominican Republic in response to a coup in April 1965 . Marine forces afloat also would execute the final withdrawal of American personnel from Cambodia and Vietnam in April 1975 . <h> Keeping an Expeditionary State of Mind <p> One consequence of the Vietnam War was replacement of the term expeditionary with amphibious in command titles ( due to the alleged sensitivities of the Vietnamese ) , but Marines never altered their focus . As the importance and vulnerability of Middle Eastern oil supplies came to the fore in the 1970s , the Corps created the Maritime Prepositioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships stationed near potential crisis areas , each holding all the equipment and supplies needed to outfit a brigade for 30 days of combat , was an alternative to the Armys reliance on airlift and commercial shipping to move its heavy forces to the sound of the guns . <p> When Iraq conquered Kuwait in early August 1990 , the MPF operated as envisioned . A brigade of the Armys 82nd Airborne Division was the first ground force to arrive in Saudi Arabia to initiate Operation Desert Shield , but the arrival of two MPF squadrons in succeeding days brought battalions of M60 tanks and 155-mm howitzers , as well as sufficient supplies and ammunition for an extended battle . The two Marine brigades constituted the heaviest ground forces in theater until the Armys first mechanized division arrived from the United States in September . <p> The history of Marine expeditionary operations reveals that organization can play a role , though it is not so much how a command is structured as the fact that it is dedicated to the mission and actively preparing for immediate deployment on short notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be specialized amphibious weapons and craft , maritime prepositioning squadrons , or gear to support short takeoffs and landings on improvised runways . Appropriate doctrine is useful , but the Corps operated for much of its existence with manuals borrowed from the Army and eventually developed doctrine solely for the amphibious and counterinsurgency subsets of the overarching expeditionary requirement . <p> But even more than any of those concrete elements , expeditionary warfare is at its most basic level a state of mind . It requires innovative thinking , a willingness to find a way to make do with less , and an aggressive style recognizing that hesitation generally will permit a foe surprised by your rapid appearance in his backyard to recover and make use of his home-field advantage . The Corps repeatedly demonstrated these attributes almost from its beginning and so has remained the premier exemplar of an expeditionary force .

What became known as the Panay Incident , in which Japanese forces repeatedly attacked an American gunboat in China , tested the national will of the United States at a time when isolationist sentiment at home was strong and tensions abroad high . <h> U.S. Presence in China Challenged <p> Americas military presence in China began in 1858 when rights to patrol the Yangtze River were arranged under the Sino-American Treaty . Its purpose was to protect U.S. personnel and interests , which steadily expanded into the 20th century . After the Spanish-American War , the U.S. Navy increased the number of gunboats available to patrol Chinas rivers , and in 1901 the Yangtze Patrol became a subdivision of the Asiatic Fleet . According to a plaque in the wardroom of the USS Panay ( PR-5 ) , the patrols mission was " the protection of American life and property in the Yangtze River Valley . . . and the furtherance of American goodwill in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . <p> Japan began to challenge American interests in China in 1900 . That year Secretary of State John Hay had announced an Open Door policy with regard to China in order to establish American trade and a U.S. sphere of influence in the region . Japan responded by trying to extend its control throughout China . <p> Regional tension fluctuated for several years until 1931 , when Japan invaded Manchuria to stifle rising Chinese nationalism and gain a source for raw materials . In essence , Japan annexed the area , renaming it Manchukuo . A Chinese plea for support from the League of Nations eventually resulted in the assembly condemning the invasion ; Japan responded by withdrawing from the league . America was interested in recovering from the Great Depression , not in a " minor , " distant dispute . However , in 1932 President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt did reaffirm U.S. rights under the Open Door policy . Tokyo summarily rejected the policy as well as subsequent protests by declaring countries that did not recognize Manchukuo thereby forfeited economic privileges in the region . <h> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabricated the Marco Polo Bridge incident near Peking to justify a full-scale invasion and occupation of China . On 29 July , Tientsin was bombed , and 13 days later Japanese marines landed in Shanghai . After attempts at finding a peaceful solution to the fighting failed , the United States decided to maintain its military forces in China to protect Americans . <p> By December the Japanese had advanced 200 miles and besieged Nanking , Chinas capital . Japanese control of the lower Yangtze through Nanking would cut China in half and give the invaders excellent lines of communication and control of commerce . But Chinese military opposition exceeded Tokyos expectations , and Japanese attacks became more vicious , with no regard for civilian casualties . Although most foreigners had fled by this time , the Panay steamed from Chungking to Nanking to evacuate many of the few Americans remaining there . <p> Lieutenant Commander James Hughes , U.S. Naval Academy class of 1919 , had assumed command of the Panay on 23 October 1936 . As a result of the Japanese invasion , he had taken precautions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunboats fore and aft superstructure . A large American flag also flew at her stern . At night all of the flags were lighted so that they could be seen from shore and from above . Hughes also periodically informed the American consul general of the Panays exact location , information that was passed along to the Japanese to avoid an accidental attack on the gunboat . <h> Attacked from the Air and the River <p> At about 0930 on 12 December , a Japanese infantry detachment on shore signaled the Panay to stop . Commander Hughes complied , and soon after a motor launch came alongside the gunboat . A lieutenant , accompanied by four riflemen with fixed bayonets , came aboard and asked where the boat was going and why , and for locations of Chinese troops . The former queries were answered , but Hughes politely refused to answer the last one . The officer then asked to search the Panay and the tankers for Chinese troops , but again was refused . The commander closed the meeting by asking the party to leave his boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the vessels were about 27 miles from Nanking , approaching planes were heard high overhead . Suddenly , before a general alarm could be sounded , two tremendous bomb explosions erupted on board the Panay . One of the bombs had hit the port bow , disabling the 3-inch gun and severely injuring Captain Hughes . Meanwhile , near-misses rocked the boat and showered shell fragments across her decks . Alley later wrote : " My first reaction was that the Japanese , mistaking the Panay for an enemy ship had then realized their error and were leaving but this was wrong . . . as almost directly thereafter a squadron of six small pursuit-type bombers came over at a much lower altitude and immediately began to power-dive and release what seemed to be 100-pound bombs . " <p> More than 30 years after the event , Alley maintained that the Japanese attack was not a case of mistaken identity : " Hell , I can believe those babies flying level up there at 7,000 or 8,000 feet might not be able to tell who we were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see our flags . They came straight out of the sun . And they came over and over again . " <p> During the 30-minute attack , sailors manned the Panay s machine guns to ward off the repeated bombing and strafing runs but failed to hit any aircraft . Damage to the Panay was extensive . She could not make steam , and there was flooding belowdecks . Unable to talk because of shrapnel wounds , the gunboats executive officer , Lieutenant Arthur Anders , finally wrote the order to abandon ship . Despite being strafed by Japanese planes , the Panay s two motor launches made repeated trips to shore evacuating the crew and passengers . <p> By 1505 , the sinking Panay had been abandonedthe first U.S. Navy ship ever lost to enemy aircraft . Casualties were heavy . Italian journalist Sandro Sandri , Lieutenant Edgar G. Hulsebus , and Storekeeper First Class Charles L.

Shortly thereafter the boats left , missing the disembarked sailors and civilians , who had hidden in tall reeds along the riverbank . <h> Leadership Tested <p> The injured Hughes passed command to Army Captain Roberts , the senior-ranking uninjured officer . Roberts , who fortuitously spoke fluent Chinese , proceeded to organize an escape plan while waiting for dusk . Chinese from a nearby town arrived and offered assistance .

Captain Roberts described the survivors arrival : <p> Past the devastation in Chaipei . . . we moved slowly around the point opposite Soochow Creek and came alongside the huge Augusta , her decks lined with sailors . . . there was no cheering : our flag was at half mast .

President Roosevelt responded with a formal protest to Tokyo on 13 December . Japan immediately made unofficial and private apologies and offered to meet all American demands . Stating that the attack had been a mistake , Japanese officials initiated an investigation . Minister of the Navy Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai reprimanded the squadron leaders of the attack , and Rear Admiral Teizo Mitsunami , head of Japanese naval air units in China , was relieved of command and ordered back to Tokyo . Their excuses and reasons for the attack were inconsistent . <p> The navy squadrons that attacked the Panay had been operating on intelligence provided by the army , whose response to the incident was indifferent . Army officials offered three baffling excuses : <p> No Japanese patrol boats were in the area during the attack . <p> The Panay provoked the incident by firing on Japanese soldiers with her 3-inch guns . <p> Patrol boats never fired on the Panay . <p> In fact , the Japanese army and navy reacted differently to the incident , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieved , Japan did not identify another culprit . <p> That person could have been Colonel Kingoro Hashimoto , the senior commander of Japanese ground forces north of Nanking ; he was known to be fanatically pro-army and anti-Western . Hashimoto had given orders to fire on any ships sighted on the Yangtze , and throughout the Nanking campaign his superior complained of his arrogance . The colonel , who had powerful political connections , was quietly recalled to Japan in 1938 but never otherwise disciplined . He continued to influence Japans war effort . <p> A Japanese army spokesman later confirmed that soldiers in a patrol boat had machine-gunned and boarded the Panay after she was abandoned . Furthermore , the War Ministry knew about that incident by 22 December 1937 but ordered all concerned personnel to remain silent . Perhaps the army deceived the navy into making the air attack on the pretext that the neutral ships were Chinese or contained Chinese soldiers ; however , Masatake Okumiya , who commanded six dive bombers in the attack , denied that possibility . <p> Another possibility concerns the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack . While Commander Hughes had answered most of the Japanese lieutenants questions , he had not allowed the party to search the Panay or the tankers and had ordered it off his boat . The boarding partys report to local Japanese headquarters may have indicated it received a hostile reception and that perhaps the Americans were concealing something . The ranking officer in the area , Colonel Hashimoto , had authority to screen intelligence reports prior to submission to army headquarters . <p> A report on the encounter was sent to supreme army headquarters in China , and an air-operations staff officer there soon met with the headquarters naval-air liaison officer , Lieutenant Commander Takeshi Aoki . Aoki recalled the officer as saying : " According to the report of an advance Army unit , many Chinese troops are fleeing up the river from Nanking . They are on six or seven large merchant ships . Our ground forces cant reach them now . So it is requested that the naval air arm make an attack at once . " <p> Aoki sent the request to the supporting naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a successful attack . By the time the squadron commanders and pilots received instructions , they had been filtered through at least eight people and were vague . The pilots scrambled into action , ignoring caution and probably misjudging the armys report . <p> It is doubtful that Tokyo endorsed the attack ; Japan still depended on America for raw materials in 1937 . However , the militarys objective was the seizure of China , and an unchecked army dictated Japanese policy there , not Emperor Hirohito or the Diet . <h> The U.S. Navy Investigates <p> Speculation grew while observers and participants awaited the results of U.S. inquiries . The Panay s survivors were certain the attack was deliberate . Perhaps local Japanese military authorities had decided to humiliate the United States and Great Britain . Four British gunboats and even the Augusta had been previous recipients of " stray " rounds . <p> Meanwhile , a naval board of inquiry had convened on board the Augusta . Among the 37 findings contained in its report , the panel determined that two distinct groups of aircraft had attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombed the gunboat . The second consisted of single-engine biplanes that dive-bombed and strafed the boat with machine-gun fire . The board reached four significant conclusions : <p> Japanese aviators should have been familiar with the characteristics of the Panay , as she was present at Nanking during air attacks on the city . <p> While the first bombers might not have been able to identify the Panay because of their altitude , attacking without properly identifying their target was inexcusable , especially since it was well known that neutral ships were on the Yangtze . <p> It was " utterly inconceivable " that the Japanese dive bombers , which came within 600 feet of the Panay during attacks that lasted 20 minutes , could not have known the identity of the gunboat or the tankers they were attacking . <p> The Japanese were " solely and wholly responsible for all losses which have occurred as the result of this attack .

Similar attacks were still very possible . <p> Several months after the apology was received , the State Department gave the Japanese government an itemized claim for losses . On 30 April the Japanese Foreign Office presented the United States with a $2,214,007.36 check for property loss and death/personal injury indemnification . <p> Although the Panay Incident was officially closed , the attack had three major repercussions . First , the United States evacuated civilians from China and withdrew the Armys 15th Infantry Regiment from Tientsin . The second aftereffect concerned isolationism and antiwar sentiment . <p> The Ludlow Amendment , originally proposed in 1935 by Representative Louis Ludlow of Indiana , sought to restrict a president and Congress from declaring war over isolated oversea incidents involving American nationals . The 1937 version of the bill specified that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States or its territorial possession and attack upon its citizens residing therein , " Congress authority to declare war would not become effective until confirmed by a majority of votes cast in a national referendum . <p> Immediately after the Panay attack , supporters of the legislation held the incident up as an example of how a president could push the country into war , and itbegan picking up widespread popular as well as congressional support . Significantly , the bills newfound momentum may have influenced President Roosevelt to soften the U.S. response to Japan . In Janaury 1938 , an effort to release the measure from committee so it could be debated on the floor of the the House of Representatives was defeated by only 21 votes . <p> A final repercussion of the Panay Incident was that it made Roosevelt cognizant that world events were threatening American interests overseas . As a result , the president expanded military programs , especially within the Navy . <p> Roosevelt mustered sufficient political support while underscoring the defensive nature of naval expansion , and on 17 May 1938 Congress approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacetime naval appropriation in historymore than $1 billionand authorized construction of 46 combat ships , 26 auxiliary vessels , and 950 naval aircraft . <p> At the time , the Japanese attack on the Panay provoked conflicting reactions in the United States , stirring up both antiwar activists and saber-rattlers . But isolationism still held enough influence over foreign and military policy to prevent a strong U.S. reaction . However , four years later when Japanese aircraft again attacked the U.S. flag there would be no national doubt or unwillingness to declare war . <p> Sources : <p> Iris Chang , The Rape of Nanking : The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II ( New York : Penguin Books , 1997 ) .

America began the War of 1812 with no privateers ready to sail . Privately owned merchant ships that , in wartime , were armed by their owners and licensed by the government to attack the maritime trade of the enemy , privateers profited by the sale of ships and cargoes they captured . As soon as word of the war arrived , ship owners in the port cities up and down the Atlantic coast raced to get their sleek sloops and schooners to sea in their new predatory role . They found cannon where they could , signed up oversized civilian crews , and sent messengers to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 26 June 1812 , a week after Congress voted for war , it passed a bill allowing privateers , which President James Madison signed the next day . <p> With their licenseswhich would make their captures lawful , not piratical , prizesand their ships manned and outfitted for war , privateers began to stream out of American ports in July 1812 . Observers assumed that privateers , a historical weapon of weaker maritime powers , would be critical to the American war effort . In a 4 August 1812 letter , former President Thomas Jefferson predicted that the Royal Navy would prevail against the U.S. Navy , but " our privateers will eat out the vitals of their commerce . " Jefferson was no great military mindin the same letter , he infamously predicted that conquering Canada would be a " mere matter of marching " but he may have been right about the privateers . <h> A Fad of Omission <p> Yet many recent historians apparently do not think so .

In many of the recent books about the War of 1812 , those victories receive a great deal of attention . That is not surprising . They stirred Americas pride at a time when the country was reeling from the capture of Detroit and defeats along the border with Canada . Yet the U.S. Navys inspiring battles on the high seas did not alter the course of the war . The loss of a few warships did not seriously weaken the Royal Navy .

In the three years of the War of 1812 , U.S. Navy warships captured about 250 vessels , but American privateers took at least five times that number of British merchant vesselsat least 1,200 , but probably as many as 2,000 , although no one knows for sure . The privateers burned some of the British merchant ships they captured , ransomed others back to their owners , lost many to recapture by the British navy , and brought home prize ships and goods that sold for millions of dollars . <p> The privateering business was thoroughly modern and capitalistic , with ownership consortiums to split investment costs and profits or losses , and a group contract to incentivize the crew , who were paid only if their ship made profits . A sophisticated set of laws ensured that the capture was " good prize , " and not fraud or robbery . After the courts determined that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cargo of coffee , rum , wine , food , hardware , china , or similar consumer goods , which ultimately were bought and consumed by Americans . Because it involved so many owners and seamen directly , and the American populace indirectly , some earlier historians termed the privateers war a " war of the people . " In addition , the government took a large cut of the proceeds off the top as customs duties , which flowed into the Treasury . <p> As the British blockade began to grind the American economy down , it also largely prevented the U.S. Navy from getting to sea . With the Armys seasonal campaigns against Canada a failure , the privateers war on the enemy was the only way America could strike back at the British Empire . The privateers exploits at sea became legendary for their ruses and flair . The psychological effect ( and the financial effect ) on Liverpool and London merchants as the American privateers made brazen captures in the Irish Sea and the English Channel ultimately may have played a role in curbing British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existential enemy of Britain , abdicated in April 1814 . <h> British Understatement ? <p> Until recently , British historians largely ignored the War of 1812 . Now , with many American historians ignoring privateers , some of the recent books by British authors consider American privateers , but only to minimize their significance . In The Challenge : Britain Against America in the Naval War of 1812 , for instance , Andrew Lambert acknowledges the impact of privateers in the first months of the war , but asserts that the Royal Navy minimized and ultimately defeated the privateer threat . While he acknowledges that the privateers guerre de course resulted in the capture of 7.5 percent of the British merchant fleet , because those losses did not produce an existential threat such as the U-boat campaigns of the world wars , Lambert concludes the privateers were " never significant . " He notes that Lloyds ( the London insurance consortium ) maintained wartime maritime insurance rates in September 1814 , and infers that the stability of the insurance rates means that privateers had little effect . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inference is questionable : The fact that maritime insurance rates could not be reduced by September 1814 , five months after Napoleon had abdicated and Britain had returned to peace with France , is an indication of the huge and ongoing damage wrought by the American privateers . <p> Only in a footnote does Brian Arthur in How Britain Won the War of 1812 acknowledge that Lloyds own list of British merchant ships lost to the Americans undercounts the true numbers by nearly 500 vessels . Lloyds , it seems , did not count British ships that were uninsured , and many British merchant vessels sailed without insurance due to what Arthur calls the " high insurance premiums " in effect . Still , Arthur scarcely mentions American privateers . To be fair , his book focuses on the effectiveness of the British blockade of America , not the wider maritime war . Yet he can not help inferentially making a gibe against privateers when he states that , spread over the three years of the War of 1812 , the American guerre de course " loses much of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which grew in overall tonnage and numbers of ships . <p> Yet nowhere do Lambert or Arthur recognize that the effect of the privateers toll on British trade is not necessarily measured merely by the fact that more ships were built than were captured or burned , or that the home country could maintain her trade links with her possessions overseas . To that extent , the comparison with the existential war against the U-boats , which may be unavoidable for modern British historians , is flawed : The War of 1812 was not a total war , and in fact reached a negotiated conclusion in which domestic public opinion mattered . <p> Yet most of the books published for the bicentennial of the War of 1812 are oblivious to privateering . Although the analogy is obviously not perfect , writing about the war at sea in the War of 1812 without referring to privateers is like writing about the war at sea in World Wars I or II without referring to U-boats . Despite the critical role of privateers , despite the entrepreneurship and drama in the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new War of 1812 books by American writers minimize , if not air-brush out , the privateers contribution . <p> Why is that ? <p> Perhaps ignoring the contribution of privateering owes something to the legacy of Alfred Thayer Mahans and Theodore Roosevelts exaltation of sea power and a professional standing navy in the generations after the Civil War . In contrast to the gleaming warships of the " new steel navy , " the ad hoc , privately owned privateers seemed amateurish and disreputable . Just as the land militia ran before the British in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 , the navalists of the late 19th century characterized privateers as a " sea militia , " and that signaled they were unreliable and prone to running . <h> ProfiteersBut Heroic Nonetheless <p> Perhaps to the high-toned Americans of the late- Victorian era , there was something unseemly about armed ships sent to sea by entrepreneurs to make money . Yet Americans , of all peoples , should not look askance at the profit motive . From the beginning of the Republic , Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War of 1812 , the British governing elite regarded Americans as " mere calculators , " who exalted making a dollar over concepts like honor . To the extent that Americans were entrepreneurial and looked at everything in terms of money , it is not surprising that those same Americans in 1812 made privateering almost an art form . <p> Moreover , in denigrating privateers as mere profiteers , we risk forgetting about the bravery that privateers occasionally exhibited : These cruises were not only about making money . There are stirring stories of stiff combat that , if now barely recalled , are not to be belittled . When they had to fight , privateers stood and fought , as the 40-man crew of the American privateer Prince de Neufchatel proved off Nantucket in October 1814 . Then there is the Chasseur , later nicknamed the " Pride of Baltimore , " which captured the Royal Navy schooner St. Lawrence on 26 February 1815 off Havana Harbor after a brief but vicious fight . Following the battle , Thomas Boyle , the captain of the Chasseur , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not willingly , perhaps , have sought a contest with a kings vessel , knowing it is not our object ; but my expectations were at first a valuable vessel and a valuable cargo alsowhen I found myself deceived , the honor of the flag entrusted to my charge was not to be disgraced by flight . " <p> Perhaps modern historians gloss over the contributions of privateers because it is hard to write about them . Unlike the Navy , which had a secretary of the Navy who controlled the operations of his two dozen ships from an office in Washington , D.C. , privateers had no centralized governmental direction . Hundreds of privateers were commissioned during the war . They put to sea when they could avoid or break through the British blockade , and they sailed where their owners or masters thought they could take prizesoff the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , in the chops of the English Channel , in the Arctic Ocean , off Brazil . Privateers had economic incentives suggesting where they should sail , based on British trading patterns , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed from every port from Portland , Maine , to Savannah , Georgia , at different times , for different cruising grounds . Sometimes they achieved spectacular successes , hovering off convoys , burning or seizing straying merchant vessels , but some privateers cruised and captured nothing , others could not get to sea , and still others were caught by British cruisers . In short , its a messy narrative , with many stories , hundreds of scarcely known seamen and shipowners , and diverse outcomes . <h> A Critical Aspect . . . May Be Lost <p> Moreover , historians can read and analyze the secretary of the Navys orders and correspondence . But because privateers were privately owned , they left behind a scattered record . If their papers still exist , they are scattered around the country in libraries and historical societies and in the dusty attics of descendants . The records of their prizes condemned in the federal courts , although public records , are incomplete and widely dispersed , so that even now , 200 years after the War of 1812 , no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant ships actually brought home for prize proceedings . <p> As fewer historians write about privateers , the popular understanding of privateers disappears , and a critical aspect of American maritime history may be lost . Yet according to Andrew Lambert , American privateers captured 1 of every 15 British merchant vessels during the War of 1812 . By the last year of the war , privateers were really all the United States could mount as a maritime threat to Britain . Whether their audacious captures and burnings influenced British public opinion or diplomacy are contested issues . But privateers were a critical aspect of war-fighting for the United States in the War of 1812 . <p> Although nations had used privateers for centuries before 1812 , privateering became a peculiarly American way of war , an effort from the ground up , decentralized , tied to entrepreneurship and patriotism . Privateering drew on the resources of the civilian world , and without calling upon a beleaguered and insolvent government for funds or direction , privateers allowed the profit-making motive , and the mass of American people , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Arthur , How Britain Won the War of 1812 : The Royal Navys Blockades of the United States , 181215 ( Suffolk , UK : Boydell Press , 2011 ) .

Kuehn , U.S. Navy ( Retired ) <p> After ingloriously failing in their first attempt , the Union Navy and Army relied on teamwork to capture Fort Fisher , the Confederacys most powerful surviving strongpoint . <p> Amid a bombardment from hundreds of U.S. naval guns , the Confederate soldiers of Colonel William Lambs Fort Fisher garrison hunkered down in bombproofs on 15 January 1865 . They had endured a similar barrage by the same powerful Union fleet less than a month earlier on Christmas Eve , but that was cold comfort on this gray January day . Suddenly , an odd sound was hearda cacophony of steam whistles . It could mean only one thing : The Union land assault was coming . <p> The successful second attack on Fort Fisher was the culmination of a number of trajectories . Of immediate importance , it neutralized the last significant Confederate blockade-running port . Located on a peninsula near the mouth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Wilmington , North Carolina . Fishers capture was also the culmination of a long and painful evolution of U.S. combined operationsthe synchronization of army and navy forces in combat to achieve an objective . Such operations are now termed " joint , " and among the most difficult are amphibious assaults . Accordingly , the fall of Fort Fisher offers insight into the difficulty of developing joint teamwork , no matter what the era , level of technology , or political context . <h> First Failed Attempt <p> By late 1864 , Wilmington was one of the last remaining Union strategic objectives of the war , almost equal to Richmond in importance . General-in-Chief of the Union Armies Ulysses S. Grant was lukewarm about committing troops to the capture of Fort Fisher when the Navy first proposed the idea . He gave the final go-ahead once Major General William T. Shermans troops neared Savannah , Georgia , and Grant began planning their advance north through the Carolinas . Sherman would eventually need to establish a seaward supply base , and Wilmington could serve this purpose . <p> On 2427 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James commander Major General Benjamin Butler and Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter , commander of the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron , conducted a poorly coordinated operation to capture Fort Fisher that collapsed under a cloud of recrimination and ignominy . An attempt to blow a breach in the works by detonating a powder ship failed , and the subsequent lengthy naval bombardment was relatively ineffective . Thousands of troops were put ashore , but poor relations between Porter and Butler resulted in a hasty , unilateral decision by the latter to cancel an assault against the fort and to re-embark the soldiers . During the withdrawal , poor weather stranded 700 Union troops on the beach . But the Confederates did not attack the isolated force , which later made it safely back to their ships . <p> The fiasco resembled a naval version of the Battle of the Crater at Petersburg , Virginia . In the upshot , Grant sacked Butler ; Porter remained commander of the North Atlantic Squadron . Although the first attack failed , it did provide important lessons for the next attempt . Butler and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the December attempt and had acted more independently than jointly . There was no such thing as a " joint task force " commander in that era , but it was clear that someone had to be in overall charge of the second operation . And there was a precedent for one of two service commanders deferring to the other : During the Vicksburg campaign , Porter had deferred to Grant . <h> Prelude to the Second Try <p> For the second attempt to capture Fisher , Grant replaced Butler with Brigadier General Alfred H. Terry , to whom he gave explicit orders to cooperate with Porter . A new attack plan emerged out of recommendations from Porter and the brigade commanders who had participated in the first try . Moreover , Porter and Terry quickly developed a solid working relationship . While the admiral was the operations senior commander , once Terry was ashore , he would be in tactical control of the land assault . <p> On the Confederate side , Colonel Lamb and his commanding officer , Major General William H. C. Whiting , believed that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to luck . Whiting notified his superiors of the inevitability of another attempt and asked that more obstructions be placed in the Cape Fears channel just west of the fort and that Lambs garrison be reinforced with 1,200 troops . These requests , however , had not been acted on by the time Union forces reappeared . <p> The failure of the first attempt had allowed an attitude of overconfidence to creep into the calculations of Department of North Carolina commander General Braxton Bragg , who withdrew Major General Robert Hokes infantry division from the vicinity of Fisher to Wilmington , a days march away . Lambs garrison was only 800 strong and ill-equipped to man the entirety of Fort Fishers works , the Confederacys most extensive . Bragg remained positive despite Lambs requests for reinforcements and recent intelligence indicating that Terrys force had set sail . The return of the Union fleet off Fort Fisher shocked the general out of his complacency . He suggested Whiting assume command of the fort , but the Cape Fear district commander declined the offer , agreeing instead to go there as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the vicinity of Fort Fisher . <h> Opening Moves <p> Porters 58 ships had arrived throughout the night of 12 January . At about 0830 on the 13th , the fleets five ironclads steamed closer to the fort than in December , opposite its massive Northeast Bastionwhere the land and sea sides met . As the monitors approached , Lamb directed his batteries to open fire , which proved to be a tactical error . After the ships dropped anchor , their gunners registered their weapons on the muzzle blasts emanating from the forts landside embrasures and then opened a sustained bombardment . Within an hour the ironclads had silenced the main guns there . <p> Meanwhile , Porters wooden ships , organized into four divisions ( Line Nos. 1 , 2 , and 3 and the reserve division ) , were supporting the Union troops landing four to five miles up the coast from the fort . Shortly after 0700 , Line No. 1 , led by its flagship , the Brooklyn , had opened fire on the woods behind the landing beach . Ships of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men began debarking at 0830 . Despite Porters best efforts , accurate fire from Confederate sharpshooters made the landing hazardous for the first hour . Additionally , several of the boats capsized in heavy surf , and most of the soldiers and sailors in the first wave ended up washing ashore cold and wet . <p> The soldiers were members of Colonel Louis Bells 3rd Brigade of Brigadier General Adelbert Ames division . Once ashore in sufficient numbers , they quickly secured the area and established a rudimentary defensive perimeter . General Terry arrived ashore shortly after Bell and assumed command . Ames 1st and 2nd Brigades soon followed and helped man the perimeter . By 1400 , 8,000 troops had landed and Porters wooden gunboats were taking position off Fort Fisher to add their gunfire to that of the ironclads . The wooden ships kept up their bombardment until after dark , when they hauled off to deeper water , but two of the armored vessels kept pounding away at the fort throughout the night . <p> Meanwhile , Terry , who delayed landing his artillery until the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That afternoon , Terry ; his engineering officer , Lieutenant Colonel Cyrus Comstock ; and one of his brigade commanders , Colonel N. Martin Curtis , moved down the peninsula to reconnoiter Fisher and assess the damage inflicted by Porters ships . After returning to his command post , Terry met with his subordinates and decided to assault the fort the next day . That evening he made a quick trip out to Porters flagship , the Malvern , to coordinate with the admiral . <p> Earlier that day , because his ships were still encounting some return fire from the fort , Porter had ordered his small gunboats armed with 11-inch guns to resume a methodical bombardment of the fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landside . The devastating barrage continued to late in the day , and the fort received periodic shelling throughout the night . <p> During their meeting on board the Malvern , the admiral agreed with Terrys decision to assault the forts landside the next day . In a surprise , Porter proposed that a naval assault force simultaneously attack the seaside , a battle-plan wrinkle to which the general assented . The warships would commence a heavy bombardment in the morning , and Terry would use signal flags to alert Porter when the Army troops were prepared . The admiral then would signal for his ships to divert their fire from the point of attack to other parts of the fort . The two commanders settled on a collective blast from the ships steam whistles at 1500 , initiated by the Malvern , as the signal to launch the attack . With the plans solidified , Terry returned to his headquarters ashore . <p> Porter designated Lieutenant Commander Kidder Breese , his chief of staff , to lead the naval assault , which would consist of approximately 2,000 sailors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisions ( three Navy , one Marine ) . While the Marines would serve as sharpshooters , the sailors would charge the fort . The last-minute addition of the assault would have a bloody , but important , result . <p> On the Confederate side , Hokes division had arrived approximately 4+ miles north of Fort Fisher early on the morning of the 13th . There his troops established a blocking position in the event the assault on Fort Fisher was a feint to cover an overland campaign to seize Wilmington . Hoke did send 700 assorted infantrymen and artillerymen to assist in the forts defense , which increased Lambs garrison to just over 1,500 troops . <p> Colonel Lamb later wrote that the Union naval bombardment had a demoralizing effect on the garrison . It prevented preparation of food , made sleep impossible , and inflicted casualties . No more than three or four of the forts landside guns were left serviceable . On the afternoon of the 14th , about 24 hours after his arrival at the fort , Whiting sent Bragg a blunt assessment of the urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gunfire and impressed on his superior the necessity of driving the Federal troops from their position if the fort was to hold out . <p> Directed by Bragg to probe the Union forces early on the 14th , Hoke reported that he did not have enough troops to expel the enemy and defend the land routes to Wilmington . After making his own reconnaissance that day , Bragg agreed . He did order Hoke to dispatch one more brigade to the fort , and Brigadier General Johnson Hagoods South Carolina troops , about 1,000 men , set out for Fisher . <p> The next morning , as Hagoods men were debarking from a steamer below Fort Fisher near Battery Buchanan , the Union Navys heavy bombardment resumed . The transport promptly departed with many reinforcements still on board . The troops who had come ashore were pinned down by shell fire almost two miles from where they were needed , at the forts landside wall . They nevertheless pressed on , and some 350 of the South Carolinians survived a harrowing march to arrive near the Northeast Bastion .

Colonel Joseph Abbotts brigade would be held in reserve , and Brigadier General Charles Paines division of U.S. Colored Troops would serve as a rear guard to deal with Hokes troops if they attacked . When he saw Union troops on the forts parapet , Commander Breese was to order his naval force to support the Army attack . While Marines armed with Sharps breech-loading rifles and carbines provided covering fire , the sailors were to charge across the beach , past the Northeast Bastion , and assault the forts seaside . <p> Breese and his naval detachment anticipated a prolonged transit to shore , but the seas proved calmer than they had for the Army landing .

Neither the sailors nor the Marines understood the overall plan , and each ship had dispatched men ashore under her own officers , who were not aware that Breese had overall command of the naval assault . <p> Moreover , the sailors and Marines lacked the training to maneuver in formation under fire . Unbeknown to Breese , Lamb had observed the naval landing and resigned himself that Confederate reinforcements would not arrive in time to thwart the impending assault . The colonel directed his few remaining guns to concentrate on the new threat . Meanwhile , Colonel Curtis watched the naval forces preparations with concern and offered sound tactical advice to a Navy officer who had come to learn of the Armys attack plan . Curtis told the officer , whom he thought was Lieutenant Benjamin Porter , the 19-year-old commander of the Malvern , that he regretted the naval forces compact formation . But the young officer failed to pass the information on to Breese . <p> At 1500 , Breese , having sent forward the Marine division and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating the attack signal .

The plans careful synchronization had broken down . <p> The sailors , mainly armed with pistols and cutlasses , had effective weapons for boarding a warship but not for storming fortified defensive works . Moreover , Lamb exercised patience , holding his troops fire until the enemy advanced to within 200 yards of the fort . The beach was devoid of cover , and Breeses men fell to a withering fire from the defenders . Within minutes , the assault columns degenerated into a mob . Only a small contingent arrived at the log palisade , which ran parallel to the forts landside , past the Northeast Bastion to the ocean .

The butchers bill was heavynearly 400 casualties . The attack , though , had focused Lambs attention myopically on the seaward corner of the works .

The pilot of the bomb-laden Japanese A6M5 Reisen Zeke had carefully used cloud cover and avoided 5-inch and 40-mm antiaircraft fire while approaching the carrier from her stern . Just before the Zeke passed the ship 's fantail , he flipped it onto its back in a snap roll . An instant later , the kamikaze pilot steepened his plane 's dive and crashed through the carrier 's forward flight deck . The resulting explosion blasted most of the ship 's forward elevator more than 400 feet into the air .

But while conducting research in Japan , I found evidence that Tomi Zai was not the brave pilot 's name . To the best of my knowledge , only a handful of the several thousand kamikaze pilots who died by crashing into enemy vessels have been identified , and usually only in Japanese-language books . I nevertheless set out on a journey to correctly identify the man who put the Enterprise out of the war . <h> Against the Backdrop of Okinawa <p> On 6 April 1945 , in response to the recent U.S. landings on Okinawa , Japan launched the largest kamikaze , or Special Attack , offensive of World War IIOperation Kikusui ( Floating Chrysanthemum ) . Its series of ten mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 11 May , about 240 Imperial Japanese Navy and Army planes participated in the sixth Kikusui attack , which severely damaged Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher 's flagship , the USS Bunker Hill ( CV-17 ) . <p> After transferring his flag to the Enterprise , the Task Force 58 commander responded by ordering planes from Task Groups 58.1 and 58.3 to intensify their attacks on the Kikusui air bases on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu . On the nights of 12-13 and 13-14 May , fighters and bombers from the Enterprise attacked the airfields using general-purpose bombs , incendiary clusters , and rockets . <p> Although Naval Air Station Kanoya was one of the bases hit , early on the morning of the 14th , 28 A6M5 Model 52C Zekes of the 6th Tsukuba , 11th Kenmu , and 8th Shichisho squadrons were able to take off . A group of 12 started lifting off at 0525 , and the remainder began leaving at 0619 .

Forty escort fighters accompanied the planes . <p> Tomi Zai was the only one of the 28 kamikaze pilots who successfully completed his mission . He is generally credited as being an outstanding pilot for being able to roll his Zeke onto its back and then hit the Enterprise after it appeared that he would fly over and miss the turning carrier . The pilot 's body , along with his plane 's engine , was found in the bottom of the forward elevator well , and in The Big E , Commander Stafford implied that " Chief Pilot Tomi Zai " was printed on calling cards found in one of his pockets . However , when I checked the names of the kamikaze pilots who had been killed on 14 May 1945 in Combined Fleet records and other sources , I could not find a Tomi Zai . I did , however , find a Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Shunsuke Tomiyasu , but considered it premature to conclude that Tomi Zai was that pilot . <h> The Search Begins <p> Fortunately , I had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CV-6 Association , through the Internet . According to his information , the pilot 's proper name was Shusasuka Tomiyasa , which closely resembled Shunsuke Tomiyasu . An early and improper translation rendered it Tomi Zai . I asked Joel if any of the pilot 's personal items besides the calling cards were recovered . About two weeks later I received an e-mailed reply in which Joel said he had a small rubber stamp that he had been told was found among the pilot 's effects . He offered to send it to me . <p> While awaiting the stamp 's arrival , I asked three Japanese veterans for help gathering more information about the pilot . Takeharu Nozaki is a member of the Hakuo Bereaved Family Association , an organization of flight reserve officer veterans and relatives of those aviators who died during the war ; Fujio Hayashi was a navy veteran who had prepared flight duty rosters at Kanoya in 1945 ; and Nobuya Kinase was Shunsuke Tomiyasu 's comrade in the Tsukuba Air Group .

Tomi Zai , ' I 'd be happy to see it returned to his family . " The stamp was about 2 ? ? inches high , with a long , slender wooden handle and a 2-by- ? ? -inch wooden base . A thin piece of rubber embossed with Chinese characters forming the words " Misc. building " was glued to the base . <p> Hoping direct evidence linking the Enterprise kamikaze to Lieutenant Tomiyasu had been discovered , I asked his brother if he had any information about the stamp . Unfortunately , he knew nothing about it . <h> Help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drying up , an Enterprise veteran , as well as Joel , was able to provide background information about the 14 May kamikaze hit . I had gotten to know Norman L. Zafft several years earlier when I was researching Lieutenant Kazuo Nakai , who had attempted to crash into the Enterprise on 1 February 1942 off the Marshall Islands . Norman was then president of the Enterprise Association . He had come aboard the carrier at age 18 in October 1943 , and in May 1945 was a shipfitter second class assigned to the ship 's Construction and Repair Division . <p> Neither Norman nor Joel knew how I could obtain one of the pilot 's calling cards or a copy of one of them , and Norman added that he had " no idea " where the cards ended up . The pilot 's family and others in Japan were concerned about the disposition and burial of the pilot 's remains . As it was a most delicate subject , I was prepared to keep the findings to myself or pass them along , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war diary , which stated , " At 1410 buried body of Japanese Naval Lieutenant whose plane crashed ship at 0657 . " According to Norman , " His body , as I recall , was placed in a mattress cover with a 5-inch shell and slid into the sea off the fantail , or stern , of our ship , as we buried our dead . " Joel speculated that he was given a simple but respectful burial at sea , probably without much ceremony . <p> " I do n't know how the pilot 's name came out to be Tomi Zai , " Norman wrote , " but my guess is , someone saw his name and could n't pronounce it . He saw Tomiyasa and shortening it to Tomi Sa in English . " <p> I had earlier determined that a Nisei officer who could translate Japanese was most likely on board the Enterprise at the time of the attack . He might have read one of the calling cards correctly but , either through mispronunciation or misspelling as the name was forwarded along , Shunsuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zai . <h> A Key Piece of Evidence Arrives <p> At this point , I wanted to report to Lieutenant Tomiyasu 's brother , as well as Nobuya Kinase and Takeharu Nozaki , on my progress . Our first meeting took place at a restaurant near Yokohama Station . There , I was excited to receive a copy of " Declaration 113 , Action Progress Summary Report " from Takeharu . Discovered in the office of the Hakuo Bereaved Families Association , this Imperial Japanese Navy handwritten document summarized information on 14 May 1945 flights out of Kanoya . It was the very report I had been looking for ; I thought it would conclusively list the name of the pilot who crashed into the Enterprise . While I was disappointed to discover that was not the case , the report did contain key information that helped me shorten the list of possible pilots by process of elimination . <p> I had learned from the Senshi Sosho , the Japan Defense Agency 's history of the war , that 28 bomb-laden Zekes took off from Kanoya shortly after dawn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilots of those planes actually completed their missions . ( Six of the aircraft probably suffered mechanical problems and returned to base . ) Furthermore , the report listed the names and ranks of the 22 pilots broken down by squadrons . Four were lieutenants ( junior grade ) , thirteen were ensigns , and five petty officers . According to the Enterprise war diary , the kamikaze pilot was a lieutenant , which left only four possibilities . <p> According to a notation in the margin of the report : " At/about 0718 , position 130 ? ? bearing ( true ) , 140 nautical miles from Miyazaki , ten escort fighters sighted two groups of the enemy task forces . One carrier the Enterprise appeared to be a CVE and was sending up a pillar of flames . " <p> Because Lieutenants Keijiro Hiura and Takuro Fujita transmitted their last communications after 0657the time the Enterprise was hitthey can be eliminated . For the remaining two lieutenants , Shunsuke Tomiyasu and Fumio Kusumoto , the flight times from takeoff to 0657 was approximately 90 minutes , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb to fly from Kanoya to the carrier 's location . The known facts about their flights could make either one Tomi Zai . However , I concluded Shunsuke Tomiyasu was the pilot of the plane that crashed into the Enterprise based on the similarity of his name to Shusasuka Tomiyasa , the surname of which closely resembled Tomi Zai . <h> Recovering a Piece of the Plane <p> Having completed my research , I next hoped , with the help of Norman Zafft , to bring some comfort and closure to the family and friends of Lieutenant Tomiyasu . On board the Enterprise on 14 May 1945 , Norman had the watch from 0400 to 0800 . He and three of his shipmatesnicknamed the " Fresh-Water Kings " took turns caring for the fresh-water tanks and pumps near the Enterprise ' s forward elevator . Just before 0700 , one of the shipmates , George Barker , came down and said , " Zafft , if you want to go and eat chow , I will relieve you early , as I feel safer down here . " Norman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the chow line , general quarters sounded . Immediately afterward , Tomiyasu 's plane crashed near the forward elevator . George Barker was one of the Sailors killed , and Norman had the terrible experience of knowing that his friend had died in his place . <p> As a member of the Construction and Repair Division , Norman had access to the bottom of the elevator well , where he ventured after the crash and explosion . He told me he picked up a souvenir there , a small piece of the Zeke 's fuselage . Another shipfitter got part of the plane 's propeller blade , a small piece of which Norman later sawed off . He polished one side and engraved on it USS Enterprise May 14 , 1945 . <p> In replying to my request years earlier for information about the Japanese plane that nearly hit the Enterprise in 1942 , Norman had begun his letter by writing that he had been bitter toward and prejudiced against the Japanese people , but after 50 years , he knew it was time to forgive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Americans had for their country . Maybe hearing from me had helped change his attitude . <p> When I told Hideo Tomiyasu and the members of the Tsukuba Air Group Association that Norman had two pieces of Lieutenant Tomiyasu 's plane , which he had carefully preserved for nearly 60 years , opinions were divided between aggressively seeking the return of one of the pieces , and gently urging Norman to part with one of the mementoes . I strongly believed that he would not part with the engraved piece of the prop blade but might return the piece of fuselage . Hideo and members of the Tsukuba Air Group Association decided to entrust me with writing an e-mail asking Norman for one of the pieces . Although I knew his attitudes toward the Japanese had changed considerably in the past couple of years , I carefully chose my words , stating in the message that we would appreciate his considering giving us one of the pieces . <p> Several days after I sent the e-mail , I received a response from Norman saying , after informing his family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piece of the plane 's fuselage . He wrote that he could not part with the piece of the prop blade , as it represented a day he would always remember , and his son would have it someday . The other piece of the plane would mean more to the Tomiyasu family than to his family , he said . About a week later I was excited to receive a manila envelope from Norman . A piece of an Imperial Japanese Navy Zeke kamikaze plane had returned to Japan after 58 years ! <h> A Final Resolution <p> A few weeks later , in early July 2003 , I attended a gathering to celebrate the life of Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Shunsuke Tomiyasu and reach a definitive conclusion about his fate . Held in a hotel room near Yokohama Station , the attendees included Hideo Tomiyasu ; the three Japanese veterans I had worked withFujio Hayashi , Nobuya Kinase , and Takeharu Nozaki ; and Tetsuo Terao , another veteran who had been a middle-school classmate of Lieutenant Tomiyasu 's . <p> Fujio , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episodes from the young aviator 's life . I followed by reporting on my research and explaining it was next to impossible to expect further developments . All the attendees then agreed that although the evidence was circumstantial , the kamikaze pilot who had been known as Tomi Zai must have been Lieutenant ( junior grade ) Shunsuke Tomiyasu . <p> I then presented the envelope I had received from Norman Zafft to Hideo Tomiyasu . He withdrew from it a small , about 1 ? ? -by-3 ? ? -inch , slightly bent piece of Duralumin . On the outer surface , part of the dark olive drab paint of the imperial navy 's planes had peeled off due to exposure to high temperatures , and a strip of metal about 2 ? ? 5 an inch wide that seemed to be a stringer was riveted on the back of the piece . <p> Without saying a word , Hideo Tomiyasu stared fixedly at the piece of the plane in which his beloved brother flew to his death . He , as well as the veterans present , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> According to Hideo , the only official word he had received about his brother 's death was that " Lieutenant Tomiyasu was killed in action on May 14 , 1945 . " About ten years ago , he had learned by hearsay that Shunsuke might have crashed into the Enterprise . Having just learned in detail about his brother 's final moments , Hideo thought Shunsuke must have been satisfied to have successfully completed his mission . In those days , when a kamikaze pilot left on a sortie , he was determined to hit the target . Hideo calmly said that he wanted all to know that , although people think Shunsuke was the only pilot who distinguished himself in the battle , all the other pilots who took off from Kanoya that morning shared in the success by having cooperated with and supported his brother . <p> In accordance with Hideo 's wishes , the piece of his brother 's plane is now displayed at the Kanoya Naval Air Station Museum . The description accompanying the exhibit explains that , more than 60 years before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high spirit of patriotism , followed the extraordinary command to die for his country and crashed into the USS Enterprise , successfully accomplishing his sure-death , one-way mission . The names of the 14 American officers and men of the Enterprise killed by the crashincluding Seaman Second Class George Barkerare also included in the exhibit for the repose of their souls . Moreover , in return for his kindness and generosity , a description is included to the effect that , despite old , hard feelings against the Japanese , Norman L. Zafft gave the relatives and comrades of Lieutenant Tomiyasu a piece of the plane on board which the young pilot died . <p> Hideo Tomiyasu told me he donated the piece of his brother 's kamikaze plane to the museum because he wants present-day young people to know that in the past many young Japanese had willingly sacrificed their lives for the sake of their country . He also wants today 's youth to realize how primitive , brutal , and violent war can be .

He was also accomplished at judo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 with a degree in politics and economics , he worked for the Nichiman Trading Company in Shinkyo ( Changchun ) , Manchuria . That September he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy in the 13th Class of Reserve Students and received intensive Zeke flight training at Tsukuba Air Base . In May 1944 he was commissioned an ensign . After several transfers and a promotion to lieutenant ( junior grade ) , Shunsuke was assigned to Tsukuba Naval Air Group on 1 March 1945 as an instructor for the 14th Class of Reserve Students . On 28 March , however , Tsukuba Air Group organized a Zeke Special Attack ( Kamikaze ) Corps , which Lieutenant Tomiyasu joined . Leading the corps ' 6th Tsukuba Squadron , he took off from Naval Air Station Kanoya on his final mission early on 14 May . In his final letter to his family , Shunsuke wrote : <p> Dear Father , Mother , and Sister , I was suddenly ordered to sortie to a certain area , and I must depart now .

DSC C2 should only be considered during a " middleweight " normal-scale catastrophe , such as Hurricane Sandy , unless it is complemented by additional federal measures that aim to ensure optimization inside a complex-catastrophe response . These measures basically " federalize " a portion of the total DSCA response in order to mitigate whole-of-government processes from paralysis . When multiple states must employ simultaneous DSCs across a region , the unity of effort erodes due to the emergence of unique objectives within a state , requisite additive coordination , and the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national and corollary levels of government have many methods , resources , and programs poised to assist in disaster response . When corresponding C2 structure is employed , it should optimize the response to the state(s) and should be tailored to the unique size of the catastrophe at hand . Different scales of catastrophes warrant different levels of responses through the local , county , state , regional , and federal levels from both civil and military stakeholders in an affected area . Consider the three categories of catastrophes , based on the order of their destructiveness : major disasters , normal catastrophes , and complex catastrophes . 3 For the purposes of this article , we will focus on the latter two . <p> Normal-Scale Catastrophes <p> The response to Hurricane Sandy was the first time in domestic history that the DSC C2 construct was employed during a no-notice disaster . This crisis was the perfect size and scale for the DSC C2 structure to be used and tested in a non-exercise situation , and the DOD and USNORTHCOM consider the response to be a success . 5 Brigadier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General James Grant of the New Jersey DSC co-commanded DSCA efforts . Governors and these authorized DSCs were able to leverage existing military and civil relationships between the two affected states . When reflecting on the Hurricane Sandy combined response , General Charles H. Jacoby , Commander USNORTHCOM , stated , " We are building the team ahead of time so the relationships are there . We are not exchanging business cards with our partners at the time of the fire , but well before the fire . " 6 <p> While there were a few areas for improvement , the overall assessment concluded that interagency relationships functioned properly and smoothly with federal assistance flowing through the Title 10 deputies assigned to the respective DSCs . The affected states initially responded to the destruction caused by the hurricane , but emerging mission requirements resulted in the subsequent tasking to federal forces . The unity of command and effort was manageable within the DSC C2 given that there were only two states affected by the aftermath . Multiple infrastructures including power grids , water , and mass transportation degraded significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a potential forcascading failures of infrastructure or networks . <p> This manageable and contained aftermath allowed for the two DSCs to operate in their respective boundaries quite well . However , had a few worst-case variables materialized , Hurricane Sandy could have easily spiraled into the realm of a complex catastrophe . One of the most challenging aspects within a DSCA crisis is to know at what point to escalate support using the National Response Framework " tiered-response " concept . " Knowing when a State and Guard are running out of resources and when to ask for Title 10 support is the question of the hour , and this is tested during National Level ExerciseVigilant Guard , " said Major General Kevin R. McBride , Adjutant General , Rhode Island National Guard , in a 2013 interview . 7 <p> New York and New Jersey augmented capability-set shortfalls through pre-existing emergency-management assistance compacts ( EMACs ) , powerful agreements between neighboring states that allow for responsive surge support to a state that has a governor-declared emergency . Emergency management agencies were able to pool requirements from adjacent states and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All costs for providing this surge support were legally obligated for reimbursement to the state or states of origin . 8 " The huge scale of Hurricane Sandy highlighted a shortcoming in how FEMA calls on USNORTHCOM to support disastersparticularly , large complex ones that affect multiple states , " reflected FEMA administrator Craig Fugate. 9 Since Hurricane Sandy tested FEMA and its ability to exercise EMACs for different states across a wide region , it allowed DHS and FEMA to realize its strengths as well as areas for development relating to internal policy and processes . <p> Many hypothetical complex catastrophe DSCA responses would be complicated by the DSC C2 option , unless a portion of the total disaster-response effort was led by a Title 10 " lead disaster DSC . " Hurricane Sandy demonstrated the need to clarify the requirement for this oversight when the situation appeared to escalate . Understanding that every DSCA response is distinctive and the President ultimately preserves the final decision , only one to three states concurrently experiencing a normal-scale catastrophe would be advised to employ DSC C2 structures within their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more breadth across a region ( four or more states ) , the existence of a defined complex catastrophe ( or the potential for one to develop ) , kinetic or terrorist activity , or any mixture of these variables would actually begin to burden and negate the unity of effort maintained at each respective state DSC . This would also create many additional layers of required expertise , coordination , and bureaucracy on the state(s) that would likely not be fully supportable . <p> Additionally , pre-existing EMACs could not be fully relied on and supported because governors would be hesitant to relinquish assets to another governor if their state was also in need . EMACs are not established as requirements during DSCA events ; they are only an option if a governor and adjutant general agree to loan out their commodities for temporary usage . 10 Complex catastrophes not only increase the burden on a state to coordinate requirements and synchronize operations with the federal government , but also break down and degrade the state-to-state support network within FEMA and the National Guard Bureau due to exponentially increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011 tsunami that devastated Japan , four levels of layered events occurred : an earthquake , the tsunami itself , the instability of the Fukushima nuclear power plant , and the humanitarian crisis of having hundreds of thousands of displaced citizens . If a similar event occurred in a heavily populated multi-state region of the United States , there would be a combination of cascading failures to infrastructure and heavy requirements affecting multiple states . DSC C2 would then be overwhelmed by possible requirements to coordinate actions with national-level interests through federal organizations . These could include USNORTHCOM , FEMA , DHS , the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services , U.S. Department of Energy , U.S. Department of Transportation , U.S. Department of Justice , U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , U.S. Department of Agriculture , Food and Drug Administration , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Federal Reserve , and even more , depending on the disasters severity and scope . Furthermore , Canadian and Mexican governments and corresponding nested bureaus and departments could easily find themselves deeply involved during a complex cascading catastrophe in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordination involving many external parties would only invite friction and confusion and hinder national-response efforts . <p> During complex catastrophes , nongovernmental organizations and **26;265;TOOLONG DSCA-response efforts should also peak at the federal level via FEMA and a supporting lead disaster DSC , instead of multiple independent civil authority and military interfaces with multiple states . In the event of a complex catastrophe , such as an earthquake at the New Madrid fault line , there would be enormous casualties and cascading infrastructure damage across 11 states and 4 FEMA regions . A total of 15 reactors would be at risk of destruction causing widespread environmental contamination . Our nation could be faced with enormous deaths and casualties if this occurred , and a large-scale mortuary-affairs effort would likely be outsourced or at least assisted by the private sector . <p> Again , this is out of scope for DSCs to initiate , especially if numerous states were represented as autonomous end customers . A FEMA director and a supporting Title 10 lead disaster DSC would be best positioned to manage these requirements . " From a USNORTHCOM perspective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs . . . . The National Guard does not have a lot of capacity for an event like that , " said Brigadier General Matthew J. Dzialo , Assistant Adjutant General for Air , Rhode Island National Guard . 11 <p> FEMA and a supporting Title 10 lead disaster DSC should aim to provide the appropriate amount of assistance without infringing on state sovereignty to the highest degree possible . Even within a two-state response such as Hurricane Sandy , there are still massive layers of politics and individual agendas that can detract from what is best for the entire country and all of its civilians . Following Hurricane Sandy , there was constant oversight for a " top-down " approach from the President , the Secretary of Defense , USNORTHCOM , and FEMA to inject efforts from the federal level . <p> On a few occasions , prior to governor consent , Title 10 forces entered into the New York State territory and were kindly asked to depart until the requirement for their assistance eventually emerged . Some state National Guard leaders elected not to call in federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  want to call in Title 10 . . . think of strategic implications for the Guard . . . . The headline the next day would read that the Guard failed and needed the Active Component to bail it out , " said Brigadier General Mike Swezey. 12 Perspectives and opinions like these are usually deeply rooted in state politics , and come from a place of overwhelming desire for the state to prove its capability and mettle to the nation at large . <p> When DSC C2 Makes Sense <p> Throughout a DSC response , sovereign state governments would begin to rightfully compromise a sensible amount of independence during possible situations such as the New Madrid fault line , influenza pandemic , weapons of mass destruction , and large-scale cascading complex disasters . A DSC C2 construct is an excellent structure to introduce Title 10 forces into DSCA response . Sovereignty would typically not have to be compromised until four or more states became involved in a struggle for resources . In this situation , a top-down response coupled with state and local effort would be appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSC ( without a degree of " federalization " via a Title 10 Lead Disaster DSC ) would make a reasonable C2 structure choice during a complex catastrophe , and that the United States could respond with a coordinated Title 10/32 unity of effort while maintaining complete state sovereignty within that C2 construct . If the New Madrid fault line complex catastrophe were considered , the option of standing up DSCs between 8 to 11 or more states , all reporting through their governors , is surely a C2 option . 13 <p> Should the fault line awaken , Alabama , Arkansas , Illinois , Indiana , Kansas , Kentucky , Mississippi , Missouri , Oklahoma , Texas , and Tennessee would be forecasted to experience significant damage . Eight to 11 or more states would next receive Title 10 deputies on their staffs to independently coordinate the inflow of federal assistance from an ever-growing array of support via a dozen of the previously mentioned federal departments and bureaus . There would be no lead disaster DSC or federally appointed authority to make the tough call when multiple states required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal efforts would be managed as a new variable . If local first responders , state emergency agencies , and National Guards were in place and ready within these 11 state governments , there would be no reason why the authorized DSCs and these governors should not be able to continue providing the same level of response that was displayed during Hurricane Sandy with two DSCs and moderate Title 10 external support . <p> Local and state first responders , fire , paramedics , police , and public-works professionals across the affected states would provide in-zone immediate supportassuming their efforts or the infrastructure were not degradedand seamlessly integrate with state Guard and Title 10 inserted forces . Prearranged and ready-to-be-used EMACs would still be in place and could be acted on , assuming there were not shortfalls and competition for similarly scarce or low-density resources . Each state could erect its own mortuary affairs , medical triage system , and displaced civilian evacuation process and have geographically independent refuge locations while relying on transportation assets and previously present resources organic to the stateprovided that infrastructure can support this . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DSC following Hurricane Sandy . History will look back and affirm the importance of the introduction of an option such as DSC for the optimum C2 for both the President of the United States and governors during DSCA response to domestic crisis . 14 The strain placed on the New York and New Jersey DSCs ( without an appointed lead disaster DSC ) illuminate a fraction of what DSC C2 would experience during an earthquake along the New Madrid fault line . Without additional recommended federal processes , DSC should be reserved for application during normal catastrophes , or our nation will take on additional burdens when attempting to make DSC work where it is less than ideal . National-level exercises must continue to test and seek to uncover seams and areas of weaknesses within this newly implemented C2 mechanism . <p> The President and the Secretary of Defense are well within their authority to employ the full and necessary response mechanisms of the federal government and military during complex catastrophe DSCA . The fringe seams of DSCA tiered-response escalation , mobilization , and level of requisite support as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest scrutiny and should be thoroughly analyzed and consciously war-gamed before the selection of C2 . <p> A list of recommendations for additive DSC C2 measures during complex disasters is as follows : <p> Appoint a Title 10 " Lead Disaster " DSC . <p> Appoint a FEMA director to prioritize resources and coordinate with the Joint Task Force ( JTF ) and state emergency-management agencies . <p> Establish a nuclear or pandemic influenza response task force for coordination with the DSC JTF as required . <p> Nullify and suspend pre-existing state EMACs and federalize movement and reassignment of state-to-state commodities as required . <p> As a last resort , consider the partial or full federalization of any state National Guard that suffers from the massive degradation of its response capacity . <p> The sobering reality is that during a large domestic complex catastrophe , the benefits that a DSC C2 can provide to a governor during normal catastrophes are rapidly overwhelmed . DSC advantages are soon forfeited unless a gradation of " federalization " occurs . State politics and the interrelationships of National Guard and the state capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they can be overruled by the President if it should aid in preventing loss of life or destruction to infrastructure . <p> We live in a post-Katrina environment and expect a higher level of response , regardless of political harmony or the sourcing origin of authority attached to a responding military capability . Disaster responders do not have a patch or uniform insignia that distinguishes between state , active-duty , Title 32 , or Title 10 forces . American citizens are not concerned with who helps their families when crisis hitsjust that someone capable will be there to lend a hand , and quickly . <p> 14 .

When he set out on it , however , Colvocoresses was already well along in his own life 's eventful odysseya 56-year journey that would end in tragedy . <p> George Musalas Colvocoresses was born in 1816 on the Aegean island of Chinos . His family suffered great personal and financial loss during the Greek War of Independence when in 1822 Turkish soldiers massacred some 30,000 inhabitants of the island . Colvocoresses later wrote that he was taken captive by a " fiend who called himself my master .

A former acting superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy , Partridge had left the Army and founded the American Literary , Scientific and Military Academy ( present-day Norwich University ) , located in Vermont .

While in the Mediterranean , he served on board the frigate USS United States and in his spare time visited relatives , including his parents , who had returned to Chinos . Shortly after completing his Norfolk Naval School studies and earning his passed midshipman 's warrant in 1837 , Colvocoresses was assigned to the U.S. Exploring Expedition . <p> Since the 1820s various Americans had promoted the idea of an expedition to explore and chart the Pacific Ocean and South Seas to advance U.S. commercial interests and scientific knowledge . Newspaperman , orator , and adventurer Jeremiah N. Reynolds was the most persistent and persuasive . In 1836 he delivered a long address on the subject to Congress .

The other vessels were the sloop-of-war Peacock , the 88-foot brigantine Porpoise , the 109-foot storeship Relief , and the schooners Sea Gull and Flying Fish . The expedition 's 12-man scientific corps included ethnologist Charles Pickering , ornithologist-artist Titian Peale , and botanist William Brackenridge . Finally , on the afternoon of 18 August 1838 , the squadron set out from Hampton Roads . <p> From his vantage point on board the Porpoise , Midshipman Colvocoresses described the departure : " At 3 o'clock . . . the Vincennes made the signal . . . and we weighed anchor in company with the rest of the squadron . . . .

From there , with Midshipman Colvocoresses on board the Vincennes , the expedition again sailed for Antarctica ; its goal was to make the first official sighting of the mysterious frozen continent . <p> On 3 February 1840 , amid the icebergs , the ships again encountered severe weather . On the 7th , however , the weather cleared . According to Colvocoresses , " The Antarctic Continent was several times in sight in the course of the day , and a point of it . . . was named Cape Carr after the first-lieutenant of this ship . " Seven days later , the ships were threading their way between masses of ice : " We were compelled to put the helm up and wear ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet wide . . . at 1 p.m. we effected a landing on an iceberg and found embedded in it sand , gravel and rocks , pieces of a new continent . " <p> After mapping hundreds of miles of the continent 's coast , the expedition later arrived in the " Fejee " Islands , where Lieutenant Joseph A. Underwood and Midshipman Wilkes Henry , both from the Porpoise , were murdered by natives on Malolo . The Porpoise ' s commander , Captain Cadwallader Ringgold , was put in charge of a punitive force , which killed some 80 Fijians . <p> By October 1840 , the expedition had reached the Sandwich ( present-day Hawaiian ) Islands , and on the 27th Colvocoresses took to horseback for a chance to view Oahu 's fabulous Nuuanu Pali cliff and mountain pass . According to his description : <p> After a ride of about four miles . . . you enter a grove of hibiscus and other tropical trees . In a few minutes you come again into open space , and . . . the Pali suddenly bursts upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either hand immense masses of volcanic rock rise to the perpendicular height of between six and seven hundred feet ; while looking down beneath the fearful precipice , you behold in one view plantations , trees , villages , meadows filled with cattle grazing , the town of Honolulu , with its harbor and shipping , and the blue bosom of the Pacific . <p> After leaving the Sandwiches , by late April 1841 the Vincennes , with Colvocoresses on board , and the Porpoise were approaching the North American continent . On the 28th , the ships reached the mouth of the Columbia River , " but , as the weather was boisterous and the sea broke with great violence on the bar , we did not deem it prudent to enter the river . " The wind picked up early the next morning , and the ships headed northward , for Puget Sound . <p> During the voyage , as Colvocoresses recalled , they very nearly escaped disaster : <p> About 10 A.M. on the 30th , the " look-outs " reported " breakers a-head " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought by the wind . After standing a few minutes on this course the weather cleared , and we discovered Destruction Rocks Point Grenville Rocks not more than a half mile off . . . . It was in fact a very narrow escape from shipwreck , and certain destruction . <p> From July to August 1841 , Colvocoresses acted as assistant to Lieutenant Henry Eld during an expedition that explored the country between the Nisqually River , in west-central Washington , and Grays Harbor , just north of the mouth of the Columbia River . It then surveyed the harbor in boats . During the journey , a " Chief Squaw " of the Sachal Indian tribe made a deep impression on the young officer . He described her as " a woman of great energy of character who exercises greater authority over those around her than any man chief I have met since I have been in the country . " <p> Not long after completing the trip , Colvocoresses joined a second Ex . Ex. overland expedition . Led by Lieutenant George Emmons , its members included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , geologist Dwight Dana , and botanist William Rich . On 7 September the party set out southward , and over the next weeks fought off insects and illness while occasionally spotting grizzlies and Indians . <p> On the 29th the group reached a mountain range that separated Oregon Territory from Mexico 's Alta California . According to Colvocoresses : " The ascent was steep and tedious and every moment we expected to be attacked by hostile Indians . . . . On arriving at the summit of the range , we obtained a view which more than repaid us for our trouble . The Shaste Shasta Mountains with their snowy peaks , could be seen some fifty miles to the southward , swelling and soaring to the skies . " <p> The party forded the Sacramento River on 12 October and five days later arrived at New Helvatia , home of Captain John Sutter , on whose property gold would be discovered in January 1848 . " We were most hospitably and kindly received by him , " Colvocoresses wrote . He had " an easy , polite demeanor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From there , the midshipman and four other members of the party set out by boat for San Francisco Bay , arriving on the 19th . Continuing overland , the others arrived five days later . <p> On 25 October Colvocoresses was assigned to the Oregon , a brig Wilkes had purchased to replace the Peacock after she grounded on a Columbia River bar and was lost . The expedition then set out for home by sailing westward , to Hawaii and then Singapore , across the Indian Ocean , and around the Cape of Good Hope . After a stop at St. Helena , the ships crossed the Atlantic . George Colvocoresses ended his book with the words , " Leaving Rio Janeiro , we shaped our course for New York , where we arrived on the 3d of July , 1842 , after having been absent from home and friends three years and eleven months . " <p> The United States Exploring Expedition had logged more than 87,000 miles , surveyed 280 islands , and generated 180 charts . Four hundred zoological specimens were collected and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had new names , among them : Colvocoresses Island in the Fijis ; Colvocoresses Passage , Vashon Island , Puget Sound ; and Colvocoresses Bay , Antarctica . <p> The voyager next enjoyed a much-deserved leave . Promoted to lieutenant in 1845 , Colvocoresses married Eliza Halsey in May 1846 . The couple would have four children , one of whom , George Partridge Colvocoresses , would retire from the Navy as a rear admiral . After cruises to the Mediterranean , the South Atlantic , and Africa , the lieutenant was assigned to the USS Levant in 1855 . He returned to the Pacific in the sloop and battled Chinese along the Pearl River after they fired on the ship . <p> In 1861 , the year the Civil War erupted , Colvocoresses was promoted to commander and given command of the converted storeship USS Supply , which was part of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron . Although outfitted with only four cannon , the ship nevertheless was able to capture a Confederate blockade runner , the Stephen Harte , off the Florida coast in January 1862 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value was the healthy sum of $19,000 . <p> The next year , while in command of the sloop-of-war Saratoga , Colvocoresses led a shore raid that snared a group of Georgians who had gathered to organize themselves into a Confederate military unit . In his report to Rear Admiral John A. B. Dahlgren , the commander wrote : " We took 26 prisoners , 22 horses and buggies , destroyed 2 bridges and burned a large encampment . . . all in broad daylight , 15 miles from our boats , without losing a single life . " <p> On the strength of these and other activities , the commander had a justifiable expectation of a more important command , but it was not to be . Detached from the Saratoga , Colvocoresses was placed in command of the St. Mary 's , an old third-rate vessel , in which he cruised off the coasts of Chile and Peru through November 1865 . Worse was to come . <p> In 1867 he was made captain and summarily retired . His son , later-Admiral Colvocoresses , would write that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father never engaged in self-promotion , was too open in stating his strongly held political beliefs , and was not born in America . " My father had always been a democrat , " the admiral was quoted as stating , " and although perfectly loyal to the government , he did not hesitate to freely express his opinion about persons and parties . " <p> George M. Colvocoresses lived the rest of his life quietly with his family in Litchfield , Connecticut . His first wife had died in 1862 , and the next year he married Adeline Swasey , the younger sister of Captain Alden Partridge 's wife . But less than ten years later , tragedy struck . <p> At 2300 on 3 June 1872 , a policeman responding to the sound of a gunshot found Colvocoresses dead near the Bridgeport , Connecticut , docks . The captain had planned to catch a boat from there to New York that night . The sheath of the sword cane he always carried lay shattered next to his body , the sword itself bent in half , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the following day ripped open , its contents , $80,000 in bearer bonds , missing . A coroner 's jury rendered a verdict of " death by pistol or gunshot wound in the lower left chest by some person or persons unknown . " <p> And so George Musalas Colvocoresses ' odyssey ended in tragic irony . After surviving a massacre , perilous seas , and battle , he met his death near home at the hands of an unknown killer .

Miller <p> The West has been frustrated since 2012 over Russias decision to violate the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces ( INF ) Treaty by testing a new ground-launched cruise missile . The treaty , which eliminated nearly 2,700 missiles on both sides , prohibits production or flight test of any such missiles with a range between 500 and 5,500 kilometers . According to public reports , the Russians now have gone beyond testing and deployed the missile , further violating the treaty . <p> As it should have , the Obama administration used diplomacy first in an attempt to persuade Russia to abide by its obligations . This approach was met with denials and ridiculous counter-accusations , including Russian assertions that U.S. missile defensesdeployed in Romania in 2015 and to be deployed in Poland in 2018intended to defend against Iranian missiles are a violation of the treaty . <p> It is now time to stop scolding and up the ante . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face no serious threat from west , east , or southno nation on the planet wants to attack Russia . While diplomacy should not be abandoned , it will have to be backed by the only type of power Russia really understands : principled strength . In fact , the treaty itself originated from the use of such power : President Ronald Reagan deployed nuclear-tipped ground-launched cruise missiles and Pershing II ballistic missiles to Europe in response to a previous Russian deployment . This U.S. deployment laid the groundwork for successful negotiation of the INF Treaty . <p> An especially elegant use of such power would avoid a tit-for-tat violation of or , worse , a withdrawal from the treaty . Rather , Russia should feel the pinch from a capability that lies well within international agreements ( and a capability Russia itself possesses ) : a sea-based nuclear-armed cruise missile . This would require restoration of the Navys nuclear capability on Tomahawk cruise missiles in what was known as TLAM-NsTomahawk land-attack missile-nuclear . <p> Bringing back the TLAM-N into the U.S. arsenal would not violate any treaty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of tactical nuclear weapons that can be delivered from land , air , and sea . <p> The U.S. TLAM-N capability carries a number of inherent advantages : <p> It would show Russia that its violation of the INF Treaty is a mistake that has costs and needs to be corrected , even if it does so without actually admitting the violation , as long as the resolution is verifiable . For those who want to preserve the INF Treaty and the New START Treaty ( as the United States does ) , demonstrating to Russia that there are consequences to cheating on existing treaties is essential . <p> While NATO would retain its **26;293;TOOLONG and/or nuclear-armedaircraft ( DCA ) capability to maintain the alliances " skin in the game , " deployment of TLAM-N would not require any action by or concurrence from our allies , who would be politically skittish over any new ground-based deployment . <p> The capability is essentially invulnerable , as the missiles likely would be placed only on board submarines . Any attack submarine can carry these missiles ; the Ohio -class guided-missile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Payload Module Virginia -class follow-on boats . <p> It would not be overly costly to reintroduce this capability . The required warhead could leverage the B-61 life-extension program and/or the planned warhead for the long-range standoff ( LRSO ) system . New missiles would need to be modified to carry the warhead , and the Navy would need to recertify boats assigned to carry these missiles . But these are modifications to existing programs ; no new weapon would need to be dragged through the acquisition system . <p> Such a capability not only would provide a credible and survivable option for extended deterrence in Europe , but also would bolster deterrence and assurance in the Pacific at a time when North Korea is growing its nuclear capability . <p> Numbers matter . Deploying TLAM-Ns on SSNs would be a hedge against the potential vulnerability of future ballistic missile submarines ( SSBNs ) by increasing by several times the numbers of undersea platforms available for deterrence . <p> The latest variants of the Tomahawk missile incorporate major generational advancements . Accuracy and the survivability against advanced air defenses , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved . <p> Some would argue that that the United States has so much conventional superiority over Russia that it does not need these weapons . That is a dangerous assumption . In any case , conventional weapons mean much less to Moscow than nuclear capabilities . If anything , TLAM-N would provide NATO with a far more credible rung on an escalation ladder that currently is binary between conventional weapons and all-out nuclear war . <p> It may seem counterintuitive that an increase in U.S. nuclear weapons capability would be required to make progress toward the ultimate goal of reducing nations reliance on nuclear weapons for security purposes . But both Russia and North Korea are very intentionally expanding their nuclear abilities to threaten U.S. allies ; it is imperative that the United States take the steps necessary to sustain effective nuclear deterrence of nuclear threats . A failure to bolster nuclear deterrence at best does nothing for nonproliferation , and at worst irresponsibly exposes our allies in Europe and Northeast Asia to greater risks of a preemptive attack or coercion . <p> To bolster nuclear deterrence and assurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious consequences to cheating on treaties , the now-ongoing Nuclear Posture Review should bring back the TLAM-N . <p> Admiral Winnefeld is a Distinguished Professor of International Affairs at Georgia Techs Sam Nunn School and a Senior Fellow at Harvards Belfer Center .
