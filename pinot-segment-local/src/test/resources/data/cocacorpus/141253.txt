There are a number of factors that you 'll have to take into consideration before you 're ready to hitch a trailer up to your vehicle , and the information we 've provided in this article will help you make the best selection when it comes to choosing the appropriate equipment to match your towing needs . <p> Before you can pick out a trailer hitch , however , you need to realize that the hitch alone will not give you the ability to tow you 'll need some additional towing components , including a trailer ball and ball mount , wiring , and safety chains . <p> Here are some terms you 'll want to be familiar with in order to select the appropriate hitch for your towing needs . <h> Common terms <h> Gross Combination Weight Rating ( GCWR ) <p> Set forth by the tow vehicles manufacturer , this is the maximum weight limit allowed for towing for the combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cargo , safety equipment , passengers , and fuel . <p> You can find this information in your tow vehicles owners manual . <h> Gross Trailer Weight ( GTW ) <p> This is the actual weight of the fully loaded trailer , including the weight of all its cargo , fluids including fuel , and safety equipment such as straps , cargo nets , and wheel chocks . <p> The best way to determine GTW is by weighing your fully loaded trailer on a truck scale , but if that is not an option , you can add up the weights of the cargo , fluids , and safety equipment with the weight of the trailer itself ( which you can find in the trailers owners manual ) . When in doubt , it is safest to round this figure up . <h> Hitch Class <p> Hitches are classified by their maximum weight capacity rating and receiver opening size . Classes range from I ( lowest weight capacity and smallest opening size ) to V ( highest weight capacity and largest opening size ) , and each class has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . <p> If you do n't  know what class of hitch you have installed on your vehicle , you can check the label on the hitch or the owners manual . <h> Tongue Weight <p> This is the amount of the trailers weight that is exerted downward onto the hitch of the tow vehicle by the tongue of the trailer . In general , tongue weight should not be more than 10% of the GTW . <p> If you tow often , it may be beneficial to purchase a specialized scale to measure tongue weight . Many trailer dealers offer such scales . If you do not tow often , your trailer dealer may be willing to measure your tongue weight for you . <p> For trailers with a tongue weight of less than 300 lbs , you can measure the tongue weight with a common bathroom scale . You 'll need to set it up as it is in the diagram below . <p> When using this setup to measure your trailer 's tongue weight , triple the number that the scale gives you .

Its important to remember that the lowest rated towing component determines the maximum weight capacity that you can safely tow . Many vehicle manufacturers use the term Towing Package to refer to optional packages that include additional features such as suspension , cooling system , and software upgrades . <h> Hitch Adapter <p> These fit into the receiver tube of your hitch and convert it from a 1-1/4 " x 1-1/4 " opening to a 2 " x 2 " opening , or vice versa .

Keep in mind , using a trailer hitch extender may reduce the overall capacity of your towing system . <h> Trailer Ball <p> This is the ball-shaped piece of equipment onto which the trailer coupler mounts and locks in place . These are attached to the ball mount , and come in a variety of sizes , including 1-7/8 " , 2 " , 2-5/16 " , and 3 " ( in some rare cases ) . These are also commonly referred to as hitch balls or coupler balls . <h> Coupler <p> This is the front end of a trailer tongue that mounts and locks on top of the hitch ball . It is designed to swivel around the ball , allowing a trailer to make turns more easily . <h> Hitch Pin <h> Trailer Wiring <p> By law , trailer lights must be connected to your tow vehicle , and this requires trailer wiring harnesses .

It distributes weight evenly between the rear and front wheels of the tow vehicle by attaching spring bars to the vehicles frame . <h> Sway Control <p> Think of a sway control as a brake pad or shock absorber that resists trailer and tongue sway ( usually caused by wind gusts or passing vehicles ) and keeps both the tow vehicle and trailer stable . <h> Trailer Hitch Classes and Applications <p> Hitches are classified by their maximum weight capacity rating and receiver opening size . Classes range from I ( lowest weight capacity and smallest opening size ) to V ( highest weight capacity and largest opening size ) , and each class has its own unique capacities and applications . <h> Class I <p> These light-duty hitch receivers are typically installed on passenger cars and smaller crossover SUVs .

Jack Stands : Which are Best for Auto Service <p> If you 're the DIY kind of auto owner who enjoys performing your own oil changes and routine maintenance , its inevitable that at some point in time , you 're going to have to hoist your vehicle off the ground to get a better look at things underneath . And , unless you 've got your own in-garage hydraulic system , the lift you 're likely going to be looking at is going to come from ramps or a jack and jack stand . <p> Like every subject in the world of automotive care , there are two sides to the debate between ramps and jack stands : some prefer one option , while others swear by the opposite . So , which is truly better for helping you perform those oil changes and other aspects of routine maintenance : ramps or jack stands ? <h> Car Ramps <p> Everyone knows how to use a ramp and such familiarity with these simple machines is usually what draws people to them when it comes to auto maintenancenot to mention how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of ramps , drive up the incline , pop the parking brake on , set down the appropriate wheel chocks , and you 're good to start working . There 's not much else to them ! <p> Many people also swear by ramps for the safety factorauto ramps are generally thought to be more stable than jack stands and there 's less of a chance for error with ramps because they offer a larger surface area for support , both in adding traction to the ground ( on applicable surfaces ) and to supporting the wheels of the vehicle itself . <p> Finally , one of the biggest advantages that ramps have over jack stands is their affordability . Getting a good set of ramps for your vehicle comes with a marginal cost compared to the cost of a good jack and set of jack stands . <p> The downfall of ramps ? Well , if positioned on a surface that does n't  offer a whole lot of traction , they can slide while you 're trying to drive onto them . Also , having to move the vehicle backwards or forwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an option in cramped quarters . Other than that , ramps are tremendously safe and easy to use ! <h> Jack Stands <p> Jack stands are a bit more complicated to use when compared to ramps , but provided you know where your vehicle 's lift points are , they only require a few more steps . To get these supports in place you 'll need to crank the parking brake on your vehicle , chock the wheels that will remain on the ground , jack the car up with a properly rated floor jack , place the jack stands under the appropriate lift points , and slowly lower the jack down until the vehicle is supported by the jack stands themselves . <p> So , why might someone prefer using jack stands to ramps when working on their vehicle ? Well , for one , you do n't  have to move your vehicle at all to hoist it up , whereas with a ramp , you have to either back up to allow for ramp placement or drive forward onto ramps to gain lift . <p> Second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work you 're doing , a jack stand can actually invite better mobility into your work environment , such as allowing you to remove wheels while the vehicle is aloft . This is definitely important when you 're working on something like brakes , where ramps simply would n't be a solution . <p> The drawback of jack stands ? They require absolute precision when being set in place and have a much smaller margin of error associated with them . If your jack stands are not properly supporting the weight of your vehicle or are not positioned in an area that 's completely secure , one accidental bump into the vehicle could send it crashing down . Jack stands are n't  a tool for beginners ! <h> The Verdict <p> If you could n't tell by now , Discount Ramps thoroughly supports the use of ramps when it comes to DIY automotive care .

@@2616063 <h> How to Properly Secure a Skateboard Ramp <p> For any skateboard ramp , it is highly recommended that you fasten and secure the ramp to a solid surface to prevent the ramp from sliding , kicking out , or moving in any such way that may cause injuries to the user . Below are three of the best ways to secure a skateboard ramp to a solid surface such as asphalt or concrete , as well as tips to secure a skateboard ramp for use with snowboarding or sand-boarding . <h> Securing Skateboard Ramps with Asphalt Anchor Screws <p> Each DiscountRamps.com brand skateboard ramp will be packaged with a set of asphalt anchor screws and washers to fix the ramp in place through the pre-drilled mounting points at the corners of the ramp . Simply drill the anchor screw into any asphalt for a firm grip in seconds . <p> Asphalt Anchor Screws are designed only for asphalt and will not work with concrete . To fix the ramps to a concrete surface , it is recommended to pre-drill pilot holes and use proper concrete anchor screws from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use , depending on the angles and force applied to the skateboard ramps , it may be necessary to re-anchor the ramps into new holes . Since asphalt is a softer surface than concrete , the screws can pull up with the right amount of force , especially on a very warm day . <h> Securing Skateboard Ramps with Sandbags <p> When using anchor screws is n't a viable option , we recommend using heavy sandbags to keep the ramps from sliding during jumps . Simply place one or two sandbags behind the ramp in a location that will not affect the initial launch , trick , or landing . <h> Securing Skateboard Ramps with Plywood <p> Another way to keep skateboard ramps in place is to strategically position plywood at the rear anchor area of the ramp . Plywood with a larger surface area will help weigh the ramp down and provide more ground friction to prevent the ramp from sliding . Adding plywood to the rear of a ramp may also create a smoother transition from the ground to ramp and elevate the launch angle slightly . <h> Securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ramps like the Skate Ramp and Rail Kit include an attached grind rail . You must firmly secure the grind rail support to the surface as well as the ramp . This requires drilling into the foot plate to create holes for mounting . If drilling is not an option due to the surface , please use sandbags to help hold the grind rail in place . <h> Securing Skateboard Ramps for Snowboarding Jumps <p> To use a skateboard ramp for use when snowboarding , dig the ramp into the snow then cover and pack snow around and on the ramp if the snow is dense enough . Groom the surface for smooth launches between jumps . Survey the area for enough room to safely jump and land . <h> Securing Skateboard Ramps for Sand-boarding Jumps <p> Dig the ramp into the sand and then cover the ramp in sand .

If you 're a pickup truck owner , all it takes are the right ramps and a little know-how to get you and your snowmobile on the road this winter . <h> Picking the right ramps <p> Unlike the ramps you might use to load dirt bikes or ATVs into your truck , the ramps required for snowmobiles are slightly different : they need to support both the track and the skis . What this means is that the ramp you 're using must provide enough grip for the track to propel the snowmobile up the incline , while also offering ski guides for the skis to slide up . <p> Discount Ramps takes the guesswork out of loading a wide variety of snowmobile makes and models by providing a full inventory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for added safety , such as ramp extension pieces : <p> Snowmobile ramp extension pieces are highly recommended when loading a snowmobile because they provide a sturdy foundation for the track to grip from the start , before the skis hit the ramp .

DiscountRamps.com 's ramps are not recommended for use with studded tracks . <p> Ready to load your snowmobile ? If so , approach your ramp like you would a small hill , being careful not to overpower your approach and send your snowmobile flying into the bed of your pickup !

Weight Capacity <p> Add together the following numbers to calculate the total , overall weight of your current setup : weight of the quad itself ( Check ATV owners manual ) , fuel weight ( fuel tank capacity in gallons x 8.5 lbs ) , weight of all accessories &amp; attachments ( check individual manuals for each item ) , drivers weight , and load / cargo weight . Four-wheeler ramps are designed for equally distributed weight across four tires / two axles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since it is , in fact , very likely that the weight on one axle is greater than on the other . As a matter of safety , it is crucial to NEVER under any circumstances , exceed the weight capacity of the ramps . It is recommended that you use an ATV ramp system with a weight capacity that well exceeds your total overall weight , especially if there is a possibility you might upgrade to a larger , heavier ATV in the future . <h> 2 . Ramp style <h> 3 . Ramp width <p> Selecting ramps that are wide enough for your 4+4 will not only make loading safer , it will also make the process easier and quicker . For dual runner-style ramps , measure the widest part of your ATVs tire width . Even though most ramps have a slight guardrail to keep your ATV tire on track , selecting a 4+4 loading ramp that is somewhat wider than the tire width measurement is recommended . For platform-style trifold and bifold ATV ramps , measure the width of the ATV itself at its widest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall ramp width you need . <h> 4 . Loading height / Ramp length <p> Using the appropriate length of ramp is critical to loading and unloading your quad safely . Even though most ATVs have a wheelbase / ground clearance ratio capable of climbing very steep inclines , you still want to keep the angle of your ramps low enough to prevent the machine from tipping . <h> How to Find the Right Length for your ATV Ramps <p> To find a ramp that is long enough to safely load your ATV , you 'll need to know the following : <p> Wheelbase is the horizontal distance between the center of the front wheel and the center of the rear wheel . <p> Ground Clearance is the distance between the ground and the lowest component of the ATV other than the tires and wheels <p> Loading height , or rise , is the distance from the ground to the top-most point of the truck bed or trailer onto which the ATV will be loaded . Another less exact option is to simply place one end of a tape measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure out on an angle until you find a length that looks optimal . <p> The following equation will output the minimum safe length , in inches , of the ramp you should use to load your ATV : <p> Rise / ( Ground Clearance / ( Wheelbase * 0.5 ) ) = Ramp Length <p> For an example , let 's say we 're loading a 2016 Polaris Sportsman 450 H.O . into a pickup . According to Polaris , our ATV has a wheelbase of 50.5 " and a ground clearance of 10.5 " . Specs for tailgate height vary , but for this exercise our tailgate will be 28 " off of the ground ( our rise ) . The equation would look like this : <p> 28 / ( 10.5 / ( 50.5 * 0.5 ) ) = 66.7 " <p> We can divide our answer by 12 to get 5.6 ' . This means that a 6 ' long ATV ramp will fit our needs quite well . <h> Do n't  Skip Safety Precautions <p> A majority of the considerations throughout this purchase process are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle as safe as possible . That goes for weight capacities , ramp widths and lengths , as well as operating the ATV with care . Always remember to wear a helmet and other necessary protective gear when operating a four-wheeler , which includes the loading and unloading process . By doing some of the research and measuring up front , you can be sure to find the perfect ATV ramp system for your needs . Happy trails !

@@2616077 <h> How to Use Wheel Chocks <p> Wheel chocks are an important piece of equipment for anyone who works with heavy vehicles . Safely chocking parked trucks , equipment , and trailers can prevent thousands of dollars in damages , injuries , and fatalities from occurring . Once you have selected the right type of wheel chock for your vehicle , it is important to know how to correctly place the chocks ; this will depend on the vehicle you want to secure , and where it is parked . Here are a few examples : <p> Facing downward on a slope : There are several ways to secure vehicles that are parked on a downhill grade : <p> For payloads over 240-tons , four chocks are requiredone for the face of each outer wheel on the downslope side . <p> For payloads up to 240-tons , only two chocks are required , placed on the downhill faces of the two front tires . <p> For articulated vehicles , two chocks should be placed on the downhill face of each tire on the central axle . <p> For lower payload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front tires will be sufficient . <p> Facing upward on a slope : When vehicles are parked on an uphill grade , the placement of chocks differs , while the number of chocks used tends to stay the same : <p> For payloads exceeding 240-tons , a chock should be placed on all of the rear tires , which generally amounts to four chocks . <p> For payloads up to 240-tons , chocks should be applied to the outermost rear tiresthis generally only requires two chocks . <p> For articulated vehicles , two chocks should be applied to the rearmost axles tires . <p> For lower payload vehicles , a chock for each of the rear tires should be sufficient to keep the vehicle in place and secure . <p> Parked on level ground : When parked on level ground , it generally only takes two chocks to secure a vehicle , regardless of size . The chocks should be placed on both sides of the drivers side wheel to prevent any rocking motion that might send the vehicle in one direction or another . <p> Chocking a trailer : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles , since the axle structure of trailers is a bit different . For most trailers , two chocks should be sufficient on a flat surface , one facing inwards on the passenger tire and the other applied on the outer face of the drivers side tire . For trailers on slopes , chocking should occur on all four of the wheels . <p> Now , aside from just knowing where to place wheel chocks , its also important to understand how they 're placed : <p> Chocks should always be placed in the very center of the wheel , so as to proportion weight appropriately and stop a vehicle from moving . <p> Any wheel chocks that are damaged or not rated for the application should n't be utilized . <p> Chocks should be placed without any gaps between the chock and the tire , so as not to give the vehicle any room for momentum . <p> Finally , chocks should always be placed on solid ground , so that they can not be compromised by the surface under them . <p> Now that you understand how to safely use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into practice on the jobsite .

@@2616079 <h> No Tractor Needed : How to Plant a Food Plot with an ATV <p> Any hunter worth his salt knows that there 's more to hunting than just pointing a rifle and squeezing the trigger : it takes a fair amount of preparation before heading into the woods . What you do to prepare for open season can dictate what you 'll bring home at the end of it , which is why its important to always plan ahead and give yourself the best advantage possible . <p> One time-tested preparation tactic that many hunters love to employ is cultivating a food plot . Taking the time to plant and tend a food plot can attract deer in a big way , however its going to take some dedicated effort and some know-how to design your plot and keep it attractive to game . Thankfully , with an ATV , a few tools and some essential knowledge , you can get a simple plot up and running in just five steps : <h> Step 1 : picking the plot <p> Before you till any earth or plant any crops , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The average plot size is anywhere from 1/4 acre to 1/2 acreany smaller and deer will likely destroy your plot before it has a chance to develop ; any bigger and youre going to have a hard time tending and hunting it . <p> Be sure to pick a spot that 's near a wooded area , or , ideally , one that 's surrounded by woods or heavy brush . Deer prefer to frequent plots that are close to cover and will be less hesitant to venture into your plot if there 's denser bedding nearby . On this same note , try to find a plot that 's longer and skinnier , as opposed to squarethis will equate to both a better sightline and a more natural draw for deer preferring to stay under cover . <h> Step 2 : prepping your plot <p> Once you 've determined your plot location and dimensions , its time to get down to work prepping itbut , before any prep work can begin , you 'll need to test your soil to make sure its viable for what you need to grow . <p> Soil testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bases in the soil . You should be looking for pH levels in the 6-7 range , which are optimal growing soils . Testing can be done by taking soil samples from your plot to your local USDA office or agriculture supply storeyoull get the results in a few days and can take action from there . If your results are ideal , plant away ; if they 're low ( below 6 on the pH scale ) , you might have to mix crushed lime into your plot , to help raise the pH . You 'll get detailed instructions of what needs to be done with your soil sample results . <p> After you 've tested and made ready your soil , focus on the areas of the plot where you 'll actually be planting crops and other florathese spaces need to be cleared of any foliage , tilled and graded before anything can be planted . This is where you 're trusty ATV will be doing most of the heavy lifting for you . Use something like a disk harrow ATV attachment to really churn up the earth , followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shifting focus to the rest of your plot , you 're going to want to leave much of the natural growth aloneespecially along the edge of the plot or where the plot meets the tree line . To help blend your planted areas into the rest of the area , use your ATV to haul in things like brush and felled tree limbs to create coverage that will draw deer out from denser bedding areas . <h> Step 3 : planting your plot <p> After using your ATV to prep the planting areas of your plot , you 'll need to decide what you 're planting . Take a look at some of the most common options used by hunters to attract deer to a plot : <p> Deer corn : A section or two of deer corn will encourage deer to frequent your plot and , because of its size , corn can be planted further in towards the center of your plot , drawing out game further from thicker brush . <p> Perennials : Alfalfa and clovers are popular perennials that are frequently big draw for deer and , thanks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Annuals : Turnips , kale and beets planted during the latter summer months and wheat and oats planting during the early fall are bound to keep deer frequenting your plot . <p> Along with any of the above options , more enthusiastic hunters may plant a fruit tree or two in their plot , to draw out those very wary bucks that might not take a chance on smaller feed . <p> Once you 've decided on what you 're going to use as your plots staple , you 'll have to get it planted properly . To make quick work of things , you 'll want to look to your ATV once again . While push spreaders are always an option , ATV spreaders are great for planting and can dramatically cut down the time you 'll spend seeding . And , after spreading , you can simply swap ATV attachments to run a drag harrow or cultipacker over the field to bury the seed . <p> Finally , if your plot is looking a little sparse , try to plant some taller grasses or shrubs around , to incite a more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that denser vegetation can provide . <h> Step 4 : tending your plot <p> Tending your plot comes down to making sure all of your plantings get what they need to thrive and that the natural image you 've worked hard to build is maintained . Hop on your ATV and truck in bags of fertilizer , brush clippings any anything else that will lend itself to your plot ! Also , be sure to weed regularly to ensure healthy crop growth and take the time to eliminate any pests that may devastate your yield . <h> Step 5 : hunting your plot ! <p> After the hard work of prepping and planting your plot and a month or two of tending it , you should have a very respectable area that 's appealing to deer and easy to hunt ! Be sure to set up both tree stands and ground blinds in optimal viewing areas and make adjustments to your plot where you see fitsuch as using your ATV to haul in more " junk " fixtures to create perceived cover for deer . <p> With the right maintenance and tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , to make it a staple in your preparedness for hunting season .

@@2616081 <h> How Much Weight Can My Truck 's Tailgate Cables Support ? <p> If you 've ever used your pickup to haul a heavy vehicle like a motorcycle or ATV , you 've likely had concerns about how much your pickup truck 's tailgate can handle . Mark , a member of the Discount Ramps sales team , researched this issue to address your concerns : <p> Some common questions regarding tailgate capacity include : What is the tailgate weight rating of my pickup truck ? How much weight will the cables on my truck 's tailgate hold ? Will the tailgate cables hold my motorcycle or atv ? How do you find out what the weight capacity of tailgate cables is ? These are a few of the questions that the Discount Ramps sales team is frequently asked . While the tailgate ratings have nothing to do with how we rate our ramps , they do play an integral part in how our ramps load machines into pickup trucks . We felt it was a topic that needed some more research . <p> Tailgates are the door at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are lowered to allow for easier entry and exit of cargo , loads , and other equipment in and out of our trucks . The cables are the part that supports the tailgate whenever it is lowered . Tailgate cables level the tailgate to the trucks bed whenever it is lowered . This makes it easier for loads to be put in and taken out of your vehicle . For our purposes tailgates are a loading platform when loading atvs , motorcycles , and other equipment . For most consumers it is not practical to take their tailgate off when loading motorcycles , atv 's or other equipment . Therefore the tailgate becomes a bridge , from our ramp to the bed of their truck . Thus the question arises " How much weight will those cables on my tailgate hold ? " <p> After phone calls , emails , and research here is what we found out about how truck manufacturers rate their tailgate cables . They do n't . The most common answer we were told was that the cables are not rated for liability reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed to handle the weight of an atv , motorcycle , golf cart , etc . They may not be designed for that , but thousands of people transport their atvs , motorcycles , and lawnmowers in there pickups without giving a second thought to whether or not their tailgates will handle the weight or not . That is until they break . <p> In the fall of 2004 my buddy and I were sitting on the back of his tailgate after a day of hunting when one of the cables snapped from our weight of sitting on it . The day before we unloaded a four wheeler with a ramp . It would have been a bad deal if the cable had broken when we were loading or unloading our quad . Turns out GMC had a recall on the tailgate cables . The truck was brand new so we took it to the nearest GMC dealership and got the cables replaced . We asked what the cables were rated at , and mostly got blank stares .

Its important that before any actual loading is done you make sure your pickup is up to the task of hauling the golf cart .

@@2616092 <h> How to Choose the Correct Pet Ramp <p> It can be easy to forget that as our pets age , their physical capabilities decline over time just as they do for us . Dogs may develop hip or leg issues that make getting in and out of a vehicle difficult and painful . We do n't  expect an older parent or friend to get in and out of a car without some assistance , so why would we expect any different from an aging pet ? <p> Certain breeds of dogs , often the larger ones , tend to be more susceptible to conditions like hip dysplasia , and those problems are intensified in pets that are inactive and overweight . A portable dog ramp is a useful and affordable solution , particularly if you have trouble lifting your pet in and out of a vehicle yourself . <h> How Do I Know if My Pet Will Use a Dog Ramp ? <p> While it is hard to predict with complete certainty , here are a few considerations : <p> Start Early : It is ideal to teach your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or before it becomes a physical necessity . Constantly picking your pet up to load and unload may cause her to expect such behavior to last forever , making ramp-training more difficult as she ages . Training your puppy to use a ramp from an early age will not only save your back from lifting her in and out of the vehicle , it may also prevent your dog from developing long-term hip or leg injuries that can result from years of a repeated jumping and landing on hard surfaces . <p> Test Ramp : You may want to create a small test ramp to assess whether your dog will climb the dog ramp voluntarily . The test ramp should be short and stable . Start with a slight incline and gradually increase the angle each time your pet successfully navigates the ramp until it is at an angle similar to the dog ramp of your choice . Holding food or a treat in front of your dogs nose as you lead her slowly up the ramp may provide extra encouragement if necessary . <p> Practice Steps : If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make a test ramp , you can observe how your dog behaves on staircases that are not completely enclosed , which present similar conditions to what she would experience while using a vehicular dog ramp . Climbing up steps without hesitation is a good sign that your dog can climb a pet ramp . <h> What Type of Dog Ramp is Best for My Pet ? <p> There are several factors to keep in mind when searching for the best ramp for your dog . Here are the main aspects to consider : <p> Portability Style : Many pet ramps come in either a folding or telescope design . Folding style ramps fold in half for easy storage , assembly , and disassembly . Telescope style ramps slide into themselves and can be used at any length between the fully-closed and fully-open positions for versatility , are easy to deploy , and do not run the risk of pinching your fingers at a folding point . <p> Length and Width : Remember when selecting ramps for dogs that a longer ramp has a lower degree of incline ; this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind the different portability styles as mentioned above , you may want to purchase the longest ramp possible that will store in your vehicle . Recommended width generally depends on the size of your dog . Naturally , larger pets will require wider ramps . A wider ramp also provides additional room for your dog if she becomes distracted and gets off track while loading or unloading . <p> Material : Dog ramps are constructed of either composite or aluminum materials . Composite ramps are lighter and less likely to scratch your vehicles paint , but may crack if handled improperly . Aluminum ramps require minimal care , do n't  rust or break down if exposed to UV rays , and will not crack when bent . <p> Surface Style : The variety of ramp surface styles includes grit , rubber , and carpet . Grit surfaces provide the best traction , followed by rubber and carpet . Both grit and rubber surfaces require minimal cleaning , while carpeted surfaces tend to require more maintenance and may retain moisture , but are typically the most affordable . Select the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy . <p> Additional Features : Some ramps are available with extra features such as side rails , which may give your pet extra confidence when using it , handles , which help to make transportation much easier , and safety release straps which keep the ramps from opening unintentionally . <h> Browse Our Selection <p> Check out our selection of pet ramps to find the right one for your canine friend .

Before you put your sled into hibernation , you should follow a few simple steps that will keep it in great condition and ensure that it 's ready to hit the trails next year . <h> Clean and Wax the Outside <p> As you near the end of the season and the snow starts to melt , your snowmobile can pick up quite a bit of mud and slush on the trails . That , in addition to road salt , can cause build up on your sled , and it 's not something you want to leave until next winter . Avoid paint and part corrosion by using warm soapy water and a sponge to thoroughly clean your snowmobile , making sure you clean under the hood , and get into every nook and cranny .

Once everything is clean and dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your snowmobile parts , and make it easier to clean in the future . <h> Maintain the Fuel System <p> For fuel injected snowmobiles , fill your tank up and top it off with a fuel stabilizer , like Sta-bil or Seafoam , to prevent gasoline solvents from breaking down and corroding the carburetor . Run the engine for a few minutes to ensure that the stabilized fuel is spread throughout the engine . Storing your sled with a full tank will reduce the risk of condensation forming and water getting into your fuel system . For carbureted models , you 'll want to completely drain the fuel tank before storage . <h> Fog the Engine <p> Make sure you 're outside or in a well-ventilated area when fogging your engine .

With the engine running , spray the fogging oil into the throttle body . Continue this until thick white smoke comes out of the exhaust , or until the engine begins to sputter . <h> Drain the Carbs <p> Remove the carburetor float bowls and drain any excess fuel . This will keep the fuel from evaporating and creating a chalky residue that could block passageways , or damage the metals . <h> Grease Lube Points and Chassis <p> Prevent rust from forming by adding grease to any point with a grease fitting , making sure that the fitting is full . For exposed surfaces , such as suspension rails , exhaust , nuts , bolts , and the like , use WD-40 , or a similar lightweight oil . When you 're getting ready to ride again , wash everything down with a degreaser to remove any oily residue . <h> Remove the Battery and Belt <p> Take out the battery and put it in a safe , temperature controlled area , out of the sunlight .

@@2616096 <h> How to Choose a Motorcycle Ramp <p> Motorcycle ramps come in a variety of styles and lengths , from simple , single runners to full-width , powered systems . With so many options to choose from , it can be difficult to decide which type of ramp to purchase . <p> To help determine the best ramp for your situation , answer the following questions . <h> How large is the motorcycle you are loading ? <p> Single runner ramps are ideal for dirt bikes and smaller road bikes , because they can easily be pushed safely up the ramp . Never ride a bike up a single-runner ramp . <p> Larger bikes are easier with a full-width ramp , since the extra width allows you to ride up the ramp and put your feet down . to balance the bike , should the need arise . <p> Remember to ensure that the ramp being used is rated for your motorcycle 's weight . <h> What are your motorcycle 's measurements ? <p> The proper ramp length is determined by measuring the height of the loading surface , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance between the centers of the front and rear wheels . Ground clearance , is the distance from the ground to the lowest part of the bike , which must be measured with the bike upright and not on the kickstand . <p> These three measurements can then be entered into the Discount Ramps Ramp Calculator , which provides the minimum length of ramp needed to clear the loading surface without bottoming out . One thing to keep in mind is that this calculates the minimum length needed , so if you have a bike with a very high ground clearance such as a dirt bike , you technically only need a very short ramp to prevent bottoming out , but a short ramp will be very steep . Use a tape measure to simulate the suggested ramp length and check the angle for yourself.If it seems too steep , a longer ramp will have a gentler slope , which is generally easier to use . <h> Do you have someone to help load your motorcycle ? <p> Loading a motorcycle is typically a two-to-three-person job , but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a full-width ramp to ride the bike up , or an accessory like a trailer hitch step to use with your single runner . <p> A hitch step allows you to easily walk with the motorcycle into the truck bed while loading , avoiding the point where the bike is too high to reach comfortable and hold steady . THis method is only recommended for smaller motorcycles . For larger bikes , riding up a full-width ramp is the recommended loading method . <h> How often do you plan to use your motorcycle ramps ? <p> Frequent motorcycle haulers , should consider installing the Alumi-Loc system on their vehicle . <p> The Alumi-Loc securely holds the ramp to your loading surface , saving time by eliminating the need for attaching safety straps . Many of the ramps available on DiscountRamps.com are compatible with the Alumi-Loc system . <p> Full-width ramps and powered ramp systems can also save time for frequent loaders . A full-width ramp allows you to quickly and safely ride up the ramp , and a powered ramp system will automatically load the bike for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your motorcycle , and storage space is limited , consider a single runner style ramp which can fold in half to store conveniently next to your bike . <p> Knowing the size of your motorcycle , height of the loading surface , measurements of wheelbase and ground clearance , how much lep you 'll have during loading , and how often you plan on using your motorcycle ramps are the key ingredients to picking the perfect motorcycle ramp . Go to Discount Ramps to find the perfect motorcycle ramp for your situation . Our huge selection includes ramps in many popular styles with different traction surfaces , weight capacities , materials , storage capabilities , and other features to choose from .

If any part of the chair is n't properly fitted " something is too long , too short , or too narrow " it can quickly become uncomfortable to sit in over time . The Discount Ramps team of mobility professionals has put together a simple step by step guide of how to measure for a manual wheelchair to get the best , most comfortable fit . <h> Seat Width <p> Measure the widest point of the body , usually the hips or the thighs , while in a sitting position . Add an inch or two to accommodate for movement and bulky winter clothing . <h> Seat Depth <p> Measure from the back of the hips to the back of the knees . Then add or subtract approximately one or two inches to determine your ideal seat depth ( depending on how much leg overhang you prefer ) . <h> Back Height <p> Measure from the hips to the shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This measurement will provide an ideal seat back height for users who need the largest amount of back support . Users with better upper body control and posture can use wheelchairs with shorter seat backs . Keep in mind , the height of your seat back will directly affect the range of motion in your shoulders , which could impede your ability to push the wheelchair . <h> Seat Height <h> Front of Seat <p> Measured from the ground to the top front edge of the seat upholstery . Seat-to-floor height is determined by measuring from the back of the knee to the sole of the foot and adding about 1-2 " to accommodate footrest clearance . Proper seat-to-floor height depends upon the amount of ground clearance desired and how high you prefer to sit . <h> Rear of Seat <p> This is measured from the ground to the top rear edge of the seat . The rear seat-to-floor height will be equal to or less than the front seat-to-floor height , depending on if the wheelchair has a rearward seat angle slope . <h> Hanger Angle <p> Hangers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures the angle of the hangers using the floor as the vertex . A larger angle means your wheelchair will be able to turn around in less space . Measured from the seat frame , hanger adjustments are typically made to accommodate the user 's leg length , overall footprint size , and any knee flexibility . Typical hanger angles are 90 , 70 , and 60 degrees . <h> Wheel Camber <p> The wheel camber is applied to the rear wheels of your wheelchair , and is the angling that brings the top of the wheels closer to each other . A higher camber increases the wheelchair stability and agility , but will make the base wider . Typical wheelchairs use three degrees of camber . <h> Proper Measurements are Important <p> Sitting in an unfitted wheelchair is not only uncomfortable , it can also cause unnecessary strain or injury on the user . This is why it 's especially important to get the proper measurements for your wheelchair before purchasing one . 
@@2616099 <h> Five Reasons You Shouldnt Use Bungees Instead of Tie-Down Straps <p> Bungee cords and tie-down straps are not the same . Bungee cords , also known as shock cords , are designed to absorb shock and are great for holding down a tarp or securing the cover on a cooler ; but not for containing heavy , bulky , or airborne-prone items . Tie-down straps , however , are specifically designed to secure cargo for transportation . They are available in a variety of lengths , widths , strength ratings , hook ends , and securing methods . To learn more about tie-down straps , see our article on the basics of tie-down straps . <p> Below is a list of reasons to seriously reconsider using a bungee cord for securing heavy , bulky cargo . <p> 1 ) You never know the exact strength of a bungee cord . <p> Most bungee cords do not come with a rating to let you know how much weight they can hold . Tie-down straps , however , will have both the minimum weight at which failure can occur ( break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular use ( working load ) printed on them . <p> 2 ) It does n't  matter how short the trip is or how quick it will be . <p> Even if you 're only traveling a short distance , you never want to trust a cheap bungee cord to hold your valuable cargo . An elastic cord may allow a load to shift ; risking the safety of surrounding motorists , yourself , and your belongings . <p> 3 ) Overloaded or old bungee cords wear out quicker than you think . <p> A bungee cord should never be stretched more than twice its resting length . Even with normal use , bungee cords will eventually stretch permanently , fray , or break as exposure to sun , rain , wind , and extreme temperatures can accelerate a cords deterioration . Bungees should be replaced at least every year , even with light use . <p> 4 ) Bungee cord hook ends are just as unreliable as the cords themselves . <p> Just as is the case with the cord , you 'll never know the exact strength of the bungees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , break and unleash the object they were securing , or even simply scratch your cargo . <p> 5 ) A stretched bungee cord that slips from your hand becomes a sharp and dangerous projectile . <p> Injury due to loss of grip on a stretched bungee cord happens more often than you might think it would . Slipped cords can recoil at speeds between 45 and 60 miles per hour , and can cause serious damage to sensitive areas such as your eyes . <p> Please contact us if you have any more questions regarding bungee cords or tie-down straps .

Hitch-mounted carriers are available in a wide range of weight capacities and materials , and can accommodate most hitch classes . Below are the most important questions to consider when looking for a hitch-mounted cargo carrier for your vehicle . <h> What kind of hitch does your vehicle have ? <p> First , confirm that your vehicle has a hitch and determine what type and class it is . Then , make sure that your hitch-mounted carrier matches the type and class of hitch you have . See our article on how to determine which hitch trailer you need for more information . <h> How heavy is your cargo ? <p> While most of our vehicle-mounted carriers are designed to withstand up to 500 lbs , you may be able to save money if you wont be transporting that much cargo .

While it may be tempting to use bungee cords , ratchet straps are the safest and most reliable option for securing your cargo .

@@2616108 <h> 5 Steps to Prepare Your Motorcycle for Winter <p> Unless you 're lucky enough to live in an area with year-round riding weather , you 're probably starting to think about storing your bike for winter . Properly storing and winterizing your bike at the end of the season extends the life of your bike , and gets you back on the road faster once spring rolls around . Our motorcycle product experts share 5 easy steps to prepare your motorcycle for winter . <h> 1 . Clean all of its Surfaces <p> After you 've taken your bike out for the last ride of the season , clean the surface thoroughly with water using a mild motorcycle-specific detergent and soft microfiber chamois . Leaving bugs , dirt , and other grime on your bike while it 's in storage can cause corrosion , ruining the paint finish . Use a toothbrush to clean hard-to-reach areas like radiators and chains . <p> Once your bike is clean , thoroughly towel dry it , ensuring there is n't any moisture left . Add a coat of wax to the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details , and add some WD-40 on exposed metal surfaces and the drive chain . These extra steps will protect all surfaces of your bike against moisture , rust , and corrosion that can occur during winter storage . <h> 2 . Check the Fluids <p> Old oil becomes acidic after a time and can eat away at seals and gaskets , so it 's a good idea to change the oil before storing your bike for a few months . Run your bike until the engine warms up , drain the old oil , change the filter , and refill the engine with new oil . Once the oil has been changed , start your bike to get the engine internals lightly coated with oil . While newer bikes have fuel injection systems , if your motorcycle has carburetors , this a good time to clean them ( especially important if your bike will be in storage for 3 or more months ) . <p> Once you 've changed the oil , tend to the other fluids in your bike . Even though you wo n't be riding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gasoline to prevent the fuel tank from rusting . Make sure the gasoline is combined with a fuel stabilizer like Sta-bil or Sea Foam . Old , untreated gasoline will turn to sludge and have a negative effect on the engine and carburetor . <p> Just like gasoline , you do n't want to leave your coolant/anti-freeze levels low . This will cause the coolant system to rust and corrode . Check your anti-freeze levels , flush the system , and replace with fresh anti-freeze . <h> 3 . Maintain the Battery <p> Make sure your battery is charged and in good condition before storing your bike . Top off any low fluid levels with distilled or deionized water , check to make sure all cables and clamps are tightened , and clean the terminals and connectors . Keep the battery from dying during the winter months by connecting it to a battery tender , which will charge and maintain the charge of your battery . <h> 4 . Protect the Tires <p> Inflate the tires on your bike to the maximum recommended pressure before storage . This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colder temperatures cause the pressurized air in the tires to condense . Ideally , you should put your bike up on a motorcycle stand for storage to keep the tires off the cold ground , preventing them from cracking or developing flat spots . If you do n't have a stand , that 's okay ! Simply place a rug , piece of carpet , or plywood underneath your bike to keep moisture from getting into the tires , and roll it back and forth a few times during the winter to help the tires keep their shape . <h> 5 . Cover and Store Your Bike <p> If possible , store your bike in a covered , dry area this winter . Cover mufflers and motorcycle exhaust pipes with plugs , rags , plastic bags and rubber bands to keep mice and other pests from turning your bike into their winter homes . It 's a good idea to cover your bike to prevent dust from collecting ; choose a breathable motorcycle cover that will prevent moisture and condensation from building up underneath it . <h> Ready for Spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the winter , it comes with some positives . Taking a break from riding and having some down time can allow you to catch up on maintenance and care that you may sometimes lose track of during the riding season . With just five simple steps , you can avoid any unpleasant surprises when you take your bike out of hibernation , meaning less work when spring rolls around . After a few quick checks and a wash , you 'll be back on the road when the snow melts and the sun shines brighter !

@@2616121 <h> How to Choose the Correct Yard Ramps <h> What is a yard ramp ? <p> Yard ramps are designed for using a forklift to load and unload cargo from truck trailers , loading docks , platforms , rail cars , and more . Typical yard ramps are made of steel , have a weight capacity between 15,000 lbs and 30,000 lbs , wheels for mobility and setup ( allowing it to be moved with a forklift ) , and a mechanism to raise and lower the loading surface . Similar to a standard loading dock , some can be permanently set up as with stationary support stands so that trucks can back up to them , and some may include hand rails that allow them to be used as walk ramps into and out of trailers . <h> Standard Yard Ramps vs .

With the level off ramp you have a solid level surface on which to maneuver the forklift before beginning your descent down the ramp . <h> How do I know what kind of yard ramp I will need ? <p> When it comes to deciding the specifications of a yard ramp for your needs , you need to know what weight capacity is required by determining the weight of the heaviest forklift that will be used on the ramp combined with the heaviest load the forklift will carry . The ramp you will need should have a weight capacity no less than the calculated combined weight . <p> You will also need to know the width of the widest equipment/cargo that will be used on the ramp . The right yard ramp should be at least 15 " wider than the widest equipment/cargo . Take into consideration the straight ramp or level off design . This is completely dependent upon the loading/unloading application . See " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section above . <p> Note : If you plan on using a yard ramp on a rail car , measure the rail car door opening to make sure the ramp will fit and make sure the yard ramp is wide enough to prevent the forklift from hitting the curbs . <h> Safety Note <p> When using a yard ramp on a truck trailer always make sure the truck is stopped , the wheels are chocked , and the safety chains are attached before using the ramp . If your yard ramp with level off has drop legs beneath the level off , the drop legs must be extended in order to reduce strain on the hydraulic pump .

Department of Justice ADA regulations state , " Alterations made to provide an accessible path of travel to the altered area will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeds 20% of the cost of the alteration to the primary function area . " ( 28 CFR 36.403 ( f ) ( 1 ) ) . See also Department of Transportation ADA regulations , which use similar concepts in the context of public sector transportation facilities ( 49 CFR 37.43 ( e ) ( 1 ) ) . There can be multiple areas containing a primary function in a single building . Primary function areas are not limited to public use areas . For example , both a bank lobby and the bank 's employee areas such as the teller areas and walk-in safe are primary function areas . Also , mixed use facilities may include numerous primary function areas for each use . Areas containing a primary function do not include : mechanical rooms , boiler rooms , supply storage rooms , employee lounges or locker rooms , janitorial closets , entrances , corridors , or restrooms . <p> 202.5 Alterations to Qualified Historic Buildings and Facilities .

State Historic Preservation Officers are State appointed officials who carry out certain responsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act . State Historic Preservation Officers consult with Federal and State agencies , local governments , and private entities on providing access and protecting significant elements of qualified historic buildings and facilities . There are exceptions for alterations to qualified historic buildings and facilities for accessible routes ( 206.2.1 Exception 1 and 206.2.3 Exception 7 ) ; entrances ( 206.4 Exception 2 ) ; and toilet facilities ( 213.2 Exception 2 ) . When an entity believes that compliance with the requirements for any of these elements would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility , the entity should consult with the State Historic Preservation Officer . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a specific element would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility , use of the exception is permitted . Public entities have an additional obligation to achieve program accessibility under the Department of Justice ADA regulations . See 28 CFR 35.150 . These regulations require public entities that operate historic preservation programs to give priority to methods that provide physical access to individuals with disabilities . If alterations to a qualified historic building or facility to achieve program accessibility would threaten or destroy the historic significance of the building or facility , fundamentally alter the program , or result in undue financial or administrative burdens , the Department of Justice ADA regulations allow alternative methods to be used to achieve program accessibility . In the case of historic preservation programs , such as an historic house museum , alternative methods include using audio-visual materials to depict portions of the house that can not otherwise be made accessible . In the case of other qualified historic properties , such as an historic government office building , alternative methods include relocating programs and services to accessible locations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entities to use alternative methods when altering qualified historic buildings or facilities in the rare situations where the State Historic Preservation Officer determines that it is not feasible to provide physical access using the exceptions permitted in Section 202.5 without threatening or destroying the historic significance of the building or facility . See 28 CFR 35.151(d) .

Tucker is getting a little too heavy to keep carrying down the stairs , but I want to protect his spine and joints . This ramp is great . It 's lightweight , so I can carry it myself , but is very sturdy . I was able to walk on it with Tucker , and it did n't feel wobbly . The only thing I would like is for the company to offer a longer ramp than 96 " . Tucker is able to navigate the ramp just fine , but the angle is pretty steep due to the height of our deck to the patio .

Most ramps were either too heavy and over-engineered ( i.e. , designed for motorcycles ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their designed purpose ( i.e. , wheelchairs ) . I am skeptical of the advertised weight limit ( 600 lbs ) for a 10 ' ramp , but since my wheelbarrow is only rated to 250 lbs this was not an issue . Worked perfectly , but some simple directions would have been welcome . Expanding the ramps is not nearly as intuitive as I had imagined ( closing them is relatively easy ) . They appear genuinely all-weather ramps , but I store them in the garage when not in use . Their collapsing design and aluminum light weight make this straightforward to do . Measure carefully , account for off-set wheels or skids ( in the case of my wheelbarrow ) , and remember that you will have to walk between the ramps going up multiple steps . Previous reviewers had warned of this , so I measured twice and did a test run with a couple of 8 ' boards that I had handy .

I had bought a similar unit from HF , but returned it because it was too small for the generator and did not have a ramp . The HF carrier was a similar price and not as sturdy as this unit . My only complaints is that the ramp does not fold flat into the carrier which makes it difficult to mount the carrier to the trailer hitch by yourself . Also , I would have preferred to have removable fasteners that retain the ramp to the carrier instead of cotter pins to make it easier to remove the ramp when storing it . <p> 5 StarsAwesome platform <p> Jennifer Torres from MN wrote ( September 04 , 2016 ) : <p> I fit this platform for an upright Walker .

Admittedly , I was confused by the actual hitch point of the rack : the hitch pin ( a bolt , in this case ) was only 1 " long with a locking washer and the 2 " hitch had a plastic insert that , when inserted into the receiver , meant the bolt did n't go all the way through both sides of the receiver , nor would it allow me to use my own locking hitch pin . I 've never seen this before so I was ( and am still ) baffled by it . My work-around was to pop the plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pound it out , which meant it fell into the hitch and will have to remain forever as it will not come out . No problem , though , as there is not amply room to insert and use my own locking hitch pin . Other than that , the rack is solid and there are no wobbles when driving . My only complaint ( and it 's minor ) , is that it would be nice to be able to mount the bike rack backwards so when I 'm not hauling cargo , the bikes could sit above the cargo basket to reduce my vehicles overall length and somewhat protect the bikes . But overall , I 'm pleased . <p> 5 StarsYou have to have this vacation carrier ! <p> Clay from FL wrote ( June 13 , 2015 ) : <p> Going in a family bike vacation then this is the cargo bike carrier for you ! Easy to assemble - about an hour and that was taking my time to spray all parts with silicon . My truck has a large lifting ' are ' topper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that all can open without adjusting .

My only problem was that I could not fold it up when not in use due to the large spare tire on my RV .

It was very easy to put together , Very solid unit . The cargo rack is HUGE ! It is heavy when assembled , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is room for a truck box and other stuff . I bought this to go into the bumper hitch on the back of my trailer , and it works great . Time will tell how well the powdercoat finish holds up , but the manufacturer did a nice job so I do n't expect any issues . It is a little more expensive than standard cargo carriers , but the incorporated bike rack , swing-up feature , and overall quality make it well worth the money spent . <p> 5 StarsFantastic Product ! <p> Jeff from IL wrote ( May 21 , 2015 ) : <p> My fiance and I bought this to replace a different cargo rack that we had bought a year ago , made out of aluminum that we felt was just not very sturdy .

The best part is that even though you have to " fold " the carrier to open the back of your Jeep , it 's incredibly easy AND there is ample room between the folded carrier and open back of the Jeep to hand in groceries , etc .
