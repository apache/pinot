Nothing compares to testing a vessel in your home waters as everywhere is different , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea keeping of the vessel in what can best be described as pretty nasty conditions in some of the most renowned and treacherous waters in the country , the portland race . All aspects of the vessels performance were incredible , with the weather on the beam , either quarter , or a following sea she never once felt vulnerable and with only minor helm adjustment needed to keep her on track it was a remarkable performance . It 's a very rare thing for any boat operator to say but I had 100% confidence in a vessel that I was totally unfamiliar with . <p> What hit the nail completely on the head were two things . Firstly the remarkable and unrivalled fuel economy which I will come to later . But secondly the vessels ability in a head sea , this situation normally will see most catamarans come unstuck but not your vessel , it will literally handle anything you throw at it . <p> I 'm sure if you listen along any quayside around the country there will be many skippers grumbling about ever increasing fuel costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel fuel was constantly on the brain . In the few short weeks I have been running Supanova II I can happily say that my projected fuel saving for the coming season will be in the region of 40% on last year which is nothing short of remarkable , and something all of your main competitors could have never truthfully offered me . <p> Truthfully every skipper will always believe that their boat is the best boat blah blah blah but the people that matter in my industry are the anglers that spend their hard earned money with me and it is their opinions that should matter the most . So far the comments have been fantastic and this cements in my head that I have made the right decision in investing in one of your vessels in these challenging economic times . <p> Your commitment to producing the best quality vessel you can is unrivalled , your communication throughout the build was unrivalled , your attention to detail is unrivalled , the fact you delivered my vessel and every other vessel on time is completely unheard of , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future who purchases one of your vessels will not be disappointed .

@@98089918 @2289918/ <h> Lagoon 421 <p> The Lagoon 421 is designed to meet the needs of sailors whose first concern is comfort and space , without sacrificing the pleasures of pure sailing . <h> Specifications <p> Length overall : <p> 41 ' 4 ' ' <p> Waterline length : <p> 40 ' 4 ' ' <p> Overall beam : <p> 24 ' 7 ' ' <p> Draft : <p> 4 ' 2 ' ' <p> Light displacement ( EEC ) : <p> 26835 lbs <p> Water tank capacity : <p> 2 x 46 US Gal <p> Fuel tank capacity : <p> 2 x 79 US Gal <p> Engine rating : <p> 2 x 40 HP <p> Interior finish : <p> Light oak alpi and non skid laminated wenge for the wood floor <p> EEC Certification : <p> A for 11 persons <h> Structure : <p> The infusion-moulding technique enables us not only to optimize the proportion of resin in the fibreglass ( comparable to the pre-impregnated technique ) , but also to improve the bonding properties of the composite . The isolation of each balsa square by mechanical ties between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the structure , and saves weight too . The systematic use of a very high-quality anti-osmotic resin ensures durability for all Lagoon catamarans . <p> Buoyancy is a guarantee of safety . All Lagoon catamarans comply with CE standards governing the unsinkability of multihull vessels . The fore and aft compartments of each hull are separated from the boat 's living accommodation by watertight bulkheads . The density of the materials used and the absence of ballast increase buoyancy . Even after a collision your Lagoon will still be able to sail . <h> Displacement : <p> Loading capacity For successful cruising you have to be able to take along everything you need without overloading the boat . VPLP architects and the Lagoon design office pay special attention to this issue . An unladen Lagoon catamaran always floats well above its waterline and the hulls are designed to be just as efficient when the boat is fully laden with water and diesel , food , sailing gear and the personal belongings of the crew . Enjoy unparalleled performance and comfort . <p> Modern cruising catamarans thus generally carry a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European pleasure boat manufacturing is regulated by CE rules that all boat builders have to observe . Precise norms have been defined in terms of construction ( structure ) and safety ( fire on board , flooding , etc ) This regulation is also extremely precise concerning the way the specifications and technical characteristics should be presented to European consumers . Lagoon of course strictly follows CE norms in terms of construction , but also in terms of public information . <p> As an example , it is compulsory under CE norms to indicate a boat 's displacement in a ready to sail condition , namely : fuel &amp; water tanks 50% full , crew and crew equipment weight , safety equipment and sails weight etc . <p> As a consumer , you should make sure that all shipyards follow the rules of the game in this regard . <p> Although Lagoon always endeavor to reduce structural weight ( infusion/sandwich techniques , etc. ) , significant hull displacement requires the use of fixed keels for several reasons : <p> Anti-drifting efficiency Performance : A fin is not only longer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds a significant amount of buoyancy to the design and this allows the architect to draw finer lines without affecting displacement . <h> Grounding : <p> Safety : The ability to hit a reef or run aground , whether voluntarily ( beaching or careening ) or accidentally , without sustaining hull damage is an undeniable safety factor . In the case of a Lagoon catamaran the keels are totally isolated from the hull so if one gets damaged , the yacht will not sink . <h> Hull shapes : <p> The symmetrical hulls of Lagoon catamarans cut cleanly through the water to ensure an identical flow rate on either side . Today , VPLP is the benchmark in hull design thanks to the experience gained from being the dominant force in multihull racing for more than 30 years . This experience constitutes a source of design innovation and guarantees quality and safety for the customer . Indeed , our architects are the best judges when it comes to achieving a happy compromise between performance and ease of handling . <p> Lagoon bridge decks are high above the water to guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Safety is also improved because less stress on the composite structure means greater strength . Another exclusive Lagoon innovation is the gull-wing bridge deck . First introduced in 2004 on the Lagoon 440 , and further developed on all later models , the curved surface under the bridge deck reduces wave impact and noise to provide greater comfort . <h> Rigging : <p> The stresses on the rigging of a cruising catamaran are much greater than those experienced by a mono-hull vessel because it does not heel to port or starboard , thus the rigging and sails do not benefit from a " shock-absorbing " effect . That 's why Lagoon calls upon the top specialists in the field ( Z Spar , Spar-craft , Hall Spars ) to provide the most reliable and efficient equipment available . The spars , standing and running rigging and sails are all designed by our suppliers in consultation with our design office . Before entering production , Lagoon catamarans undergo sea trials to physically validate the calculated figures . These trials are carried out in the presence of technicians from our suppliers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are one of the most vital aspects of a modern cruising vessel . Lagoon has made every effort to design electrical circuits that combine quality , reliability , ease of access and maintenance , lightness and safety . Safety is a major consideration so the electrical systems on Lagoon catamarans are installed in strict compliance with CE standards , and even exceed them in certain respects . The quality of the cables , the way in which they are laid and ducted , their systematic coding , and the ease of access to distribution panels are all factors that Lagoon takes into account when fitting electrical systems to ensure the highest possible standard . <p> Refrigeration For health and safety reasons the conservation of foodstuffs is essential . Lagoon has therefore studied the question of on-board cold storage very carefully . No cruise would be enjoyable without an efficient refrigeration system . Lagoon and Groupe BTnTteau have much experience in this area and this has led them to implement an ideal compromise between a number of factors : - best possible insulation , given the limited space available , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the temperature of the compartment concerned , - system efficiency , - ease of maintenance , - choice of widely available brands . <p> Generating and storing energy Saving and storing energy on board a cruising sailboat is a classic problem . A pioneer in this field , Lagoon has always been heavily involved in the R&amp;D work of the Group BTnTteau , particularly when the Lagoon 420 Hybrid was developed in 2008 . <p> From the flexible solar panels located on Bimini awnings to the adjustable supports installed between the dinghy davits , Lagoon remains a leader where R&amp;D in renewable energy is concerned . <h> Deck gear , rigging : <p> The stresses on the rig of a catamaran are about ten times those of a mono-hull . This explains why we take so much care in selecting high quality equipment . <p> The deck plan design , choice of materials and calculation of stresses is a demanding job that is undertaken jointly by our architects , our suppliers and the Lagoon design office . Each item is subject to repeated and rigorous testing to ensure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These tests are conducted in the marine-mist ageing chamber at the Group BTnTteau laboratory , as well as on racing boats at sea . <h> Designer Layout : <p> Lagoon catamarans are designed by internationally renowned architects Van Peteghem and Lauriot Prevost ( VPLP ) , world leaders in multihulled yacht design .
