It was formulated in the Special Theory of Relativity by the German-born American physicist Albert Einstein ( 1879-1955 ) . <p> E=mchas to be the most famous equation of all time . Authors David Bodanis , Pete Moore ( and no doubt many more ) have each written entire books concerning just this one equation . It is the name of an Internet website . It was shown at the beginning of Twilight Zone television episodes ( " A dimension of mind " - remember ? ) and at the beginning of " Twilight Zone : The Movie " ( 1983 ) . E=mc was the name of a 1996 film . E=mc is the title of a Mariah Carey album . Many corporations ( computers , graphics , management , etc ) use this equation as part of their name . <p> You may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seems that knowing how to use this equation conveys intelligence . <p> Basically , the equation states that matter and energy are identical . If you could convert a small amount of matter completely , it would yield a tremendous amount of energy . Let 's use gasoline as an example . If we burned 3 kilograms of gasoline ( about 1.05 US Gallons or 3.97 liters ) , it would yield 140,000,000 Joules , which is a tremendous amount of energy . However , the burning of gasoline only produces a chemical change . Now let 's calculate converting those 3 kilograms of gasoline completely into energy . Finally , we will use the legendary <p> E=mc <p> And the meaning of this equation ? The energy ( e ) of a mass to energy conversion equals the mass ( m ) that was converted multiplied by the speed of light ( c ) squared . If we choose mass in kilograms and the speed of light in meters per second , then the answer will be in Joules . <p> The mass ( from the above example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( c ) is 299,792,458 meter per second . So c = 89,875,517,800,000,000 mtr/sec which rounds ( for purposes of this discussion ) to 9 x 1016 mtr/sec . So , the energy equals 3 kg ( mass ) x 9 x 1016 mtr/sec ( c ) , which equals 27 x 1016kg ? mtr/sec which equals 2.7 x 1017Joules . This is almost 2 billion times the energy we obtained from the " ordinary " burning of 1 gallon of gasoline . ( And we all know that is a huge amount of energy ) . <p> It is fascinating and quite intimidating to learn that a matter to energy conversion of just one gram yields the equivalent of 21.5 kilotons of tnt - the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb . Yes , all that power is generated from one gram of matter transmuted into energy - the mass of one paper clip ! <p> The calculator below is very easy to use .

@@101966344 @6166344/ <p> Among other things , calculus involves studying analytic geometry ( analyzing graphs ) . The above graph should be familiar to anyone who has studied elementary algebra . The horizontal axis is the ' X ' axis and the vertical axis is the ' Y ' axis . <p> The primary concern of differential calculusis determining slopes of equations . When dealing with a linear ( straight line ) equation , this is relatively easy . The slope of a line ( designated by the letter ' m ' ) is defined as the difference in ' y ' divided by the difference in ' x ' . ( or the " rise over the run " as it is sometimes called ) . <p> Mathematicians use the Greek letter delta " ? " to represent " difference " and so this equation could be written : <p> Using y=3x + 6 ( the red line in the graph above ) , we take the 2 points ( x=2 , y=12 ) and ( x=-2 , y=0 ) and calculate the slope : <p> There is an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equations of the form y = a x + b = 0 , the slope equals ' a ' ( the coefficient of ' x ' ) . This is better than choosing points and calculating differences do n't you think ? Just one more quick example - what is the slope of 5y = -3x + 7 ? Since the equation has to be of the form y = ax +b then y = -3/5 x + 7/5 and so the slope = -3/5 . <p> Differential Calculus <p> In the previous section , we learned how to calculate the slope of a linear equation ( equations whose exponents = 1 ) . What happens when dealing with quadratic , cubic and higher-power equations ? <p> The graph above is based on a quadratic equation which predicts the distance an object has fallen ( the y-axis ) in relation to time ( the x-axis ) . You can not state one specific slope for this equation because the slope is constantly varying . What can be calculated is the slope at any point along the curve . Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what do we do for choosing a second point ? We could try using a value of t= 4 seconds , remembering this is not the same slope at t=3 . So , we get : d= + 32 4 = 16 16 = 256 feet . Now , we have our second set of values : <p> y=256 and x=4 <p> Calculating this approximate slope yields : <p> Why do n't we choose a closer value of x such as 3.1 ? When that is the case , the distance equals 153.76 feet and our slope is : <p> How about choosing a value of x that is even closer to 3 than 3.1 ? Besides representing a difference , ? x ( called ' delta x ' ) also represents the smallest possible quantity greater than zero . ? x is less than a millionth , less than a trillionth - it 's 1 divided by infinity . So , when x2 = 3 + ? x , then y2equals <p> +gt = 16 ( 3 + ? x ) = 16 ( 9 + 6 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x + 16 ? x <p> and the slope at x = 3 can be calculated as : <p> Since ? x is such an incredibly minuscule quantity , we can safely say that at x=3 , slope = 96 . Incidentally , the process of calculating a slope is called differentiation , the result of these calculations is called the derivativeand this branch of mathematics is called differential calculus . The derivative is usually represented by dy/dx or f ' ( x ) . <p> Although the above method does work , it has 2 drawbacks - it is rather cumbersome and it only calculates the slope at one particular point . If we wanted to know the slope at x = 2 , we would have to go through all those calculations again . Is there an easier way for determining the slope of an equation at any point ? Yes ! <p> Differentiation the Easy Way <p> For a function of the form k x n , the derivative is equal to n k x ( n-1 ) <p> A good example is the equation d= + @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The derivative equals 2 16 T or 32 T <p> Having determined the derivative , we can put it to use by the previous example when we calculated the slope for x=3 . When x = 3 ( or time = 3 seconds ) , the slope = 32 3 or 96 . WOW that 's a lot easier huh ? What about the slope at 2 seconds ? 32 2 equals 64 . <p> And what is the purpose of all this slope measuring ? In this equation , every time we determine a slope at a particular point in time , we are calculating velocity . So , at time = 2 seconds , an object has fallen 64 feet and has a velocity of 64 feet per second . When time = 3 seconds , distance = 144 feet and velocity = 96 feet per second . <p> Just a few more comments . The derivative of a constant ( for example the number 7 ) is always zero . So , by way of example , the derivative of x + 7 is 2x . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' term , simply differentiate each term and then sum those derivatives.Example : What is the derivative of 3x -5x + 2x + 13 ? Answer : 9x - 10x + 2 One important point to remember is that this method of differentiation works ONLY for equations of the form k x n . <p> Integral Calculus <p> As we learned , differential calculus involves calculating slopes and now we 'll learn about integral calculus which involves calculating areas . <p> The above graph where velocity = g T ( or v = 32 T ) , is based on the derivative of the second graph equation d= + g t . Now , if we wanted to determine the distance an object has fallen , we calculate the " area under the curve " . Yes , the " curve " in this case is a straight line but the principles of integral calculus still apply . <p> If we calculated the sum of the orange , blue and red areas this would equal the distance fallen after 3 seconds . Area of a Right Triangle = + ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 feet per second ) = 144 feet Now looking at the previous graph , we see that this is the precise distance after 3 seconds . If we wanted to find the distance fallen between 2 and 3 seconds , we calculate ALL the area from 0 to 3 seconds ( 144 feet ) and then subtract the distance from 0 to 2 seconds : + ( 2 seconds * 64 feet per second ) = 64 feet So , the distance fallen between 2 and 3 seconds is 144 - 64 = 80 feet . Looking at the previous graph and doing the subtraction , we see the numbers are the same . <p> So how were we calculating these areas ? We multiplied the y-axis ( which is the quantity g T ) by the x-axis ( time in seconds or ' T ' ) and we multiplied this by + . So we calculated the area by the formula + ( g T T ) which equals + g T , and this is the precise formula which was used in the previous section ! ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resultant formula is called the integral and this branch of mathematics is called integral calculus . ( NOTE : the integral is sometimes called the anti-derivative ( not much imagination went into that word huh ? ) Is there an easier way to integrate an equation ? Darned right ! <p> Integration the Easy Way <p> Example 1 : What is the integral of 5x + 3x -7 ? Answer : ( 5x ) /3 + ( 3x ) /2 -7x + c where ' c ' is a constant.Since the derivative of a constant is zero , when calculating an integral we have to allow for a constant . <p> Example 2 : Here 's an interesting example of integral calculus . The area of a sphere is calculated by the formula 4pr . What is the integral ( anti-derivative ) of this formula ? Answer : ( 4pr ) /3 which is the formula for the volume of a sphere ! <p> Well congratulations ! !

Now , in Part 2 , we are going to discuss a special kind of switch - the relay . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Notice in the above diagram that a relay uses an electromagnet . This is a device consisting of a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core . When electricity is applied to the coil of wire it becomes magnetic , hence the term electromagnet . The A B and C terminals are an SPDT switch controlled by the electromagnet. &amp;nbsp When electricity is applied to V1 and V2 , the electromagnet acts upon the SPDT switch so that the B and C terminals are connected . When the electricity is disconnected , then the A and C terminals are connected . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the switch but the two are NOT linked electrically . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp There is another type of relay called a solenoid that basically works on the same principle . The solenoid electromagnet consists of wire wrapped around a tube containing an iron cylinder called a " plunger " . When electricity is supplied to the wire coil , the " plunger " moves through the tube and activates a switch . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp At this point you might be wondering about the purpose of all this . Why switch an electromagnet just so it can control another switch ? Why not just use one regular switch ? One important application is illustrated in the diagram below . <p> NOTE : the symbol indicates a ground connection . Since a great percentage of an automobile consists of metal , using the automobile itself as one " side " of a circuit saves a tremendous amount of wire . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp When the ignition key is turned all the way to the " start " position , it allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which then connects the battery to the starter motor . So why do we need this solenoid " middle man " ? Could n't we just eliminate it and connect the ignition wires to the + battery terminal and the other wire to the starter motor ? The important point here is that the electromagnet is using a small amount of current to control a large amount of current to the starter motor . ( Remember that the electromagnet and the switch are NOT connected electrically ) . Have you noticed that all of the wires ( except the ignition wires ) are purposely drawn with thick lines ? The reason being that some circuits ( such as the starter ) in a car require a tremendous amount of current . ( If you look at an automobile 's battery cables , you will notice they are quite thick . ) Connecting the ignition wires to the battery and then to the starter motor would cause these thin wires to conduct much more current than they were designed for . These wires would become very hot and the insulation would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ignition switch ) . After starting the car for just a few times , the wires and the switch would be in bad shape . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp We do have a second choice . We could use thick battery cables for the ignition wires and use a heavy duty ignition switch . This is n't very practical either . Do you think it would be easy to squeeze cables into the steering column and to squeeze in a heavy duty ignition switch too ? Therefore , the use of a solenoid is the most practical solution . <p> **41;0;TOOLONG <p> For the next circuits , we recommend using a 9 volt battery , a 9 volt electronic siren ( or buzzer ) and a 9 volt SPDT relay . <p> **41;43;TOOLONG <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Another practical use of relays is for switching one circuit ' on ' when another circuit has been switched ' off ' or broken . What possible application requires such an odd switching arrangement ? How about a burglar alarm ? <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical flow . Since the alarm loop wire connects points ' V2 ' to ' C ' , it can easily be seen that electricity flows from the negative battery terminal , goes to V1 then V2 , then ( because the alarm loop is unbroken ) it goes to C and finally to the positive battery terminal . In this circuit , current is flowing through the electromagnet , causing the SPDT switch to make contact with terminal B. Because of this , the siren does NOT sound because there is NO current going to point A. <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Now let 's suppose that the alarm loop is broken . The wire does not necessarily have to be cut to trigger the alarm . Perhaps one or more magnetic switches could be wired in series in the alarm loop and when one magnet moves , it causes the switch contact to break and then the alarm will sound . The electricity is now flowing across points C and A to the siren and NOT the electromagnet . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Alarm Circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what it is ? If the alarm loop is reconnected , the siren shuts off . This is NOT recommended for any serious alarm system . After all , if a door with a magnetic switch is forced open , all a burglar would have to do is close the door . The siren then goes off ! Is there a better way to wire an alarm ? Sure . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Alarm Circuit 2 looks very similar to Circuit 1 , the only difference being that one side of the alarm loop now goes to point B instead of point C. What happens when current is applied to this circuit ? The siren sounds off immediately and stays on continuously . Hmmm , that sure seems like an annoying alarm circuit . ( Did Tim Conway 's father wire it ? If you do n't get this joke , see Part I ) . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Now for the ' beauty ' of this clever circuit . By using a scrap of wire , temporarily connect point B to point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alarm loop , the siren sounds once again . What happens if the alarm loop is reconnected ? The siren still blasts away . Now that 's a much better alarm circuit ! Let 's see how it works . Temporarily connecting points B and C causes current to flow through the electromagnet , which attracts the switch to point B. As long as the alarm loop remains unbroken the alarm remains silent . Break the alarm loop , the alarm sounds . Unlike Circuit 1 , reconnecting the alarm loop no longer causes current to flow through the electromagnet . The only way to activate the electromagnet is by connecting points B and C. All right ! <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp In the ' real world ' , the relay , the power supply ( battery ) and the siren should be inaccessible to everyone except those authorized to ' arm ' and ' disarm ' it . You can easily see that the alarm could be ' sabotaged ' in a number of ways if unauthorized persons had access to it . Incidentally , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? If the alarm loop were to be broken , you would never be able to arm it . Therefore , in a real world application , if the alarm can not be armed , you would know something was wrong ( a door might be open , a wire might be broken , etc . ) . Also , in real world applications , an alarm would be much more complex than the one shown here . The arming process would probably be done with a key switch . The alarm might also have flashing lights , an automatic phone dialer to the police and so on . The circuits shown are for demonstration and educational purposes only and NOT meant to be used in place of professional alarm systems . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp One more circuit should be shown because in real life , the same power supply probably would not operate the alarm loop as well as the warning circuit . The diagram for such an arrangement is shown below in Alarm Circuit 3 . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circuit 2 , which probably could be built for about $5 . ( Yes , you could add some magnetic switches to the alarm loop but remember this will increase the cost very quickly ) . Though inexpensive and consisting of only 3 parts , Circuit 2 demonstrates some important electrical concepts . By all means , do some further research on relays , alarms and so on . <p> And good luck with the project ! ! ! <p> **41;86;TOOLONG <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Just a few more words about relays . As is the case with many mechanical devices being replaced by their electronic equivalents , relays are being " phased out " by Solid State Relays ( SSR 's ) . Mechanical relays do have their disadvantages when compared to an SSR : &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 1 ) switching is much slower &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 2 ) the contacts wear out &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 3 ) they make noise when they switch &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 4 ) their magnetic fields can cause problems for nearby &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp components <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch high voltage and high current circuits .

Yes , employers can run credit checks and they take a bad credit rating as a sign of irresponsibility . <p> Important : To avoid running up an unpayable credit card debt , you should always pay the outstanding balance in full every month . If this can not be done , pay off your balance by the most money you can afford each month .

If you wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay $1,000 . There would be no interest , no minimum payments to make , no late charges , etc . <p> However , if you ca n't pay the balance in just one payment , you might decide ( as most people do ) on just making a minimum payment . Calculating this payment involves 3 factors : 1 ) Minimum Payment Percentage 2 ) Annual Percentage Rate 3 ) Smallest Minimum Payment <p> 1 ) The Minimum Payment Percentage varies depending on the credit card company , but usually it 's between 2% and 4% of the outstanding balance . If it is 2% then for $1,000 it is $20 . <p> 2 ) Annual Credit Card Percentage Rates vary from one company to another but they average about 16% . Since you will be delaying payment by at least one month , your balance accumulates interest rate charges .

The Smallest Minimum Payment was brought into practice by credit card companies so customers would not literally be paying off a credit card balance forever . Again there is variation on the amount of this payment but it is rarely below $10 . In our example above , when we get to payment #104 ( 8.67 years ) , the minimum payment falls below $10 . Continuing the calculations at a constant monthly payment of $10 , the balance finally gets paid off in 186 months or 15 and a half years .

To calculate a four band resistor value , use the middle four " drop " boxes then click on the " Calc 4 Band " button . For a five or six band resistor , you can use all six boxes but all 6 do not necessarily have to be used - the " Temperature Coefficient " box , for example . After you have selected the 6 " drop box " choices , remember to click the " Calc 5 Band " button for your answer . If you have calculated a 5 or 6 band resistor , and go back to calculating a 4 band resistor , the two drop boxes on the ends ( far left and far right ) will not clear but this is perfectly all right . When calculating 4 band resistors , the values of the drop boxes on the ends do not enter into the calculations in any manner . <p> Four Band Resistors <p> Resistors are electronic components that oppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For larger values , kilohms ( 1,000 ohms ) and megohms ( 1,000,000 ohms ) are used . For example 3,300 ohms equals 3.3 kilohms or just 3.3 k and 1,500,000 ohms equals 1.5 megohms or 1.5 meg . <p> Color " bands " are used to indicate the resistance value with each color signifying a number and these color bands are grouped closer to one end of the resistor than the other . <p> As can be seen in the above 4 Band Resistor Color Codes chart , the first two color bands have values of brown = 1 , red = 2 , orange = 3 and so on . <p> The third color band is the multiplier of the first 2 bands . Here , black is 1 , brown is 10 , red is 100 and so on . Putting this in other words , the value of the third band ( the multiplier ) is the number 10 raised to the power of the color code . For example , red in the third band is 10 or 100 . This third band also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = .01 . <p> The 4th band is the resistor 's tolerance and shows how precisely the resistor was manufactured . Gold = 5% , silver = 10% and no band whatsoever = 20% . <p> Now that we know the values of each color , let 's try calculating a few examples of resistance values . <p> Looking at resistor #1 , we see the colors red red green gold . The Color Codes chart " translates " this into 2 2 and 100,000 which equals 2 2 +100,000 or 2,200,000 ohms and do n't forget the gold 4th band which indicates a 5% tolerance . <p> Resistor #2 has the colors orange orange yellow silver which " translates " into 3 3 +10,000 or 330,000 ohms and a tolerance of 10% . <p> Resistor #3 has the colors yellow violet silver meaning 4 7 +.01 or .47 ohms and no fourth band indicates a 20% tolerance . <p> Five Band Resistors <p> Use the 5 Band Chart to solve these next problems.For resistor 4 , we see the first 3 bands are violet , green and red which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looking at the fourth band ( the multiplier ) , we see it is brown and has a value of 10 . So , the resistance value is 7 5 2 + 10 which equals 7,520 ohms or 7.52 K ohms . Band 5 is red which indicates a 2 per cent tolerance and a brown sixth band means that the temperature coefficient is 100 parts per million ( ppm ) . <p> Examining resistor 5 , the first 3 bands are brown , black and blue and the fourth band ( the multiplier ) is green . So , these colors convert into 1 0 6 + 100,000 which calculates to 10,600,000 ohms or 10.6 Meg ohms . The brown 5th band and the red 6th band mean that the resistor has a 1% tolerance and a 50 ppm temperature coefficient . <p> If you 've read these instructions , you probably have a good understanding of determining a resistor 's value from its colors .

@@101966357 @6166357/ <p> One of the most important uses of calculus is determining minimum and maximum values . This has its applications in manufacturing , finance , engineering , and a host of other industries . Before we examine a real-world example , we should learn how to calculate such values . <p> Let 's use for our first example , the equation 2X2 -5X -7 = 0 <p> This is a quadratic equation in one variable . That is to say it is an equation of the form : <p> ax2 + bx + c = 0 <p> With equations of this type , we know that when the " a " term is positive , the graph of the curve will be " concave up " ( U-Shaped ) and therefore the equation will have a minimum value but no maximum value ( okay - technically , the maximum value is infinity ) . Looking at the graph we see that the minimum point is roughly X = 1.5 and Y = -10 . Is there a way to determine the minimum point without graphing the equation and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the graph . If slope values were calculated for points on the left side of the curve , you could see that the slope would always be negative but it becomes " less negative " the closer the curve approaches the minimum ( the bottom ) . If the slope were calculated along the right side of the curve , the value would always be positive and the slope values would get larger the further away from the " bottom " the points were . <p> So , it is logical to think that the slope is zero at that " bottom " point and therefore the derivative is zero at that point too . So , let 's take the derivative of 2X2 -5X -7 = 0 which is : <p> 4X - 5 <p> When 4X -5 equals zero , X =1.25 which means that at this point , a minimum value exists . As for the ' Y ' value , we go to the original equation and enter the value of X as 1.25 . <p> Y = 2X2 -5X -7 <p> Y = 2* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So , at point X=1.25 , Y= -10.125 there exists a minimum value . <p> In this example we knew that we were obtaining a minimum value because we graphed it . Also , we stated that the " rule " for quadratic equations is such that when the ' a ' term is positive , the curve will be " concave-up " . There is yet a third method to determine whether a point is a maximum or minimum value . If we take the second derivative and if that value is positive , then we are dealing with a minimum value . In this example , taking the derivative of the derivative we have the value 4 which is positive and so we know this is a minimum . <p> For equations of the type aX2 + bX + c =0 , a handy tool to use is the Quadratic Equation Calculator . Not only does this calculate the roots of the equation , it will also show the derivative and the point at which the maximum or minimum exists . <p> The second example we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except that it is " concave down " instead of " concave up " . If you think you understand the concepts presented so far , then move on to Part II <p> Okay , let 's examine this equation : <p> -4X2 + 4X + 13 = 0 <p> Since this is a quadratic equation in one variable with the ' a ' term being negative , we know that the graph of the curve will be shaped " concave down " ( shaped like n ) and it will have a maximum value but no minimum value ( okay , if you want to be technical , its minimum value is negative infinity . You happy now ? ) . <p> We learned from the first example that the way to calculate a maximum ( or minimum ) point is to find the point at which an equation 's derivative equals zero . The derivative of this equation is : <p> -8X + 4 <p> and when -8X + 4 = 0 , then X= .5 and it is at that point where the maximum of the curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we substitute .5 into the original equation and get : <p> Y = -4* ( .5*.5 ) 2 +4*.5 + 13 <p> Y = 14 <p> So , at point X=.5 , Y= 14 there exists a maximum value .

As a double-check , using those roots , we can " rebuild " the original equation by <p> ( X - 3 -4i ) * ( X - 3 + 4i ) = X2 -3x +4Xi -3X +9 -12i -4Xi +12i -(4i)2 <p> This reduces to : X2 -3x -3X +9 -(16)*i2 <p> Since i2= -1 then -(16)*i2 becomes -(-16) = 16 and so : <p> X2 -6X +25 =0 <p> Complex Number Multiplication <p> Addition and subtraction of complex numbers pretty much follow the rules of basic arithmetic and so we wo n't discuss these . Multiplication starts getting a little tricky . Consider : <p> ( 5 + 6i ) * ( 7 + 8i ) <p> This equals 35 + 40i + 42i + 48i2 <p> As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So answer= -13 + 82i <p> Complex Number Division <p> Were you wondering - is division more difficult than multiplication ? Sure is . First we must define a new term - conjugate , whereby the conjugate of a + bi = a-bi . Example - the conjugate of ( 3 + 4i ) is ( 3 - 4i ) . The main principle to remember in complex number division is that we multiply the " top " and " bottom " of the fraction by the conjugate of the denominator . Time for an example : let 's divide ( 9 +3i ) by ( 7 +5i ) <p> ( 9 + 3i ) ( 7 + 5i ) <p> The denominator is ( 7 + 5i ) and its conjugate is ( 7- 5i ) <p> Multiplying top and bottom by the conjugate : <p> ( ( 9 + 3i ) * ( 7 - 5i ) ) ( ( 7 + 5i ) * ( 7 - 5i ) ) <p> Which equals ( 78 - 24 i ) 74 <p> Which equals 78 24i minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -0.32432432432432434 i <p> Square Root of a Complex Number <p> Now we move on to even greater difficulty . Time to define another term - modulus , whereby the modulus of a complex number a + bi equals the square root of ( a2 + b2 ) . The modulus of a complex number is generally represented by the letter ' r ' and so : <p> r = Square Root ( a2 + b2 ) <p> Next we 'll define these 2 quantities : <p> y = Square Root ( ( r-a ) /2 ) <p> x = b/2y <p> Finally , the 2 square roots of a complex number are : <p> root 1 = x + yi <p> root 2 = -x - yi <p> An example should make this procedure much clearer . Find the square root of 12 + 16i <p> r = Square Root ( 122 + 162 ) <p> r = Square Root ( 144 + 256 ) = 20 <p> y = Square Root ( ( 20-12 ) /2 ) = 2 <p> x = 16/ ( 2*2 ) = 4 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -4 - 2i <p> Even though you have a calculator that can do these calculations for you , now you know the procedures for complex number arithmetic .

@@101966364 @6166364/ <p> Trigonometry is a word derived from Greek and it means the measurement of triangles . Basically , it is the study of triangles ( particularly right triangles ) and the relationships between their sides and angles . If you 've just started studying trigonometry ( or if you are here for a ' refresher ' course ) , you 've probably seen terms such as ' sine ' or ' arctangent ' . Now you 'll see what they mean . <p> Basic Trigonometric Functions <p> The above diagram is a right triangle with sides labeled in terms of Angle A. ( Yes , the hypotenuse is also an " adjacent " side of angle A , but it always gets labeled as hypotenuse . Incidentally , the hypotenuse is always the longest side of a right triangle and it is always opposite the right angle . ) <p> Let 's suppose Angle A is 40 . Using the handy trigonometry calculator , we look up the sine of 40 and find that it is 0.64279 but what exactly does this mean ? Looking at the definition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratio of the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse . So , we can say : <p> sine(40) = 0.64279 = opposite side hypotenuse <p> This means that for every right triangle with a 40 angle , the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse will always be 0.64279 . Let 's suppose we have such a triangle and we know that the hypotenuse is 7 feet long . How long is the opposite side ? From above , we showed that 0.64279 = opposite side hypotenuse . Using a little algebra we can say that the opposite side = 0.64279 hypotenuse or 0.64279 7 . Therefore the opposite side = 4.4995 feet . <p> If we wanted to find the length of the third side , ( the adjacent side ) , we could use the Pythagorean Theorem , but we can solve it using trigonometry . We see from the above chart that the cosine of angle A = adjacent side hypotenuse . Using the calculator , we find that the cosine of 40 = 0.76604 and so : <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an excuse to show another trigonometric function ) , we see that the tangent function is the ratio of the opposite side divided by the adjacent side . In this case the opposite side divided by the adjacent is 4.4995 5.3623 which equals 0.83911 . Looking up the tangent of 40 on the calculator , shows that it equals 0.8391 which agrees pretty darned well do n't you think ? <p> Sine , cosine and tangent are the most frequently used trigonometric functions . There are 3 other functions ( cotangent , secant and cosecant ) but because this is just an introduction to trigonometry , there is no need to discuss these . ( But if you really have to know , you can find the definitions at the calculator as well as other pages ) . <p> Angles Measured In Radians <p> Eventually , in your study of trigonometry , you will encounter the term radian . Like degrees , the radian is a unit of angular measure but unlike degrees , it is not some arbitrary unit that was conveniently chosen . The radian is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by an arc ( red line ) whose length exactly equals that of the radius . Let 's see how this is derived . <p> So , for every circle , 2 p radii subtend a " central angle " of 360 and therefore one radius would subtend a central angle of <p> 360 ( 2 p ) = 180 p = 57.295779513 ... degrees = 1 radian <p> Some of the more common angles expressed in radians are : <p> 180 = p radians 90 = p 2 radians 60 = p 3 radians <p> 45 = p 4 radians 30 = p 6 radians 20 = p 9 radians <p> 15 = p 12 radians 10 = p 18 radians 5 = p 36 radians <p> To convert degrees to radians multiply by ( p 180 ) To convert radians to degrees multiply by ( 180 p ) Or here 's an angle converter that you can use . <p> The further you progress in mathematics , the more you 'll encounter angular measure in radians rather than degrees . You can see the reason since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Inverse Trigonometric Functions <p> The term " inverse " is a little deceiving because it implies a reciprocal . To make things even more confusing , the abbreviations for these functions also seem to suggest a reciprocal . For example , the inverse sine function is sin-1 but it does not mean 1 / sine . Okay , let 's see what it does mean . <p> Inverse trigonometric functions are also known as arc functions . Just as there are 6 trigonometric functions , there are also 6 trigonometric arc functions - arc sine , arc cosine , and so on . The arc function means the angle whose trigonometric function equals a specific value . Stating this another way , if the trigonometric function of ? y = x , then the arc function of x is ? y . For example , the arc sine of 0.64279 is 40 . <p> If we graph the trigonometric functions ( see below ) , we see that each of the six trigonometric arc functions can have 2 values . For example , looking at the sine graph we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 or 150 . Looking at the tangent graph , the arc tangent of 1.732 can be 60 or 240 .

However , there is no question that the most significant , most watched and most reported is the Dow Jones Industrial Average . This average , computed from the prices of 30 stocks , is sometimes referred to as the Dow Jones Average , the Dow 30 or simply the Dow . Whenever media reporters state that " the market " is down or " the market " is doing well , they are almost always talking about the Dow 30 . <p> Dow Jones &amp; Company was founded in 1882 at 15 Wall Street , New York and started out by delivering hand-written stock market information ( called the " Customers ' Afternoon Letter " ) to investors in the Wall Street area . In 1884 , the Dow Jones Average consisting of 9 railroads and 2 industrials first appeared in these newsletters . Eventually the " Customers ' Afternoon Letter " evolved into the Wall Street Journal first published on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1896 for the first time an average consisting entirely of 12 industrial stocks is published . To see the list of these 12 companies ( as well as all such lists from 1896 to the present ) , click here . On October 4 , 1916 it was calculated on the stock prices of 20 companies and finally on October 1 , 1928 it was increased to 30 companies , the same number as it is today . <p> There are no specific criteria by which a company is chosen to be on the Dow 30 . Generally , the Dow 30 is composed of very large companies that represent a variety of industries in the economy . You will never see the Dow 30 list consisting of companies that are all in the same industry . <p> Any decision to add or remove any of the companies which make up the Dow 30 is made by the editors of the Wall Street Journal . Also , there is no particular schedule by which Dow 30 companies are changed . On two occasions the list of Dow 30 companies went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 06-01-1959 to 08-09-1976 ) . Then again changes have been made in less than 1 month . ( The Dow 20 list remained unchanged for only 3+ weeks from 12-07-1925 to 12-31-1925 and was unchanged for just 15 days from 01-22-1924 to 02-06-1924 . ) <p> One of the major reasons for removing or adding companies to the Dow 30 list is to reflect major changes in the economy . Some of the companies that were on the list such as Remington Typewriter , Victor Talking Machine and Pacific Mail Steamship now seem very out of place . Three of the more recent additions , Microsoft , Intel and Cisco Systems are the only NASDAQ stocks that have ever been on the Dow 30 and they reflect the high technology aspect of the 21st century economy . <p> The Dow Jones Industrial Average is not the only Dow Jones average . There is also the Dow Jones Railroad Average , first published in October 26 , 1896 . This average was always calculated from the stock prices of 20 railroad companies until 1968 . Over 70 years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major mode of transportation and so the list now consisted of 20 transportation companies . In 1970 , the name was changed to the Dow Jones Transportation Average , by which it is still known today.On January 2 , 1929 , the Dow Jones Utilities Average , calculated from 18 utilities , appeared for the first time . Six months later it was calculated from twenty utilities . In June 1938 , it was based on 15 utilities and this number has remained to this day . <p> How the Average Is Calculated <p> In 1896 , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was easily calculated by adding the price of each company 's stock and then dividing by 12 . This simple procedure became more complicated whenever a company underwent a stock split . <p> A company decides to make a stock split whenever its stock price becomes a little too expensive . For example , a company whose stock price has increased to $1,000 may feel that investors would be reluctant to buy such expensive shares . The company might decide to make a 4 for 1 stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 shares but each is now worth $250 . So , shareholders have not become 4 times richer , the company 's worth has not quadrupled and the only change is that the stock price is at a more attractive $250 . <p> These stock splits had to be taken into account ever since 1896 and by 1927 the average was computed by multiplying American Can 's stock price by 6 , General Electric by 4 , Sears by 4 , American Car and Foundry by 2 and American Tobacco by 2 and then dividing by the number of stocks on the index . As can be seen , this calculation was getting increasingly complicated and so on October 1 , 1928 the Dow divisor made its first appearance . Its value at that time was 16.67 and so the stock prices of the Dow 30 would be added up and then divided by 16.67 . <p> Let 's use an example to show the way in which the divisor works . To make things simple , we 'll only use 3 fictitious companies ( with their closing prices ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So for these 3 companies , the fictitious Dow 3 Average would simply be the total divided by 3 <p> Average = 1,500 3 = 500 <p> Now at the close of the business day , Arizona Aircraft decides to make a 4 for 1 stock split and so its stock price is now $300 . If we add up the stock prices we get 600 and dividing by 3 we only get 200 . However , the Dow average must be consistent and can only change values based upon actual changes in stock price and not stock splits . In other words , the Dow 30 ca n't close with one value and then open on the next day with a drastically different value . <p> So , to calculate a new divisor , we use the formula : <p> So , the new divisor = 3 + ( 600 1500 ) = 3 + .4 = 1.2 Calculating the " new " average we get a total of 600 and dividing it by 1.2 equals 500 which is exactly the same as the " old " average , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strange results about using the Dow divisor is that now the " average " stock price of the 3 companies is larger than any one of those three stocks ( but we know that the " real " price of Arizona Aircraft is $1,200 , right ? ) <p> From this point on , we would continue to use the new divisor of 1.2 until another stock split occurred or if any companies are added to or removed from the Dow 30 list . So , for example , several months after that stock split calculation , our fictitious Dow 3 closes at the following prices : Arizona Aircraft 316 Boston Bismuth 215 Carolina Cable 75 and the ' Dow 3 ' average is 505 ( you did remember to divide by 1.2 and not 3 right ? ) Now let 's suppose the editors at the Wall Street Journal decide that Delaware Drilling ( which closed at $13 per share ) will replace Boston Bismuth . So , the opening prices of the ' Dow 3 ' will be : Arizona Aircraft 316 Delaware Drilling 13 Carolina Cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adding up these 30 amounts , we get 1,100.235 and when divided by the current divisor 0.125552709 equals 8,763.13 which is the closing price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for June 5 , 2009 . <p> On Monday June 08 , 2009 when the New York Stock Exchange opens , two of these stocks ( General Motors and Citigroup ) will be replaced in the Dow 30 by two others ( Cisco Systems and The Travelers Companies ) , thus requiring a change in the Dow Divisor . <p> To calculate the new divisor , we first must calculate a " new sum " by using the " old sum " , subtracting the stock price of the companies being replaced and adding the stock prices of the two companies being included . <p> Old Sum <p> 1,100.235 <p> Citigroup <p> -3.460 <p> General Motors <p> -.865 <p> Cisco Systems <p> 19.870 <p> Travelers <p> 43.750 <p> New Sum <p> 1,159.530 <p> new divisor = previous divisor + New Sum Old Sum <p> new divisor = 0.125552709 + 1,159.530 1,100.235 <p> new divisor = 0.132319125 <p> For a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divisor equals 8,763.13 which is precisely the Dow 30 June 5 , 2009 closing average and the June 8 , 2009 opening average . Even though two stocks have been removed and replaced by two others , the Dow Jones closing and opening averages remain the same . ( Only the divisor has changed ) . <p> On 03-07-2008 , the closing prices for the stocks that make up the Dow 30 were : <p> Company Name <p> Company Name <p> Company Name <p> 3M Co . <p> 76.51 <p> Alcoa Inc . <p> 36.60 <p> American Express <p> 41.53 <p> American International <p> 42.88 <p> AT&amp;T <p> 35.01 <p> Bank of America <p> 36.74 <p> Boeing <p> 76.60 <p> Caterpillar <p> 69.84 <p> Chevron <p> 85.26 <p> Citigroup <p> 20.91 <p> Coca-Cola <p> 58.85 <p> DuPont <p> 45.00 <p> Exxon Mobil <p> 82.49 <p> General Electric <p> 32.23 <p> General Motors <p> 21.96 <p> Hewlett-Packard <p> 47.31 <p> Home Depot <p> 25.88 <p> Intel <p> 20.07 <p> IBM <p> 113.94 <p> Johnson &amp; Johnson <p> 61.51 <p> JPMorgan &amp; Chase <p> 37.56 <p> McDonald 's <p> 52.27 <p> Merck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Procter &amp; Gamble <p> 65.80 <p> United Technologies <p> 67.49 <p> Verizon <p> 35.08 <p> Wal-Mart <p> 49.90 <p> Walt Disney <p> 30.76 <p> If we add up all 30 amounts , we get 1,460.95 . Now we must divide this total by the Dow Jones Industrial Divisor , whose value on March 7 , 2008 was 0.122834016 and so 1,460.95 0.122834016 equals 11,893.69 which was the precise closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average for 03-07-2008.

Slope , tilt or inclination can be expressed in three ways : 1 ) As a ratio of the rise to the run ( for example 1 in 20 ) 2 ) As an angle ( almost always in degrees ) 3 ) As a percentage called the " grade " which is the ( rise run ) * 100 . <p> Of these 3 ways , slope is expressed as a ratio or a grade much more often than an actual angle and here 's the reason why . Stating a ratio such as 1 in 20 tells you immediately that for every 20 horizontal units traveled , your altitude increases 1 unit . Stating this as a percentage , whatever horizontal distance you travel , your altitude increases by 5% of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degrees does n't give you much of an idea how the rise compares to the run . <p> Calculating Grade From A Map <p> One way to calculate the grade of a hill is with a map that shows the altitudes of locations . For example , you 've measured out a distance of 3 miles ( run ) with a change in altitude of 396 feet ( rise ) . First , the units must be made consistent , so we convert 3 miles to 15,840 feet . <p> grade = ( rise run ) * 100 <p> grade = ( 396 15,840 ) * 100 = 2.5% <p> Calculating Grade By Measuring The Road Distance <p> With an altimeter and an odometer , we travel the exact route we measured on the map and our altimeter indicates a change in altitude of 396 feet which , not surprisingly , is precisely what we had already measured on the map . However there is a small difference between the 3 mile distance measured on the map and the 3.0009375 miles ( 15,844.95 feet ) we just traveled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the travel distance of 3.0009375 miles is the slope length or slope distance . To calculate the true run , we need to use the Pythagorean Theorem . <p> run = Square Root ( 15,844.95 - 396 ) <p> run = 15,840 feet <p> Now we can calculate the grade = ( 396 15840 ) * 100 = 2.5% The slope angle exactly equals what we previously calculated because instead of using the slope length as the run , we used it to calculate the true horizontal distance . <p> Calculating Grade By Using Slope Distance <p> If we calculate slope from the formula : <p> grade = ( rise slope length ) * 100 <p> we must remember that this is not the proper way to do so and it is not the method we learned in algebra class . However , it does have the advantage that it is usually easier to find a slope length than the horizontal run and it is fairly accurate when the angles are 10 degrees and smaller . So , returning to the previous problem , we could calculate the grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and since we are dealing with a small angle , it is very close to the actual figure of 2.5% . As the angles get larger , the calculations start to diverge dramatically . Look at the table below .

It is also the grade for that angle . ) The next column is the rise over slope length ( or hypotenuse ) percentage for that angle . ( or sine of that angle times 100 ) .

There are tools ( inclinometers ) which measure slope , tilt , etc . Of course if we use one of these , it is a good idea to take more than one measurement and at different locations .

So , using an inclinometer at several locations and then calculating an average of those measurements would yield a much better indication of the road 's slope . <p> Another way to determine slope is with a level . Roofers ( among others ) use this method . <p> One end of the level is placed along the slope of a roof and the lower end is lifted until the bubble indicates it is perfectly horizontal .

S2 is a double pole double throw switch that changes the switching from regular 5 way switching to series switching . S1 is a single pole double throw switch that selects neck and middle in series or middle and bridge in series .

You may wish to choose a lower or higher value because after all , it is your guitar . With this modification , all you have to do is solder the capacitor to those two terminals and that 's it . <p> That circuit has one problem - as the volume is turned lower , more of the higher frequencies will predominate , even to the point where the guitar starts to sound very " tinny " as the volume approaches zero . <p> Diagram 2 In this circuit , a resistor is connected in parallel with the capacitor , and as the volume is turned lower , the higher frequencies are not as dominant .

There are three different treble bleed circuits and many different recommended values for the components . Also , guitars have different pickups ( high output , low output , humbucker , single coil ) and different potentiometer values ( 250K , 500K , 1 Meg ) .

This results in 17 different pickup combinations ( see table below ) , with 22 additional sounds enabled by the phase switches on the neck and bridge pickups and all of that multiplied by the 3 tone circuits , producing an incredible tone monster . <p> Phasing For All 3 Pickups <p> The above diagram shows a 3 pickup guitar with a phase switch for each coil . ( These could either be single coils or humbuckers . ) This drawing is based on John Atchley 's " Individual Pickup Selection " modification . Each switch is DPDT center OFF .

Even John Atchley , the designer of this circuit has said " I 've quit building these particular modifications because I did n't find the phasing to be that tonally useful . " It does seem to be overkill regarding phasing , but the idea of using 3 SPST toggles to control the pickup selection is very convenient .

@@101966395 @6166395/ <p> There 's more than one way to wire a humbucking pickup . That is to say , a humbucking pickup can be wired with an alternative wiring and if done correctly , it will still be hum canceling and will retain all of the sound characteristics of conventional wiring . If that 's the case , what 's the point in even doing this ? The difference occurs whenever coil cut switching is chosen . Coil cut switching was already discussed on page one but now we 'll look at it in much greater detail and possibly give you additional ideas about guitar wiring . <p> SPST Coil Cut Switch <p> One thing we never discussed is which coil gets cut and which coil stays active when a coil cut switch is ' on ' . Figure 1 shows the simplest wiring for a coil cut switch . When the switch is ' on ' , it ' grounds out ' the middle wires , which causes both of Coil B 's wires ( green and white ) to be connected to each other . This is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit ) across Coil B so that it can no longer produce any sound.So , coil ' B ' has been shunted and Coil A is the active coil . If we wanted Coil ' B ' to be the active pickup , is there a way to do this ? Sure . <p> " Inside-Out " Wiring of a Humbucker <p> Figure 1 shows a conventional humbucker wiring - red to ' plus ' , black to ' minus ' and the two ' middle ' wires ( black and white ) connected to each other . Figure 2 shows an alternate wiring . Speaking informally , you could say the red and the green wires are now the ' middle wires ' and what were the two ' middle wires ' are now on the ' outside ' . ( I refer to this as ' inside out ' wiring . ) There is nothing wrong with this , it sounds exactly as it did before and it is in phase with itself just as if it were wired conventionally . Now , when the coil cut switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to ground , Coil A has been shunted and Coil B is the active coil . <p> DPDT plus SPST Switch <p> Using an SPST switch connected to the ' jumper ' of a DPDT series/parallel switch works the same way as in the previous diagrams . When the coil cut switch is ' on ' , a conventionally wired humbucker ' grounds out ' the middle wires and Coil A is the active coil . If the humbucker has an alternate ( or ' inside-out ' ) wiring , Coil B is then the active coil during coil cut . <p> SPDT Center OFF Switch <p> You can choose series humbucker / Coil A / Coil B all with one switch <p> The diagram on the right offers an interesting , relatively easy-to-wire circuit that gives you three tone choices with just one switch . Remember to use a single pole double throw center OFF switch . ( This switch is n't particularly difficult to find but make sure you use this exact type of switch ) . In the center position , the switch is n't connecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When switched in one direction , the switch connects the red and black wires , which shunts Coil A and leaves Coil B active . When switched in the other direction , the switch connects the white and green wires , which shunts Coil B and leaves Coil A active . <p> DPDT on/on/on Coil Cut Switch <p> This type of switch utilizes a different manner of coil cut switching . Looking at the graphic on the right , we see a very popular switching arrangement for a humbucking pickup . It gives you the options of coils in series , coils in parallel or ( what concerns us most in this topic ) - just one coil active . Looking very carefully at the graphic , there is a dashed blue line in the lower left and upper right part of the switch . These are the terminals that are connected when the switch is in the middle ( ' coil cut ' ) position . Notice that in this case , the switch does not shunt the inactive coil but in fact shuts it off . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output ) . Following the current flow , we see that Coil A is the active coil . <p> Now , if we want Coil B to be active , we 'll have to give the humbucker an ' inside-out ' wiring . Compared to the last diagram , it 's as though the green and red wires have been shifted ' up ' one terminal and the black and white have been shifted ' down ' . Parallel and series settings will sound exactly the same as the previous wiring . The only difference is when the switch is set to the middle ' coil cut ' position Coil B is the active coil . <p> The Purpose of Selecting Coils <p> Actually there are two reasons for selecting a specific humbucker coil . 1 ) One reason is the sound difference that occurs when either Coil A or Coil B is chosen . If the humbucker is mounted at the neck position , the sound difference will be negligible . However , when located at the ' bridge ' position , there is a significant sound change between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbucker has one of its coils cut , it sounds much brighter . <p> If you have chosen Coil A , you 'll notice a very bright treble sound that is a drastic change from the rather subdued sound usually associated with most humbuckers . Selecting Coil B sends the sound even further into the treble range and yields a bright , almost earsplitting sound . Personally , I 'd rather use Coil A for its fuller and much more pleasing sound . Of course it is your guitar and if you want an over-the-top treble sound then choose Coil B for the active coil . And you know the way to ' choose ' which coil stays active , right ? Conventional wiring - Coil A is active with coil cut switch ' on ' . Alternate wiring- Coil B is active during coil cut . <p> 2 ) The second reason for selecting a particular coil ( actually set of coils ) is that if it is done in the proper way , the result is yet another humbucking pickup . ( And you thought your guitar only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All humbuckers already have an A Coil and a B Coil . So , if you wire the pickups so that neck pickup Coil A and bridge pickup Coil B are active when both coil cut switches are ' on ' , the result will be hum-canceling . ( See Diagram A ) Yet another guitar tone results when the pickups are wired so that Coil B at the neck and Coil A at the bridge are the two active pickups during coil cut . ( See Diagram B ) ( As you may have guessed , I like this tone because it does n't have that extreme treble sound ) . Actually , some guitar companies are manufacturing their guitars in just this way . Now , that you know how it is done , you can wire a guitar like this and without the need for buying yet another guitar . <p> Selecting Coils By Switching <p> We have used the expression " choosing " a coil but your choice is limited to selecting the active coil before you permanently wire everything . So , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you realized Coil A might have been a better choice , you would have to rewire the coil cut circuit in order to do this . <p> However , there is a way to choose an active coil by switching . Looking at the diagram , if you wire a phase switch along with a coil cut circuit , you will be able to choose the active coil without rewiring anything . When the upper terminals of the phase switch are conducting , Coil A is the active coil . When the bottom phase switch terminals are conducting , the red wire is connecting to ground and the green wire is going to the ' + ' connection . Because of this , the coil switch now grounds out the red wire and so Coil B becomes the active coil . <p> Another way to choose active coils by switching is using 2 SPDT switches .

@@101966397 @6166397/ <p> We should first explain two properties of pickups which were never previously discussed -magnetic polarity and coil windings . Two pickups can be combined with these two properties in four ways : <p> ****** <p> Magnetic Polarity <p> Coil Windings <p> Output <p> Hum Canceling <p> 1 ) <p> Same <p> Same <p> Strong <p> No <p> 2 ) <p> Opposite <p> Opposite <p> Strong <p> Yes <p> 3 ) <p> Same <p> Opposite <p> Weak <p> Yes <p> 4 ) <p> Opposite <p> Same <p> Weak <p> No <p> The rightmost columns " Output " and " Hum Canceling " will be discussed later . <p> Combination number 1 is the way in which guitar pickups have been manufactured and installed ever since the very first electric guitar . This was ( and still is ) , a pretty good way to wire guitars with the only problem being hum . Guitar pickups are wound with a lot of wire which unintentionally creates an " antenna " which can " receive " electromagnetic interference from fluorescent lights , light dimmers , electronics equipment and especially 60 cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with this interference by avoiding playing near electrical equipment and by facing in a direction in which the guitar produces the least noise . <p> Probably the most successful attempt in reducing pickup noise was in 1955 when Gibson Guitar employee Seth Lover developed the humbucking pickup . These pickups are actually two side by side , single coil pickups with each coil differing from the other by having reverse winding and reverse magnetic polarity ( abbreviated as " RWRP " ) . Humbucking pickups can have more than one magnet , but to keep things simple , let 's see how a single magnet humbucker works . <p> Did you notice that the magnet in the drawing has its polarity on its edges instead of on its ends ? This is done to keep the magnetic strength constant from one end of the magnet to the other permitting all 6 guitar strings to have the same volume . <p> The other reason for polarizing the edges is to allow both coils to have opposite magnetic polarities which the diagram below easily demonstrates . <p> Moving on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clockwise direction . However , should n't those coil windings be the reverse of each other ? Not exactly . Basically the term " reverse winding " , although it is used by just about everybody , is inaccurate . Actually , it is the current flow in the two coils that travel in opposite directions . <p> In the diagram , the current begins at the center of coil 1 then travels clockwise until it reaches the series connection ( the place where the two coils join - indicated by the blue arrow ) . The current enters coil 2 at point C and if we follow it to point D , we see that the current has traveled in a counter-clockwise direction . This is what makes humbucking pickups work the way they do . Coil 1 and coil 2 are electrically out of phase and since electrical interference only travels through the guitar pickup 's windings , when the hum travels from one coil to the other , it gets canceled due to the opposite coil windings . ( The magnets play no part in hum cancelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound ( the signal ) is generated from the pickup 's wiring and magnets . So , when the guitar signal travels through the coils , no cancelation occurs because the coils are out of phase electrically and magnetically . In effect , having opposite electrical and magnetic polarities is similar to putting two phase switches on two pickups . When both switches are set to the out of phase positions , no cancelations occur because the 2 " out of phase " conditions cancel each other out . <p> Anyway , if you just wanted to learn how humbucking pickups work , you do n't have to read any further . However , you might find it interesting to continue . <p> The above graphic shows a humbucking pickup wired in series and connected in what I call an " inside-out " wiring . The wires that were joined at the series connection are now on the " outside " of the pickup and the ' A ' and ' D ' wires now meet at the series connection . But is this humbucking ? Well , both coils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , when the current in coil 1 travels in a clockwise direction , it travels counter-clockwise in coil 2 . Since we have opposite magnetic polarity and opposite coil windings ( actually current flow ) , this is just as valid as if it were wired in the conventional way . Why would we want to wire it in this way ? Among other things , it is something to consider when you choose to add coil cut switching to the wiring . <p> The above graphic shows a humbucking pickup wired in parallel . The important features of parallel wiring are : ? it produces a brighter sound than series wiring and ? it is humbucking . In this wiring , the ' A ' and ' C ' wires are connected to ' + ' and to each other . The ' A ' wire begins at the " START " in coil 1 , and travels clockwise . The ' C ' wire begins at the " FINISH " of coil 2 and travels in a counter-clockwise direction . The ' B ' and ' D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wires , ' B ' enters coil 1 in a counter-clockwise direction and ' D ' goes from the center of coil 2 in a clockwise direction . So , as we can see , in both cases we have a reverse current flow and since we have opposite magnetic polarities , this is a properly wired humbucking circuit . <p> Even the Fender Guitar Company started making their guitars humbucking , but not with traditional humbucking pickups . Before the mid 1980 's , if you had a single coil guitar , all its pickups had the same magnetic properties and all were connected so that the current flow in each was exactly the same . By now , you should know why this does not produce a hum-canceling circuit . ( remember combination 1 ? ) <p> Then , around 1985 , the Fender Guitar Company thought of an easy and inexpensive way to solve the hum problem by making the middle pickup in a Fender Stratocaster ? have reverse wiring and reverse polarity of the other 2 coils . This in effect " created " a humbucking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle or middle and bridge . <p> Still , this left the neck and bridge pair in a non-hum-canceling status , which did n't bother too many people because the " neck and bridge " choice is not available for a standard Fender Stratocaster ? . <p> Combination 3Same Magnetic Polarity Opposite Coil Windings <p> Since humbucking pickups always have two coils with opposite magnetic polarities when would we be connecting two pickups with similar magnetic polarities ? How about when connecting the neck and bridge pickups of a Fender Stratocaster ? ? <p> Looking at the diagram we see that connecting A to C and B to D ( the typical parallel wiring method ) creates a circuit in which the current flows through the coils in opposite directions , ensuring the hum will get canceled . However , we also need ( but do n't have ) opposite magnetic polarities to counteract the electrical out of phase guitar signal . Basically , we have a circuit in which the hum and the guitar signal gets canceled . The guitar signal does n't get 100% canceled ( just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so the guitar signal has been reduced to a weak , thin , squawky " out of phase " sound . Actually , some people like this sound . It is used quite often in country music and produces a penetrating sound when used through distortion . It is not a sound you would want to have all the time but that 's why there are switches on guitars . <p> The above graphic shows a series wiring of this humbucking circuit . This one , due to its greater volume is more popular than a parallel out of phase circuit . <p> Combination 4 Opposite Magnetic Polarity Same Coil Windings <p> Of all four combinations , this is undoubtedly the worst of the bunch . It produces a weak guitar signal that is n't even hum canceling . If you wired a humbucking pickup out of phase , this is the result . You 've probably seen books and other websites that state that this produces a poor sound because the coils of a humbucking pickup are so close to each other . No , I believe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak guitar signal . Together , these produce a very poor signal to noise ratio . Our recommendation is not to try this combination at all , whether in a humbucking pickup or two separate pickups . <p> Well , now that you have become a humbucking " scholar " , maybe your next guitar project will not seem so overwhelming .

Heck , this is the third two humbucker " mod " on this website. ( the other two are Funky Five Switching and Super Seven Switching ) . <p> This modification is usually referred to as the " Jimmy Page Wiring " and it does offer a great variety of tones . <p> If you use push-pull potentiometers or " pots " ( as shown above ) , then this wiring will not affect the appearance of your guitar whatsoever . Basically , a push-pull pot is a " pot " with a switch attached to it ( almost always a DPDT switch ) . It is switched by pushing down on the knob which is attached to the shaft of a volume or tone control . <p> There are dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of wiring but we think ours is probably the most concise and easiest to follow .

However , if you scroll to the bottom of the page you will see a diagram for a circuit with no dead spots . <p> As we 've said many times , doing any unauthorized work on your guitar will void the warranty . <p> If your guitar has two 2 wire humbuckers , then you must convert both of these to 4 wire humbuckers .

You must take this extra wiring , soldering and time into consideration before starting this project . <p> Another concern is the cost of the modification which is going to be somewhat higher than the other rewirings found on this website . Making a very rough estimate , the cost of one DPDT push-pull pot is about $10 and so the parts will cost about $40 . You could try getting a deal at your local guitar shop or ordering this as a " kit " from an online guitar part supplier . These kits usually consist of 4 DPDT push pull pots and sometimes things you do n't need such as a pickup switch , an output jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your guitar.Be careful when ordering because some online companies sell " kits " of this wiring consisting of just one DPDT push pull pot and 3 regular " pots " .

You can drill four holes in your guitar and use toggle switches instead . You 'd need 2 DPDT and 2 SPST switches and nothing else . Of course it is your guitar and you have to decide if you want 4 additional holes drilled into it . <p> If your guitar is very thin ( such as a Gibson SG ) , there is not enough room for a push pull " pot " to fit in .

For those who wish to see the " old version " , please click here . <p> Loading <p> " Interest only " loans are becoming increasingly popular and so it is important to understand exactly how they work . An " interest only loan " allows a person to pay a lower monthly payment at the beginning of the loan in order to save money ( or to anticipate a larger salary ) so that a higher monthly payment is more affordable later in the loan . Scroll down for an example . <p> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <p> ***** ***** <p> ***** <p> Example : Using the above calculator , let 's input that we are borrowing $250,000 at 7% interest rate for 30 years . ( We 'll say the " interest only period " of this loan will be 5 years ) . After clicking " CALCULATE " , we see that the standard mortgage payment is $1,663.26 per month and the " interest only " monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 years , the standard mortgage payment total is $99,795.60 and the 5 year " interest only " payment total is $87,499.80 , saving us $12,295.80 when using the interest only mortgage . But is this savings worth it ? <p> Actually , this leaves you with two big drawbacks : 1 ) After 5 years of interest only payments , you have absolutely zero equity in your house . To put this in plain English , after 5 years , how much of your house is actually yours ? Absolutely nothing . 2 ) After you have enjoyed 5 years of " saving " $12,295.80 , you make up for this for the next 25 years with a monthly payment that is now $103.69 higher ( $1,766.95 minus $1,663.26 ) than the standard payment . <p> To sum up , in this case , the interest only mortgage costs $18,811.20 more ( $617,584.80 minus $598,773.60 ) than the standard mortgage . That $18,811.20 is the price you pay for the five years of lower mortgage payments . This higher 30 year total is something to consider if you are thinking of getting an interest only mortgage . 
@@101966409 @6166409/ <p> Here is a number trick that is not too well known and so you can use it to impress your friends . In fact this does n't require a computer and can even be done with paper and pencil . It involves a series known as the Fibonacci number sequence , named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci ( 1170-1250 ) . <p> A Fibonacci number sequence is formed by starting with any two numbers , adding those to get a third number , adding the second and third to produce a fourth number and so on . This is much easier to see with a short example : <p> 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 <p> As can be seen , the sequence is formed by adding the previous two numbers . 2 plus 3 = 5 , 3 plus 5 = 8 , 5 plus 8 = 13 , 8 plus 13 = 21 and so on . Using the calculator below , if you input 2 and 3 into the first two boxes , when you click " Calculate " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same numbers in the list above . <p> Now , for the " trick " with the Fibonacci number sequence . Ask your friend for two numbers . You could then enter the numbers in this computer page but it is much more impressive if this trick is done on paper . Adding the two numbers , create a Fibonacci sequence that is exactly ten steps long . When you reach the tenth number , tell your friend you can total all ten numbers in your head ! <p> And what 's the secret ? <p> Whenever you have a Fibonacci sequence of 10 numbers , the total will always be the seventh number times 11 . <p> For practice , input two and three in the first two boxes and then click " CALCULATE " . Yes , you could get the total by clicking " Calc Total " or by using the trick . <p> If you entered two and three for the first two numbers , the seventh number will be 34 and multiplying this by 11 gives a result of 374 . It is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , to multiply 34 by 11 , think of summing 34 and 34 but shift one number one decimal place . <p> 34 34 374 <p> Obviously , when you ask a friend for two numbers make sure you mention they should be kept relatively small . <p> Doing this trick on paper is much more impressive than on a computer so why not use this computer page just for practice ? <p> Remember , before you show this to anybody , the best advice is to practice .

@@101966414 @6166414/ <p> Important : This modification should be done only by someone who has great familiarity with soldering and unsoldering.Scroll to the bottom for a few instructions . <p> Yes , it seems that people have come up with all kinds of mouse modifications , even going so far as substituting an Altoids ? box for the mouse case . Some of these modifications are quite impressive but here is a modification that is actually quite useful . <p> Many years ago when I was using a computer mouse , the left button went " dead " . Taking the mouse apart would have been easy enough but the bigger problem would be finding a replacement switch of the same exact size and having the same " travel " distance as the previous one . Then , it occurred to me that I did n't even need a switch and instead , two wires could be used in its place . <p> Before we talk any more about the modification , the first thing to do is taking the mouse apart . <p> Each manufacturer constructs a computer mouse differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be fastened with at least one screw . To make things tougher , sometimes these screws are very well-hidden . Sometimes the screw(s) are covered with a piece of foil . In the picture above , the arrows are pointing at four ovals of plastic ( the two on the left have been removed . Remember to keep and replace these pieces of plastic because the mouse moves more smoothly with them . ) Anyway , the mouse I modified was held together by two screws and the ovals on the right were covering 2 plastic latches that snapped the two pieces of plastic together . So I removed the two screws , moved the plastic latches and was able to open it up . <p> Since you are taking the mouse apart , it 's probably because one of the buttons no longer works and if you are right-handed , the chances are higher than 99% that it 's the left mouse button that 's causing the problem . The old mouse button has to be unsoldered and 2 wires have to be soldered in its place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed and the circuit board has to be lifted out of the plastic case and flipped upside down . <p> Now that the circuit board has been flipped , the left mouse button is now at the bottom right of the diagram . <p> What you now have to do is unsolder the two connections and remove the pushbutton switch from the underside of the board . <p> Now you have to solder 2 thin wires to the same two terminals where the switch used to be . Keep the wires thin because the holes in those solder terminals are pretty small . <p> Once you solder those wires to the circuit board , seal up the mouse , making sure you can access both of those wires . <p> At the left is the re-assembled mouse with the left and right plastic mouse buttons still unattached . <p> Before going any further , you could use the newly attached wires to act just like a mouse button . Strip some insulation from the two ends and when you want a left mouse click , touch the two wires together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the mouse in this manner is pretty awkward and so we need to find a faster and easier way to connect and disconnect two wires . <p> There are probably many solutions to connecting the two wires but here is one way . Two small holes were drilled into the mouse ( see red arrows ) and then a bare number 14 wire was placed into those holes . For extra security , one end of the wire was heated and melted into the plastic so that it would remain tight and not rattle around . ( You can use a soldering iron for this , but remember to heat just the wire and do n't let the tip touch the plastic . ) One of the recently attached thin wires was then soldered to the other end of the number 14 wire . <p> For the other connection , braided #18 wire was used and the other thin wire was soldered to this . <p> As for using the mouse , you 'll probably have to adjust the top wire quite a bit but eventually you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now easier than it was originally . <p> Well , as you can see , after just a few days I decided to " modify the modification " . It does look better when it 's completely sealed up and I also decided to remove the right mouse switch as well . <p> That 's a nail that 's been melted into the mouse and is connected to the " common " side of both mouse buttons . The braided wire is soldered to the left mouse button terminal and the solid wire connects to the right . <p> As for the plastic mouse buttons , since I removed the switches that were beneath them , they are now connected to nothing . <p> Okay , maybe the appearance of the mouse still is n't that appealing but the important advantage of this modification is the greater ease you will gain in using the mouse . <p> Yes , just a few days elapsed and it was time for another modification . This time I used some sheet metal ( although I should have searched for something a little better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this modification is that the only requirement for the materials you use is that they be conducting and this should leave you with a huge amount of choices . <p> Since this modification permits the use of a wide variety of different materials , I decided to use a U.S. quarter . ( For the first time I 'd say this looks pretty good does n't it ? ) <p> The quarter is not just sitting on the mouse and has been " burned in " to give it greater stability . <p> Maybe the mouse would look better if it had n't undergone four modifications . Wow , that plastic has been drilled , bolted and burned a great number of times and it does show does n't it ? <p> With this mod ( and the previous one ) , the mouse has become " ambidextrous " . Yes , a left-handed or right-handed person should be able to use this equally well - and there 's no need to go to the control panel and change the " buttons " from right-handed to left-handed . <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make an appearance ? <p> Deciding to make a break with the past ( well not really ) , the quarter on the mouse has now been replaced by a half dollar . Quite a radical change in design huh ? <p> This time the coin was " burned " into the mouse until it was flush with the plastic . This makes the mouse much more comfortable to use . I suppose the coin being flush with the plastic would also make the mouse look better - if it had n't been subjected to so many modifications . <p> S u m m a r y <p> So , after all that work what are the benefits of doing this ? <p> ? The mouse is now silent . ( and I ca n't possibly think of a reason why anyone really needs to hear a mouse click . ) <p> ? Using the mouse is so much easier . Granted , pushing a mouse button does n't require the strength of Arnold Schwarzenegger , but then again , think of how many times per day you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( particularly clicking with the index finger ) , can cause medical problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome . I have n't conducted any extensive medical research on this but it seems this modification would definitely reduce the risk of acquiring any neurological problems . <p> ? You are no longer restricted just to using your index finger and you can now use two or more fingers . <p> ? The mouse has lost its " right hand / left hand " orientation and so you really do n't have to go to the Control Panel to change from " right hand " to " left hand " . <p> ? This modification allows tremendous freedom for you to place the left click " button " ( actually two wires ) and right click " button " ( another two wires ) just about anyplace . <p> ? Since there are so many materials that conduct electricity , this opens up a lot of possibilities for materials and objects you could use . Perhaps you could replace the #14 wire with a nail . With a small modifcation , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Can this modification produce a functional mouse that can be used every day just as if it were a " real " mouse ? Yes . In fact I 'm using one right now . <p> Good luck with your modification . <p> I n s t r u c t i o n s <p> When doing modifications such as these , there are some problems that could arise . <p> Damage could be done just by disassembling and re-assembling the mouse . <p> Remember that the soldering iron gets very hot and accidentally placing it next to an electronic component can destroy it . <p> Using too much time when soldering or de-soldering can cause damage to the circuit board . <p> Circuit board terminals can get " worn out " by too much soldering and de-soldering . <p> Because this mouse underwent four modifications , what were once the switch button terminals became damaged . Basically , there was no copper remaining and so a proper connection could not be made . I found one solution for this ( see photo ) . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one circuit board and there is usually a ribbon cable connecting one board to the other . Eventually I found which wires attached to the mouse button switch terminals and so I used a knife to separate and remove the insulation from wires #2 and #5 . I attached and soldered two wires to these points and these newly soldered wires are now quite secure .

The button numbers correspond to the nine example problems further down the page . The " light years " and " Parsecs " buttons are for input only . Whenever distance is calculated , it will always be shown in light years and parsecs . <p> The system of classifying stars by their brightness originated with the Greek astronomer Hipparchus ( 190 BC - 120 BC ) who categorized stars into six magnitudes , the brightest were classified as magnitude 1 and the stars just barely visible to the human eye were designated as magnitude 6 . In the nineteenth century , the British astronomer Norman Pogson ( 1829 - 1891 ) proposed a system in which a difference of five magnitudes would be exactly equal to 100 . Also , with more modern methods of determining brightness , some stars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . So , in astronomy , brightness is expressed in magnitudes with each magnitude change equal to the 5th root of 100 or 2.5119 or a more exact figure of : <p> Also , the brighter an object the smaller the magnitude and the dimmer an object the larger the magnitude . <p> Apparent ( or visual ) magnitude is based upon an object 's brightness as it appears from Earth . <p> Inverse Square Law <p> A very important concept in astronomy , physics and a great many other studies , is the inverse square law which states that when a force ( such as gravity ) or a type of energy ( such as light ) radiates from a source , its intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source . For example the Earth is one astronomical unit of distance from the Sun . If it were at 2 astronomical units , then the Sun would be one quarter ( + ) as bright , at three astronomical units it would be one ninth ( ? ) as bright . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another type called absolute magnitude which is based upon an object 's true or intrinsic brightness . The Sun has an extremely bright magnitude but this is due to the fact that it is very close to the Earth . If all stars were to be seen at the same distance , then the ONLY factor affecting its magnitude would be its intrinsic brightness . <p> Astronomers have chosen the distance of ten parsecs ( 32.6156 Light Years ) as the arbitrary point at which all stars would be compared.Every star that is less than 10 parsecs from the Earth will always have an apparent magnitude that is brighter than its absolute magnitude ( if m &lt; M , distance &lt; 10 parsecs ) . Every star that is greater than 10 parsecs from the Earth will always have an absolute magnitude that is brighter than its apparent magnitude ( if m &gt; M , distance &gt; 10 parsecs ) . <p> Luminosity <p> Luminosity is another way to express brightness . Here the Sun is given the arbitrary value of 1 and a star twice as bright as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is half as bright as the Sun has a luminosity of .5 and so on . <p> As is the case with absolute magnitude , luminosity is also based strictly on the object 's actual ( or intrinsic ) brightness and the object 's distance has nothing to do with it . This is similar to the way in which a light bulb 's brightness is rated . A 100 watt bulb looks very bright when it is just a few feet away but if your neighbor down the street is lighting his porch with a 100 watt bulb , it looks a heck of a lot dimmer does n't it ? Nonetheless , they are both 100 watt bulbs and have equal brightness or luminosity . Since absolute magnitude and luminosity are both based on a star 's actual or intrinsic brightness , if you know one , you can calculate the other . ( See examples 2 &amp; 3 ) . <p> Magnitude Formulas <p> Now that we have the necessary definitions , we can derive some magnitude formulas . Yes , we could easily look up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how they are generated . ( If not , you can always use the calculator . ) From the definitions we learned that raising the 5th root of 100 to the power of the magnitude is the way in which brightness can be compared . For example , a second magnitude star is 15.85 times brighter than a fifth magnitude star . ( 2.5119 = 15.85 ) We know a star 's brightness as observed from ten parsecs is defined as its absolute magnitude . From the inverse square law , we know that brightness decreases by the square of the distance . Knowing these relationships , we can set up a formula : <p> We 'll have to use a little algebra to make that formula more user-friendly : <p> That 's a much easier formula to manipulate is n't it ? Dividing both sides by 5 we obtain : <p> ( 5 + ( m - M ) ) 5 = log10 ( distance in parsecs ) <p> Exchanging the left and right hand sides of that equation produces : <p> log10 ( distance in parsecs ) = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the equation to the power of ten , the left side of the equation is now 10log10 ( distance ) which simply becomes distance . We will keep the right side equation raised to the power of ten and the equation is now : <p> 9 Magnitude ProblemsRemember that these problems are numbered to correspond with the eight calculator buttons . <p> 1 ) The star Sirius has an apparent magnitude of -1.46 and the star Regulus has an apparent magnitude of 1.36 How much of a brightness difference is this ? To calculate the brightness difference we 'll need to use this formula : <p> magnitude1 - magnitude2 = 1.36 - ( -1.46 ) = 2.82 <p> Designating the 5th root of 100 as ' n ' and raising it to the power of the magnitude difference we calculate : <p> brightness = n2.82 = 13.428 <p> Rounding down to 3 significant figures , this means that Sirius is 13.4 times brighter than Regulus . <p> 1b ) If the variable star Mira has been observed from a maximum brightness of magnitude 2.0 down to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that ? <p> 10.1 - 2.0 = 8.1 magnitudes <p> brightness = n8.1 = 1,737.8 <p> Rounding that to 2 significant figures makes this a brightness change of 1,700 . <p> 2 ) A brightness change of 30 equals how much of a change in magnitude ? To calculate the magnitude change we 'll start with a formula similar to the one shown in example 1 . <p> ( 2.511886 ... ) magnitude = brightness <p> Taking logs of both sides we get : <p> magnitude * log ( 2.511886 ... ) = log ( brightness ) <p> Solving for magnitude : <p> magnitude = log ( brightness ) .4 <p> Returning to our problem , we must calculate 30 brightness units in terms of magnitude . <p> magnitude = log ( 30 ) .4 <p> magnitude = 1.477121255 .4 magnitude = 3.6928 <p> 3 ) The star Vega has an absolute magnitude ( ' M ' ) of 0.58 what is its luminosity ? Absolute Magnitude and Luminosity are directly related but we have to see precisely how . We will have to change the brightness formula from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word ' Brightness ' and we 'll look up the absolute magnitude of the Sun which is 4.83 . A star of absolute magnitude 3.83 would be about 2.5119 times ( one magnitude ) brighter than the Sun and a star of absolute magnitude 2.83 would be 6.31 times ( two magnitudes or n ) brighter and so on . As can be seen , to calculate the luminosity , we raise the 5th root of 100 to the power of the magnitude difference and the formula is : <p> Since Vega is 4.25 magnitudes brighter ( 4.83 - 0.58 ) than the Sun , it has a luminosity of n4.25 which equals 50.119 or 50.1 to 3 significant figures . <p> 5 ) Measured from the Earth , the Sun has an apparent magnitude of -26.74 and is 4.848 x 10-6 parsecs distant . What would be its magnitude if it were 10 parsecs away ? Basically , this question is asking us to determine the absolute magnitude of the Sun and even though we already looked it up , let 's try calculating it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimmer than when it was at one astronomical unit . Using the inverse square law , we 'll have to divide the Sun 's present distance by 10 parsecs and square the result : <p> ( 4.848137 x 10-6 parsecs 10 parsecs ) 2 <p> equals 2.3504 x 10-13 which means the Sun 's absolute magnitude is going to be considerably dimmer than its apparent magnitude . We learned from example 1 that : <p> Brightness = n(magnitude) <p> In order to use this formula , we will have to take logarithms of both sides . <p> log ( Brightness ) = magnitude * log ( n ) <p> The log of the 5th root of 100 is .4 and so : <p> log ( Brightness ) = magnitude * .4 <p> magnitude = log ( Brightness ) / .4 Or <p> magnitude = 2.5 * log ( 2.350443 x 10-13 ) <p> magnitude = 2.5 * -12.62885 <p> magnitude = -31.57213 <p> That number represents how much dimmer the Sun will be at 10 parsecs . So to calculate the Sun 's absolute magnitude , we subtract that number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot easier and of course , it 's even easier just to use the calculator . <p> 6 ) The star Sirius has an absolute magnitude ( ' M ' ) of 1.45 and is 8.60 light years ( 2.64 parsecs ) away . What is its luminosity and apparent magnitude ? The first part of the question can be solved with the absolute magnitude to luminosity formula : <p> Luminosity = n ( 4.83 -1.45 ) = n(3.38) = 22.5 <p> To solve for apparent magnitude , we could use the inverse square law but as we saw in example 4 , it 's a lot easier to use the formula we generated : <p> 9 ) You are travelling in outer space and you measure the Sun 's magnitude to be 2.75 . How far away from the Sun are you ? Solving the Sun 's absolute magnitude and luminosity is easy because they are always 4.83 and 1 respectively . 72766 @qwx932766

If you have no experience with wiring OR if you want suggestions on what supplies to buy , click here . <p> Loading <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp As is the case with the " Lincoln Cent Project " , electricity is another good example of science being part of our everyday lives . Look around you . Your television , your clock radio , the computer you are using and many other electrical appliances are all utilizing electrical power . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp To explain things as briefly as possible , electricity is a flow of electrons . Substances that allow electrons to flow freely are called conductors and those that do n't are called insulators . <p> E L E M E N T A R Y &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp C I R C U I T S <p> Diagram number 1 illustrates an extremely simple circuit . ( For the moment , ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The battery is represented by 4 lines ( the longer line being positive and the shorter one negative ) . Starting from the negative end of the battery , electrons " circle " through one wire , pass through the light bulb , pass through the other wire and then return to the battery thereby completing the circuit . See ? Quite simple . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp This is all well and good but there are 2 drawbacks to this circuit 1 ) the light always stays on and 2 ) the power is constantly being used . How can we turn the light bulb ' off ' ? Well , we could unscrew the bulb from the socket but in the real world this is very inconvenient . ( Light bulbs are inside fixtures , on ceilings and so on ) . Perhaps we could disconnect the power at the source . This too is very inconvenient . You would have to go down to your basement to shut the power off . Or - much more dangerous - you would have to disconnect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Is there a safe way to interrupt the electron flow without physically touching the wire ? Sure . It is called a SWITCH ! ! ! <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The inside of a typical household wall switch has a strip of metal ( B ) , making contact with point ' A ' , completing the circuit and thereby conducting electricity to the light . This would obviously be the ' ON ' position . When the insulated lever is moved down to the ' OFF ' position , it pushes the metal strip away from point ' A ' , breaking the circuit and turning the light ' OFF ' . This type of switch ( having a lever which " flips " it on and off ) is called a toggle switch . <p> Because of being well-insulated and mounted in a box , household switches are a safe way for turning electrical devices on and off . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Finally , let 's talk about that dotted line in Diagram 1 . Now what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch OR if they were connected with a wire or other conductor ? Well , the light bulb would turn ' off ' , the wires and the battery would get very warm very fast and the electrons would simply travel from the battery to point A to point B and then back to the battery . Notice that in this new circuit , the electrons are traveling a path ( or circuit ) that is shorter than the original one . Hence you have just learned what a " short circuit " is and how its name is derived ! Short circuits are dangerous . They cause wires to heat , circuit breakers to ' trip ' and can even start fires . <p> S W I T C H E S <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp There are many different types of switches : toggle , rotary , pushbutton , " rocker " , " pull-chain " , slide , magnetic , mercury , timer , voice-activated , " touch-sensitive " , and many others . Heck , even the Clapper ? is another type of switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch " ( rarely seen nowadays ) is the type that most easily demonstrates the functioning of a switch . Old sci-fi movies ( " Frankenstein ( 1931 ) " or " Young Frankenstein ( 1974 ) " , for example ) , made extensive use of these switches in the laboratory scenes . <p> Today , use of knife switches has been confined to 1 ) heavy-duty industrial applications and 2 ) demonstration purposes - science projects for example . The knife switch has a metal lever , insulated at the ' free end ' that comes into contact with a metal ' slot ' . Since the electrical connections are exposed , knife switches are never seen in household wiring . <p> Referring to Diagram 2 , the wiring is very similar to Diagram 1 except a switch has been added . Compare this to the Typical Household Light Switch diagram . Pretty much the same principle at work would n't you say ? This type of switch is a Single Pole Single Throw ( or SPST ) . This means that it controls one wire ( pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , this is an on/off switch , but a ' throw ' only counts when a connection is made . ' Off ' is not considered a ' throw ' . Also notice that only 1 wire has to be switched . ( Following the circuit from one end of the battery to the other you can see why this is so ) . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp As it is , this circuit alone could be your science project . A variation could be substituting a push-button switch and putting a ' buzzer ' or ' doorbell ' where the light is . Now you have a good demonstration of how a doorbell is wired . Pushbutton switches are usually " momentary on " . That is to say the connection is made only when you press the button . There are " momentary off " pushbutton switches , but using one in a doorbell circuit would mean the bell would be constantly on until someone pressed the button . Impractical do n't you think ? ( The comedian Tim Conway joked that his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was silence someone would say " Hey somebody 's at the door " ) . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp A practical use of the momentary off switch is the " mute button " on your telephone . If a momentary on switch were used , it would be very annoying to press the button constantly as you talked and released it only for muting . This shows how each type of switch has its specific applications . <p> The above diagram shows an interesting variation of doorbell wiring . The 2 doorbell buttons do not have to be right next to each other . One button could be at a front door and the other at a side door . If you follow the circuit , you can see that pressing either button will cause the doorbell to ring . The 2 switches are said to be wired in parallel . <p> The burglar alarm circuit at left employs magnetic switches . These switches and their associated magnets are generally mounted on doors and windows . Notice that Switch 1 and Switch 2 are wired in series.Both switches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete and for the bulb to light . ( This would indicate the ' armed ' status of this burglar alarm . ) Magnetic switches come in 2 varieties - " Normally Closed " and " Normally Open " . These 2 terms describe the state of the switch when it is NOT being controlled by the magnet . The switches in this diagram are the " Normally Open " type and because the magnets are far enough away , the switches are in the ' open ' state . If the magnets were brought closer , the bulb would go on and the circuit would be " armed " . At this point , moving either magnet would make the bulb go out and the alarm would be triggered . ( For the sake of simplicity , the activated alarm circuit has not been drawn ) . An important point to note is that cutting the wires at any point would also make the bulb go out and trip the alarm . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp The next type of switch ( no diagram ) is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used when there are 2 ' live ' lines to switch but can only turn on or off ( single throw ) . These switches are not used much and are usually found in 240 volt applications . <p> Single Pole Double Throw Switches <p> Diagram 3 makes use of the Single Pole Double Throw Switch . The common terminal is the middle terminal in the SPDT Knife Switch or if you are using a household switch , it would be the brass colored terminal . ( the other 2 would be silver colored ) . This circuit clearly demonstrates what happens when the SPDT switch is moved back and forth . Light A goes on and B goes off , B goes on and A goes off and so forth . You can see that this popular switch would have many practical applications : the transmit/receive button on a " 2-way " radio , the " high/low beam " switch for your car headlights , the pulse/tone dialing switch on your telephone , and so on . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp If you are using the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " position , which an ordinary wall switch would NOT have in which case you will need to add an SPST switch for shutting this circuit off . ( In electronics work , many SPDT switches have a middle position in which the electricity is turned off to BOTH circuits . It is an SPDT center off switch . Also , some electronic SPDT switches have a " center on " position . The best example of this type of switch is the " pickup " selector on an electric guitar which can choose the rhythm , treble or both pickups for 3 varieties of sounds ) . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Diagram 4 ( below ) depicts what is probably the most common use for the SPDT switch - the 3 way light switching circuit . Electricians incorrectly call the SPDT switch a " 3 way switch " . The proper terminology should be " three terminal switch " . However the term 3-way switch has stuck and it 's a misnomer we 'll just have to live with . <p> So , how does this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of a stairway and Switch 2 is at the top . Suppose Switch 1 is in a ' down ' position ( B &amp; C connected ) and Switch 2 is in an ' up ' position ( D &amp; E connected ) . The light bulb is off . Now someone comes to the bottom of the stairs and flips Switch 1 ' up ' . If you follow the circuit you can see why the light bulb would now turn on because A &amp; B and D &amp; E are connected . When the person reaches the top of the stairs , Switch 2 is flipped ' down ' , E &amp; F are now connected and so the light bulb goes off . Another person shows up at the bottom of the stairs and flips Switch 1 ' down ' , connecting B &amp; C thereby turning the light on again . The person reaches the top of the stairs , flips Switch 2 ' up ' connecting D &amp; E and the light bulb goes off . Notice that in the case of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstroke turns the bulb off . If you have such switches in your house OR if you have purchased household wall switches for this circuit , you now see the reason why they do NOT have the words on and off printed on them . &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Do n't you think this switching arrangement would make a great science project ? <p> The Double Pole Double Throw Switch <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp A simple way to think of this switch is imagining 2 SPDT switches side by side with the ' handles ' attached to each other . Perhaps the most popular use for this switch is ' phase or polarity reversal ' . So , how does the DPDT switch accomplish this ? First , you have to wire the 2 ' top ' and 2 ' bottom ' terminals in a ' criss-cross ' fashion . The top 2 terminals become the input and the middle two terminals become the ouput . Now , referring to the bottom left diagram , the switch is in the ' up ' position , W &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarity is maintained because the input and output are directly connected . No problem seeing that right ? <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Now let 's see what happens when the switch is in the ' down ' position ( right diagram ) . The + input goes from the ' W ' terminal , down to the lower right and then up to the ' Z ' terminal . The negative input goes from the ' X ' terminal and out through the ' Y ' terminal . See what has happened ? With one flip of a switch , polarity has been reversed . What applications does this have ? For one thing , electric guitar players use this type of switch to put one pickup out of phase with the other , producing a thin , ' squawcky ' , ' inside-out ' kind of sound . In the ' old days ' before 3 prong plugs , power switches on some electrical devices used this switching arrangement to switch polarity in case the plug was in the outlet the " wrong way " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very common ) use is to put this switch between 3-way switches so that the same light may be switched from many different locations . Referring to Diagram 4 , if A &amp; B and E &amp; F were connected , the bulb would be off . But now think of the wires going from A to D and C to F. If their connections were reversed , ( A to F , C to D ) , the light bulb would turn on again . So , how would we be able to reverse the polarity of these 2 wires ? By using the polarity reversing switch ! ( See Diagram 5 below ) . <p> &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Incidentally , electricians have once again stuck us with another misnomer by calling this a " 4-way " switch . Can you see what the 4-way switch is ? It is a DPDT switch , wired for phase reversal without the bottom 2 terminals exposed ( they do n't have to be ) . If you can buy a 4-way switch , great . If not , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp Also , you do n't have to limit yourself to using just one 4-way switch . If you were to attach a second 4-way switch from the Y and Z terminals of the first switch to the W2 and X2 terminals of the second switch , you could have the same light switched from a 4th location . ( See Diagram 6 ) . <p> Or you could add a 5th or 6th switch , etc . Now would n't that make an impressive science project ?

@@101966428 @6166428/ <p> Sometimes you may encounter an equation such as X3 = 70 , which is not immediately solvable . There is a branch of mathematics called numeric analysis which is specifically concerned with the solution of these equations , sometimes referred to as implicit equations or implicit functions . One of the procedures for solving such an equation is known as the Newton-Raphson Method , developed by British mathematicians Isaac Newton ( 1642-1727 ) and Joseph Raphson ( 1648-1715 ) . <p> Showing Newton 's Method Graphically <p> Demonstrating Newton 's Method by using graphs and mechanical calculations is the best way to illustrate the way it works .

This does n't even have to be a very good guess , so let 's say that x0 = 6 . <p> Solving for X1 <p> Next , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ x1 can be obtained by taking the slope at the point f ( x0 , y ) then drawing a tangent line through this point and extending it so that it intersects the x axis at x1 . <p> To determine the slope at f ( x0 , y ) we take the derivative of f(x) = X - 70 which is 3X then we input 6 ( the value of x0 ) into the derivative , yielding a slope value of 108 . When x = 6 the y value calculates to 146 . With these two pieces of information , we can calculate the value of x1 . The slope value of 108 means that every time the y value decreases by 108 , the x value decreases by one . At point x1 since the y value decreases from 146 to 0 , the x value decreases by 146 108 ( or about 1.35185185 ... ) which makes x1 equal to 6 minus 1.35185185 ... or 4.648148148 ... ( In the diagram above , note the blue line intersecting the x axis at x1 ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to get the value of X1 , we can now calculate the slope of the red tangent line , the value of y at f ( 4.648 ... , y ) and the value of X2 . <p> Once again we 'll use the derivative of f(x) , 3X , insert x1 = 4.648 ... and obtain the red line 's slope value of 64.8158 ... Putting x1 = 4.648 ... into the equation f(x) = X -70 , yields a y value of 30.424 ... Again , we have generated two pieces of information , by which we can calculate the value of x2 . The slope value of 64.8158 ... means that every time the y value decreases by 64.8158 ... , the x value decreases by one . At point x2 since the y value decreases from 64.8158 ... to 0 , the x value decreases by 30.424 ... 64.8158 ... ( or about .46939 ... ) which yields a value of x2 = 4.648 ... minus .46939 which equals 4.1787 ...

So , now that we have determined that angle AOD equals .883091 radians ( or 50.5974 degrees ) , we can calculate the remaining parts of the circle . <p> The central angle AOB equals 2 * 50.5974 or 101.195 degrees . <p> The radius = line AE / sin(AOD) radius = 7 / sin ( 50.5974 ) radius = 9.0591 Now that we have this information , the rest of the circle can be easily solved .

This was formulated by the German-American physicist and mathematician Albert Einstein ( 1879-1955 ) in his Special Theory of Relativity .

So , now we 'll discuss the construction of magic squares where n=4 , 8 , 12 and so on . <p> A 4 by 4 magic square is a doubly even magic square , one of the three types of magic square . The other two types are : ? odd ( where n=3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , etc. ) ? singly even ( even but not a multiple of 4 where n=6 , 10 , 14 , 18 , 22 , etc . ) <p> Now , let 's discuss the construction of doubly even magic squares , starting with the simplest , the 4 row by 4 column one . To determine the sum of any normal magic square we use the formula : <p> So , for the 4 by 4 magic square , each row , each column and both diagonals would sum to 4 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a simple , easy to remember way to make a 4 by 4 magic square . In a 4 by 4 grid write the numbers 1 through 16 from left to right . Now " flip " the numbers in the diagonals ( the red lines ) . That is to say , exchange 16 &amp; 1 , 6 &amp; 11 , 13 &amp; 4 and 10 &amp; 7 , and you 'll have a magic square totalling 34 . <p> Unfortunately , the above method only works for the 4 by 4 square and so we 'll have to learn another way for constructing doubly magic squares of any size . <p> Looking at the diagram below , divide the square into four " mini-squares " - squares at the four corners , the size of each equals n/4 . A 4 by 4 magic square has mini-squares that are 1 by 1 . ( note the 4 red squares ) . For an 8 by 8 the mini-squares are 2 by 2 , for a 12 by 12 the mini-squares are 3 by 3 and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square the size of which is n/2 . For a 4 by 4 square the size would be 2.

( see the square at the right ) This method works perfectly but gets a bit confusing with the " mini-squares " , the large square and the formula for each . <p> Let 's try building an 8 by 8 square with a different approach . For this method , we will divide up the square into smaller squares , each of which has a side equal to n/4 . We will place these 2 by 2 squares along both diagonals of the square . ( see illustration ) <p> Counting from 1 to 64 , starting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the red squares ( while leaving the others blank ) produces this partially completed magic square : <p> Starting at the top leftmost cell , while counting from 64 then backwards to 1 , insert this number whenever a blank cell is encountered . For example , we ca n't fill in 64 or 63 because 1 and 2 are in those cells . However , when we reach 62 , 61 , 60 and 59 we can fill in those numbers because those squares are blank . Then we continue without filling in 58 , 57 , 56 and 55 but 54 , 53 , 52 and 51 are blank cells and do get filled in . Continuing in this way , until the bottom right cell is encountered , the magic square is now complete with each row , column and diagonal summing to 260 . <h> A Third Solution <p> This is similar to the previous two solutions but is much easier to understand and to memorize . This time the n=8 square is divided into rectangles , each of which has a dimension of n/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the numbers 1 through 64 if the number is within a rectangle . <p> Following these rules , the partially-completed magic square will look like this : <p> Starting from the top left and counting backwards from 64 to 1 , fill in the blank cells of the square and you have the finished square . <p> The 32 by 32 magic square shown below was also created by using the " rectangle method " . The numbers in red are the ones that are in sequential order and the blue numbers are the reverse order numbers . The " magic sum " of this square is 16,400.

Click on the " Average Distance and Eccentricity " button , enter these numbers , click " CALCULATE " then you will see its perihelion and aphelion distances along with its perimeter , area , foci distance and so on . <p> It seems in geometry that the ellipse is the " forgotten stepbrother " of the circle even though the ellipse is far more interesting . First some definitions . <p> An ellipse is the locus of points the sum of whose distances from two fixed points , called foci , is a constant . Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Line of Apsides ) . Lines AO and OB are the Semi-Major axes.Line CD is the Minor Axis and is the perpendicular bisector of the Major Axis . Lines OC and OD are the Semi-Minor axes . Points f1 and f2 are the foci of the ellipse . Points A and B are called apses . Johannes Kepler 's First Law states that the planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun located at one of the foci . If we were dealing with planetary orbits and we were to say the Sun were at f1 then : Line A f1 would be the perihelion distance Line f1 B would be the aphelion distance and Line AO is the planet 's average ( or mean ) distance and would be one half of the major axis . <p> The eccentricity of an ellipse equals : <p> As the eccentricity value goes from 0 to 1 , the ellipse goes from circular to highly elongated . <p> Surprisingly , unlike the calculation of a circle 's perimeter , calculating the cirumference of an ellipse is much more complicated and requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no formula that will precisely generate an ellipse 's circumference . The most accurate equation for an ellipse 's circumference was found by Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan ( 1887-1920 ) ( see the above graphic for the formula ) and it is this formula that is used in the calculator . <p> The eccentricity of an ellipse is not such a good indicator of its shape . For example , Pluto has one of the most eccentric orbits in the solar system with an eccentricity value of .245 . This might create the impression that the orbit is somewhat flattened . Actually , by using the calculator , we see that the minor to major axis ratio is about .97 which is practically circular . <p> We drew a graphic ( see below ) to show the shape of an ellipse over a wide range of eccentricities . As you can see , even at an eccentricity of .3 an ellipse still appears as if it is circular , and this is an eccentricity that is even greater than Pluto 's . <p> Drawing Ellipses <p> The traditional way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or thread , place two thumbtacks in a sheet of paper , put the loop over the thumbtacks and then with a pen , keeping the loop tight at all times , go completely around the thumbtacks . <p> Referring to the ellipse at the top of the page , the triangle C f1 f2 would represent the loop of string , the thumbtacks would be at f1 and f2 and the pen would start out at point C. <p> This works fine , except you are not exactly sure of what the ellipse is going to look like ( how eccentric , minor to major axis ratio , etc . ) . Therefore this calculator will determine how far apart the thumbtacks have to be for a required eccentricity . <p> Example : If you make a loop of string 10 inches long , and want an ellipse with an eccentricity of .5 , enter these figures in the calculator and your answer will be a thumbtack distance of 6.66666 inches . <p> Other Ellipse Properties <p> Referring to the ellipse diagram at the top of the page , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that f1 and f2 are spots on the table . If you were to shoot the ball from anyplace over spot f1 , the ball would then go over spot f2 , then f1 and so on.If you shot the ball through line Af1 , the ball would go through line f2B and no matter how many times it is deflected , the ball will never cross line f1f2 . Conversely , if you were to shoot the ball anywhere through f1f2 , it will continue to cross line f1f2 with each deflection and will never travel through Lines Af1 or f2B . If we were talking about rays of light and the inside of the ellipse were reflective , the same behavior would be exhibited by the light , just as in the pool table example . <p> You may have heard of " whispering galleries " in which one person stands in a certain spot and whispers while another person stands at another spot and can hear the other person perfectly .

The capacitor in the circuit is for the tone control and these values usually are from .02 to .047 mfd ( short for microfarad ) . <p> The top diagram shows the way in which Fender wires its volume control . ( This is the best way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses 250K " pots " and .02 mfd capacitors . The bottom diagram shows the wiring that Gibson uses for its volume controls . ( This is the best wiring method when you are using a volume and tone control for each pickup ) . Gibson generally uses 500K " pots " , .047 mfd capacitors for the neck tone and .02 mfd capacitors for the bridge tone control . <p> SPDT Switch <p> Rewiring a guitar can dramatically change its sound . If you are unsure of basic switch terminology , please go to this tutorial first : Switches <p> Pictured above are two Single Pole Double Throw ( SPDT ) switch diagrams . ALL SPDT switches have their common terminal in the middle and they ALL function as shown in the above diagram . In position ' A ' , the center terminal connects to the top terminal . In position ' B ' , the center terminal connects to the bottom terminal . <p> There are 2 special cases of SPDT switches that have the functions as shown in diagrams A &amp; B plus they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminals ( diagram C ) OR the common terminal connects to neither terminal ( D ) . These are called the " SPDT center on switch " ( C ) and the " SPDT center off switch " ( D ) . These switches are called center on or off because this third switch position is located in between ' A ' and ' B ' . For example , if this were a toggle switch , this middle or ' center ' position would occur when the switch lever was straight up . Even though these switches have 3 positions , they are still considered double throw because another ' throw ' implies a connection to yet another terminal and as we can see , diagrams C &amp; D have the same number of terminals as A &amp; B. <p> The best example of an " SPDT center on switch " is the pickup switch used on guitars with 2 pickups ( the Gibson Les Paul ? , the Gibson SG ? , etc ) . <p> Pictured above is the pickup switching diagram for a 2 pickup guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch ( SPDT ) center on switch . The middle connection is the ' common ' terminal and this is where you connect the output wire . ( This is the wire that goes to the volume control or may go directly to the output jack ) . Basically , when the switch lever is in one position , the neck pickup is active and in the other position , the bridge position is active . In the ' middle ' switch position , both pickups will be ' on ' . This SPDT center on switching arrangement is extremely common on 2 pickup guitars . <p> DPDT Switch <p> ALL DPDT switches have their center terminals as the common terminals and they ALL work like diagrams A and B. In position ' A ' , the common terminals connect to the top terminals and in position ' B ' , they connect to the bottom terminals . <p> There are 2 special cases of DPDT switches , pictured in diagrams ' C ' and ' D ' . Diagram C shows the middle position of the more common type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminals connect to the top and bottom terminals simultaneously . This is the typical DPDT center on switch that you would find at Radio Shack and most electronic parts suppliers . <p> Diagram D shows the middle position of a highly specialized type of DPDT center-on switch . Here the common terminals connect as shown in the diagram . Some refer to this as a " DPDT on/on/on switch " but as you can see , the switch in Diagram C could be referred to in the same way . The biggest use of this switch is for wiring humbuckers in series / coil-cut / parallel . This is the only way you can get all 3 options in one switch . <p> Now that you know about switches , let 's talk very briefly about : <p> Guitar Pickups <p> If you read about relays , you will learn that an electromagnet is a chunk of metal ( usually iron ) , wrapped with a great deal of wire . When an electrical current flows though the wire , a magnetic field is produced . A guitar pickup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrap a huge amount of wire around it ( thousands of turns , usually ) . When guitar strings ( or any metal ) moves through the magnetic field , an electrical current is produced . <p> In the next section , we 'll discuss various switching arrangements of a guitar 's pickups so that a great many tones can be produced . Just remember that : ? Any modification you do to your guitar will void the warranty . ? Some of these modifications will change the appearance of your guitar . ? If you are not sure of your electronic skills you may actually do damage to your guitar for which we will not be responsible . ? Similarly , you may alter the guitar in such a manner that it becomes unsafe electrically in which case you could be harmed . Again , we will not be responsible for any injuries . <p> 3 Single Coils Wired In Parallel <p> This diagram shows 3 single coils wired in parallel , allowing seven tone choices . The typical 3 single coil guitar contains a 5 way rotary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single coil ; neck and middle in parallel and middle and bridge in parallel . This modification will give you 2 more sounds - all 3 pickups in parallel and Neck and Bridge in parallel . <p> 3 Single Coils Wired In Series <p> This diagram shows 3 single coils wired in series , allowing seven tone choices . Note that the switches are wired such that they shunt ( or short-circuit ) the coils so that they get bypassed . With this modification , you will not get any parallel sounds which are so typical of the " Fender sound " . ( For example , " Sultans of Swing " is played with the middle and bridge pickups in parallel ) . The pickups in series gives you a fuller sound with much higher output , which is good for distortion . If you want a more versatile modification , go to the Wolf Wire ? Modification which will give you series choices , parallel , single coil , and out of phase options . <p> Humbuckers <p> Humbucking pickups are essentially 2 single coils right next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how this pickup cancels the hum , click here . Since there are 2 coils , you can have up to 4 wires with which to work , providing you with a great many tone options . Almost all independent pickup companies manufacture humbuckers with 4 conductor cable . Stock guitar humbuckers rarely have 4 wires coming out of them but sometimes it is possible to convert 2 wire humbuckers to 4 wire types . This is an exacting procedure with little room for error but the tone rewards can be well worth the effort . If you really want to give this a try , then click here . <p> Pickup wire colors vary for each manufacturer . Two of the most popular manufacturers are Dimarzio and Seymour Duncan and their wiring codes are : <p> The traditional method for wiring a humbucker is to wire the coils in series : <p> If you wanted to wire a 4 conductor Dimarzio or Seymour Duncan in this way , just look at the diagram . Solder the 2 " middle wires " together , tape the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be very careful when working with 4 conductor wiring . The colors and polarity are very important . You could easily make a mistake and wire an " out-of-phase " arrangement which would have low output , a squawky , thin sound AND the humbucker would NOT be hum canceling . <p> Another humbucker advantage is that the 2 coils make it have a much higher output than a single coil pickup . This gives them a much fuller sound and produces a " fat " warm overdriven sound . <p> Wiring the coils in parallel will produce a brighter tone ( with somewhat less volume than series ) , but will still be humbucking . <p> Again , the humbucker could be permanently wired in the manner shown in the above diagram . However , if you permanently wire the humbucker for series or parallel , you are seriously limiting your tone options . <p> Rather than settling on just one permanent wiring , a very good choice is to put a series/parallel switch on a humbucker . <p> The black line you see in the diagram is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the upper right terminal . This wire is necessary to connect the 2 " middle wires " so that the humbucker can be connected in series . The kind of switch you 'll need is a Double Pole Double Throw with no center position . ( See diagrams A &amp; B in the above DPDT switch section ) . In this way you can switch tones right in the middle of a song and you can go from a bright tone to a fuller , louder tone that is quite suitable for overdriving an amplifier . <p> Yet another tone option for humbuckers is the coil-cut switch . Here you get a very bright sound but the output will be less than if it were wired in series and you no longer have hum canceling . Since you are using just one half of the humbucker , " coil-cut " sounds best when using a high output pickup ( DiMarzio " X2N " , DiMarzio " Distortion " , Seymour Duncan " Invader " , Seymour Duncan " Distortion " , etc ) . A coil cut switch is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of connecting one end of an SPST switch to that junction that was created for series wiring and connecting the other end of the switch to ground . So , we now have another 2 tone humbucker arrangement that can easily be switched back and forth between 2 tone options . <p> Still , if you have a humbucker with 4 conductors , you might want to go all the way and wire it for all 3 of the tone options we have discussed . The best way to do this is with a special DPDT on/on/on switch ( see Diagram D in the previous section ) . <p> This is a " neat " arrangement because you get the 3 best humbucker tone options all in one switch . Still , you might have trouble finding this type of switch OR you might not like having a 3 position toggle switch because it is hard to switch to the middle coil cut position OR you 'd rather have a smooth parallel to series switching option . <p> If that is the case , use a standard DPDT Switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use a separate SPST switch for the coil cut option . <p> This arrangement does have all the advantages mentioned above . However it has the disadvantages in that the coil-cut switch will only work when the DPDT switch is set at the ' series ' position and it may require another hole to be drilled in your guitar for that additional switch . <p> Phase Reversal Switch <p> For single coils OR humbuckers . <p> Another tone option for a guitarist is to put a pickup out of phase with another pickup , producing a thin " inside-out " squawky kind of sound . When 2 pickups are in phase , they work together and reinforce each other . When they are out of phase the 2 pickups are working against one another and the resulting sound is the " leftovers " from these cancelations . The closer the 2 pickups are , the greater the cancelations , the thinner the sound and the lesser the volume . Therefore , the neck and bridge pickups out of phase is the best choice for this type of sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to a regular sound ) , we use a phase reversal switch ( see above diagram ) . ( For an explanation of how this switch works , go to Basic Electricity and scroll down to the ' Double Pole Double Throw ' section ) . It is important to state that you do not have to use 2 phase switches because reversing the leads of both pickups would put them back in phase ! ! Wiring the phase switch is fairly simple . Solder 2 wires in the criss-cross manner shown in the diagram . In the guitar cavity , unsolder the 2 bridge pickup leads ; solder the phase switch " Out " leads to the exact same spot where the pickup leads were ; solder the bridge pickup leads to the " From Pickup " terminals on the phase switch . Mount the switch , close up the guitar and start enjoying the new sound you just created ! <p> Humbucking Pickup Out Of Phase With Itself <p> As stated previously , the closer 2 coils are to one another , the greater the cancelations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , wiring a humbucker out of phase with itself is going to produce a lot of cancelations , a huge reduction in volume and a very thin sound . If that 's not enough , the pickup will not be humbucking either . Still there are some people that like this kind of sound . The best way to put a humbucker out of phase with itself is to wire the coils out of phase in series . ( see below ) <p> Just to make sure we " cover all the bases " , it is possible to wire a humbucker out of phase with itself in parallel . This produces the thinnest , lowest output of all possible phasing combinations . Still , for those that want to give this a try here is the wiring diagram .

@@101966482 @6166482/ <p> A science project about the Lincoln Cent ? Sure . After all , science is all around us in all aspects of our lives . One great benefit of this experiment is that the cost is literally pennies ! ! Before we begin , the coin is technically called a cent . Look at the reverse side ( the ' tails ' side ) . <p> It does n't say penny does it ? However , the word ' penny ' is so popular , we will use it for the rest of this discussion . <p> S I Z E <p> The diameter of the penny can be easily obtained by using a ruler . We measured it as .75 inches or 19 Millimeters . ( Do n't take our word for it though - try these measurements yourself . ) <p> Now determining the thickness is somewhat tougher is n't it ?

A more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a ruler - a micrometer . We used one and obtained a value of 1.27 mm ( or .05 inches ) for the thickness . <p> Now we can get a rough idea of its volume . The penny is a cylinder with an extremely low height . As with all cylinders , the formula is : <p> VOLUME = Pi * ( Radius ) 2 * height <p> VOLUME = 3.14159 * 9.5 * 9.5 * 1.27 <p> VOLUME = 360 cubic millimeters = .360 cubic centimeters . <p> You can recheck these figures - or recheck your own calculations - by going to the cylinder calculator . <p> An even more precise way for measuring the volume would be to use a measuring cup , a graduated cylinder or anything else used for measuring volume . <p> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; IMPORTANT &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; &lt; <p> If you use a measuring cup , make sure it is NEVER going to be used with food ! ! Please , no experiments with any food related equipment . <p> Okay now what ? Well , fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water and drop in a penny to see the volume rise . Of course the volume change would be minuscule . So , like the ruler experiment , why not drop in a great deal of pennies ( remembering exactly how many you used ) , see the volume difference , divide it by the number of pennies , and you have the volume ! If the volume is in Fluid Ounces and you want it in cubic centimetrs , just use the Ultra Converter . <p> M A S S <p> We want to keep this discussion relatively short and so we do n't want to present a long lecture concerning the concepts of mass and weight . These 2 terms are sometimes used interchangeably , but scientists always make a distinction between the two . ( It would be a good idea for you to research these concepts yourself - and the Internet has LOTS of information out there ) . Just to give you a rough idea about weight and mass - in space , astronauts are weightless but they are NOT massless . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an interesting change took place in 1982 . Prior to that year , pennies were 95% Copper and 5% zinc . After 1982 the composition became 97.6% zinc and 2.4% copper . ( 1982 pennies can be either one of these . Oh and in 1943 pennies were made of a steel &amp; zinc combination but we wo n't concern ourselves with those ) . So , the point is that pre-1982 pennies will have a different mass than pennies made after 1982 . So , how about ' weighing ' ( determining the mass ) of some pennies . <p> First , we will have to construct a crude scale . One way is to hang a plastic disposable cup from a rubber band and attach it vertically to a ruler . ( Again , do n't just take our suggestions . Perhaps you could find your own method of ' weighing ' the pennies ) . Now we must use a ' standard ' mass and the best substance for that would be water . Fill the cup with 100 milliliters ( cubic centimeters ) of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember the point on the ruler the cup reaches ) . Now empty the cup of water and fill it up with pre-1982 pennies until the cup reaches the same point as when you had it filled with water . The number of pennies in the cup will have a mass of 100 grams . ( In case you are wondering , the number of pre-1982 pennies that equal 100 grams is about 32 . ( So each of these pennies has a mass of 3.1 grams ) . ( However , do the experiment yourself ) . Now do the same with pennies made after 1982 . ( This will be about 40 pennies and so each of these pennies has a mass of about 2.5 grams ) . <p> Okay , you have now determined the size and the mass of pennies . Now time to move on to density . <p> D E N S I T Y <p> Density is defined by the formula : <p> Density = Mass Volume <p> ( Not to confuse you anymore , but a lot of people use specific gravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the density of a substance compared to water - grams per cubic centimeter . ( Almost always , densities are expressed this way but it is important to know the difference ) . <p> Now is there any way to verify your findings ? Sure . For all intents and purposes we could say that pre-1982 pennies are all copper and the ones after 1982 are all zinc . Now looking up the densities we find Copper = 8.96 and Zinc = 7.13 . Pretty good agreement would n't you say ? <p> O T H E R &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp P R O P E R T I E S <p> Get a pre-1982 penny and drop it on the floor or on concrete or on a table , etc ( but DO N'T start scratching any furniture in the process ) . Anyway , did you notice the distinctive ' pinging ' sound a copper penny makes ? Now drop a penny made after 1982 . The sound is much ' duller ' is n't it ? Why do n't you research about copper and zinc to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate is dangerous and so we advise you <p> ? DO NOT DO THIS EXPERIMENT YOURSELF ! ! ! ! ? <p> ? POSSIBILITY OF SKIN BURNS &amp; FIRE HAZARD ! ! ! ! ! ? <p> Have your teacher , instructor or professor try this . ( They are used to working with high temperatures ) . <p> As we can see from above , there is a huge difference between the melting point of zinc and copper . So much of a difference that a zinc penny can be melted in a Bunsen burner but a copper penny can not . To try this , we recommend clamping the penny with an alligator clip and holding that with pliers or Vise Grips . The zinc penny will easily melt in the Bunsen burner flame . The copper penny will certainly get hot , it will even start to glow but it WO N'T melt . We were patient enough to be able to melt a zinc penny in a candle flame .

Switching it " up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The above circuit works very well for switching 1 humbucking pickup or switching a 2 single pickup guitar such as a Fender Telecaster ? Switches wired in this manner allow one humbucker ( or two single coils ) to have 4 switching options : 1 ) Coil A only 2 ) Coil B only 3 ) Both coils in parallel 4 ) Both coils in series <p> These are also the four options you can get by using Seymour Duncan Triple Shot ? pickup mounting rings so which to choose ? 2 SPDT switches - Cost is low , switches are easy to obtain.Triple Shot - Does n't change guitar 's appearance . However , since you are visiting this page , I do n't think you 'll mind drilling two small holes in your guitar . <p> In the above diagram , the circuits show how the four switching options are activated by the 2 SPDT switches . In all four circuits , the " Coil A " switching wire actually goes to the " Coil B " switch ( DEF ) and the " Coil B " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch ( ABC ) . In circuit 1 , " Coil A " is the active pickup . By turning the Coil A pickup switch on ( or downward ) , you are actually turning Coil B off and by turning the Coil B pickup switch off ( or upward ) , you are actually turning the Coil A pickup on . If you have followed that explanation , you can see the opposite is occurring in circuit 2 . <p> If you can understand those 2 switching circuits , then you will see that in circuit 3 , by turning both switches off , both pickups have actually become wired in parallel . <p> Following the wiring for circuit 4 , ( notice the wire connection between terminals ' A ' and ' D ' ? ) , you can now see how the pickups are wired in series . <p> If you can understand how the above circuit works , then you will understand the principles of the circuits on this page and the next page .

@@101966490 @6166490/ <p> Pictured above on the left is a scale for weighing small objects up to 20 pounds . It is meant to be held by the top ring and the object to be weighed goes on the hook . However , the weight of the scale is so light it works the same upside down . For example , if you were to hold it by the ring and place a 20 pound object on the hook OR if you held it upside down by the hook and clipped the object on the ring it would indicate 20 pounds in both cases . On the top of the diagram , the scale has been placed horizontally on a table with ropes affixed to the ring on one side and the hook on the other side .

@@101966509 @6166509/ <p> A friendly and very informative forum for guitar wiring and rewiring is Guitar Nuts 2 . Its moderators and members are quite knowledgeable about all aspects of the electric guitar . If you have any questions about an electric guitar modification this is the place to ask it . As a matter of fact , the Guitar Nuts were quite helpful to me when I was working on this very modification . By the way , I 'm a member there myself . <p> Advantages and Disadvantages <p> This is an alternative to the Ultra Strat ? Mod and its biggest advantage over the Ultra Strat ? Mod is that ? there are no dead spots for any of the possible switching positions . ( Okay , technically , the Super Strat ? Switching does have one " dead spot " - turning all 3 pickup switches off but the Ultra Strat ? mod does this too ) . Another advantage of this circuit is that you 'll get 2 new sounds - ? neck and bridge in parallel ? neck , middle and bridge in parallel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention is that ? doing any unauthorized work will void the guitar warranty . ? It will definitely change the appearance of your guitar . In fact , this takes up more space than the Ultra Strat ? Mod because there is now a 4PDT switch in place of the DPDT switch and each SPST switch is being replaced by a DPDT switch . <p> Looking at the above photo , the section labeled " Previous Wiring " shows the switches when I wired the Ultra Strat ? Mod into a 3 pickup Telecaster ? type guitar . The lower section shows the same guitar with the Super Strat ? Mod and its larger switches taking up more room . Basically , the 4 new switches take up about the same space as the 5 switches in the previous wiring and so the 5 switches can no longer be squeezed into the same space as the 5 way lever switch it replaced . ( Something else to think about ) . ? The biggest disadvantage of this circuit is its complexity . This mod requires four DPDT switches and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order online . ( compare this to the Ultra Strat ? Mod which uses 2 DPDT and 3 SPST switches . ) This means that the Super Strat ? Switching will be somewhat more expensive , require much more wiring and take up a lot more space . <p> Wiring the Circuit <p> There are two diagrams for this wiring . The first one shows the specific wiring and soldering points to be done . If the procedure at the bottom of Diagram 1 is followed it should lead to a correctly rewired guitar . ( It worked for me because I followed those steps and Diagram One exactly when I did this wiring . ) Of course this is just a suggestion for how you should proceed and by all means come up with your own instructions if you want to . <p> After following Diagram One , it would be a good idea to get a test meter , set it for resistance and test all possible switching arrangements ( series and parallel ) to see if you have done the wiring correctly . Series resistance is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tougher and here 's a calculator to help you . <p> If you follow Diagram One precisely , when you proceed to Diagram 2 , you 'll notice that you 'll have to disconnect or even cut some wires that have already been soldered . ( For example , adding a neck phase switch ) . Still I think it is a good idea to have everything soldered at this point so that the circuit can be tested . <p> The second diagram mainly focuses on the rewiring after you 've done the pickup wiring . <p> The Finished Product <p> The two guitars shown above were both manufactured by Route 101 Guitars ( no longer in business ) . Both guitars were recently rewired with the " Super Strat ? Mod " . The switching for the guitar on the right can be seen in much greater detail in the close-up photo towards the top of this page . <p> The guitar on the left had been previously modified many times and I 'm surprised that it took only two picks to cover up all that previous work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's " pickguard modification " . Why was it done ? If you own a guitar that has a pickguard that spans almost the entire guitar body , just getting at the wiring requires removing the strings . Now , with that slot sliced into the pickguard , accessing the wiring only requires the removal of four screws . How was it done ? No , it did n't require a special pickguard cutter and it was cut using only a hacksaw blade . It 's easier than using the entire hacksaw and you can do it all by hand - no need for a vise either . <p> As you can judge from the wiring diagrams , with over two dozen solder connections to make , this is not an easy project to do . However , when you are finished , you will have an extremely versatile and very reliable guitar . Good luck with the rewiring.

As a matter of fact , the Guitar Nuts were quite helpful to me when I was working on this very modification . By the way , I 'm a member there myself . <p> This is very similar to the Bass Cut Tone Circuit except that this circuit can also work as a treble cut . Simply by flipping the DPDT toggle switch , each of the capacitors can be placed into the signal path in series , producing a bass cut or in parallel , producing a treble cut . <p> Before you begin , ( as we 've said many times ) , doing any unauthorized modification on your guitar could void your warranty or decrease its resale value . <p> For this circuit , you must use a DPDT on/on/on type of switch . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , please go to this page , scroll down to the DPDT switch section and look at Diagram D. ) <p> When installing the DPDT on/on/on switch , make sure it works exactly the way as depicted in the graphic below . <p> Building the Circuit <p> We suggest that you start by soldering all 6 capacitors to the 6 terminals on the rotary switch . Next , take the free ends of the capacitors you just soldered and twist those around each other , crimp these to the right middle terminal of the DPDT switch and then solder . <p> Now ( looking at the diagram below ) , you must cut the " hot " lead from the volume control to the guitar output jack .

The larger the capacitance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , when the rotary switch is set to the .046 mfd capacitor you 'll hear a tremendous treble cut , but when you flip the switch it will produce a barely noticeable bass cut . <p> Plug your guitar into an amplifier and enjoy the new sounds you just created !

It will definitely change the appearance of the guitar . ? It is a complicated circuit and somewhat difficult to wire . ? If you want to stay with the original pickups , ( as I did ) , you will have to remove both humbuckers and wire these with 4 conductor wiring as described here . <p> As for the advantages : ? The required seven switches ( hence the name Super Seven Switching ? ) are extremely easy to obtain ( six SPDT and one DPDT ) ? All of the switching positions have no dead spots . ? It will produce forty distinct tones ( 72 if you include the phase switch options ) . <p> If you want to know how this switching circuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the " How It Works " section . <p> Still , you will probably find that learning the switching of this guitar is even more important and useful . <p> Switch Instructions <p> The top half of the diagram below shows the way the switches are placed on the guitar . For clarity , the phase switch is not shown and the humbucker coils have been lettered . Rather than thinking of the wiring as six switches , think of it as three switch pairs : ? neck humbucker coil switches ( orange circles ) ? neck and bridge pickup selection switches ( gray circles ) ? bridge humbucker coil switches ( yellow circles ) <p> Looking at the bottom half of the diagram , we see that each of the " switch pairs " can have four switching positions . For example , the 4 neck humbucker positions are : 1 ) Coil ' A ' is active . 2 ) Coil ' B ' is active . 3 ) Both coils ' A ' and ' B ' are wired in parallel . 4 ) Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in series . The bridge pickup switches work in a similar manner except they switch coils ' C ' and ' D ' . The pickup selection switches have a similar switching pattern except that they switch pickups and not the individual coils . <p> In the table below , if you look at the left column , the 3 numbers indicate the switching arrangement ( with the neck/bridge switch pair being the middle number ) . For example , 1 3 2 means both pickups are wired in parallel ( in relation to each other ) and coils ' A ' and ' D ' are active . When just the Neck or just the Bridge pickup is active , we will call the inactive switch pair ' position 0 ' . This means if just the neck pickup is active , the arrangements of the bridge pickup switches have no effect whatsoever on the sound . <p> Here are all 72 switching combinations : " HC " in the rightmost columns indicates hum-canceling .

( You might be surprised by the " out of phase " choice being humbucking but 2 coils with identical windings and polarity become humbucking when they are wired out of phase ) . Actually , you get more than the 6 new sounds listed if you include all the combinations that the phasing switch can produce . However , the neck and bridge in series out of phase is the best-sounding out-of-phase option but experiment all you like ! ! <p> Well here is my schematic for this switching : <p> A schematic is okay for seeing how a circuit works but a wiring diagram is much more helpful when you go to do the actual work : <p> To make it easier to read ( and to follow ) : ? Wires from the pickups are drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the switches are drawn with thicker and darker lines . ? The connections have been numbered . ? If you choose not to have a phase switch , connect wire #5 and wire #6 directly to the SPST switch at positions 5 &amp; 6 . ( This is the reason there is a dashed line around the phase switch ) . <p> How It Works <p> You do not have to know this , but in case you are curious , by redrawing the schematic and not showing the phase switch , the switching becomes a little easier to understand . <p> When the DPDT switch is in the series position , ( middle terminals connected to the top terminals which are connected by a wire ) , the switching is easy to see . The only outputs for the pickups are the middle pickup " + " terminal and the bridge pickup " ? " terminal . The switches are wired so that they shunt ( actually " short-circuit " ) that particular pickup . So when you are turning one pickup " off " on your guitar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pickup . This creates no problems when all pickups are in series . Switching to parallel , the middle terminals are now connected to " ? " and " + " . The switches still function the same way . When you want neck and middle , the bridge pickup is " shorted " and the neck " minus " terminal goes directly to ground and its " plus terminal " goes directly to the " hot " ( or ' + ' ) output . When you want bridge and middle , the neck pickup is " shorted " and the neck " minus " terminal goes directly to ground . These are the only parallel combinations you can obtain . Why ? If you wanted Neck and Bridge , you would flip the middle pickup switch " on " and do you see what happens ? The middle pickup switch causes the ground and hot outputs to be connected together which results in the entire guitar turning " off " and no sound comes out . By the same reasoning , you can see why trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also have the same effect . ( Luckily , you can get ALL 3 single coil choices when the switch is set for series ) . <p> In order to maximize the humbucking possibilities , the pickup that is reverse wired with reverse polarity ( RWRP ) should be on the " left " side of the circuit . Let 's suppose the RWRP pickup was in the bridge ? Then we would want to wire the guitar in this way : <p> In this way we could get neck and bridge ( series and parallel ) , and middle and bridge ( series and parallel ) and all four would be humbucking . As you can see this circuit is quite " flexible " in accommodating the kinds of switching that you want .

Of those four , this is the easiest to do and just requires adding two toggle switches . If you have a two humbucker guitar , the odds are good that you only have three switching options : ? neck pickup only ? bridge pickup only ? neck and bridge pickups in parallel . However , since you are reading this web page , you want more switching options than this do n't you ? In fact , guitarist Trey Anastasio ( of the rock group Phish ) wanted a guitar that had more tone options than the typical three just mentioned . So , he had legendary guitar maker Paul Languedoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a custom guitar which had many tone options with a minimum of switches . Eventually , Paul Languedoc made 3 such guitars for Trey Anastasio and each guitar uses the switching shown in this circuit .

This was done so that when both single coils are being used , it will be a humbucking circuit .

Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup in the conventional way and wire the bridge coil in an " inside-out " manner . The two switches required for this are DPDT switches that have no center positions .

One hole is much larger than the other and if you wanted to install two very small switches , the hole on the right is much too large . Yes , you could try securing the switch with a large washer above and below the wood but a small switch with a large washer might look cheap and cheesy , plus the fact that a switch mounted in that way would not be very secure . There is another solution though . Get a guitar pick and drill into it two small holes , the same size as the hole on the left .

Now place the right hand switch into the guitar and tighten the switch nut onto the guitar pick . Now both switches have been firmly secured . The left switch is secured to the guitar wood and the guitar pick and the right side switch is secured only to the guitar pick but it is quite strong . I have done this many times ( see the photos ) , and the pick is extremely secure . Do n't forget that a guitar pick is very strong and this is something you should also keep in mind when you drill into them . <p> These photos might give you some ideas . <p> The guitar on the above left is a Yamaha SBG 2000 , sometimes referred to as the Japanese Les Paul . Like the Les Paul , it weighs a lot and has tremendous sustain . Those formidable looking pickups are DiMarzio X2N 's , the highest output pickup made by any manufacturer . Despite their incredible output , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds out of those X2N 's and I sometimes jokingly refer to this as my " surf guitar " . Yes there are eight switches on this guitar because I added a solo switch to the Super Seven Switching . That 's a red rocker switch for the phase switch chosen just because I like the look of it . On the right is an Agile AL-2000 Gold-Top guitar which is an inexpensive copy of a Les Paul . In spite of its relatively low price , it is well-made and has good action . It originally came with P-90 pickups which are slightly larger versions of the traditional single coil design . P-90 's have more coil windings and are somewhat hotter than the typical single coil . P-90 's have their fans and you could even say there is practically a sub-culture devoted to the P-90 sound which lies somewhere between single coil and humbucker . I bought the guitar to explore the P-90 sound and I think I gave those pickups a pretty good workout . Well , I guess I am not a P-90 fan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place . Like the P-90 , the mini-humbucker is yet another unconventional pickup and is probably found in even fewer numbers than the P-90 . I do like the sound of these and they have a nice treble response that you usually do n't hear in series-wired humbuckers . Still , why should I settle for a few sounds when I could wire this up with Super-Seven Switching ? ? Needless to say , the switching really furnishes this guitar with a surplus of sound . ( or any 2 humbucker guitar for that matter ) . Note the guitar picks which are supporting switches that are in holes where a volume and a tone pot used to be . That 's a Gibson speed-knob chosen strictly for its appearance . <p> The guitar ( above left ) is an OLP MM1 . Six of the switches are mounted on guitar picks . Why ?

Despite their appearance , those are full-sized guitars and are very well made . The guitar on the left has 2 DiMarzio X2N 's which as stated previously , have extremely high output without being muddy . The guitar on the right has 2 DiMarzio Super III 's which have a fuller , darker , " crunchier " sound especially when distorted . Both guitars have eight switches - I added a " solo switch " to the Super Seven Switching . <p> Above are 2 Dean Guitars , with a Vendetta XM on the left , and an Evo XM on the right .

Pictured above is a guitar made in the style of the Fender Telecaster ? and manufactured by the now out of business Route 101 Guitars . The neck pickup is a true humbucker and the other " humbucker " consists of the middle and bridge single coils . It may look as if there is n't much room in that guitar cavity but seven switches can be mounted there .

We already have 6 as a factor because 2 x 3 = 6. 7 is prime and so we will need that . We do not need 8 as a factor because it is 2x2x2 and since we already have a ' 4 ' , we just need another 2 . Since we already have a 3 , we just need another 3 to make a ' 9 ' . We do not need the 10 because 2x5 = 10 . Therefore our number is : <p> 2 x 3 x 2 x 5 x 7 x 2 x 3 = 2,520. 72762 @qwx932762 <p> Puzzle #3 &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp &amp;nbsp 9/26/99 <p> This one is a ' classic ' ( and even Marilyn Vos Savant got it wrong - no kidding ) . <p> If a chicken and a half can lay an egg and a half in a week and a half , how many eggs would one chicken lay in a month and a half ( 6 weeks ) ? <p> ANSWER : <p> The common mistake is to reduce all three quantities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) .

@@101966560 @6166560/ <p> This probability puzzle has been around a long time . Generally , it is referred to as the Monty Hall Problem because it is somewhat based on a show he hosted called " Let 's Make A Deal " . The problem is stated as follows . <p> You are a contestant on " Let 's Make A Deal " and you have been shown three doors . You are told that behind one of the doors , is a new car , and behind each of the other two doors is a goat . Naturally , you want to win the car and you are told you can pick any one of the three doors . This would mean your chance of winning the car based on this condition is one in three or one third . <p> However , after you make your pick , Monty Hall opens a door you have n't chosen and shows that it 's a goat . He then offers to let you change your selection . Would changing your selection decrease your odds of winning the car , increase your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little easier to use an actual example . You pick door number one . Monty Hall shows that a goat is behind door number two . He then offers you the choice of picking door number three or you can stay with your original choice of door number one . Should you change your pick to door number three , stay with door number one or does it make any difference ? <p> Conditions in effect when playing this game : The placement of the car and the goats is done totally at random and you have no way of knowing what is behind which door . Monty Hall knows exactly where all three are . After you make your pick and Monty Hall shows you one of the other doors , it will always be a " goat " door and he will not show the " car " door nor will he open up the door you just chose . <p> ANSWER Surprisingly , you will win two out of three times if you always change your choice . The car is equally likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ) , so let 's examine each case . To make it simple , let us say you always choose Door Number One in these 3 instances . <p> Car is behind Door Number One : You switch and always lose . Goats are behind the two doors you have n't chosen . You will be shown a goat and yet since you are always changing your choice , you always end up picking the other goat . This happens 1/3 of the time . <p> Car is behind Door Number Two : You switch and always win . The car is behind a door you have n't chosen and Monty has no choice but to show you a " goat door " and the car is behind the remaining door . This happens 1/3 of the time . <p> Adding up the probabilities , we see that by always switching , you win 2/3 of the time and loose only 1/3 of the time . <p> Granted , this was based on your choosing door number one each time but if you look at the above 3 explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door number 3 will also result in your winning the car two out of three times . <p> Another Explanation : When you make your first pick , you will be wrong 2 out of 3 times or putting this another way , the odds are always 2 out of 3 that the car is definitely behind one of the two doors you did not choose . Since Monty Hall always eliminates one of the unchosen doors , two out of three times the car will be behind one of them and Monty has no choice but to show a " goat " door . <p> And Another Explanation : Suppose there are 1,000 doors , 999 goats and 1 car . For your first choice , you select Door Number One . Then , ( just as in the previous example ) , Monty Hall opens all the unchosen doors except one . So , Monty Hall opens 998 doors to reveal 998 goats and only door number one and door number 557 remain unopened .

A class consists of 58% girls and 42% boys . There are 6 more girls than boys in the class .

For each flip of the two coins there are 4 possible outcomes : <p> " Head , Head " ; " Head , Tail " ; " Tail , Head " ; " Tail , Tail " <p> You reason that since 2 Heads is 1 of the 4 combinations , then flipping 2 coins twice will give you a " 50/50 " chance of getting 2 heads at least once . <p> Is your reasoning correct ? <p> ANSWER This is not a good bet either . There are 4 possible outcomes of one flip of two coins and so there are 16 possible outcomes of 2 flips : <p> Notice that the successful outcomes are only 7 out of 16 and not 8 out of 16 .

Out of these 36 combinations , there is only one way that a twelve ( 2 sixes ) can appear . <p> You are offered an even-money bet ( let 's say for $10 ) that if you can throw a twelve in 21 throws , you win $10 . If not , you lose $10 . Also , you may continue to make bets for as long as you 'd like . <p> You reason that a twelve is 1 out of the 36 dice combinations , therefore your chances are 50-50 after 18 rolls and with 21 tries you are going to come out a winner more often than not . Is this reasoning correct ? <p> ANSWER For any ' n ' throws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , after 10 throws of the dice , the number of all possible outcomes = 3610 = 3,656,158,440,062,980 . Then you would have to calculate the successes which is quite a complicated procedure and involves the binomial distribution theorem . Fortunately , here 's an easier method . Instead of calculating the successes , look at it from a " non-success " point of view . For example , on the first roll , there is a 35 in 36 chance ( .97222222 ) that you wo n't roll a twelve . For the second roll , the probability of not succeeding is ( 35/36 ) 2 or ( .97222222 ) 2 or about .945216 . As we proceed to calculate ( 35/36 ) n for higher values of ' n ' we will reach a point where the failure probability falls below .5 which is the point at which the odds are better than 50-50 that you will roll a twelve . Continuing on to 20 we see : ( .97222222 ) 20 = 0.5692602 ( .97222222 ) 21 = 0.553447 ( .97222222 ) 22 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24 = 0.508596 ( .97222222 ) 25 = 0.494468 So after 25 , throws we see that the " chance for failure " has fallen below 50% or the chance for winning is now better than 50 per cent . Therefore , taking a bet involving rolling a " 12 " in 21 throws would not be a good idea.In fact in 1952 , a gambler named " Fat the Butch " , agreed to this bet ( except at $1,000 for 21 rolls ) . After losing $49,000 he realized that something had to be wrong with his reasoning . Use a search engine to find out more about this .

@@101966601 @6166601/ <p> Yes , that is the periodic table displayed above , but it is presented a little bit differently than you have usually seen it : Elements 57 through 70 ( and 89 through 102 ) are usually shown separately , and at the bottom of the chart . Here , they are placed right alongside the other elements in numerical order . All the elements are shown with 4 background colors : blue , yellow , green or red . By being displayed in this way , it is easy to see how the orbitals of each element get " filled in " with electrons . <p> Let 's look at the first 3 rows of the periodic table . <p> Row 2 consists of the 2s ( blue ) and 2p ( red ) orbitals . Row 3 consists of the 3s ( blue ) and 3p ( red ) orbitals . This pattern continues for all the rows thereafter . <p> When we move down to Rows 4 and 5 , the 3d and 4d orbitals ( green ) also get filled with electrons . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 5f orbitals ( yellow ) get filled with electrons . <p> Now let 's show the periodic table with the names of the orbitals ( " s " " p " " d " and " f " ) replacing the element numbers and symbols : <p> You probably remember that the " s " orbital contains 2 electrons , the " p " orbital 6 , the " d " orbital 10 and the " f " orbital 14 . Now , let 's see how all of this comes together . <p> Row 1 contains 2 electrons in the 1s orbital , row 2 contains another " s " orbital ( 2 electrons ) and a " p " orbital ( 6 electrons ) . Adding up those electrons ( 2 + 2 + 6 ) equals 10 . Scrolling up , let 's look at the element at the end of row 2 . What is its number ? Yes , neon is element number 10 ! ( This is the sum of the electrons in two " s " orbitals and one " p " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrons . Row 3 has another " s " orbital ( 2 electrons ) and another " p " orbital ( 6 electrons ) . 10 + 2 + 6 equals 18 . Scrolling up , and looking at the element at the end of row 3 , we see that it is argon , element number 18 . <p> Looking at row 4 , we encounter a new type of orbital - the " d " orbital . The first 3 rows have 18 electrons and the fourth row gives us an additional 18 ( " s " orbital 2 , " p " orbital 6 and " d " orbital 10 ) which brings the total to 36 . Scrolling up and looking at the end of row 4 we see that it is krypton , element 36 . <p> The fifth row adds an additional 18 electrons ( " s " orbital 2 , " p " orbital 6 , " d " oribtal 10 ) . 18 plus 36 = 54 , which is the atomic number of xenon , the element at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of orbital - the " f " orbital . Adding 54 electrons to 32 ( electrons in the " s " , " p " , " d " and " f " orbitals ) sums to 86 . Element 86 is radon and is at the end of row 6 . <p> So , we can see that as the " s " and " p " obitals are filled , this produces the " Main Group " of elements ( blue and red groups ) . As the " d " orbitals are filled , this produces the " Transition Elements " ( green group ) and as the " f " orbitals are filled , this produces the " rare earth " elements ( yellow group ) . <p> Now , you can see how ( and why ) the periodic table has certain elements arranged in " blocks " and " groups " and you can see the reason for the " steps " . Perhaps this has increased your understanding of the periodic table , orbitals and the elctron configuration of the elements ..
