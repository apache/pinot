After landing a solid job , the recommendation is to save a small percentage of each paycheck- for 40+ years until retirement . <p> The underlying assumption is that we should all follow the same linear path from elementary school until death , spending the majority of each day- at- work , trying to climb the ladder , to get a raise , to buy a bigger house , to fill it with more stuff that was n't necessary to begin with . Only after- retiring is there room to explore , relax , or spend time with family . <p> You might call it the time-money paradox . Most Americans trade the majority of their available time for a paycheck , and then spend the majority of each paycheck on depreciating material possessions . As the spending snowballs , many individuals- desire- a larger paycheck , which requires longer hours and more responsibilities at work , which means even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicious cycle that often continues in perpetuity . <p> I cant speak for you or anyone else , but the standard American- lifestyle does n't  work for me . Instead of material possessions , I prefer to- have freedom . Freedom to change careers , start a business , take some time off , or travel the world . Its not about what I choose to do , its about having the freedom to choose . <h> What is Financial Freedom ? <p> Being free , financially , means you can maintain your desired lifestyle without a regular paycheck. - In other words , financial freedom is the 21st-century definition of- retirement . <p> Instead of defining financial freedom as a single point in time , I like to break the concept down into- four- stages . <p> Stage 1 ) No Freedom <p> Everyone begins the journey by relying on a monthly paycheck . At this stage , a job and reliable income stream- is required to pay the bills . Without the ongoing paycheck , any savings could be quickly depleted and you could risk defaulting on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To graduate into the- temporary stage of- financial freedom , you must spend less than your earn and create a pool of savings . Otherwise , you will be forced to continue working indefinitely because your lifestyle- depends on your employment income . As you begin to save a portion of your income , you might invest your savings in a diversified investment portfolio- to produce a regular stream of income . Or , you might start a passion business on the side , creating another stream of income . <p> Your freedom grows alongside your savings . Eventually , you will have enough money saved to feel comfortable switching jobs , starting a business , returning to school , traveling for a year , or any number of other activities that are impossible to achieve while working- full-time . These can be major life changes , but they are not permanent . Your freedom is temporary- until- your income exceeds all of your expenses . <p> Stage 3 ) Permanent Freedom <p> At this stage , your total non-employment income exceeds your total expenses and you no longer require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reliable side business and/or a large investment portfolio producing a substantial amount of income . <p> Yes , a side business is still labor income . You are trading your time for money . However , my assumption is that your side hustle represents your passion . Its something that you enjoy doing . Something that you find fulfilling or meaningful . <p> Fulfillment- is the entire point of this article . Financial freedom does not require- that you retire early to a life of leisure ( unless that is your desire ) . Its about having autonomy and independence in your daily routine , allowing you to design a better life while spending your time , money , and energy in a more meaningful way. - If that includes starting a new business , great ! Doing meaningful work while getting paid is my definition of a win-win . <p> Stage 4 ) Luxurious Freedom <p> This last stage is a concept that is rarely discussed or achieved . While I define permanent freedom- as the point at which your income exceeds your expenses , such a definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you know that you require $1,500/month to live a barebones lifestyle , and you- can safely withdraw between $1,500-$1,600/month from your investment portfolio , you have technically achieved financial freedom . But have you ? <p> What if a budget of $2,000/month would provide a significant increase in satisfaction ? Perhaps the additional $500/month could be used for hobbies , entertainment , and travel . All of which make you far happier in your life . But $2000/month in expenses is more than your portfolio can support , which means you 're headed in the wrong direction ( back to temporary freedom ) . <p> The tradeoff in this scenario is clear . You can continue working additional years to build a bigger pool of savings , which will provide additional income and flexibility for the remainder of your life . Or , you can leave your job as soon as possible and hope that a smaller portfolio will provide sufficient income . Its all about finding the right balance given your personal situation . <p> When you- have enough passive income to spend freely , that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your income exceeds your expenses by a comfortable margin , allowing you to increase or decrease your spending given your desired lifestyle . You might call it- financial freedom 2.0 . <h> Do You Desire Financial Freedom ? <p> Ask yourself these- questions ( and ask your spouse if you have one ) : <p> Are you happy with your existing lifestyle ? <p> Have you found a meaningful work-life balance ? <p> Do you enjoy your job and find purpose in the daily routine ? <p> These can be difficult questions to answer , but they provide a great deal of information about your desire- for financial freedom . In my experience , responses can be divided into three categories . <p> 1 ) Work is meaningful <p> Some individuals find purpose in their career and have no desire to stop working . That 's perfectly fine and respectable . You can continue working and be financially free the two are not mutually exclusive . <p> Even if you have- no desire to stop working , I still believe that financial freedom is beneficial . At the very least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace of mind . There is always a possibility that your job could be eliminated , or your life circumstances change , or any number of concerns that might be partially remedied by financial freedom . <p> 2 ) - Work is meh , but necessary <p> Another group of individuals is somewhat indifferent about work . If you fall into this group , you probably dont- love work , and its not your burning passion , but its tolerable and it pays the bills . There are good days and bad days , but the overall trend might be described as neutral and necessary . <p> In this situation , your preferred level of financial freedom should be inversely related to your- overall disdain for work . You should work harder to increase your savings rate- and reach financial freedom if you find yourself increasingly unhappy at work , because financial freedom will allow you to change careers or quit the rat race altogether . <p> 3 ) Work is boring , terrible , and soul crushing <p> If you find yourself in this group , - financial freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your job , you should be willing to make sacrifices to escape . That might include cutting unnecessary expenses , working a side-job , building your human capital , or moving somewhere with a much lower cost of living . You should be saving as much money as possible , so that you can change careers as quickly as possible . <p> By focusing on financial freedom , your perspective can be transformed . You can go from sludging through 40 years of dreaded employment , to designing the life that you desire. - And you can find freedom quickly if you 'll devote your money , time , and energy toward that goal . <p> The point is this , time ( not money ) is your most valuable asset . If your time at work makes you miserable , save enough money to quit and- go find a new job. - Life is too short to be miserable on a daily basis . <h> Are you Pursuing Financial Freedom ? <p> Given the various stages of financial freedom , and the differing opinions on work , I would love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is financial freedom- a pressing desire ? Or , would you rather continue working and spending your paycheck freely ? <p> For Vanessa and I , financial freedom is our primary long-term financial goal . We- appreciate the flexibility and freedom that accompanies a large pool of savings , and we would rather forego consumption than live dependent on a monthly paycheck . Although we have n't yet achieved permanent ( or luxurious ) financial freedom , we- are in a great position . We are completely debt-free , and- have accumulated enough assets to purchase a prolonged period of freedom . And at this point , that 's all that we desire . <p> The media often portrays financial freedom as an insurmountable task that requires decades of saving and investing . Thats sometimes true , but its beneficial- to focus on each victory along the way . For example , most people could pay off all non-mortgage debt , and accumulate enough savings to find a new career that is enjoyable. - Those are huge accomplishments- on the journey to financial freedom- that should be celebrated . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post , especially the concept of luxurious freedom . To me , financial freedom is very specific : to have enough money that I can invest it in safe , tax-free assets ( mainly municipal bonds issued by fiscally responsible states , arranged in a bond ladder ) and have enough income to afford a comfortable lifestyle . I would not fully quit working , but would reduce my workload by about 75% . <p> Nice post . I think a lot of people fall into category 2 ( meh ) with their jobs so they are n't  motivated to save a lot but they are n't  really fulfilled by their work either . This is n't a great place to be , especially since #2 tends to shift to #3 over time , not #1 ! <p> The best option is to figure out how to save a lot of your income by really understanding your personal spending vs happiness relationship . You 'll find a lot of spending is not making you happy and you can cut that . Then its easy to save , and you do n't  need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the path I took , helping me reach financial independence around 40 . I 'm still working to reach " luxurious freedom " ( I like your term here ) , but its relatively easy because I do n't  mind my job and saving no longer takes much conscious effort . Its a nice place to be and I highly recommend it ! <p> I think that financial freedom means having no debts and having an investment portfolio which is 25 times annual expenses . Minimialist lifestyle is essential . This includes no car , property . Rent is the way to go . <p> Even if I had unlimited financial freedom , I am definitely the kind of person that would still have to have a job . Even in retirement . I feel that part is huge struggle for retirees , needing a job to make you feel useful and like you 're accomplishing something . <p> Really enjoyed your post ! It is a simple idea , income more than your expenses . We figured it out after reading some books , and associating with some mentors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they can " retire " at any age because no one teaches this stuff . All they need is to generate the right kind of income . thanks for the article . <p> Nice post , an inspired one . but what if your job is not giving you anough income that could sustain you and your family let alone saving , like in the case of developing country where unemployment rate is high , what would you do ? Or the principle is for developed countries alone . advice . <p> Hi Jacob , Thanks for the inspirational post ! Financial freedom has been a goal of mine since my early twenties . I always knew that if I were to achieve it I would have to do things differently to my friends . I graduated with a PhD in physical chemistry when I was 25 and instead of getting a normal job I began writing educational textbooks . I figured that creating intellectual property was a good way of creating passive income . In the early days of my writing career I actually worked on a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings and weekends writing . Fortunately , the books I was writing were selling well so I was able to pay off all my college debt and quit the laboring jobs by the time I was 29 . I am now 35 with a fairly large portfolio of successful books which give me a passive income in excess of 100,000 dollars a year . So now for the first time I feel like I can stop working so hard and relax a little ! My single minded focus on achieving financial freedom has come at the cost of my personal life though . I always defined myself by my pursuit of financial freedom , and before I achieved it I felt like a failure , so I found it hard to let people get close because I was fixated on the person I had n't  yet become , and I felt that until I became that person I was n't loveablewoah that 's deeper than I expected to go ! I envy the fact that you have someone with you on your journey to financial freedom . Now , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Its exciting and slightly terrifying , but no one said freedom would be easy ! <p> Great input and story here , Jason . Thank you for sharing . You must be incredibly intelligent to get that Ph.D . at 25 ( I know because my undergrad was in Chemistry ) . Do you have any tips that you learned along the way that might help other readers who are trying to reach that freedom ? <p> Thanks for the reply Jacob , I live in the UK , where 25 is a fairly typical age to graduate with a PhD , thanks for your complement though = . If I were to give advice to someone aiming for financial freedom or looking to supplement their income , I would suggest considering the following : <p> 1 . Create intellectual property ( write a book , write a song , invent something ) . 2 . Protect the intellectual property ( books are automatically protected by copyright , inventions require patenting etc ) . 3 . License your IP to a company and receive a royalty on every sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book to a publisher in return for royalties . An inventor licenses their patent to a company that manufacturers similar items to their invention , in return for a percentage of each sale ) . <p> Do n't  get me wrong , this process requires luck , research , and hard work , and to be honest , I think the majority of people who set off down this road would probably fail . But , if you get it right , it is one of the quickest ways to financial freedom and you can earn many times more than in a normal job . Its something to think about : ) . <p> Awesome post and well done ! You are a very inspiring couple . I 'm also working on my financial freedom . My father taught me how to always diversify and stop waiting for the retirement years to do what I want and love . <p> My husband and I started working towards financial independence after we found a really inspiring blog a few years ago . We have both always been great savers and really interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made small changes and it was mostly something that was fun to talk about . But , as time progresses we find that we are more and more committed and now are well on our way . Not there yet , but its pretty exciting ! <p> We are definitely moving toward financial freedom . I have a business that I am eventually going to pay someone to run which will provide passive income and we are planning on paying off our mortgage in the next 4 years . Between the two of these , we should be on track to be financially free in the next 8 years ! <p> Financial freedom is something I 've always aspired in youth and adulthood . I read a lot about it ( books on the subject are many ) and I came to the conclusion that financial freedom should not be the ultimate goal in life . You have to ask yourself what lies behind the desire for financial freedom . I think that in life people usually want to be happy , have a loving family , etc. , and achieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life what you love , and make money dealing with this , what more do you want ? <p> Hi Matthew , I mostly agree with your assessment , although nothing in my article indicates that financial freedom should be the ultimate goal in life , or that it guarantees a loving family or eternal happiness . Financial freedom is about using your money and ( more importantly ) your time intentionally . The nitty gritty details can be interpreted differently by each individual . <p> This is something my husband and I have started to focus on and give serious thought . Sadly , I do n't  think that very many people believe financial freedom is possible . We used to think that way as well . But I have found that if you do n't  believe it , then you wo n't go for it . Debt does n't  have to last forever and you can build up your reserves . Through hard work and focus , we are getting there . We firmly believe that its not about how much you make , but rather how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of my main focuses with money , which works nicely with finishing paying off my student loan debt . I think it puts you in a place to make choices independent of debt , which for many of us is how decisions are influenced . I actually started a page that includes my Financial Independence date , I would love to know what you guys have planned as a FI Day ? <p> I do think about financial freedom daily , and I update my net worth daily as well . It does help me stay motivated , but what is harder is trying to figure out what exactly I would want to do differently when I retire ( other than just not have to go to work of course ) . It would help if/when my husband and I can nail down a vision as to how we want to spend our time . Currently we are n't  even sure if we want kids or not which obviously would have a huge impact on our future goals and financial needs ! <p> Bravo ! One of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why " behind all of the " what 's " and " hows " that you also teach , which are necessary to achieve it . As far I 'm concerned , the word " retirement " belongs back in the 20th century , in the land of employer pensions and ( virtually ) guaranteed home equities . ( Unfortunately , most financial services providers still have n't gotten the idea , and insist on continuing to try to get young people interested in " saving for retirement " and the predictable result is the aforementioned blank stare ! ) Today , switching from 100% work to 100% leisure at age 65 is just one of many choices you can make if you achieve financial freedom but that 's not a choice that 's drawing much interest these days . Why should it ? There 's a whole world of way better and EARLIER choices you can make to enjoy your life of financial freedom . Terrific post , Jacob , I 'm sharing it all over the place ! <p> I 'm writing my own post on defining financial freedom right now . Its certainly got me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income from anywhere ( mainly from real estate rental income ) and spend that income in a cheaper country so it goes a lot further seems to be a way to get there sooner . One things for sure you have to be prepared for hard work to get there . And for people to think you are crazy . It seems to scare people when you tell them you are doing something different to the norm . <p> Enjoyed your article Jacob , couldnt be any truer ! Time is the most important asset of all and if we want to achieve finacial freedom we simply need to live below our means and cut back on the expenses . I got married less than 1 year ago and was obliged to cut back on expenses and I 'm happy with my lifestyle . Not easy initially ( not referring to the marriage but cutting back on the expenseslol ) but surely possible ! <p> Great post ! Financial freedom is about enjoying a lifestyle within ones means . Communicating with ones spouse is key to mitigating potential financial conflicts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once you figure this out , you will be better able to see where you are spending most of your money and if it is worth the cost . You may find certain expenses are not worth it . You can save money and be happier ! <p> Financial freedom is one helluva goal . I think everyone wants it , but most equate it with being wealthy . But like you say , if you 're stuck doing work in order to pay for all your unnecessary things , then you are n't  financially free . You are n't  really free at all . <p> I do n't  need a lot of stuff . I do n't  need a lot of money . I just want to do the things I love and make enough money from them to take a little time here and there . When I want . For whatever reason I want . No vacation requests required . <p> To me , that 's financial freedom . I think its a modest goal , but still difficult if you 've been stuck in the traditional working-for-others mindset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things when I was as young as you two . You 're off to a great start . <p> Your definition is a very good one and its a great goal . Its quite similar to ours . The psychology of financial freedom is really fascinating to me as well . From out outside perspective , I cant believe how much people tend to value stuff . I.e. people continue working a job they despise for the greater part of their life in order to buy it ? <p> " Life is about more than living paycheck to paycheck , or looking forward to retirement at age 70 . " Thou speakest truth . Exactly what Timothy Ferriss says ; retirement should be the worst-case scenario and not the primary goal of our short lives . Great article . <p> Good job on this post jacob . My definition of financial freedom is a simple equation : monthly passive income greater than monthly expenses equals Financial Freedom . That 's what I did and i now live the life of my dreams . P.S spending under 12k during your first year of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right wife = <p> Love and agree wholeheartedly to your definition of financial freedom . For me its means choices . Choices on how I want to spend my money , my time and my energy . Money is the tool I use to create the life I want for me and my family . It might not be the life you 'd want or anyone else would , but that 's sort of the point . Financial Freedom gives us the ability to choose how we live for ourselves , not based on what others want or think we should do ( that type of thinking is what lands most people in debt ) . I 'm glad you and Vanessa are following your own path and finding so much joy as you continue your journey together . <p> Financial freedom is simply the ability to do what I want to do , when I want to , and wherever I want to . It means that if I do n't  feel like working for a month , I can , and can still feed myself ! In short , it entails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way of thinking : wisdom . So impressed you guys figured this out so young . I 'd like to send you around to every high school in the nation to explain how this stuff works and get young people inspired to live happier , more free lives . <p> By living within ( and often below ) my means it allows my wife and I to sleep well at night knowing that the creditor wont be calling and we still are able to plan and budget for fun trips for our kids . We just got back from Disneyland ! Great blog , Glad I stumbled upon it . <p> Inspiring post , Jacob . My husband and I were just talking about the prospect of hunkering down over the next several years to get our debt paid off ( mortgage and car loan ) . We do n't  carry credit card debt and we pay off big purchases immediately . The traditional " retire/have fun when you 're 70 " makes little sense to me , especially since were in our prime right now and it seems wasteful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mull over this idea your post was well-timed . Thanks for sharing ! <p> What is financial freedom to me ? One word : CHOICES . Ive achieved financial freedom , so today Ive got choices . I make mine differently than others would ( for sure ! ) , and the future me will make them differently than the past me or the current me . But I do n't  have to live with the consequences of choices made by creditors , bosses , or the Social Security Administration . <p> I 'm so amazed at how wise and willing to sacrifice you and your wife are at such a young age . My mentor , although much older now , was just like you . I was the spender . It took me until my early 30s to " get it " and while I never was frugal to the level that you and my mentor are , I was still able to achieve a lot in 20 years ( pay off the house , save a lot ) . <p> While my goal of financial freedom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever before . That means for today , I 'm debt free , I do n't  have to work a job I hate and I 'm relatively stress-free . Total financial freedom means all expenses are paid through passive incomethat is still on the horizon but not far off ! <p> This a great definition of financial freedom . Money is a tool that gives you choices if you use it well . Not everyone will want to make the same choices , but would n't you want the option to decide how you spend your time ? You guys sound like you have an awesome mindset . <p> My husband and I have definitely started to be more frugal since both of us left the corporate world about a year ago . He is doing what he loves and is passionate about , yet I am still floating around working random jobs , trying to start my own business . In the meantime , I have to worry about paying my credit card debt ( and avoiding their calls ! ) and student loans ( for that masters degree I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am seriously considering cashing in my retirement ( which would allow me to pay off all my credit card debt ) . I do n't  want to work until I 'm 80 , but I 've also always lived paycheck to paycheck . I always thought I would " catch up , " but teaching was not a profession that was going to allow that to happen . <p> Dang Abby , sorry about the temporary setbacks . You seem like a really intelligent woman , so keep grinding a hustling . I 'd definitely try to avoid pulling the retirement funds though ! You 'll get hit with a penalty and you 'll never get to put that money back in <p> Hello Abby , my husband and I were both public school teachers with credit card debt and student loans . We just paid them all off even after leaving teaching to start our own businesses and decreasing our income . It can be done , so keep paying down that debt . We had many money meetings and stopped spending . We are happy and healthy and have never looked back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine , fine post ! We would like to be doing more of what we want to do and not what we have to do . I think loving what you do and adding value to the world is our goal . We have to question every ought , should , and must that comes our way , but its SO worth it . My goodness , we needed friends like you when we were 23 !

You may want to refresh with the last article on- how the stock market works- before beginning this one . Its all about stocks again today . And more specifically , the different types of stocks that an investor can own . <p> There are many different types of stocks and different classifications that are used to group stocks together . Let 's take a look at each of these stock classifications . <h> Based on Ownership Rights <p> There are two different types of stock that investors can own . They have different ownership rights and different privileges . <p> Common Stock Common stock is as it sounds , common . When people talk about stocks they are usually referring to common stock , and the great majority of stock is issued is in this form . Common stock represent ownership in a company and a claim on a portion of that companies profits- ( dividends ) . Investors can also vote to elect the- board- members who oversee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock has yielded higher returns than almost all other common investment classes . In addition to the highest returns , common stock probably also carries the highest risk . If a company goes bankrupt , the common shareholders will not receive money until the creditors , bondholders and preferred shareholders are paid . <p> This risk can be greatly reduced by owning many different well established companies ( diversification ) that have solid financial statements and a history of strong earnings . <p> Preferred Stock Preferred stock represents some degree of ownership in a company but usually does n't  come with the same voting rights . With preferred shares , investors are usually guaranteed a fixed dividend . Recall that this is different than common stock , which has variable dividend payments that fluctuate with company profits . Unlike common stock , preferred stock does n't  usually enjoy the same appreciation ( or depreciation in market downturns ) in stock price , which results in lower overall returns . One advantage of preferred stock - is that in the event of bankruptcy , preferred shareholders are paid off before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I like to think of preferred stock as being somewhere in between bonds and common stock . It shares similarities with both . As a result , I would n't hold preferred stock . I do n't  really see any reason to forego the growth potential of common stock , or the additional safety provided by bonds . For me , its a hybrid that does n't  belong in my portfolio . <h> Based On Company Specifics <p> Each company has a unique plan for growth and dividend distributions which is reflected in these stock classifications . <p> Blue-Chip Stocks <p> Blue-chip stocks are stocks of the biggest companies in the country . These are usually high quality companies with years of strong profits and steady dividend payments . They are also some of the safest stocks to invest in . Because the companies are large , stable investments , they do n't  have as much room to grow . This usually results in steady stock prices , but less upside for investors . As a result , historical returns for very large companies have trailed the returns of smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the S&amp;P 500 . <p> Income Stocks <p> Income stocks are often times related to " Blue Chip " stocks . They are stable companies that pay large dividends . Older people who are retired often buy stocks in these stable income companies since it provides them with a steady income stream in the form of dividends ( although I think that 's a poor reason ) . When you combine the dividend payments with the appreciation in stock price , these stocks often provide retirees with more money than they can earn by investing in bonds or other fixed income investments . Of course , this comes with higher risk that the stock price will fall in a market downturn . <p> Many energy and utility companies pay high dividends and are a good example of income stocks . <p> Value Stocks <p> Value stocks are the stocks of companies that usually have one or more of the following : <p> Low price-to-earnings ratios <p> Low- price-to-book ratios <p> Low price-to-dividend ratios <p> Low **28;0;TOOLONG ratios <p> In other words , they are under priced when compare to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of distress or financial problems . Other times , it may be due to investor behavior and cyclical trends . <p> Value stocks have outperformed growth stocks over the last- century , and as as a result , many investors tilt a portfolio to include more value stocks . - There is debate on the correlation between value stocks and additional risk in a portfolio . Some say that a value premium exists to compensate investors because value stocks are definitely more risky than other available investment options , like growth stocks . Other would argue that value stocks are under priced due to investor behavior and inefficiencies in the market . There is supporting research for both . <p> I personally think that the additional risk is minimal and primarily shows up in certain economic cycles when investors are less risk tolerant and the expected risk premium is high . But I also recognize that past performance is no indication of future performance , and as a result , would n't be surprised if value stocks do n't  fare well going forward . Despite all that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the value side . <p> Many times , " value investors " also take a look at factors beyond the relationship between price to earnings and book value when considering value stocks . They will evaluate company leadership and other qualitative factors before buying . Of course this is very difficult for the average investor today , despite what Warren Buffet has to say . <p> Growth Stocks <p> Growth stocks are stocks of companies with profits that are increasing quickly . This increase in profits is reflected in the rise in the companys stock price . These companies often reinvest the profits and pay little to no dividends to stock owners . In doing so , they hope that the growth in stock price is enough to keep stockholders on board . <p> Growth companies are often technology centered , and usually either sell a product or focus on research and design . Most of these companies experience rapid growth . Their stock prices often grow faster than underlying earnings , which results in high price/earning ( P/E ) ratios . This can continue for a while but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average , leaving some investors to get burned on these stocks . Growth stocks can rise in value quickly , but they often fall even quicker . <h> Based On Size <p> Market capitalization ( market cap ) is simply a way of referring to the size of a company in a manner that allows you to compare companies in different industries . <p> You compute market cap by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price . For example , if a company had 100 million shares of common stock outstanding and a current stock price of $50 per share , its market cap would be $5 billion ( 100 million x $50 ) . <p> Investors usually categorize companies under one of these labels although there is not universal agreement on the exact cutoffs . <p> Mega-cap : Over $200 billion <p> Large-cap : Over $10 billion <p> Mid-cap : $2 billion " $10 billion <p> Small-cap : $250 million " $2 billion <p> Micro-cap : Below $250 million <p> Nano-cap : Below $50 million <p> The size of a company is very important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mid , or large cap mutual funds . This means that the mutual fund only invests in companies of a certain size . <p> There is a strongly correlation here between risk and return. - Small companies are more risky than large companies because they have less resources available , havent established themselves as well in the market place , and may not be as well known as the giant stock issuers . <p> As a result of increased risk , these " small cap " companies have produced higher returns than " mid cap " or " large cap " companies over the- century . Continuing the trend , " mid cap stocks " have outperformed " large cap " and " mega cap " stocks . <p> For this reason , many investors choose to allocate more of their portfolio to small or mid cap stocks , also called a " tilt . " Again , this results in slightly more risk . <h> Summary of the Different Types of Stocks <p> Most investors choose to invest in common stock instead of preferred stock . The growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies are sometimes referred to as " blue chip . " They often pay steady dividends but have less growth potential . <p> Income Stocks provide investors with steady dividend payments . <p> Value stocks have good fundamental valuations and often pay dividends . They have outperformed growth stocks over the last few decades , which may or may not be a result of increased risk . <p> Growth stocks are generally more volatile and tied to economic cycles . They often outrun the underlying company earnings which results in a price correction later on . <p> Small Cap stocks have outperformed large cap stocks in recent history , but do involve more risk . <p> If you are looking to tilt your portfolio toward value companies or smaller companies , consider reading about Betterment . Ive been impressed with their service . Or if you prefer to buy and sell stocks yourself , Motif Investing is probably your cheapest option . <p> Hope you learned something about stock classification today . Let me know if I covered all of the different types of stocks or if I missed something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gentry <p> Ive been using Stash and I love it ! I 'm a beginner investor and have a lot to learn . Stash has made it easy for $1 a month . I 've looked into betterment and it seemed to be very similar to that . Do you have an opinion on stash ? <p> A great run down on the different types of stock available . Your point that value stocks have out performed growth stocks in recent times is extremely pertinent . Warren Buffet recently made the point that its difficult to find value in the SP500 but that there is value to be had in emerging markets . He is the ultimate value investor <p> Jacob , very nice classification of stocks , personally i would like to invest in large cap or blue chip stocks because as u mantion above bluechipstock are safe to invest rather than investing and our hard earned money in panny stocks.and bluchip companies pays regular dividend also .. <p> Knowing the different kind of stocks and stock classifications is important . I do find it confusing from time-to-time . Its one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the less you realize you actually know . <p> I 'm with DB 40 in that Im mostly in index funds so I do n't  think about this too often . But for individual stocks in a taxable account , I prefer growth stocks . I 'd rather have income stocks or other dividend paying stocks in a tax-advantaged plan . <p> Yeah , qualified dividends currently receive the same tax treatment as long term capital gains , so its a wash either way . But if that changes , an investors portfolio should be situated to take advantage of tax breaks . Good thoughts ! <p> I think the " value stock " definition kind of depends on how you 're looking at it . It seems like you 've defined it based on the idea of value investing , which is basically someone thoughtfully valuing a company and determining that its current price is low , making it what they consider to be a safe play . But in the more general sense , a value stock is one that simply has a low valuation relative to earnings ( or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whether or not that price is fair , and in fact is widely considered to be a risk factor . That extra risk is why they have shown to return more than growth stocks . So I actually think that for the regular investor , its more accurate to categorize value stocks as riskier investments that have the potential to grow more . <p> Ill clear up wording , perhaps it was a little convoluted . What you 're hinting at is the idea of a " value premium . " There is debate on the additional amount of risk involved , much of which is dependent on how you define risk . Its not worth getting into on a blog post comment , as a multitude of professional and academic papers havent resolved the issue . <p> What a great primer ! I especially like the breakdown between growth , income , value stocks , etc . As an index investor I do n't  think about these too often , but its great to know what 's making up the basket of companies were investing in. 
@@44824060 @4824060/ <h> Betterment Review 2017 <p> I enjoy- reading and writing- about the investment strategies discussed in this Betterment review . But that 's atypical , and most individuals would rather spend their time doing something other than managing an investment portfolio . <p> If you are n't  interested in tinkering with your investments , Betterment provides a straightforward approach to successful investing that requires very little time , money , or energy . <p> This approach bypasses most of the fees and expenses that erode investment performance. - These include commissions to buy/sell securities , loads- and- hidden fees charged- by brokerage firms , and unnecessary taxes . This strategy also helps mitigate some of the costly behavioral flaws- that are common to individual investors . <p> I 'll admit upfront that Im- impressed- by Betterments value proposition . They do everything related to portfolio management for you , and they do it very well . Beyond providing a low-cost , diversified portfolio , Betterment provides advanced tax loss harvesting , tax-advantaged- rebalancing , and a slew of other valuable services for a reasonable 0.25% in annual fees . <h> Betterment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $10 Billion in assets for more than 250,000 clients . The company takes pride in offering portfolio management services- that are affordable and easily accessible . <p> Here is a nice Betterment review created by the CEO and Bloomberg : <p> Betterments selling point is- ease of use . The online user interface is designed to be clear and easy to understand . <p> If you are looking to invest your savings- without having to worry about anything else , Betterment is for you. - There 's no researching which investments you need to purchase , or deciding when to rebalance your portfolio . Betterment does all of that , and more , - automatically . <p> With Betterment , you do n't  own individual stocks or bonds . Investments are held in the form of exchange traded funds- ( ETFs ) . The asset allocation between these various ETFs ensures that your account is not weighted too heavily in- any specific asset class , company , country , or sector , which ultimately reduces overall investment risk . <h> Betterment Investment Options <p> When you deposit money with Betterment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock and bond ETFs . Betterment uses ETFs instead of mutual funds because ETFs have lower expenses and receive preferential tax treatment , making them a better overall investment vehicle . <h> Stock Market Funds <p> Betterment 's investment committee has chosen stock ETFs that reflect the U.S. market , as well as international markets . These ETFs allow you to invest in thousands of publicly traded companies at once , providing huge diversification benefits . Betterment uses the- following ETFs for core stock exposure : <p> The- U.S. exposure covers the total U.S. stock market with a slight tilt towards value and small-cap stocks . The value and small-cap tilt has historically outperformed- the broad market , based on research by Nobel-prize winners Eugene Fama and Kenneth French . <p> By adding international stocks , investors- benefit from growth overseas in developed markets , including the U.K. , Japan , and Europe . - The emerging market ETF allows investors to capture growth in small but expanding markets such as Brazil , India , and China . These international securities- further diversify the- portfolio , resulting in less risk- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's investment committee has recently chosen to expand their bond offerings , which now include : <h> Your Betterment Portfolio <p> When its all said and done , the stock and bonds ETFs listed above are blended together to create your ideal investment portfolio . <p> When you create a Betterment account , - you will be asked a series of questions to determine your risk tolerance and investment time horizon . The Betterment algorithm then uses that information to create a portfolio tailored to your preferences . <p> If you are young and looking to build wealth , Betterment will recommend that you hold more stocks than bonds to maximize long-term growth . In my example , Betterment suggested that I have 90% stocks and 10% bonds . Here is how that looks in a taxable account : <p> If you are looking to establish an emergency fund , or if you have a shorter investment horizon , Betterment will recommend a more conservative portfolio that includes a larger allocation to bonds . <p> The Betterment process is designed to align your financial goals with the correct amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation , you can manually adjust your asset allocation at any time . <h> Personalized Retirement Advice ( RetireGuide ) <p> Betterments- RetireGuide- service- uses your personal retirement goals to recommend an appropriately diversified portfolio . This recommendation takes into account all sources of income , your savings rate , where you live , and what you expect to spend during retirement . Betterment reviews- all of your financial- accounts to make this recommendation , even if they are held outside of Betterment . <p> RetireGuide- automatically updates- with any changes in your accounts and helps you stay organized with a display of all of your retirement accounts in one place. - You can also now update the age at which you expect to receive Social Security benefits and even upload a Social Security statement file from SSA.gov for precise estimates and advice . <p> The result is a comprehensive view of your financial progress , with personalized advice on how to achieve your financial goals and retirement goals . The RetireGuide system will recommend the amount that you should be saving in order to achieve your goals. - If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimizes investment returns and recommends sustainable withdrawal rates to improve the longevity of your portfolio . <h> Betterments- Tax Efficiency <p> Betterment includes a number of services that can reduce your annual tax liability . <p> Tax Loss Harvesting - Capital losses can lower your tax bill by offsetting gains , but the only way to realize a loss is to sell the depreciated asset. - At its most basic level , tax loss harvesting is selling a security that has experienced a loss " and then buying a correlated asset ( i.e. one that provides similar market exposure ) to replace it . Here is a good video by Betterment reviewing the mechanics : <p> According to Betterments research , this- service would have increased Betterment returns by approximately 0.77% per year over the last decade. - That means this feature alone more than covers the 0.25% annual fee . <p> Spousal Tax Loss Harvesting Betterment now offers- TLH+ for married couples . When you enable TLH+ on your Betterment account , you will now be asked to provide your spouses Betterment account information as well . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across all accounts and help prevent wash sales ( simplifying your annual tax return ) . <p> Tax-Coordinated Portfolios - Tax-Coordinated Portfolio optimizes and automates your- asset location . It places your highly-taxed assets in your IRA accounts ( tax-sheltered until retirement ) , and your lower-taxed assets in your taxable account . Betterment- research shows that this strategy can boost after-tax returns by an average of 0.48% each year , which approximately amounts to an extra 15% over 30 years . <p> Smart Rebalancing Portfolio rebalancing is basically shifting money between the asset classes you 've decided to invest in. - If your ideal portfolio was 60% stocks , 40% bonds , the goal is to keep that asset allocation in balance . Over time , you might end up with 70/30 allocation if you never rebalance your portfolio , resulting in more risk than you originally intended . The problem is that rebalancing often- involves selling one asset class and buying another , which- can result in additional taxation . Betterment- uses- all available cash flows ( your deposits ) and reinvested dividends to- rebalance your portfolio . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tax- liability- over time . <p> Tax Efficient ETFs - Betterment uses ETFs instead of mutual funds , which can result in additional tax savings each year . ETFs are a more tax-efficient investment vehicle than mutual funds when held inside of a taxable account . <h> Other Betterment Features <p> Smart Deposit Allows you to automatically invest any excess savings that are sitting in your bank account . You tell Betterment how much you want to keep in your bank account and how much you want to invest , then Betterment uses those guidelines to automatically transfers- funds from your bank account to Betterment on a regular basis . This allows you to continue building a bigger investment portfolio without holding too much cash . <p> Beautiful Design - Betterment has a wonderful , easily accessible interface that can be accessed on any computer , tablet , or smartphone . The interface allows investors to easily control and edit any investment accounts held at Betterment . <p> Fractional Investing - Betterment can purchase fractional shares of any investment , which means that 100% of your money is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share costs $100 and you only have $60 available in your account , you 'll purchase- 0.6 shares and remain fully invested . <p> Behavioral Realities- Many people begin investing with good intentions , only to see the idea fade away like- a New Years resolution . If you do n't  enjoy managing your portfolio or reading about investing , you might neglect it altogether . Betterment does everything for you in exchange for a reasonable fee . <p> Great Customer Service- Betterment employees- are on hand seven- days a week to answer your questions by phone , email or live chat . Everyone we have talked with at the company has been kind and helpful . <h> Betterment Fees <p> Betterment offers three different plans , each with a different fee . <p> Plan <p> Annual Fee ( % of account balance ) <p> Annual Cost ( per $10,000 invested ) <p> Features <p> Betterment Digital <p> 0.25% <p> $25 <p> All services mentioned in this review are included <p> Betterment Plus <p> 0.40% <p> $40 <p> Betterment Digital + one annual financial planning call from a team of CFP- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Digital + unlimited financial planning advice from a team of CFP- professionals <p> Betterment Digital is the core offering . Betterment Plus and Premium build upon Betterment Digital by offering financial planning advice from a team of professionals . <p> Its also worth noting , - all three service tiers are subject to a $2 million threshold . Betterment waives all fees on the portion of your- account balance that exceeds $2 million . <p> Remember that in addition to the Betterment fees stated above , you 'll have to pay underlying ETF expenses ( which average about 0.10% annually ) . When you invest in any ETF , you will pay a fee to the ETF provider ( such as Vanguard ) . This is not unique to Betterment , and they do n't  receive any kickback on the ETF expenses . <p> Betterment charges no other fees . No trading commissions , no minimum required balance , no transfer fees , and no account closure fees . <h> Betterment Security <p> When reviewing Betterment , I wanted to verify- the measures taken by Betterment to secure each account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FINRA , and subject to all regulations set forth by the federal government . <h> Possible Drawbacks <p> Features Betterments biggest competitor ( Wealthfront ) recently began offering a number of services not yet available on Betterment , including a variety of advanced tax-loss harvesting features . Betterment responded by providing- Tax-Coordinated Portfolios ( discussed earlier in the review ) , but Wealthfront still maintains the edge for taxable accounts . <p> Cost of Service Betterment fees are reasonable , and I think the included features more than justify the 0.25% annual fee. - But if you are eager to learn about investing , you can manage your own portfolio. - <p> Investment Options Some investors might prefer to invest in asset classes that are not available through Betterment , such as real estate . <h> Betterment Review Bonus <p> Betterment is currently offering our readers up to one year of free investment management- as a limited time offer . <p> The signup process takes less than five minutes .

For a flat 0.25% annual fee , Betterment will create and manage a diversified investment portfolio tailored to your unique goals and risk profile . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Leo <p> Hey Jacob , I 'm absolutely new and clueless . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my future . I have a business I run in the summer ( 12 weeks ) and then work full time the rest of the year . I want to know if its honestly worth it to start out with $1000 with no automatic deposit ( I cater so leftover money will vary month to month ) . Will the fees outweigh the return ? Am I better off just investing in bonds through my local bank ? Sorry its so broad of a question but like I said Im clueless and just want to insure we have money that 's building without us touching it . Thank you in advanced . <p> Hi Leo , Betterment and Wealthfront are great options for someone just getting started . The fees are very low ( You would pay $2.50 annually per $1,000 invested ) , so it can make sense to start with something like $1,000 if that is what you have . Stocks have historically provided excellent long-term performance within a diversified investment portfolio , so that is one reason to consider using a robo-advisor instead of a local bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Would you be confident in using Betterment , given that their protection is limited to $500K ? By way of comparison , my understanding is that Vanguard accounts are insured by Lloyds of London for up to $50 million . What do you think ? <p> Hi Buff , First of all , $500,000 is the SIPC limit at every brokerage firm . Vanguards additional insurance has an aggregate limit of $250 million , which is a tiny fraction of total assets invested there ( several trillion ) . Therefore , if SIPC insurance was exhausted due to fraud or bankruptcy ( it does n't  cover financial losses due to normal market swings ) , its unlikely that the additional $250 million is going to help you recover your losses . For that reason , I would invest where you want to invest , or hold the $2 million in separate brokerage accounts ( up to $500,000 each ) if you are concerned about SIPC protection . <p> Hello Jacob , I am an old guy just getting into the world of investing ( Above the age of 45 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over again . Am I too late ? What would you advise for someone like me . I make $101,000 a year . Started the job finally in January . <p> Jacob , I stumbled onto your blog today and and very impressed . I 'm recently retired , 67 ( wife is 70 ) and fortunate in that our finances seem to be in pretty good order . In addition to other investments , mainly real estate worth perhaps 6M , we have my ( 401 ) k of around 800k under management with minimal interaction , a small IRA of about 133k managed by the same firm and my wifes IRA of around 700k managed by a different firm . Neither of us are savvy on financial choices nor are we likely to become suddenly interested or adept . We expect to live 30 years more based on family history . Something like Betterment or Wealthfront seems perfect for us initial decisions on risk and then minimal involvement , and reduced fees . As these are retirement accounts there would be little additional depositing . Is one option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts be held ( new Roth IRA , ? ) . Many thanks in advance . <p> Hi Jeffrey , Congratulations on your financial success . Both choices are great options for investors such as yourself . My reviews of each service cover the unique selling points , and many features do overlap . If your accounts are traditional , you can roll them into a rollover IRA . If you hold any Roth accounts , you would roll them into a Roth IRA at either firm . Any taxable brokerage accounts would also be separate . <p> Jacob , Informational review ! I am 22 , recently graduated , debt free , maxing my Roth and looking to take the next step by investing in some ETFs . ( If that is the next step ? ) I have set some lofty goals to achieve in the next 5 years as well as being foceused on my long term goals for early retirement . I 'm looking into investing 10k with Betterment to start working towards the 5-year goal . ( Of course , I already have my 6 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make my money work for me in the most efficient way . Is this the path you 'd recommend ? Any advice and guidance is appreciated . I 'm always trying to grow my knowledge and net worth ! Thanks . <p> Congratulations on your success . Those are great achievements . The optimal solution depends on your preferences . I think Betterment offers an outstanding service for busy professionals looking to build wealth . Of course , you can DIY for cheaper , but that requires some work and you wo n't ever obtain the complete automation/features provided by a quality robo-advisor . <p> I recently retired and I will also soon be receiving about $500k from an inheritance . I am considering using a robo-advisor to hold that inheritance . Some comments on your blog indicate that most of the robo-advisor clients are young people ( i.e. people in their accumulating phase . ) What are the drawbacks of robo-advisors for retirees ? Does Betterment , or do any of the other robos that you have used , provide advice on withdrawal strategy ? How do they select assets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for those replies Jacob ! What about my last question ? How does Betterment select assets to sell in order to satisfy withdrawal demands ? Or is that part of their " secret sauce " ( i.e. proprietary info ) ? <p> I already have a good amount saved for a safety net in a betterment account and a decent amount in the bank . I see you said if you plan on needing the money in a short amount of time its better the just save in a bank account . What exactly is considered short term ? If I plan on buying a car in the next 2-3 years is it better to save in a betterment account or the bank account ? <p> New to the blog ! A few investing blogs , even Betterment itself ( their " Safety Net " goal ) , have suggested using the market or even a ROTH IRA to build an emergency fund . You 're probably familiar with the idea , but its recommended because : A ) 8% average return , even with a conservative portfolio , is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) with taxable investment accounts you can withdraw at any time and with a ROTH IRA you can always withdraw your own investment ( not the interest ) . If Im honest , this seems dubious , but I also have kept everything in a brick and mortar bank mostly out of fear . <p> Is a conservative investment account or ROTH IRA a great place for an emergency fund , awful emergency fund advice or decent advice under a particular set of circumstances ? If the third option , what are the circumstances in which that is decent advice ? Thank you in advance ! <p> I 'm just doing a drive by , but noticed your question and I would say anything you put into an investment fund can not be considered emergency money . Maybe you could put it into govt bonds or something I guess ( although with the current govt who knows how safe that really is anymore . ) I saw the same thing in the 1990s the stock market was strong for many years in a row and everyone forgot that it actually does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it goes down the hardest , that is often when you need that emergency money the most . If you must insist on this approach I would say you should double the size of your emergency fund so that when there 's a massive crash ( as it will eventually happen ) you will have at least something to fall on . Investment accounts are not savings accounts ! The only reason you see very wealthy people treat them as such is because they often have big reserves to fall back on should the worst happen . And in any case any type of IRA is not good for this need since generally you end up paying big penalties if you withdraw the money before age 59.5 ( some exceptions but its not at all liquid ) . <p> Regarding a Roth IRA , in my mind unless you expect to pay more taxes when you retire than when you are working ( not very likely ) a tradition IRA is better because having that tax break helps you to save more . I might consider a Roth IRA if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap without needing the tax deductions ( maybe you just started working and have no debt to pay off and are already used to living frugally , for example ) . Most people need the classic IRA tax deduction in order to permit them to max out the contribution . I would say after paying off high interest debts and putting aside that emergency fund that maxing out the IRA is your next best thing to do with your money ( besides investing in yourself of course ) . If you work for a company with a 401K the allowed contribution is like 18K , and if you are an independent consultant than look into an SEP-IRA . <p> Hello , Jacob You have wisdom beyond your years so I am here asking for some advice . I am 26 with literally $0 saved up or invested . I decided to make a change and I am making the necessary changes . Budgeted so i can hit my emergency fund ( in a 1% savings account ) in a couple of months . After that is done with I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I opened up a betterment account but opening up an IRA from them is the best way to go ? <p> Hello Johnathan , Great job in setting goals and working hard to achieve them . Many of the tax features available through Betterment are only applicable inside a taxable account . An IRA or other tax-sheltered account loses tax-loss harvesting and some of the other features . Betterment is still an excellent option for establishing a Roth or Traditional IRA , and you can establish multiple different account types as you see fit over time . <p> Hi Jacob , Thanks for your review ! I recently got into Betterment to begin learning about investing . I have very little money , and I noticed you mentioned a 5% savings account . Would you be able to give me a link to look up information on that ? I am looking at needing to save for a down payment for a home within 5 years at the most and it seems from your previous posts that this would be the better option for that . Thanks ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to have 25% ( 200k ) saved to make a down payment on a first home purchase within the next 2-3 years . I currently have about 150k saved towards the purchase in a savings account earning 1% annually . Would it be worth considering moving this to a Betterment taxable account to earn greater than 1% for the next few years ? I was thinking about setting a conservative risk during that time , and then moving to more moderate risk after the home purchase and keep making new deposits into the Betterment account for the long term . <p> 2-3 years is not far away . Having a large equity allocation could prove risky if we experience a market downturn . Bonds are probably a little more safe , but still subject to decline if interest rates rise . That said , your plan is solid if you want to continue growing your Betterment account over time . I just do n't  know if I would risk the home down payment if needed in 2-3 years . <p> I just heard about Betterment and checked out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know nothing about investment , and I have very little money to invest ( if you were to ask today , I 'd say its in the double-digits . ) Just wondering , and this is definitely going to sound like a dumb question , but how low can starting investment be ? How low can monthly auto-deposits be ? I know on the site it says there 's no minimum , but most people in the comments tend to have at least $250 to invest ( at pretty much the absolute least as far as I 've seen ) . I have less than this , but given that I do n't  want to spend the rest of my days living hand-to-mouth ( as I currently do ) , I 'm itching to put my money into something that will one day grow . I want to build wealth and a retirement fund . I 'm in my late 20s , I have no loans , and have next to nothing . Is Betterment still a " place " for someone like me ? <p> Hey George , You could definitely begin using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the account balance . However , I would recommend at least having some funds set aside in an emergency fund before investing in stocks/bonds . <p> I 'm interested in starting an account with Betterment . I currently just have a small emergency fund of about $8,000 , and no other investments of any kind ( outside of a retirement account at work I do n't  know that much about ) . So is starting from nothing , and depositing $100 ( or more ) a good decision or should I just stick with my savings account ? Also My initial emergency savings goal was just $5,000 . I just wasnt sure how to start saving after I had hit that initial goal . Is there an upside to using some of that money to make an initial deposit with Betterment ? Lastly , I have a very simple tax return that I still can barely figure out on my own . Does having an investment like this complicate filing my tax return ? Appreciate any feedback you may have ! <p> Hey Ken , what are you financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons ) , but Betterment invests your money in a combination of stocks and bonds . As such , it is best suited for long-term investors who do n't  need the money for several years . Stocks and bonds have historically outperformed a savings account by a large margin , but there are no guarantees and sometimes the stock market is quite volatile . Regarding your taxes , you would receive additional paperwork if you utilize a taxable account ( to report taxable gains or losses ) . If you only have an IRA at Betterment , there are no additional tax forms until you begin withdrawing the funds . <p> Great article , really appreciate the solid advice you 've been handing out . I 'm just getting started on betterment . I have about 15,000 in a checking account doing absolutely nothing for me . I was thinking of contributing the maximum amount to a Betterment ROTH IRA immediately , and then putting 2,000 in a Build Wealth Account . For the remaining 7,500 I 'm thinking of putting in a Savings Account with the intent of adding 300 monthly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently make roughly 60k . Would you advise against any of this ? any help is greatly appreciated ! <p> Thanks for the great article . Say someone invested $500 just to try it out . Would the monthly fees likely exceed the returns ? Or , in other words , what would be the minimum amount to wisely invest for someone who 's mostly curious ? <p> I 'm thinking about rolling over my 403b from a former job which would put me over the $100000 threshold . Even with the management fee , I think I would come under the current fees I have with my current 403b company . How easy is the rollover process ? How much guidance does Betterment provide ? Also , if I also want to move over some of my taxable accounts , how might I go about finding out if I qualify for the beta test you mentioned rather than having to liquidate funds . Thanks in advance . <p> I have a managed account with fidelity for my IRA which is very expensive . I really not investment savy and wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things in retirement , hence my going with the Fidelity IRA managed account . I really never have a need to talk with the advisor , so I 'm wondering if transferring my Fidelity IRA over to Betterment would n't make more sense for me . It definitely would be cheaper . <p> I have approx $220,000 in a managed account in Fidelity . I pay approx 1.5 % of my balance for this " managed " account . I am not a savvy investor whatsoever . This is all the $$$$ I have . Would I d be better off moving it to Betterment ? I am afraid to make a mistake , yet , if Betterment would be doing basically the same things for me , I 'd be saving the $$$ I am paying Fidelity . As side question .. I do have a Roth IRA account with Betterment with approx $2,000 . I have had it since October 2014 . From that time , I am losing approx $150 . Does that sound right based on market conditions from then until now ? Any help you could offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees , and if you are n't  getting any help from an advisor , I do n't  see a reason to keep paying that . Regarding your Roth IRA , that does sound correct . Most stock and bond markets ( including the US ) are down since that time . <p> Well , when you say help , they are the ones deciding when and how much to buy/sell if whatever EFT . I guess that is " rebalancing " . I guess my question is , is Fidelity doing the same thing that Betterment , Wealthfront , Vaguard or anyone else is doing out there ? <p> Great review Jacob , Thanks.I have been struggling to decide between Wealthfront and Betterment . Other than fees and asset allocation difference , one particular area I struggle to understand is how they both execute Tax Loss Harvesting . Both companies do it differently and they both claim theirs is better . Could you please share you views on the tax loss harvesting comparison between two companies ? <p> Hi Jacob , I 'm 24 and I 've been trying to read up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stumbled upon your comprehensive review of Betterment , which I just heard and learned about for the first time today . I have some savings set aside for emergency fund , no debts of any kind , but I also do n't  have retirement accounts and no 401k . I want to start investing with Betterment . I was just wondering what your advice would be for someone in a situation like mine . <p> Hey Rinzin , Thanks for the comment and welcome . Sounds like you are in a good place with the emergency fund and no debt . I would personally start investing in the stock market to build long-term wealth . If you do n't  want to manage your portfolio , I think Betterment would be an excellent option . They offer the most benefit in the taxable account , with tax loss harvesting and other great tax features . You could also setup an IRA or Roth IRA there as well . Let me know if you have any questions . <p> Thanks so much for the prompt response ! I just opened Roth IRA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term investing with 90%stocks and 10% bonds . Please correct me if I 'm wrong ; I read somewhere that making a one time contribution of the maximum allowed in Roth has a slight advantage in the long run over going after DCA and making the monthly contribution . I 'm just a bit confused here and I 'm able to make the one time payment of the maximum allowed in my Roth IRA if you think that 's the way to go . Please advise . Thank you and Youre AWESOME = <p> Jacob , I manage my own ROTH IRA with Vanguard , and I feel comfortable doing that . However , I 'm considering opening an account with Betterment and throwing $10k into a taxable account there as I would like to invest more cash outside my IRA for the year . Would this be a good option ? <p> I am confused . I currently have about $500K in my company 401K , at Fidelity . In 2008 it had about the same , then took a HUGE hit but now I have recovered . I hear many top-notch experts/advisors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is afoot , similar to 2008 or at least 2002 . As I said , I recovered my big 2008 loss , but since I am now set to retire , I could not take another big loss of some 35-40% . So the answer , I hear , is to rebalance my 401k temporarily out of stocks for the next year ( taking a loss of the last of the bull , I know ) and wait out the big bear , then get back in . Preserve the seed corn before retiring , then put it back in , so to speak . <p> So I am confused . I want to move it all to Betterment , but want to be able to move my money out of stocks and into " cash " ( money market type things ) if needed . <p> Can I do this with Betterment , maybe by choosing a risk number or whatever it is such that it will have very high bond amounts ? ( Or are these dangerous high yield bonds ? ) <p> I 'm not sure if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser , newer policy of buy , hold , sell versus buy and hold , that buy and hold is dead , that one can due better by running from big market collapses by getting out of the market and then re-entering , especially when nearing retirement . <p> I am wanting so badly to go with Betterment , but afraid of a big market dip with my retirement looming , but I also like to be in stocks since they have the higher yield . So ability to rebalance out of stocks when danger lurks seems a good way to " somewhat more safely " be in stocks . Any help/thoughts appreciated . <p> That is trying to time the market , and empirical evidence shows that it usually fails . Yes , its been a bull market , but no one knows when that ends . If you want to hold cash , you would have to do that yourself . Betterment does not allow customers to hold a portfolio of cash equivalents . They add no value if that 's the case . <p> If I rollover a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betterment would the clock reset as having a new Roth IRA . e.g. would I have to wait another 5 years before I pulled that money for a house down payment or childs education ? <p> Hi Jacob , I 'm really happy I stumbled onto this . I 'm 26 year old that does contracting work , so I do n't  have retirement or anything except a savings account I put into every month since its just me . I do n't  understand all this stuff and have been reading and reading on joining up with Scottrade or Vanguard . Then I found this . Now I 'm leaning into this , mainly because I do n't  have the time to look , read , and understand where and how to invest . Its so confusing , I 'm trying to learn what I can from reading everything I can ! I read all the comments before I asked something , to make sure it was n't already answered . Most were ! Just another question and some clarification please and thank you . I can set up a bettermint account at 100 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then get to 10,000 and the % drops , etc etc ? Is the 100 a month the same as a Roth IRA . Or would this be 100 a month and then more money to put into Roth IRA ? I 'm confused on the difference . When you talk about the taxing , the Roth IRA is n't something you get taxed on as long you do n't  withdraw before a certain point ? What about the 100 or so a month I put into Betterment , is that something i have to worry about taxing at the end of every year ? Thank you Like I 've said , I 'm 26 , I just have a savings account , I 'm looking to set up a Roth IRA and let it sit for years till I hopefully retire . I need something set up sooner than later to retire on eventually . Is betterment the way to go for me ? <p> Yes , $100/month is fine . Roth would be tax-free if you delay withdrawals until retirement , and there are n't  any taxes to worry about . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the tax loss harvesting services will probably lower your annual tax bill . <p> I 'm a new investor and I do n't  have much money to play with , also have student loans . I have a 403-b going now , but do you think its a good idea to start a Roth-IRA or a traditional account with betterment ? My goals are long term investment , but i also would like the option to pull some out if I want to put a down payment on a house in 10 or so years . <p> What rate are your student loans ? If they are above 6% , its tough to beat that guaranteed return by paying them off . If you want to invest and have the ability to withdraw funds for a house , either IRA option will work . Roth allows you to withdraw your contributions at any time , penalty free . If you have owned the account for 5 years or longer , you can withdraw earnings without penalty for a first-time home purchase ( $10k max ) . Traditional IRA allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-time home purchase , penalty free . <p> From previous comments I read that this is not available outside the US . My question is if you know if this service is available for US citizens living abroad investing with US funds ? i.e. Funds coming in from bank accounts in the US . <p> Not sure about Betterment , but I assume it would work since were Americans living abroad with a Vanguard account . We have been investing for the past year with our US bank account and no problems . After all , you are transferring money from one US account to another . <p> If there is a problem with getting the website to load , or transfer money you can always subscribe to a VPN service , as we have had to do to pay some online bills back home . <p> Thanks for taking the time to write such a comprehensive review ! Ive been using Betterment for a while now auto-depositing $100 monthly into a Build Wealth fund and I 'm really excited about it . I started using it because it seemed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest but do n't  have enough extra cash to open a Vanguard index fund ( last I checked , the minimums for most Vanguard index funds were around $3,000-$10,000 ) . But I was glad to learn more about it from your post . <p> The one thing about Betterment that I do wonder about is the fact that their portfolio includes a relatively low number of international stocks . I know you mention international interest rate risk and international credit risk , but there is risk is U.S. stocks as well . It seems to me that it would be best to diversify as much as possible internationally ( news from China this past month notwithstanding ) . If you happen to have any thoughts on this , I 'd love to hear them . I 'm probably going to keep using Betterment regardless . But I 'm definitely curious and interested in learning more about this . <p> Hey Sarah , Thanks for the thoughtful comment and question . Its always great to hear from another satisfied Betterment user . Your current plan is a great way to build wealth over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betterment portfolios hold thousands of them . If you look at the included stock funds in my review , you will see VEA and VWO included . Those are both international stock ETFs . VWO holds over 1000 stocks from emerging international markets , and VEA holds over 1400 stocks from developed international markets . And if you look at your own portfolio online , I 'd imagine its similar to the screenshot in my review which shows that more than half of the total stock allocation is in these ETFs . That means Betterment is allocating a roughly half of the stock portfolio to international countries and half to the U.S. This is theoretically sound based on GDP and other economic factors . Hope this clarifies things for you and clears up any confusion . <p> Jacob , I 'm near retirement approx 1 year year or so . I 've worked at a major corporation for 15 years . I have a 401k where I can move a portion to an IRA . My 401k does have a variety with small cap , mid cap , large cap , stable fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specfic target expirations from 2015 -2035 . I have the option to move a portion of my 401k as I have done this in the past . So from that prevoius move , I also have $22k in a roth and $7500 in a regular IRA , both with Vanguard . I do have a brokerage acct at Vanguard where I have the ability to buy ETFs . I 've had a Vanguard ETF portfolio in the past , but have temporarily moved to a money market , due to volitility . I also have some cash in savings from the sale of a condo . I 'm past 59-1/2 . At retirement , my company pension and ssn should cover my expenses , combined around $60k annually , with some potential after retirement projects . Betterment looks like a good option and would place money there to grow for several years , maybe 5 years or more . What would you advise ? Move some of my 401k , or move the Vanguard IRA/IRA Roth , or the cash , or a combination of all . The cash is giving me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portion of the cash in any case . My company also matches up to 5% in my 401k . Thanks , Len <p> Len , its hard to say without knowing more about you and your risk tolerance . If your pension and Social Security will cover all living expenses , it would probably be wise to invest most of your 401k , IRAs , and cash in something that will grow . Stocks have historically outperformed other asset classes over long periods of time . You might keep an emergency fund in cash and think about putting everything else in the market for long term growth . But do n't  invest in stocks if you need the money in 5 or less years . <p> Jacob . I really do not much at all about investing . I am recently retired . And receive a pretty good guaranteed pension for life with 3% guaranteed annual growth . ( it has not missed in over 30 years ) . I also have a Roth IRA with 21.5 k with a large regional banking securities division . Within the Roth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA , stocks , bonds ) and it remains tax free . Being single , I like the Roth , as I do n't  have to worry about tax issues when I am older and probably more of feeble mind . = Within the Roth I have 3 structured CDs . Each CD follows a group of 10-12 stocks/bonds/commodities and performs accordingly . I have been making around 4-5% annually . I also invest in a few companies within the Roth . I do n't  do trades very often , maybe a few times per year . My Roth account is only about 6 yrs . old , and I will continue to make deposits . The bank fee is pretty high for any transaction . Would I better to keep that Roth where it is , or move it to something like Betterment ? I am definitely more of a " put-it and leave-it alone " kind of mindset . <p> Without knowing your specifics at that bank , I would almost guarantee you are paying excessive fees and management charges . And 4-5% is very modest in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , Betterment is likely a much better option with much lower fees . If your pension covers all your living expenses , I would also consider investing your Roth aggressively if you move it to Betterment ( i.e. large allocation to stocks ) . This will allow the opportunity for more growth over time to either spend late in life or pass to heirs ( but will also involve more risk/volatility ) . <p> What advice would you give to a 20 year old with all this ? I am a full time student and work part time so I do n't  have much saved up right now to invest ? What 's your best idea for me ? I 'd like to be able to start saving for a down payment on a house . <p> My best advice is to start building solid financial habits now . Learn the importance of saving and invest as often as possible while you are young . When do you want to buy a house ? As a general rule , you should avoid investing in stocks and bonds ( and choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money in less than 4 or 5 years . This is because you could see a significant drop in the value of stocks and bonds , and your portfolio would n't have time to recover before you needed to liquidate for your financial goal . <p> I currently have an emergency fund account with Betterment , and I have been contributing money based on dollar cost averaging . I am hesitant to contribute the total amount of what I ultimately plan to contribute all at one time considering that the market is so high right now . Any thoughts on this ? <p> Also , my wife and I each have Roth IRAs and traditional IRAs with Morgan Stanley and we have been weighing moving all of it to Betterment . However , the financial adviser is a friend of my wife and I am not knowledgeable enough to accurately tell her why we want to switch other than to pay significantly lower fees . Any suggestions on this , especially considering that she and her colleagues have probably all been trained on how to counter clients who want to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Morgan Stanley are currently at a loss of a few thousand dollars , so it pains me to take the loss in order to switch to Betterment . Any thoughts on this ? I assume it may be worth taking the loss considering that I will quickly make that up considering the drastically lower fees I will be paying with Betterment ? <p> Mike , thanks for stopping in , and valuable questions for all readers . 1 ) I wo n't lie , stock market valuations scare me right now as well . They are historically high . However , there is no guarantee that they wo n't go even higher . This bull market could last another couple of years , so I really cant recommend trying to time the market . The other consideration is that there are n't  a lot of attractive investment options right now outside of the stock market . Bond prices will fall as interest rates rise . Physical Real estate can be attractive if you want to mess with it , but REITs ( the easy way to invest in real estate ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) You have all the ammunition that you need in fees . Fees are a primary determinant of investment success , and there is plenty of research showing that ( email me if you need some links to show her ) . If you are paying significantly higher fees than Betterment , without getting significantly better investment results ( very likely that her friend is n't beating the benchmark indicices ) , you should take your money and leave . Do n't  feel bad about making wise financial decisions , even if the advisor does n't  like losing your **31;30;TOOLONG else being charged . 3 ) Do n't  worry about sunk costs . The loss has already occurred ( even though you do n't  have any tax consequences for losses inside an IRA ) . What 's done is done , and if you are losing money in this bull market , you need to leave ASAP . Think of it like this your current account balance is what you have available today . Do you want to invest what you have today at a high-fee brokerage firm that is losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is based on sound academic investment principles ? I think the choice is easy , even though the paper loss hurts . <p> Thank you for your response . You make some great points . I have two more questions . <p> 1 . I have linked my Morgan Stanley accounts up to Feex.com to see what type of fees I am paying for the mutual funds that we are in , and the fees are ridiculous ! I spoke with our financial adviser awhile back , and she she that she would put our money in ETFs if that would make use feel more comfortable due to the lower fees . However , I know I would still be paying the Morgan Stanley management fee and probably others , but they way they disguise the fees it is tough to know how much I am paying in fees on top of the mutual fund fees . Is there anyway for me to find this out to arm myself with more information when talk with her about pulling our money out . <p> 2 . I know you mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passive investing does not attempt to time the market , if I pulled all of our retirement accounts from Morgan Stanley now and moved them to Betterment , I would be putting a significant amount of money into their ETFs at a time when the market is very high , which is concerning . On the hand , if I wait for the market to drop ( who knows when this will be ) before pulling my money from Morgan Stanley , I will have less money to pull out and put into Betterment . Any thoughts ? <p> 1 ) It really is sickening to hear so many horror stories about brokers collecting massive fees while severely underperforming an appropriate passive index . Happens all the time ( you are n't  alone ) and I think it should be criminal . If she told you that she would put you in index ETFs , but you continue paying outrageous fees , I would use that reason to leave . Regarding how to see the layered fees that you are paying above the mutual fund fees , I imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Online sources wont know , because as you mentioned , they disguise and layer fees differently for each individual investor . I think you have all the ammunition that you need . Show her the outrageous fees and explain that you have a money manager ( Betterment ) that will charge you a mere 0.15% for a great portfolio , tax-loss harvesting , and everything else . 2 ) Realize that you are n't  ever really pulling your money out with tax advantaged accounts . You are just rolling it over and there are n't  any tax consequences for that if you do it right . What you have said is exactly my sentiment and is the exact reason that market timing really is n't possible in an illiquid account ( IRA , 401k , etc ) . You ca n't withdrawal that money ( to buy real estate , spend , etc ) before retirement age without paying taxes and penalties , so the stock market is almost always the best option . And if you are going to be in the stock market , you might as well just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right time is nearly impossible . 3 ) All that said , I would stop paying the outrageous fees immediately and move your money into Betterment . Even if the market corrects , Morgan Stanley cant stop that , and they will continue charging you fees <p> Jacob Thanks for the very informative , and easy to understand , article . I am sorry if this has been asked and answered but I did n't  see it . I have created my own taxable and IRA accounts using only Vanguard mutual funds . Am I understanding you correctly that to use Betterment , I transfer ownership of my mutual funds to Betterment , they cash in everything so that they can redo my portfolios in ETFs ( none of which I have now ) ? Thanks <p> Does Betterment and / or Wealthfront cover termination and transfer costs from the old providers ? I currently have a 403b with Vanguard and Franklin Templeton as well as a general savings account with Discoverbank . <p> I 'm pretty excited to try Betterment , but then I checked out the performance tab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Betterment returns are lower than the S&amp;P500 index . If that 's true , why bother ? <p> Hi Mason , thanks for stopping by . Its not an issue with the tool , or Betterment , its an education issue . Many investors do n't  understand benchmarking or the basics of index investing . The S&amp;P 500 is just one index , tracking 500 large-cap domestic stocks . Betterment is a company that builds diversified portfolios comprised of many indices , including large cap domestic stocks , but also small-cap domestic stocks , value oriented stocks , international stocks of all flavors , and a variety of bond funds . They provide completely diversified , global portfolios . As it happens , the S&amp;P 500 has done quite well in recent years . Much better than bonds and most international stocks . That 's why that one index has outperformed a more complete , diversified portfolio like those provided by Betterment . It does n't  mean you should run out and buy only the S&amp;P 500 . Wise investors understand the importance of diversification , and understand that most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summary , it does n't  matter if the S&amp;P has outperformed a global stock/bond portfolio in the last few years . Its not an appropriate benchmark , and there is not guarantee that this hot streak will continue . <p> Thanks for the quick response . I 'm just starting to learn about personal finance , and I was given the impression that the S+P 500 is the benchmark to compare to , and if you do n't  think you can beat it , join it . So , the S+P is just on a streak ? I have n't looked at a far back history . I started listening to Dave Ramsey telling me to expect 12% returns on mutual funds , lol . Its disillusioned me a bit <p> No problem , and I understand where you are coming from . Many have been mislead by Ramseys investment advice , but that 's another article altogether . The S&amp;P 500 is a fine benchmark and a fine index , for large-cap domestic stocks . Yes , large US stocks have done very well lately , but everything ebbs and flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent hot performance , as it will always be changing . Figure out your risk tolerance level , and build a diversified portfolio that you will be happy with for many years . You will see many " hot streaks " over the years , but stay the course and stay diversified . You will do well over time . <p> Great write up , Jacob . Thanks . My question is this : I 've been with Fidelity for 20 years . I have a mixed portfolio of mostly individual stocks and some mutual funds split between a brokerage account and an IRA . What 's the best way to switch to Betterment ? Do I sell all my stocks ? Do I keep everything as is at Fidelity and simply open a new account at Betterment ? Or a combination of those options ? ? <p> I 'd like to switch because as much as I say I 'll do it , I just never can get a handle on active investing . And the idea of automated investing and adjusting is very appealing . <p> Jeremy , You can always rollover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regarding the taxable brokerage accounts , The Betterment team said this : " Were working on being able to transfer over assets in-kind to mitigate any tax consequences ; however , its still in beta and only works in specific cases . Depending on if the customer qualifies , we may be able to open the beta to them as a test trial . Otherwise , such scenarios currently require liquidating the assets then transferring to Betterment . " <p> Hi Jacob , I 'm 63 yrs . old and retired , my wife is 53 yrs . old and still works . Together we make 100k a yr . She makes 52K and I make 48K ( SS , pension and annuity ) . We have 205K in savings . 115K in a taxable account and 90K in an IRA account both with Metlife Securities which has a 1.25% fee and also has not performed well during the past year . I want to move the 205K into a Retirement Income Fund which has a monthly payout either with Betterment or Vanguard . Would you recommend one company over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its mainly a question of your preference . Want to tinker with your portfolio , rebalance , etc ? Vanguard is great for DIY investors who are able to conquer most of the behavioral flaws that accompany buying high and selling low , trading too much , etc . If you want a portfolio with 10-20 ETFs , automatic rebalancing , tax-loss harvesting , and all the other things that either take time , or are n't  possible for the individual DIY investor , consider paying the 0.15% for Betterment . <p> Hi Jacob , I read a bunch of your reviews , great insight and well written , Thanks . Question I had is I believe Vangaurd is offering a management service also , how would you compare that to Betterment if fees are comparable since betterment uses lots of Vangaurd ETFs . <p> Hey Dave , thanks for reading . The Vanguard management service is twice as expensive for those with $100k and more . The investment side is also inferior . From what Ive read , portfolios are more simple ( arguable difference ) but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as tax loss harvesting , smart rebalancing , etc . In exchange for higher fees and inferior asset management , you do get online/phone access to a fee-only advisor . Now , how consistent the advice is , or how much time each advisor has per client , I do n't  know . But I suspect they are managing a full load . In short , I 'm yet to understand the role of Vanguards new service among traditional advisors and robo-advisors . High net worth need more than an online advisor/mass produced financial plan , and will probably always work with a good local team of financial experts . On the other hand , The masses who need quality money management/investing services are better off with the robo-advisors for reasons mentioned above . <p> Thank you for the writeup . It seems like a good service , but I 'm struggling to justify even the reduced cost of a service like Betterment over just following a similar model allocation and rebalancing diligently myself . Particularly for a tax-deferred account that is n't receiving active contributions . Would you disagree ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxable accounts , there is no way the average investor can perform the valuable tax services offered by Betterment . I think the fee is justified by tax-loss harvesting alone , and all the other features are just icing on top . 2 ) In tax-deferred , which you mention , you lose out on a few of the tax benefits . However , I still think the value proposition is there . They do everything for you , select great ETFs , rebalance , etc . For most investors , the result is a hands-off approach which reduces their ability and desire to actively trade , time the market , chase hot tips , etc . All of these things combined leave me recommending the service . I 'm not suggesting that a very discplined and sophisticated investor couldnt replicate the tax-deferred holdings at Betterment , just that it takes time and effort and the avoidance of all the common behavioral flaws that plague us all . Most investors would be better off focusing on their craft to increase income . Not attempting to determine proper asset allocation , purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just my $0.02 <p> Jacob my wife and I are currently investing with an advisor who charges .6% per annum . He invests in a 60/40 ratio of index funds through vanguard , ishares , and DFA funds . All are passively managed . We are retired since 2011 and our current ages are both 60 . We have about 1mm with this advisor . I have a small taxable account at Betterment . We are thinking of doing it ourselves at Vanguard with a 3 or 4 fund portfolio . All the money is in tax deferred accounts . Do you think Betterment would be a better choice in the long run ( 20 years ) vs Vanguard because of the diversity of betterments investments ? <p> That 's a possibility but no one knows if a small cap/value tilt or anything else will continue to outperform in the future . I do think Betterments portfolios are better than a simple 3-fund portfolio , but its no guarantee . I think your decision really lies within asking if you want to do it all yourself to save the 0.15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more ( Tax loss harvesting and other features you probably cant do yourself ) for a small fee ? <p> A 0.6% VS a 0.15% over 20 years , is a $90,000 difference . Can your advisor convince you he can make that much difference in the growth of your portfolio ? I do n't  think that is shown in the historical record . <p> Rachel , You can always rollover an IRA directly to Betterment without any tax issues . Regarding the taxable brokerage accounts , The Betterment team said this : " Were working on being able to transfer over assets in-kind to mitigate any tax consequences ; however , its still in beta and only works in specific cases . Depending on if the customer qualifies , we may be able to open the beta to them as a test trial . Otherwise , such scenarios currently require liquidating the assets then transferring to Betterment . " <p> My wife and I have about $17k between our 2 Roth Iras at Vanguard . About $10k in the target retirement fund 2055 , and $7k in vanguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , however we only started investing in 2013 . So , we have seen the brighter side of the economy . Do you think we are okay sticking to Vanguard target retirement , or would Betterment be a better option . We plan to max both of our Roth IRAs out in coming years . Appreciate your feedback . <p> Hi Peter , I think you will be fine either way , although you will get a more diversified and complete portfolio through Betterment . Target date funds are very simple , and actually charge higher expense ratios through the underlying mutual fund shares when compared with their respective ETF shares ( i.e. total bond market mutual fund has a higher expense ratio than total bond market ETF at Vanguard , even though mutual funds are inferior investment products when compared with ETFs ) . Betterment portfolios hold more index ETFs and I like that , but you are paying a small fee for that . If you have a taxable account that can utilize tax loss harvesting , I 'd say its a no-brainer for Betterment . <p> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if that 's changed . No fee . 2 ) You do n't  change from stocks to bonds , you can only change your risk tolerance score ( which changes your asset allocation ) . They do n't  believe in market timing or dynamic asset allocation so its not a feature meant to be abused . They attempt to rebalance using dividends and cash flows to avoid any taxes . There are no fees to change your risk tolerance score . <p> If they have a predetermined set of ETFs in the portfolio allocation how does tax loss harvesting work ? Suppose an ETF has a losing year , would n't tax loss harvesting imply finding a highly correlated security ( but not too correlated to be considered identical ) say SNEW , selling the loser and buying SNEW ? Where do they get the correlated securities ? <p> Hi Dan , Those are the ETFs they use when first constructing a portfolio . They have others that are used during tax loss harvesting . low-cost index ETFs are widely available , so its not difficult to find a correlated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold . <p> To Jacob , I am 62 yrs old and retired my wife still works and we earn 100k a yr between the two of us . I have 200k invested with Met-Life Securities which I do not withdraw from at this time . I have 10k in a regular savings account at my bank that we add $500 a month to it . We use this as our emergency or money as needed account . Would I be wiser to invest this regular saving account money and monthly deposit into a betterment account ? I would be taking out money as needed from time to time <p> Tom , if the 10k and $500/month are used as short term funds or an emergency fund , I would not invest that money with Betterment . Stocks and bonds are not appropriate investments for money needed on a whim because of volatility in pricing . <p> I have $100,000 in a deferred comp account . I am retired . I am almost 71 so face mandatory withdrawals . I do not need any income from this money as have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I consider something like Betterment ? Or are other options better ? <p> Ron , I think Betterment is a great option for someone in your situation . The automated tax loss harvesting is a wonderful feature and probably worth the 0.15% management fee in itself , but its only used in taxable accounts . In general , Betterment runs a very good program and their investment philosophy is sound . <p> Hi . So if I have $10,000 to invest in betterment right now and continue to deposit $100.00 each month will I be charged more for having that amount ? I guess I am really new at this and do n't  really understand . <p> I enjoyed the review ! = I do n't  know much about investing so this was a good option for me . The website is so simple for me to navigate and I also have the app for my phone . Love the automatic deposits and that they tell me if I 'm on track to meet my goals . <p> Ive been waiting for a product like this to come to market ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can have software do for us . Ive been using Betterment since May 2014 , and it works exactly as expected . The setup process was very smooth . Adding funds is a snap . <p> Why pay an " advisor " 1%+ ( sometimes much more ! ) for the same functions ! ? This product is a perfect fit for me , and its a bargain . You cant beat it . <p> Hey Jacob , The review has really got me interested in Betterment . I have been trying to find a way to start investing some of my money but am unsure of how to do it and really know nothing about investing at all . My wife and I have a budget set up and I want to stick with that as much as possible . So with any money left over after applying everything to our budget , I would put that into an account like Betterment . Does it make sense to start with an account as low as $250 , or should I save up to start an account like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just learned of Betterment . Sadly , I have not done much towards my retirement other than 401Ks . I currently have one sitting with Edward Jones . Do you think Betterment is a better option ? I 'm the " invest it and forget about it " investor and not at all interested in doing anything more . <p> Hey Kalyan ! I 'm a fan of both , but for different purposes . With Vanguard you 'll have to buy and sell any investments you would like to own . You will also likely need to rebalance your investment portfolio over time . It is free to trade Vanguard investment ETFs if you set up an account there . <p> Betterment is completely hands off . They actually use Vanguard for investments , but they buy/sell/rebalance/tax loss harvest for you . In return , you pay them a small ongoing fee . Does that help ? Thanks for reading ! <p> I am financially savvy ( work on Wall St ) and at this point in life have the ability to take risk and mostly do single stock investing and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversification . I have n't used Betterment just as a disclaimer and I came here after seeing ads for Betterment on my Mint account . <p> I just want to highlight a couple of things for some others who are interested in Betterment and looked at this good post ( especially if you are busy and are not financially savvy ) . There are a few points on fees which people generally focus on but I think Betterment is offering something very significant which trumps all this if you are not financially savvy and can think 20-30 years down the line : <p> 1 ) Automatic investing As of now something that even I am very guilty of , I only actively invest when I see a lot of money sitting in my checking/savings account . While automatic investing is easy on your 401k not all brokerages make it easy to do this . This is probably the biggest wealth creating step in your life if you manage to do this in a disciplined way . <p> 2 ) Automatic rebalancing People who were close to retirement and did n't  rebalance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally ) are going to really struggle through the rest of their lives in what is probably the greatest American human tragedy since World War 2 . If you are not financially savvy and are too busy to actively take an interest in how/where to invest , I can not recommend a service like Betterment ( or some inevitable competitor ) more highly to you . The generation after the boomers have been left to fend for themselves for retirement and with how complex the whole investment space is , being disciplined from a young age can not be more emphasized . <p> Your advice is sound . For such a young couple , you have obtained wisdom in financial matters beyond your years . You have also mastered the art of getting more for less . Being frugal is not being cheap . Being frugal means not being stupid . Perhaps the smartest thing anyone can do from a financial standpoint is to diversify their investments as long as they do n't  take their profits and spend it on bottled water . 
@@44824061 @4824061/ <p> Most people stop at financial assets when calculating net worth . For a comprehensive view , you should also include non-financial assets- like your human capital ( the present value of anticipated lifetime earnings ) . - The reason for this is simple human capital is converted into financial capital through the process of saving . <p> For example , a recent college graduate often has negative financial assets ( debt ) , but significant human capital ( earnings potential ) . After starting a new job , the graduate can begin saving part of each paycheck , converting human capital into financial capital . At retirement , human capital is depleted but financial capital should be peaking . <p> Financial liabilities include any form of debt , such as : <p> Auto loans <p> Student loans <p> Mortgage loans <p> Credit card debt <p> Money owed to- anyone <p> When calculating your assets and liabilities , the value of each item should be estimated using the current market value . For example , the best estimate for the value of your jewelry is the price that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today ) , not the price you paid at the time of purchase . <h> Net Worth Example <p> Let 's assume that you have the following assets : <p> Furniture worth $5,000 <p> A- home worth $150,000 <p> Two cars worth $25,000 <p> Electronics worth $5,000 <p> $125,000- saved in your 401k <p> $20,000 in your savings account <p> Total assets ( ignoring human capital ) = $330,000 <p> Let 's also assume- the following liabilities : <p> Student loans totaling $50,000 <p> A mortgage balance of $105,000 <p> Total liabilities = $155,000 <p> Net Worth = ( $330,000 $155,000 ) = $175,000 <h> What Does Your Net Worth- Mean ? <p> Most financial decisions will increase or decrease your net worth . By tracking your net worth over time , you can determine if your financial decisions are helping or harming your financial- progress. - If your net worth is continually moving upward , that means you are increasing your assets faster than your liabilities . If your net worth is decreasing , - the opposite is true . <p> Increasing your income and/or decreasing your expenses will result in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net worth . <p> Buying a brand new car , new electronics , household products , or other depreciating assets will decrease your net worth , because after being used these products are worth far less than the price you paid new . <p> Insurance is a tool used to protect your net worth. - Most insurance products will actually decrease your net worth over time , because you must pay ongoing premiums to the insurance company in exchange for coverage . <p> But without insurance , an unforeseen event could destroy your net worth in a flash . The- small premium payments eliminate the possibility of a major loss . <h> Your Net Worth Can Be Misleading <p> Your net worth is a financial snapshot at one point in time . Checking your net worth- once is not very valuable , because it provides no context . <p> Individuals in peak earning years are able to increase their net worth quickly , converting their human capital into financial capital by spending less than they earn . <p> Individuals in retirement will often see their net worth decline with age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial assets . <p> For most people , net worth will fluctuate in each stage of life . <p> 2 ) Investment- fluctuations <p> Hypothetically , let 's assume that- you have- $500,000 invested in the stock market . If the stock market has a major correction like the one observed in 2008 , the value of your investments ( and your net worth ) could be cut in half . <p> If you sell all of your stock holdings after the market tanks , you will guarantee the loss and realize a massive reduction in your net worth . If instead , you remain- invested long enough for the market to rebound , your net worth will recover . This scenario highlights- the importance of tracking your net worth to evaluate your financial progress over- time . <p> 3 ) Comparing to others <p> Another dangerous game is- comparing your net worth to someone else . You probably have unique financial goals , a different- career , a different family situation , and many other differences . But your net worth does n't  capture these differences . <p> For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are multiple interpretations of that number : <h> How to Track Your Net Worth <p> There is n't any perfect method for tracking your net worth , but I personally recommend the following : <p> An Excel spreadsheet <p> Personal Capital <p> An Excel spreadsheet is useful for two reasons . First , it forces due diligence . To list all of your assets and liabilities , you must think about and acknowledge your financial situation . And second , - it can help keep your family on the same page . Should something ever happen to me , my family can use- the Excel sheet to identify assets and liabilities . <p> Personal Capital is a much easier solution . After signing up for a free account- and securely- linking your financial accounts , the software automatically updates your net worth in real time . This allows you to track your assets and liabilities without any manual effort . <p> We use a combination of Excel and Personal Capital to track our net worth . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> Great post ! I agree its important to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Someone in their late 20s who just graduated from medical or law school will likely have a negative net worth , but substantial earning power over the next few crucial years . I think its important to capitalize on your own situation for your benefit . For example , the recent med school graduate may choose to have a much riskier investment portfolio , knowing that the high salary can smooth out the volatility ride . Someone who earns less , but has a higher net worth because of years of saving may want a more conservative portfolio to make a career change , or retire . <p> I cant believe this is the first time Ive come across this site . You two have a cool thing going here . You guys did a great job explains the concept and details of both understanding and calculating net worth as an individual . Its so easy for folks today to see there available credit as there available cash to spend . But if you keep the financial lens of net worth In focus your not Gona see it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Our net worth is n't high at the moment , but we think were doing great that our net worth is in the positive 5 figures with me being two years out of college and my husband still being a student . We plan to continue saving and stay debt-free throughout the rest of his school . Once he graduates , we hope to kick our savings and investing into high gear . Thanks for the motivation help . <p> This is such an important topic ! So many people think of net worth as a business term , but when you look at your personal net worth itll really change the way you look at debt and money in general . And its fun to see your net worth improve ( hopefully ) over time ! <p> I love tinkering around with numbers ! Our number is $500,000 even . We have less than $40,000 left on the mortgage and then the mortgage payment will be going toward investments . We currently have just over $60,000 in cash and retirement accounts , so we have a ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its relative in nature as what 's important to some will likely not be important to others . Were slowly , but surely , growing our net worth and us starting our own business was a key part in that equation . <p> I have just started growing positive net worth after I got out of my credit card debt . That was my first goal . It will take me some time to get to financially secure , but I wont stop trying to reach that goal . <p> I 'm using the 4% rule to figure out how much I need to be financially independent . My magic number is $625,000 ( $25,000 x 25 ) . I 'm currently sitting at $128,000 , so I have a ways to go . I do include my retirement accounts in my networth even knowing that I do n't  plan on touching them until age 59.5 . I have a separate calculation to figure how much I need to live on until I can withdraw from the Roth 401k and Roth IRA . <p> Once B and I get married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint expenses ( hopefully lower than living as a single ) and our retirement goal . <p> Nice overview . I know net worth is just a number and does n't  really mean much , but I like to track ours just to make sure its headed in the right direction . Plus , its fun ( especially when paying off debt ) to watch that number go from negative to positive and then continue growing . Financial freedom is an awesome goal to have , but its a long ways away for my wife and I. 
@@44824064 @4824064/ <h> Wealthfront Review 2017 <p> Wealthfront is one the largest independent robo-advisors with more than $7 billion in client assets under management . They have combined the best of modern technology with rigorous investment research to- provide diversified , low-cost , tax-efficient- portfolios comprised of index ETFs . <p> In plain English , Wealthfront makes it easy for anyone to get access to a diversified , long-term investment portfolio ( and financial advice ) without the high fees &amp; account minimums of traditional wealth managers . <p> Wealthfront will manage your first $15,000 for free- if you sign up through this website. - For balances larger than $15,000 , the management fee is a flat 0.25% per year . <h> Wealthfront Background <p> Since launching in December of 2011 , Wealthfront has grown into one of the most sophisticated robo-advisors in the world . <p> Much of this success can be attributed to Wealthfronts team of experts. - CEO Andy Rachleff is vice chairman of the endowment investment committee at the- University of Pennsylvania and a faculty member at Stanfords School of Business . He was previously the co-founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by- Burton Malkiel , Ph.D. , who is the Professor Emeritus of Economics at Princeton University and author of the best-selling- A Random Walk Down Wall Street. - Other members of the investment committee hold a doctorate degree or the Chartered Financial Analyst ( CFA ) designation . <p> Here is an excellent introduction to the company and the service provided : <h> Wealthfronts Investment Process <p> Getting started with Wealthfront takes less than ten- minutes . The section below will describe the onboarding process for new Wealthfront clients . <p> 1 ) Select your investment preferences <p> When you first- create a Wealthfront account , you will be asked to select your investment goal . You can choose between retirement savings , general savings , college education , or something else entirely . Your answer will help Wealthfront suggest the correct type of investment account . <p> Wealthfront then asks you to complete eight multiple-choice questions about your investment preferences and risk tolerance. - The questionnaire is designed to assess your willingness and ability to accept investment risk , and Wealthfront uses this information to recommend an appropriate asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more stocks than bonds , because stocks have historically offered greater risk ( volatility ) and reward . <p> 2 ) View recommendations <p> After you complete the questionnaire , Wealthfront will explain- your assessed risk tolerance on a scale of 1-10 , with 10 being the highest risk level . <p> When I went through the process , I scored a 10/10 , which is not surprising . I 'm young and I have a long investment horizon , making stocks a great investment choice for me . <p> If you do n't  like the Wealthfront recommendations , you can change your asset allocation by adjusting your risk tolerance . Once you decide on your preferred portfolio , simply click " next " and fund your new account with a minimum of $500 . <h> Wealthfronts Tax Efficiency <p> Wealthfront offers several unique features to reduce the annual tax burden- of investors . <p> Differentiated Asset Location Wealthfront- uses a different mixture of asset classes for your taxable and retirement accounts . For example , municipal bond interest is exempt from federal taxation , making municipal bonds more attractive when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corporate bond interest is taxed as ordinary income , making corporate bonds suitable for tax-sheltered- accounts . <p> Automated Rebalancing Wealthfront maintains your desired asset allocation over time . Hypothetically , let 's assume that your portfolio begins with an asset allocation of 50% stocks , 50% bonds . Over time , stocks might outperform bonds resulting in a portfolio comprised of 60% stocks , 40% bonds . That 's not ideal because the portfolio now has more risk than you are comfortable accepting . Rebalancing is the act of returning that balance to 50%-50% . Wealthfront rebalances as efficiently as possible , using the following methods : <p> Intelligent Dividend Reinvestment Wealthfront automatically reinvests all dividends into the asset class that is underperforming , reducing the need to sell winning investments . <p> Cash Flow Reinvestment If you 're adding to your Wealthfront balance over time , they use those funds to automatically purchase the asset class which is underperforming . Again , this maintains your ideal asset allocation without requiring the sale of one asset class ( which results in less taxation ) . <p> Wealthfront 's Selling Plan Selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and commission free . Many professionals- receive company stock as part of a compensation package , but its risky to have a sizable portion of your wealth tied to a single companys stock . The Wealthfront selling plan allows you to sell your company shares gradually , - minimizing taxation in the process . Doing this on your own is expensive and time-consuming , and Wealthfront is the only company to offer this service . <h> Passive Plus Investing and Tax Reduction <p> Wealthfront now offers three unique investment features designed to increase your return and reduce your tax liability . <p> 1 ) Daily Tax-Loss Harvesting This feature is free for all taxable Wealthfront accounts. - Tax-Loss Harvesting works by taking advantage of investments that have declined in value ( a common occurrence in a diversified investment portfolio ) . By selling declined investments at a loss , you earn the right to deduct that loss from your taxable income " thus lowering your annual tax- burden . <p> What 's more , you can replace any investment sold in this manner with a highly correlated alternative investment . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio is unchanged , even as you gain tax savings . These tax savings can then be reinvested to further grow the value of your portfolio . <p> At Wealthfront , when one of your ETFs- drops in value it is automatically sold and quickly replaced by a highly correlated alternative . <p> 2 ) Tax-Optimized Direct Indexing Available to clients with $100,000 or more invested , Wealthfront will create your own index portfolio , harvesting losses among the individual stocks in the S&amp;P 500 or S&amp;P 1500 . This feature is unique to Wealthfront and can not be found anywhere else . <p> Instead of using a single ETF investment to implement the U.S. stock allocation of a portfolio ( typically Vanguards Total Stock Index ( VTI ) ) , Tax-Optimized Direct Indexing replaces VTI- by directly buying up to 1001 individual securities from the S&amp;P 500 or S&amp;P 1500 indices . <p> Thus , if a single stock in the portfolio is down in value , it can be- sold to harvest losses ( even if the overall market is up overall ) . In purely index ETF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. stock market ETF declines in value . <p> Wealthfront offers 3 levels of direct indexing to clients : <p> Wealthfront 100 : Available now- for taxable accounts of- $100,000 , the Wealthfront 100 will utilize up to 100 of the largest capitalization stocks from the S&amp;P 500 combined with specific ETFs to provide US stock market coverage equivalent to Vanguard 's Total Stock Market ETF ( VTI ) . <p> Wealthfront has written a few research oriented white papers on the topic of tax loss harvesting . They conclude that a portfolio including Wealthfronts Daily Tax-Loss Harvesting service and Tax-Optimized Direct Indexing- service could add up to 2.03% annually in additional investment returns ( compared to VTI only ) <p> Advanced Indexing blends five single-factor strategies ( value , momentum , high dividend yield , low market beta , and low volatility ) with the cap-weighted market index ( VTI ) to generate a new modified index . This new index then serves as the benchmark for the Direct Indexing tax loss harvesting algorithm in your portfolio . <p> Historically , this strategy has provided additional portfolio gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily tax-loss harvesting and direct indexing services previously described , Wealthfront estimates the overall after-tax benefit to be as much as 3% each year , as discussed in their latest- research . <h> Wealthfronts Portfolio Line of Credit <p> With this service , Wealthfront offers you access to immediate cash without disrupting your investment strategy . A home equity line of credit offers a similar way to obtain cash , but Wealthfronts Portfolio Line of Credit offers several important benefits not found elsewhere : <p> Availability : Wealthfront clients with an account valued at $100,000 or more have immediate access to the line of credit . <p> Low-Interest Rate : Your line of credit is secured by your diversified investment portfolio , and current rates are between 3.5-4.5% depending on your account size . <p> Complete Flexibility : Borrow the amount you need , when you need , for any reason . Then repay on your own schedule . <p> No Application or Fees : If your account is eligible , you have a line of credit . Simple as that . No paperwork , credit checks , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30% of the current value of your Wealthfront account ) and Wealthfront sends you the money as quickly as one business day . <h> Path by Wealthfront ( + Wealthfront Portfolio Review ) <p> Path allows you to- link all of your external financial accounts through your Wealthfront Dashboard . The service can then evaluate your accounts to- measure- four important metrics : <p> Fees <p> Cash Drag <p> Tax Efficiency <p> Diversification <p> If your external- accounts are flawed , Wealthfront offers a unique solution and an opportunity to easily transfer your funds into a new Wealthfront account . Instead of selling everything at once , Wealthfront uses their Tailored Transfer process to migrate your investments tax-efficiently over time . <p> Path also allows you track- your financial progress in real time . Path uses your real transaction history to calculate a rolling 12-month average of how much you 've been saving and spending , then provides advice on how to achieve your financial goals using this data . <p> If that 's something you 're interested in , take a look at this video : <h> College Planning with Path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice .

Just like with retirement , you can adjust the inputs to see the impact of increased savings . Want to make it personal ? You can upload a custom image for each account on your dashboard . <p> Wealthfront is the only robo-advisor offering a cost-effective 529 plan and a personalized college planning service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection <p> Wealthfront maximizes the protection of your assets by doing the following : <p> Third party custodian : Your assets are held in an account at a third-party custodian named Apex Clearing . Wealthfront only has the right to issue trading instructions against your account . The firm- can not access your money , - other than to receive the agreed upon advisory fee . You are the only one who can deposit into , or withdraw from your account . <p> SIPC Insurance : Wealthfront is protected by SIPC insurance . This insurance covers up to $500,000 in securities for each type of account you hold with Wealthfront . An IRA is considered a different type of account than a taxable account for this purpose , but different types of IRA accounts are considered one account for this purpose . SIPC insurance also covers up to $250,000 in cash . <p> Additional coverage : Apex Clearing has secured excess SIPC insurance that provides an additional $150 million of coverage to all its clients . <p> Everything is held in street name : Wealthfront only invests in SIPC covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DTC ) . That means the securities purchased on your behalf by Wealthfront are held separately from other Wealthfront assets and remain fully insured . <p> No rehypothecation : Wealthfront clients only have cash accounts ( not margin accounts ) at Apex Clearing . That means at no time can the cash or securities held in your account be loaned out or borrowed by Wealthfront or Apex . <h> Wealthfront Fees <p> For all of the services described in this review , Wealthfront charges an advisory fee of 0.25% per year . Your first $10,000 invested has zero management fees . However , they are currently offering readers of our blog an additional $5,000 managed free for a total of $15,000 . <p> If you were to sign up here to receive $15,000 bonus , here is the total annual cost by account balance : <p> Total Account Balance <p> Balance Subject to 0.25% Annual Fee <p> Total Annual Fee <p> $10,000 <p> $0 <p> $0 <p> $25,000 <p> $10,000 <p> $25 <p> $50,000 <p> $35,000 <p> $87.50 <p> $100,000 <p> $85,000 <p> $212.50 <p> $150,000 <p> $135,000 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incur no other fees- outside of- the- 0.25% advisory fee . There are no trading commissions , custodial fees , or exit fees if you close your account . <p> Keep in mind that although Wealthfront charges no additional fees , you will have to pay fees for the underlying ETFs that you own through Wealthfront . You would pay these even if you managed your own portfolio . These are typically around- 0.10% annually on top of the 0.25% management fee . <p> Once you have an account opened and funded , you can get an additional $5,000 managed free for each friend that you invite who opens and funds their account . The person invited gets an additional $5,000 managed for free as well . That 's $5,000 for the both people involved . There 's no limit to the amount you can get managed for free and these funds are managed free for as long as the account remains- open . <h> Possible Drawbacks <p> No fractional share investing Betterment and Motif Investing both allow investors to utilize fractional shares , but Wealthfront does not . For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more than $125 per share today . If you only have $100 available in your investment account , Betterment and Motif will allow you to purchase a partial share . At Wealthfront , no investment would occur until your account balance exceeds $125 . <p> No cash equivalent investments- At Wealthfront , your money is invested in a blend of stock and bond ETFs . Financial markets are risky , and you can lose your money even in their most conservative portfolio. - If you are a very risk averse investor , or if you need immediate access to your funds , - Wealthfront wont be the best fit ( consider a savings account ) . <p> No customization Wealthfront recommends a diversified set- of ETFs to everyone , but no customization is allowed . If you do n't  want real estate in your retirement account , too bad . If you want to own a small-cap ETF , too bad . They do make very good , research-based recommendations , but you ca n't tinker with the allocation . <h> Wealthfront Review Summary <p> Wealthfront offers quality asset management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I think Wealthfront offers even more to a select group of people : <p> Individuals just getting started : Wealthfront recently lowered their minimum account funding to just $500 . This allows almost anyone to open a new account and start building wealth . When combined with their offer to manage $15,000 free of charge , Wealthfront is a great option for new investors or individuals wanting to test the service . <p> Young professionals and families : Wealthfront is focused on offering services and features that directly address the needs of young professionals . The Wealthfront 529 College Savings Plan , Stock Selling Plan , and Path ( Financial Planning ) are examples of unique services designed- to help young families manage their finances . <p> Individuals who have an extensive network : All investors who sign up through our website begin with $15,000 managed free , but each additional referral results in an additional $5,000 managed free . Someone with an extensive network could have a sizable portfolio managed for free . <p> Individuals with $100,000 or more to invest in a taxable account : Retirement accounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taxable account balances in excess of $100,000 receive Wealthfronts Passive Plus suite of tools , which can reduce your tax liability significantly . Wealthfronts tax features become more valuable as your account balance grows , and no other robo-advisors offer anything comparable at the moment . <p> Wealthfront Review 2017 <p> Summary <p> In my opinion , Wealthfront is the best robo-advisor in existence . In 2017 alone , Wealthfront has added several innovative features , including Path financial and college planning , a portfolio line of credit , and the Passive Plus suite of tax reduction tools . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Don <p> I am considering opening a $2500 Roth IRA with Wealthfront . I would like to keep the money available in case I should need to use it . Is this a wise choice , or would it be better to not use an IRA for this purpose ? Thanks . <p> I 'm 19 and I 've done 2 summer internships and have a few thousand dollars that I would like to invest and I think Wealthfront would be great for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do n't have any knowledge about investing in stocks and bonds . I know that Wealthfront makes you take a risk test which will determine how your assets would be allocated . For example let 's say Wealthfront puts 70% in stocks , 20% in bonds , and 10% in real estate . What does that really mean ? How can I watch the stock market to determine how well my investments are doing ? Does Wealthfront 's algorithms find and manage appropriate stocks for my case ? Do I get to see what stocks that Wealthfront has chosen for me ? If I create a Roth IRA with Wealthfront do I just put money in annually and watch it grow ? <p> Hi , have a personal investment account at wealthfront . So far I 'm pleased with an overall 5% rate of return in 4 months . I have a 401k ( non matching ) and pension plan with work so this additional account is more of a long term savings ( not roth eligible ) . My question is , given that it is liquid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I DO plan to use in the relatively near future ? I have a vehicle I 'm selling , but plan to use the money in about 6 months to purchase a new one . I 'd like that money to earn something while it is in a holding pattern . Or am I better off just sticking it in my credit union ? <p> Natalie , you can go either way . The tradeoff is between risk and reward . The credit union is very low risk and reward . Wealthfront portfolios are invested in stocks/bonds , which means you could make money in 6 months or experience a loss . Future returns are uncertain ( risky ) . <p> I 'm in my early 40s and starting a Roth IRA for the first time . Wealthfront seems like a great option ; however , if I decide I do n't  like it , are there penalties for moving my investment elsewhere ? If I wanted to change companies how would I go about doing it ? <p> Also is the .025% fee considered low for the industry ? With max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thanks ! <p> I am 28 years old . I recently opened a Roth IRA account with Betterment ( 90% stock and 10% bonds ) . I contribute 12% to Roth 401K . My employer matches 33% of the first 6% . I am wondering if it is worth to start a general investing taxable account with Wealthfront considering the first $15K managed for free . <p> Thanks ! Currently , given my age , my portfolios ( IRA , and 401K ) is at high risk ( &gt;90% stocks ) . I was going to structure the wealthfront account as more moderate risk . What do you think is a good stock to bond ratio : 60/40 , 70/30 etc. ? <p> Hi Pree , Your optimal asset allocation depends on your risk tolerance and many other personal factors . I would recommend that you choose an allocation that makes you comfortable for the long haul . More stocks means the potential for higher returns , but also the potential for significant losses . Bonds are much more stable , with a lower average return . <p> One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you cant explicitly modify their allocations for you . But the questions you answer in the risk assessment determine your risk tolerance which they encapsulate as a numeric " Risk Score " . While you 're able to influence your asset allocations directly , you are able to change your Risk Score once every thirty days . This gives you the ability to tweak their asset allocation strategy for your account to be more conservative or more aggressive within their strategy and allocation templates . <p> I point this out because I 've created a site where I 'm logging my Wealthfront investment performance results monthly to help visitors gauge how its performing for me . But the important things is that I am not using Wealthfront for my complete investment plan . Instead , I invested $10,000 that I had sitting in a meager 0.95% interest rate savings account with Wealthfront and dialed my Risk Score down to their lowest value of 0.5 . This is their most conservative investment profile and I 'm running this test to see how it performs compared to a traditional savings account . <p> Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds taxable , IRAs and 401k , into either Wealthfront ? Putting all of my taxable account funds into Wealthfront would exceed the $100,000 limit to take advantage of direct indexing . To simplify things , I 'd just as soon have all of my investments in one place , then , so I 'd move over my IRAs and 401k . Kind of all my eggs in one basket . Is that too risky ? Should I have everything in Wealthfront ? <p> Hi Bill , I cant give you specific advice , but I also prefer simplifying my life and having accounts in the same location . Wealthfront uses diversified ETFs , and therefore offers a good solution for any type of account . <p> Thank you for the great information . You really provide a great resource ! My husband and I are considering moving our retirement ( SEP-IRA ) , currently valued at about $225,000 to Wealthfront or Betterment . ( Im 49 , my husband is 45 ) . We are currently using a traditional advisor , and I simply ca n't stomach the fees any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also considering Vangards Personal Advisor Services in the mix . Any thoughts on how this might compare ? <p> Betterment and Wealthfront are better at asset management IMO . They include more features , but cost less than VPAS . The only advantage to VPAS is access to an advisor , but I have no personal experience with that . I have heard that the employed advisors service too many clients , making it difficult to get real advice when needed . As such , I have n't considered VPAS , and would rather save the difference in annual fees by going with Betterment or Wealthfront . <p> I just inherited some money $100K , I have no cc debt , I have an emergency fund . Ive been sitting on this money for about a year collecting .10% in a saving account at a credit union . I know I need to start making my money work for me . I love the interface and the ETF options with Betterment . They both have Tax-Loss Harvesting . Do you feel that the Tax-Optimized Direct indexing with Wealthfront is enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know its just your opinon . ) Awesome blog . Thanks <p> Hi Garret , I am a fan of the additional tax loss harvesting features provided by Wealthfront . Wealthfronts direct indexing becomes more valuable as your taxable portfolio increases , because any losses harvested can offset unlimited gains in the same year ( but only $3k of ordinary income each year ) . Losses that are n't  utilized in the current year can be carried forward . <p> Two questions : 1 . Can I ask my money be moved to cash if I anticipate a long term draw down in the market and/or can I invest in reverse ETFs with Wealthfront ? 2 . I heard of one site that will manage your funds in your existing accounts but I cant seem to remember the name . Are you familiar with that ? <p> Carol , Thats what money managing firms do , keep you from getting emotional and taking money out in a bad market . For instance if you doubled down in 2009 instead of selling you make a killing . How could you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market ? If you could do that you would n't need an advisor . Mike <p> Hi , I am 15 years old and have made $1200 working my summer job and am nervous to put this money in a traditional bank due to all the fees . I would like to invest half of it and feel I can contribute $500-$700 per year while in high school . Would this be a good option for me within account this small ? <p> Mike , so impressed that you are reading and already saving at age 15 . You are way ahead of where I was at that age ! With regards to Wealthfront , it would be a great option . Signing up through our blog means your first $15k is managed completely free of charge . <p> random internet browser here checking into to say WAY TO GO MIKE for thinking about your future at such a young age . you probably represent .001% of people your age who even consider such things , much less take the initiative to actually invest . use this for motivation to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history speaks for the future , you 'll have 7-figure investments by age 45 if you maintain your current mindset. obviously there 's a lot that could happen between now and then , however ! = <p> Hi Jacob ! Thanks for the great info . I have 200K from a divorce settlement . I turned the money over to a Raymond James advisor . The fees seem to be high and I rarely hear from my advisor . I do n't  want to touch the money until retirementIm 46 now . Is Wealthfront account a better choice for this money ? <p> I have a question that reiterates one earlier about liquidity you mentioned wealthfront and betterment are the same regarding " getting out " , but could you provide more details about the costs and tax implications of getting your money back out ? I have two envisioned scenarios one , I simply decide I 'd like to use the money ( say , purchase a car , etc ) , and two its retirement time and I 'd like to start drawing from those funds to cover my living expenses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to get my money when I wish to use it . Thank you ! <p> If you have tax sheltered accounts ( 401k , IRA , etc. ) in any investment firm , you cant withdraw the money until retirement age without paying penalties and taxes . Those are the rules outlined by the IRS . So your only other remaining option is to rollover the money into another firm and invest there . That 's all done by ACH or wire transfer , for free . If you have a taxable account , you can withdraw the money straight to your bank account any time . That means you would be selling your investments and liquidating to cash . Any investment gains would be realized at the time of liquidation and you would pay taxes according to holding period . Long term , or short term , depending on how long you had investing the money . There is nothing unique about the way this is all handled . Money is transferred in from a bank or another financial account , and transferred out the same way . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this review , Jacob . Direct Investing is an interesting concept , but looking at the data Wealthfront presents , Im noticed a few things and wonder what you think about them : -If they 're using individual stocks and not the VTI ETF , then presumably that means you 're also saving the 0.05% Expense Ratio that VTI charges . If this is true , I 'm kind of surprised that Wealthfront does n't  advertise this benefit , given their emphasis on low fees . Also , does the chart where they list the mean performance account for this reduced fee ? ( Presumably it does , if they 're displaying VTIs returns net of expenses ) . -Its interesting that while WF500 and WF1000 beat the VTI on with their mean returns , its not consistently beating it every year . In fact , 4 out of 15 years , the VTI beat the direct investing . It looks as if direct investing not only gives you better mean returns , but also less volatility. -Not surprisingly , WF1000 beats on WF500 . This makes it curious that they did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how WF100 compares to the VTI . <p> Hey Jason , thanks for stopping by . 1 ) Great point , and I do n't  know how an investment would be divided among individual securities and the remaining ETFs. 2 ) I agree . I would like to see results charted . But WF100 will track VTI and the other direct indexing options very closely for the reasons stated above . The WF100 directly purchases the 100 largest companies in the SS&amp;P500 , and fills in the remaining holes with ETFs to achieve an overall balance equivalent to VTI . WF500 does the same thing , except basically buys the whole S&amp;P 500 , and adds small/mid cap ETFs to mimic VTI . <p> I 'm 70 , retired , and have about $250K in a managed account with a major bank costing maybe 1.5% a year in fees . However I seldom hear from my account manager and am pretty much a passive investor . Trying to figure out if a service like Wealthfront or Betterment might be just as good a bet for me , since I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any ideas ? Thanks ! <p> Hi Ken , If you understand the importance of passive investing and low fees , it would be a great move for you . The difference in account value from paying 0.15% instead of 1.5% is enormous over a lifetime . And according to academic research and empirical data , the guy at the bank likely is n't adding any value to your portfolio , just siphoning off profits that should be yours . <p> Thanks for the thorough post . Definitely a lot of great information that helps me decide if I really want to go with Wealthfront . Can you help me with some questions though ? <p> 1 . Does my portfolio allocation automatically get rebalanced as I get older ( similar to a target date fund ) ? 2 . How often can someone change their risk tolerance and thus change their asset allocation ? <p> Jacob , great questions . I actually wanted clarification and asked a Wealthfront executive your questions . I received the following answers : 1 ) Your allocation wont automatically change as you get closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumes that other pieces of your financial profile havent changed over that time . Instead , we prompt our clients to re-take our risk assessment once a year , so we can incorporate all available information . As the client ages , their risk score will naturally fall ( all else being equal ) , but if their income changes or they answer other questions differently , that will also affect how their allocation changes . 2 ) We allow to clients to change their risk scores a maximum of once every 30 days . However , we discourage clients from doing this too often because its often used as a way to time the market , which we do not recommend . <p> Ive been considering Wealthfront for my Roth IRA this year , and I really like their investment philosophy . Thanks for the thorough review and the additional $5,000 offer . I think you 're review has made this decision easy . = -Thomas 
@@44824066 @4824066/ <h> Motif Investing Review 2017 <p> A Motif trading account allows you to trade individual securities , participate in select IPOs , build customized 30-stock portfolios ( called a motif ) , or choose from a catalog of professional and community-built motifs . <p> A Motif impact portfolio is a fully-automated investment portfolio aligned with your personal values . Its similar to the managed portfolios offered by other robo-advisors , with a few key differences that I highlight later in this review . <p> This unique strategy landed Motif Investing in the fourth position on CNBC 's recent " Disruptor 50 " list , which includes the 50 most innovative firms in finance . <h> Motif Trading Account <p> The Motif trading account allows you to trade any publicly listed stock or ETF for $4.95. - Although this is the same service provided by all discount brokers , Motif offers competitive pricing and fractional shares . <p> Fractional shares allow you to trade securities using dollar amounts rather than shares . For example , if you have $500 to invest in any stock , Motif Investing will allow you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share price . The vast majority of other brokerage services require that you trade using whole shares . If you do n't  have enough money to purchase the exact number of shares that you want , your money will not be invested . <p> All brokerage-related services provided by Motif Investing ( listed below ) allow you to invest using fractional shares . <p> Trade IPOs <p> Motif Investing is the first discount broker to provide full access to initial public offerings . Here are the steps required to participate : <p> Place a conditional order . The minimum investment is $250 and the maximum varies by IPO . <p> There are no commissions or fees for IPO purchases . To sell your IPO shares , you pay the standard $4.95 fee . Motif- Investing is the first discount broker to offer IPO investments directly to retail investors . <p> Create , modify , and trade Motifs <p> In addition to individual securities and IPOs , you can trade motifs for a flat $9.95 . You can create your own motif using any combination of 30 stocks and ETFs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Investing team or community motifs designed by other investors . <p> There are thousands of different motifs available now . You can browse by name , theme , investment performance , popularity , dividend yield , and more . <p> Every motif is fully customizable . You can start from scratch using your ideal combination of 30 stocks and ETFs , or you can customize a professional or community designed motif . You can replace any of the pre-selected individual securities or change the weighting if you want to own more or less of an individual company . <p> Horizon Motifs are free to trade <p> Motif Investing recently introduced commission-free Horizon Motifs . All Horizon Motifs are free to trade and free to rebalance if you keep the preset asset allocation. - If you change the rebalancing parameters or preset asset allocation , you will pay the standard $9.95 motif commission . <p> For example , here is the asset allocation and investments offered in the most aggressive , long-term horizon motif : <p> These asset classes are actually very good for the average investor . They are utilizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robo-advisors . You wo n't receive any additional features , but these are completely free to trade . <p> Motif royalty program <p> One of the factors that distinguishes Motif Investing from other brokerages is the community . Thousands of investors participate by creating and sharing Motifs . <p> Even better , you can get paid to share your personal motif through the Motif Creator Royalty Program : <p> Track your royalty earnings through an easy-to-use and dynamic dashboard . <h> Motif Impact Portfolios <p> In addition to all of the brokerage services discussed above , Motif offers automated Impact Portfolios- for $9.95/month . The minimum required investment is $1,000 . <p> These fully managed portfolios are value-oriented . The underlying investments differ according to your chosen values , such as planet sustainability , fair labor , and corporate behavior. - The asset allocation of each Impact Portfolio is determined by your risk tolerance and time horizon . <p> The stock , real estate , and commodities portion of your Impact Portfolio is determined by the corresponding value-based MSCI stock index , a leading provider of research-based indices and analytics with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different MSCI index corresponding to sustainability , fair labor , corporate behavior , etc . <p> Instead of investing in the entire MSCI index , Motif opts for direct stock ownership in the largest companies within each index . The disadvantage of this approach is less diversification in your Impact Portfolio . The benefit is that direct stock ownership avoids all expenses and fees . <p> The bond portion of your Impact Portfolio is comprised of diversified ETFs . These are the standard index ETFs used by all robo-advisors , offering massive diversification and low fees . <p> To illustrate , here is the recommended asset allocation in the " fair labor " Motif Impact Portfolio . <p> You can select the each category to view the investment recommendations . For example , the U.S. stocks category includes the following investments : <h> Motif Investing Fees <p> Action <p> Fee <p> Details <p> Trade Stock or ETF <p> $4.95 <p> No minimum investment <p> Trade/Rebalance a Motif <p> $9.95 <p> $300 minimum investment <p> Purchase IPOs <p> $0 <p> $250 minimum investment <p> Sell IPOs <p> $4.95 <p> N/A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Platform Inactivity Fee <p> $10 <p> See details below <p> IRA Account Termination <p> $95 <p> Full IRA account closure <p> Its worth noting that you can trade individual securities within your motif . You will pay the standard $4.95 commission per sale or exchange , which means two individual trades will cost as much as exchanging your entire motif . <p> The inactivity fee only applies if you- meet all of the following conditions : <p> Have less than $10,000 in combined securities and cash in the account but more than $0 <p> Have not placed a commission trade in the account within the last 6 months <p> Are not active Motif Blue subscribers or Impact account holders <h> Motif Investing Drawbacks <p> Dividend Reinvestment- If a stock in your motif pays a stock dividend ( unlikely ) , the additional stock shares are automatically reinvested in your motif . If the dividend is in cash ( likely ) , the money will be credited to your account balance . Motif does not offer cash dividend reinvestment at this time . <p> Fees I 'm not a big fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these fees are fairly standard at discount brokers . <h> Is Motif Investing Right for You ? <p> I cant recommend the automated Motif Impact Portfolios . <p> First , the investment portfolio offers little improvement over existing portfolios provided by Wealthfront and Betterment . The Impact Portfolio includes direct stock ownership , which is slightly less expensive than ETFs , but far less diversified . More importantly , motif impact portfolios provide none of the advanced tax and financial planning features offered by competitors . <p> The value-based investing approach is the only other distinguishing feature. - If you are interested , you can recreate each of the Impact Portfolios without paying any monthly fee . First create a- free Motif brokerage account , then navigate to the Impact Portfolio of interest and review the portfolio recommendations ( as I demonstrated earlier in this review ) for free . You can use that information to create your own motif for $9.95 . <p> Beyond the portfolio , there are pricing concerns . Motif charges $9.95/month per $100,000 invested . There are no pro-rated charges . If you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $100,000 breakpoint , you will pay an additional $9.95/month . <p> Using hypothetical account values , here is how that fee compares to competitors : <p> Depending on your Impact Portfolio account balance , you could pay more or less than 0.25% annually in fees . When compared to the competition , the fee is not justified . There are n't  enough valuable features to recommend Motif Impact Portfolios over Wealthfront or Betterment . <p> With that said , the brokerage component of Motif Investing is superb . If you purchase a motif for $9.95 , you are paying roughly $0.33 per security ( $9.95/30 ) . Even the $4.95 individual trades match the lowest pricing offered by other discount brokers . <p> Throw in free direct IPO access , and you are looking at the best value among all brokers . <p> Motif Investing Review 2017 <p> Summary <p> If you are looking to trade stocks or ETFs , Motif Investing offers far better pricing than other discount brokers . If you are looking for an automated investment solution , the Motif Impact Portfolios fall short of the competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Nice review . A few questions if I may . I just purchased a professional Motif portfolio , the Ultimate Buy and Hold 50% Equity 50% Bond as designed by Paul Merriman the noted and now retired financial advisor . The asset allocation is well designed and my question is will that asset allocation be fixed as it if or do I have to rebalance it myself ? I would very much like to keep the asset allocation without having to adjust it . If I need to rebalance it how do I do that and is that a charge for this . Furthermore , if I want to periodically wish to add to this exact portfolio , is that a $9.95 charge each time I do this ? Thank you ! <p> Hi JR , You would have to manually rebalance . The cost is $4.95 to trade any one security , or $9.95 to redesign the entire Motif . The other option would be to split the portfolio and design one Motif for your stock allocation and a separate Motif for the bond allocation . <p> J.- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of . I want to add a lump sum to the 23 stock Motif I created . 1. ) can I add the total amount to just 6 of these stocks and what would that cost ( Motif charge fee ) ? 2 . ) If I add it equally to all 23 stocks , what would that cost ? 3 . ) I know to buy 1 stock is 4.95 . If I wanted to add 4 stocks is it 4 X 4.95 or 9.95 for all 4 ? <p> Thanks for the write up and the additional info in the comments . But i got ta ask , have you or anyone else made any money off Motif ? If so , care to share percentages over time range ? I 'd be interested if anyone made money off of the sites mentioned high performing Motifs . <p> Jacob-New to investingNot quite clear on receiving dividends . I do understand if it is a stock dividend it is added to that individual stock . I also understand if it is a cash dividend you have to reinvest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is are there tax implications as to these cash dividends received if 1 ) I reinvest them in a Motif or 2 ) Leave them in the cash account ? Are there capitol gains on dividends and is this true in any type of brokerage account , not just Motif ? <p> Hey Clay , 1 ) Dividends are always taxable in the year received , regardless if reinvested or taken as cash . 2 ) Taxation of dividends can get complicated . It depends if the dividend is qualified or not . If qualified , its taxed the same as long term capital gains , which are beneficial to most investors . If non-qualified , they are taxed as ordinary income . Both of the above points are true for any brokerage/financial firm/wealth management firm . Hope this helps . <p> You can sell just the one or more for $4.95 per stock , or you can sell the whole Motif ( or parts of it ) and replace it with new stocks for $9.95 . You can also change the weights of each stock in the Motif for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new investor and motif fan , I am learning so much about designing my own motifs , etc . My question is how profitable it is for me to own say 3.5 percent of Apple within a motif . Or if I have a motif with mostly etfs or mutual funds , how does it profit with an allocation so small within the motif ? Even if it were a motif of just 5 etfs , that 's a $50 investment each in a large index of stocks . Also am I better off as a small investor with $3,000 or so to invest to put all the money into just one , two or three motifs , or 12 different ones ? Thank you for any help you can provide . <p> Just largely a matter of preference . Diversification always dilutes the percentage owned of each individual firm , but that 's not a bad thing . Most assets returns are due to overall market movements , not individual stock selection . <p> Jacob , good review , thanks . My question is about buying and rebalancing a motif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 stocks and buy it . In Feb I decide that I do n't  want to invest in 10 of those stocks I chose in Jan going forward so I delete them from the motif . In Feb , do I have the option of buying this changed motif and NOT rebalancing ? Rebalancing would involve selling the 10 stocks I no longer want . What I want is to buy the motif in Feb without the 10 stocks I deleted , but keep the stocks I bought in Jan without selling any . <p> Great review . Thanks ! one item I thought needed clarification . The Disruptor 50 is companies whose innovations are revolutionizing the business landscape , not just the investing landscape . Motif is #4 on that list , but the top company innovating in the investing space . Except for not reinvesting dividends at this time , Motif is completely awesome . I want to move everything there , but am a little concerned about their sustainability at those prices . Hopefully they have other revenue sources and are n't  supposed to be funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob . Most of my portfolio is just simple index funds , and I have no plans of changing that . However , I 'd love to invest in a few stocks of my own choosing , but I 've never gotten around to it simply because it feels too complicated . A tool like this looks right up my alley . Thanks for pointing it out . <p> Even though this service does n't  fit the kind of passive investing we do , I 'm all for any service that lowers costs for consumers . Buying 30 different stocks for $10 is preposterously cheap . If you had a lot of money you wanted to move into the market at once as an active investor , this is a great option .

I have a caffeine addiction and am currently tracking my spending to see how much I am really spending , so hopefully that will be motivation to quit ! <p> " The house always wins ! Of course you might hit that streak ( that you mistake for skill ) and win big , but it 's a short term fix . Statistically , you 'll give it all back to the house . The casino , or dog track , or lottery is stacked against you . Why do you think so many governments run lotteries ? You guessed it , because they make a fortune on people who gamble . " <p> The way you worded this makes it seem like you think most people think the casino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people know that they are going to lose over time , but are willing to pay to be entertained ( just like most people pay to be entertained by movies , video games , etc . ) . <p> An advisor I worked with was the most popular guy at his high-end bar hangout . I asked his assistant how he went out so often.she said he was an alcoholic now and loved the attention.it was addicting . <p> Worse , was when she tallied his expenses . In 2010 he spent over $80,000 at this bar . No wonder he was so popular there ! He spent more there per year than most people earn ! <p> Very nice breakdown . Its amazing how much a seemingly " little " habit can end up costing . I have a few habits that cost money , but I know about them and limit them . Plus , they fit into our budget which fits into our long term financial goals . <p> I will confess that we are wine aficionados ! We stock up when were in wine country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope this does n't  make me sound like a lush , because I swear I 'm not ! = ) I find when people go on shopping sprees because they are blue , or bored or anger whatever the emotion it may be is because they assume what they buy will either cheer them up or have earned it after being passed over for a promotion , a bad break-up , etc . <p> I drink one beer most nights of the week while watching the sunset . I enjoy it and the beer costs about $0.5 , so a $15 per month habit is not too bad as I do n't  have desert most meals I think it makes up for sweets . All in moderation . <p> I would argue the house does n't  always win when you add skill into many games . Blackjack has one of the lowest house edges in the entire casino and is considered a very winnable game . If you find a single deck table ( pretty common ) and know what the dealer has to do on soft 17 , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win really big . There is a reason that there are professional blackjack players . <p> Poker is also a winnable game and carries no house advantage because it is really a zero-sum game minus the house rake . Again a skilled player can easily win lots of money and make a living doing this . In fact I have a couple of friends who were professional poker players . They stopped because the " grind " was too much and the US really cracked down on online player which is where they really made their money . <p> In both cases , it takes a very skilled individual to do this and basically perfect play most of the time , which most of us are not able to do <p> The casino offers blackjack because they come out ahead . Its simple math . If counting were easy , the casino would be broke . There are not many , if any , professional blackjack players . Casinos understand the deck limitations and have fixed most loose ends . <p> Sure , poker is your best bet in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . Its a game of skill , as you mention , which takes enormous practice . ( *Disclaimer* I used to play hold em online and in person for a decent amount of money . ) <p> Jacob ! ! ! Well done . The cost alone is simply not enough to scare people away form harmful addictions although it ought to be . Neuroscience and evolutionary psychology have dug deep into the whys , but I am afraid most people are simply not aware of what or who they are . That info combined with the cost and the obvious health issues may do the trick ? Du n no , but super cool post , man . <p> Its crazy to see those numbers of what they would amount to over the long term . We do n't  smoke but do drink from time to time and try to be balanced with it for various reasons one of them being because of the cost . We actually have a family member who budgets religiously to a fault . The one thing they refuse to cut costs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change on each month craziness . <p> Addictions are costly , no doubt . And you did n't  even factor in the medical costs associated with addictions like smoking and alcoholism . Or all the lawyer fees that pile up when alcoholism and gambling addiction break up families . Or all the interest and fees charged when funding your shopping addiction with credit cards . <p> And those are only the monetary costs . . . the least of the total price we pay . <p> Justin , do you know of any coupon or discount sites to order nicotine patches , inhalers , or vapour cigarettes ? I am finding so many of my friends are looking to kick the habit but quitting cold turkey can be extremely difficult . I feel with some products such as the patch to assist them , it can be a much more attainable goal . The problem is they are extremely pricey . Would love to hear form anyone if you have advice on coupons or discount sites for smoking aids . <p> I knew that vices were expensivebut wow $104kthats a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NYC , there are sometimes programs where they give out nicotine patches and nicotine gum for free .

@@44824068 @4824068/ <h> Our Minimalist Lifestyle : Thriving on $1,000/month <p> During- our engagement , Vanessa and I began evaluating- our spending habits and estimating- how much money we would spend in marriage . After much discussion , we set a goal to spend less than $12,000 in our first- year of marriage ( roughly $1,000/month ) , something we called a minimalist lifestyle . <p> Perspective We wanted to appreciate- what we already had- ( instead of what we did n't  have ) . <p> Discipline We wanted to learn the art of self-discipline ( including how to say " no " under pressure ) . <p> The first- year has now passed ( are we still newlyweds ? ) , and its time to share our results . We initially hesitated to post everything online , but decided that our experience might encourage other couples to embrace a minimalist lifestyle . <p> Before moving into our mobile home , we rented an apartment with a roommate for $330 ( including all utilities ) . <p> Mortgage Payments <p> $0 <p> $0 <p> We own our mobile home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new showerhead/faucets , a small space heater , and window A/C unit . <p> Land Lease <p> $208 <p> $2,080 <p> We own our mobile home , but lease the land . Following our apartment rental in April and May , we paid 10 months of rent and utilities for the mobile home . <p> Insurance <p> $0 <p> $0 <p> We are self insured , which means that we could withstand the loss of our mobile home . <p> Taxes <p> N/A <p> $51 <p> In Texas , personal property taxes are paid by whoever owns the property on January 1st . Because we purchased in May , we did n't owe taxes in the first year , but I 've included the annual amount anyway . ( Yes , the property taxes were $51 for the entire year . ) <p> Electricity <p> $33 <p> $330 <p> See the discussion below this table . <p> Natural Gas <p> $9 <p> $90 <p> The furnace , stove , and water heater use natural gas . <p> Trash Service <p> $10 <p> $100 <p> Water/Sewage <p> $29 <p> $290 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation <p> $919 <p> Public Transportation <p> $0 <p> $0 <p> Jacob 's employer pays for unlimited bus usage . <p> Taxes/Registration <p> N/A <p> $34 <p> Our 1996 Saturn is worth about $1,500 , but the local county tax office assessed the value at $100 and the actual tax liability was less than $9 for the year . Annual registration was roughly $25 . <p> Auto Insurance <p> $26 <p> $312 <p> Basic liability only . <p> Maintenance <p> N/A <p> $93 <p> Two oil changes and brake pads . <p> Gasoline <p> $40 <p> $480 <p> The commute to work is less than 5 miles each way , and the Saturn averaged roughly 35 MPG . <p> Total Living Expenses <p> $6,823 <p> Healthcare Expenses <p> $105 <p> $1,260 <p> Obamacare allows us to stay on our parents insurance until age 26 . See the discussion below this table . <p> Dental Expenses <p> N/A <p> $40 <p> This includes the co-payment for one filling . Dental insurance was provided by Jacob 's employer . <p> Entertainment <p> N/A <p> $236 <p> This includes local entertainment only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . <p> Personal Care <p> N/A <p> $84 <p> This includes all cleaning and care products : paper towels , toilet paper , toothpaste , floss , soap , etc . We already owned some of the necessities , and purchased the remaining items at the Dollar Tree . <h> How is that Possible ? <p> If I had to attribute our- success to one thing , it would be intentional spending decisions . By monitoring , analyzing , and discussing our spending habits , we were able to reduce spending in almost every major- expense category . You can read about our specific methods in the discussion below . <p> Housing <p> Our first two months of marriage ( April and May ) were spent in an apartment . In the- last week of May , we purchased a 1980s model ( 2 bed , 2 bath ) mobile home for $11,500 cash , which is less than most people spend on a car . Ironically , we paid for the mobile home by selling Vanessas Toyota Camry ( she owned it before we got married ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense is $208/month in land rent . For comparison , a small apartment runs about $650/month in our location . 2 BR apartments run between $800-$900/month . Let 's just split the difference and say that an apartment is approximately $500/month more expensive than our mobile home . That means our mobile home will pay for itself in less than two years . <p> Utilities <p> Managing the utility bill is pretty straightforward , even in a poorly insulated mobile home . We limit water usage with low-flow showerheads- and aerators , We limit the electric/gas bill by running the central heat and air as little as possible , turning the water heater down to a reasonable setting , and using the natural climate to our advantage . <p> In the spring and fall , we almost never run the heat or A/C . We plug in two large fans and allow the natural airflow to heat and cool the house ( depending on the time of day ) . In the summer and winter , we focus on controlling the temperature in a single- room ( the room we occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single space heater ( winter ) . By acclimating to our homes natural temperature fluctuations , we- are able to keep the monthly utility- bill to a minimum . <p> The Saturn has been an excellent car for almost three- years . Its inexpensive ( cheap insurance and taxes ) , reliable ( very little ongoing maintenance ) , and gets great gas mileage ( 40+ MPG when hypermiling ) . - If we need an additional transportation option , - my employer pays for unlimited rides on the local bus route . <p> Travel <p> The easiest way to minimize travel expenses is through credit card rewards . Using the rewards earned from credit cards , we were able to take several short vacations with family . All of- the hotel stays were 100% covered by reward points , leaving gasoline and food as our only expenses . <p> Insurance <p> Obamacare allows us to remain insured through our parents ( until age 26 ) . Vanessa was covered at no additional cost , because her fathers existing plan includes the entire family . My coverage required an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no other medical expenses . <p> Food Expenses- <p> We shop the weekly grocery ads , and then meal plan around the discounted meat and vegetables ( see how to save money on groceries ) . Buying real food is important to us because research has shown that diet largely determines overall health and longevity . <p> For the most part , we cook our meals at home . When eating- at restaurants , we always attempt to find a 50% discount through- Groupon , Restaurant.com , coupon apps , etc . <p> Shopping- <p> We established a very simple shopping strategy purchase nothing unless ( 1 ) its necessary , and ( 2 ) the price is right . Using this approach , we were able to keep our total shopping and gift expenses around- $1,000 for the year . <p> Our approach highlights- the importance of planning ahead . By consciously evaluating our existing possessions , we were able to distinguish between- wants and needs . Between our wedding registry and existing possessions , Vanessa and I needed very few items after getting married . When shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase , we waited for a bargain before pulling the trigger . <p> Entertainment <p> The best part about working full-time while completing a PhD is that I 'm always busy . There is always- another book to read or paper to write . Vanessa is in the same boat , because she is a motivated self-learner . Our dedication to learning results in less time for leisure- and fewer opportunities to spend money . <p> In addition , we have changed our philosophy on entertainment . Instead of eating out or having drinks at the bar , we invite other couples over to our house for dinner . Instead of paying full price for bowling , we play disc golf at the beautiful local park for free . Instead of paying for cable TV , we stream entertainment through the internet for free . By changing our mindset , we enjoy great- entertainment at a much lower cost . <h> Why did we Choose a Minimalist Lifestyle ? <p> We could have spent a lot more money without getting into financial trouble , - but we purposefully chose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there were situations that required extreme discipline . But Vanessa and I can both confidently say that we would n't change a single thing . Through the year-long experiment in minimalist living , - we emerged wealthier and wiser . <p> We made huge financial progress . In one year , we paid off all of our debt ( roughly $25,000 ) , purchased a mobile home with cash , and were still able to save and invest a considerable amount of money . We achieved all of these things- on a limited income ( less than $50,000 combined ) . <p> More than that , we created a strong financial foundation on which to build . With no debt and minimal monthly expenses , we can now save a- large percentage of our income- and focus on achieving- financial freedom . <p> Most importantly , we learned a ridiculous amount about the relationship between money and life satisfaction . <p> The American culture is overwhelmingly focused on consumerism as a source of happiness . Every advertisement is meant to persuade you into buying more material possessions , newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure to work , consume , waste , and repeat . The worst part its impossible to find freedom in this never-ending cycle of consumption . <p> Our experience was entirely counter-cultural . We learned that material possessions are not a primary source of happiness. - We learned that a simple life can lead to- more free time , fewer money arguments , and less overall stress. - Its a paradoxical concept really . The less money we spent , the less we coveted material possessions , and the more we learned to appreciate what we already had . <p> In our first year of marriage , we figured out that its possible to live a privileged life on $1,000/month. - What a valuable learning experience it was . <p> *2017 update Many readers have asked for an update , so I will be creating a brand new post that summarizes our 2017 minimalist lifestyle . You can expect that to be published in early 2018. 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Great job guys ! I also try to follow some of your frugal methods specially on " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iPHONE/iPAD/iMAC etc. since they are way over-priced for the value they provide . It is not always the price but what value they provide compared to alternatives .. <p> Yea we had a singlewide mobile home before we purchased our house . It was paid for but we decided to bite the bullet and get a house because mobile homes usually depreciate in value . I plan on buying a double wide again in a few years and plan on paying cash or put a big down payment down . My goal is to be mortgage free again . <p> When I saw your annual expenditures , I thought .. " Well , they must be excluding their housing . " But NO ! <p> Smart , smart to pay cash for your home . <p> I have a friend who actually makes seven figures in real estate , and he told me something a long time ago . <p> " Only finance appreciating items ; never depreciating . " So if you have $3000. for a car , you buy a $3k car .. You do n't  put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to finance property where tenants paid his mortgage but he that 's about it . <p> You two have blown his words of wisdom right out of the water . = <p> I have a question .. and forgive me if you 're written this somewhere .. but are you planning on being frugal indefinitely ? Or is this for the first few years of marriage to get yourselves financially situated the way you 'd like ? <p> People poo-poo mobile homes but do n't  realize how great at cost saving they can truly be . Also , we have low utility bills in our apartment because with things like a/c , since we only have window units , we only cool the room were in to a bareable level ( still sweating in shorts ) during the day and only crank it down to 72 to sleep . Sleeping is the one time of the day I need the a/c on as I 'm someone who gets extremely " exothermic " when I 'm in in a deep sleep and need a cool room to stay asleep . But otherwise , I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , I leave the house and head for a shady park ( or air conditioned friends house , lol ) ! <p> So , I have a question , and please do n't  hate me for asking this . I am not trying to criticize , I am just curious How are you able to stay on your parents insurance when you 're married . In every health insurance plan I have ever heard of you cant stay on you parents insurance after you 're married . <p> Great job ! Very inspiring . I am grateful to be on my parents health insurance as well . One less thing to worry about ( for now ) . Your housing costs are so low ; I would be fine looking into a mobile home , but my boyfriend is n't a fan . Now that we are paying for utilities , I 'm leaving the AC as a last resort . Luckily this apartment came with a nice ceiling fan in the living room , and we have a fan in the bedroom . <p> I remember the day when I got too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad day for me . <p> Interesting that you are charged an additional fee for trash removal . Up here it is included in our property taxes , so if you were a renter you never actually saw that cost ( yeah I know it would be rolled into the rental rate ) . <p> Wow ! Im impressed . You have really kept your expenses down in a lot of intelligent ways . I had a Saturn . It ran forever . It was very inexpensive to maintain . My only exception to your budget is this , there is always money for a dog !

About 30% of that time , or roughly 530 hours per year , are spent watching advertisements . Not only do you pay thousands for the cable service , youre- persuaded- to continue spending through excellent advertisements . <h> How to Get it for Free <p> You- can find any television program on the internet for free , which means- cable television can be completely replaced by a high-speed internet connection . <p> A few favorite streaming sites of mine are Series Cravings and TV Box . Neither charges any fees or requires you sign up for an account ( although you 'll need an ad blocker on your internet browser to combat the annoying pop-ups ) . Also- note that the sites have DMCA ( copyright ) compliance policies listed , which makes them seem legitimate . <p> For the most part , individuals in other countries host the files . Its a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  download any of the files , the general consensus is that you have not violated any internet/media agreement laws . <p> If you still cant find what you are looking for , you can simply type in what you want to watch in Google .

Jerry &amp; Jacki <p> I have been researching this for months and I 'm about ready to take the plunge and cut the satellite off and buy an antenna .

I am trying to get my dad to stop his cable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes his nascars live and is stubburn towards change . It certainly is challenging to find shows you like that are on cable and not so popular online . I love watching CW and ABC but I also like anime and online wise it is a bit of a juggle to find a show with all the episodes and not having to read subtitles . It is also hard to find any free episodes of nick jr . or disney jr . shows like paw patrol or sofia the first for my little one . Netflix is great but they do n't  have the selection on stream as they do for mail sadly and sometimes it takes months before they come out with an anime that is n't subbed or just action and gore based . Thanks for the site options you provide and maybe as streaming gets more fans there will be better options out there . I like multitasking and my little one requires it so having a few moments of t.v. does n't  hurt when your frequently on the go . <p> My favorite method : find someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their user name and password . <p> DH and I got rid of cable about two months ago because the only thing watch is our premium channel shows ( HBO and Showtime ) and could n't justify the cost anymore . Prior to that , we purchased a Roku with a gift card we received for Xmas and fell in love with it . It has Showtime and HBO apps in addition to YouTube , Netflix , and many others . We asked his parents if we could use their login in exchange for paying half or two thirds of their premium cable bill ( which would have been around $20/month for us ) . They insisted we do n't  pay and thought we were crazy for giving up cable in the first place . So now were enjoying access to our favorite cable shows at no charge . <p> Hello , this is all new to me . I do n't  even have a face book account yet .

Can you help me with that ? <p> I agree with most of your tips on saving money by watching TV for free . We also use XBMC ourselves and we find that the news is better on XBMC by adding video add-ons such as FOX and CBS . Also another great thing about XBMC is that we have our home windows server connected to it so that we can access all movies , music and pictures from a centralized location to anywhere in the house . We have tried this antenna you mentioned before but we get poor reception out here sometimes and it is great other times , must be an antenna placement issue . <p> Hey guys ! Thanks for stopping in and adding your methods . Antenna reception can be spotty depending on location . We 've even seen some issues depending on where we set it up in our house .

My brother let 's us share his account and he pays for it . <p> Some of the streaming sites that you mentioned , as well as some other really popular ones , are n't  available in Canada . We therefore do n't  watch the shows until they come out on Netflix . Were okay with this method though , as long as were not paying for cable . <p> I want to cancel my cable service so badly , but I just cant give up the access to live sports . As soon as I can find a way to watch sports without traditional cable service I 'll cut the cord immediately ! <p> My worry here is that your internet providers , often the same as those who can and want to provide the cable service , can throttle or limit what content they provide via streaming . With the repeal of the net neutrality laws , there is nothing preventing this from happening . It might get bad press , for sure , but honestly , since when do cable companies care about having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and recently added it to our bills . Ugh . I hate that we did it .

We pay about $37 per month for tv and internetlets say maybe $20 for television . <p> I can definitely see how this is a good place for folks to cut costs , especially if your baseline is higher . But we 've chosen to keep it ( mostly for ease and for not having to stream entertainment ) and to look for savings elsewhere . <p> Great tips , Jacob !

Ebay is a popular choice , as is Amazon . The thing that sets Craigslist apart is the fact that they charge you nothing ! No fees to buy or sell. - Craigslist is also easy and convenient to use , allowing you to search for items by location . <p> Craigslist is also easy and convenient to use , allowing you to search for items by location . After specifying your preferred city , Craigslist automatically shows all goods and services specific to that location . This makes it easy to buy and sell when you are ready . <h> Know Your Product <p> If you are shopping for ANYTHING online , then put in the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds easy , but its an important part of any- successful Craigslist deal . <p> Craigslist is a wildly inefficient- market , and many Craigslist users do n't  have a clue about the fair market value of items listed. - I 've sold used items for more than the going retail price . I 've purchased valuable items for next to nothing . Its a crazy market . <p> Subjective pricing- is the essence of Craigslist , so you need to know the value of your items before getting started . Understanding used market prices is what will allow you- to buy low , and sell high . <h> Learn How to- Negotiate <p> I 'll let you in on a little secret here always negotiate when making a purchase on Craigslist , and always stay firm when making a sale . <p> When you go to make a purchase , never give the seller full asking price . Offer a lower price and negotiate using these tips : <p> Cash talks- Always be able to offer cash when negotiating a purchase . Many sellers want to get rid of their item and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you email a seller about an item that is overpriced , and they refuse to negotiate , just give it a few days before trying again . This gives you more- negotiating- power and allows you to mention the items inability to sell at the initial price point . The exception to this rule is if the item is already at a rock bottom price . <p> Be friendly- A lot of sellers will accept a lowball offer if you are friendly during the initial contact . <p> When making a sale , always stick to your listed price for a few days before entertaining lower offers . Unless you are desperate for the money , patience will usually lead to more profit . <p> If you learn to set aside your feelings while negotiating , you will greatly improve your profit margin . The worst thing that can possibly happen is rejection . If the other party wont accept your deal , who cares ? There are thousands of other Craigslist users waiting in the shadows . <h> Restore and Sell <p> Restorations- are one of the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> Look for furniture , appliances , or anything else that needs to be restored . I 'd recommend checking out garage sales , flea markets , and Craigslist to find deals . <p> Dirty items are the easiest to restore , but if you know how to make minor repairs you will have more opportunities . <p> Use your skills to fix the item , then list it on Craigslist for more than you paid . <p> We recently reconditioned a solid wood table . It was ugly and mismatched with blue paint and scuffed legs . We bought the table for $12 at a garage sale . After sanding and repainting it , we made about $100 this week on Craigslist . Here is the finished product : <h> Flipping on Craigslist <p> I 've made thousands of dollars by purchasing goods at a discount , then turning around and reselling them for a higher price . This works for almost any category of item , but you have to know the value of whatever you want to flip . If you 're an expert in train sets , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars . But if you know a lot about cars , do n't  start buying train sets . <p> My areas of expertise include electronics and motor vehicles. - I 've bought and sold dozens of video game consoles , computers , and computer peripherals. - I paid for part of my undergraduate degree by flipping cars and motorcycles . <p> It pays to shop around . I 've bought sale items on Amazon and immediately listed them on Craigslist for a 100% profit . Always keep your eyes peeled for deals . <p> If you have room to store inventory , look for off-season purchases . Air- conditioners , heaters , motorcycles , hunting goods and sporting goods are examples of seasonal items . These items are in high demand part of the year and often sold at a discount during the off-season . <h> Selling Techniques <p> Make sure to implement a few simple tips when you go to sell your item on Craigslist . <p> Description When you list an item on Craigslist , make sure to write a positive and promotional description which addresses all of the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't  be misleading , but do n't  list every tiny flaw in the initial description . <p> Pictures Proper photographs are necessary to secure a sale . Make sure to take clear and inviting photos in a well-lit room , using several angles . <p> Its free to sign up and list your items on Craigslist , and you can get started by selling the junk that you no longer use . After you get a little experience , move into flipping or another money making avenue . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> I have sold items in the past on CL . I learned that allowing people to contact you only by phone is better so as you now have them on caller I 'd . If they do n't  show up you simply give them a call and ask what happened , you waited for them , maybe they got tied up with something else and lost track . <p> Some great information here . I 've sold quite a few things on Craigslist and Ebay over the past few years . I had some car parts from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly on Ebay . I sold a few cars and motorcycles that I owned on Craigslist and Ebay . To be honest though most of the vehicles I 've lost money on probably because I overpaid to begin with or invested to much in fixing them up . I really would like to flip cars on Craigslist though and make at least $500. -$1,000 per car would be nice , no need to be greedy . I really should look into buying cars at auctions , but I do n't  much about how that works . I lost my job a few weeks ago after working for that company 26 years . I kind of like being off and the idea of working for myself , so hopefully Ill figure something out . If I can find a job that pays half way decent , I was planning on only working for another 3 years until medicare would kick in . Thank God my house is paid off ! <p> Awesome info Jacob ! I have been using Craigslist for years to sell stuff and am finally making the jump to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services as well I clean rental properties and he is in the rock masonry business we get pretty regular calls on side jobs its great ! ? <p> This is awesome , I have read a whole whole lot of blogs in my day but I do n't  really remember ever responding to this one . But this is so awesome and comes at the greatest time in my life . I just recently went through a divorce from someone who was bi-polar , schizo , and just plain mentally unstable and wrecked me financially . I have recently moved and am 30 years old living in my parents house . ( not cool at all ) I am now stuck paying child support ( on a kid who we now all think is n't even biologically mine ) . Anyway I have been racking my brain for the best possible idea for a way to make cash ( under the radar ) so to speak so it wont risk raising my monthly child support payments . Also the city I am living in just does n't  have a lot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day a friend told me a story about a guy who supposedly started off trading a paperclip on CL and the end result of this trading -up on CL was he ended up turning his paper-clip ( and not without a lot of hard work and diligence i 'm sure ) into a house ! that grabbed my attention for sure ! Then my dad starts mentioning all sorts of items around his house that he does n't  want and does n't  have the time to get rid of and offered if I sold them I could just keep the $ , just for taking them off his hands . I have been praying about my situation for a while now and can say this is n't the first sign or answered prayer I 've received but I think I 'm definitely going to give it a good running try , because like I said this information coupled with all else I believe is the big man upstairs turning my face towards a road and telling me to take the first step , nothing is free but I think God putting it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , haha " Soooo here we go ! ! <p> Hello , I have many various items to sell . I am downsizing and my mother passed . I have furniture ( big and small ) paintings , household items , dinnerwarein perfect condition . I travel a lot for work . Is there a seller to sell for me ? Thank you , Meryl <p> Great post and topic . I just launched a website that will scan the products on craigslist and compare the prices of the items with amazon and ebay and display the potential profit . I was wondering if you might consider doing a product review on it . The website is http : //www.arbitrage.pro <p> I like the idea of flipping on Craiglist and eBay and love the articles Jacob , but I 'm curious how you 'd find sale items on Amazon then immediately flip them on Craigslist . It would take time for Amazon to ship the item and by then there 's the obvious flake factor . <p> Simple , Do not advertise the item until you have received it and examined it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so anxious . Take your time it will assure that you have not made mistakes through the flip . <p> I have been a flipper ( the good kind , lol ) almost all my life . I started when I was 13 and cant stop even today . <p> Those who are complaining about not being able to find stuff to Flip I just want to tell them that they are not serious if that is the case . You can always look for stuff worth flipping on CL or you could go to your nearest goodwill with a scanner app and if you are not very unlucky you will find something worth flipping . <p> Get out there and make money . Being lazy does not help . Excuses do not help either . That 's what I teach my grand children and I am sure some of them will take over my empire . <p> Do n't  forget money to be made on free items given away on CL . I have an ad on CL to haul away metal scrap for free and have gotten used washers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were in good working condition and sold for profit . What is not re-sellable I take to the scrap yard and make good money on as well . Not as much as I used to because scrap prices are down right now , but its still all good because its free money . the people were happy just to have someone haul it away for free and it keeps it out of the landfill . I also buy and sell cars , canoes/kayaks , utility trailers , power tools , yard tools , mowers . Its not a full time gig because its too erratic finding flippable money makers but is a nice additional income . People are catching on to it as well and beat me to the moneymakers more and more now . <p> Jacob because of people like you I 've made it pretty far in the game . Started with surfboards to pay rent during college then moved up to motorcycles and cars . It has now led me to a career and a significant income . Thanks to people like yourself , good luck with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your website and I got ta tell you it is awesome . Just to let you know , I have been Buying and Selling Appliances for over 18 years now and love it . I am now semi retired so I have created a website to teach people about Flipping Appliances on a Shoestring Budget and craigslist is the best place to do it . Great news is , you do n't  need any money to get started . Would love to ad your site link on mine and vice-versa . Maybe even a guest post . Email me if interested . In the meantime check it out http : **25;63;TOOLONG . Thanks ! <p> Ive been selling furniture on CL for years . My tip for sellers offering hard to transport items , like furniture , is offer free " local " delivery . The leverage i create is i tell the buyer that if they pay full price , i will include delivery . Often times i will get full price plus a $ 50.00 delivery fee . Buyers are either lazy or do n't  own the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its easy for me to offer delivery . I sell brand new furniture so condition &amp; surprises are never an issue for the buyer . I have a lot of repeat customers from creating a small " service " edge on CL . <p> I started selling on Craigslist last year in the middle of a home remodel . I sold almost everything I ripped out of my house on Craigslistshelves , doors , appliances . To me it was amazing having people come and pay me to haul away my trash . Since then , I have sold an odd collection of thingsIm constantly trolling through my house to find more things to list . I 'm probably the person you guys like to buy from , because I do n't  really care how much money I get for most of what I list , I just want it out of my house . I have also sold extra things to people who came to buy something specific . The funniest was a day I sold Herbalife products to someone buying vertical blinds . <p> Yes CL is inefficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get my hands on . This year I can barely give them away . Brass headboards wont even bring $10 . I 'm sure I could get more at scrap yard . Of course , that just may be in my town . Your local market may be opposite at this time . <p> Hi Jacob , I am in the beginning stages of starting a part time furniture updating business for fun with the hopes of making a little extra money . Your blog has been very helpful . I was hoping you could give me some advice on how to handle customer payment . I was considering a cash only option , but am realizing this will exclude a lot of potential customers . I do n't  want to have to deal with NSF issues with checks . How have you set up your business ? Thank you for your help ! <p> Karen , I 'm sorry for the delayed response . I 've stuck to cash for all of my selling . There are many new card readers that you can attach to smartphones , but they take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to recommend any particular brand , but maybe another reader knows ? <p> I have a question . The one thing I am not keen on about selling on Craigslist is having people come to my house often . IN particular when the items are large ( furniture ) . This IS Craigslist with nuts out there or people casing out your place . If its small items I meet at Starbucks . Just wondering what peoples perspective is on this . Great article and thoughts by people on it . <p> One technique that works great for me is bartering.lots of times I can barter up to a much more expensive items then what I started with .. I recently traded a Wii u that I spent 150 on for a 55 inch plasma AND a 32 inch LCD TV .. sold those for 350 together and more than doubled my moneyI always ask if sellers are willing to trade . Also always always always low ball the shit out of people lots of times an item that is originally 75 dollars you can get for 50 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time if you see there item is still up days or weeks later . Finally my last tip is like was said earlier find your niche and stick with it.mine is fixing broken electronics people sell suuuuper low and I have made huge profits because people do n't  have the time or knowledge to fix .. I bought a 55 inch led TV for 10 dollars and it needed a set of 35$ ribbon cables chaching .. sold for 200 155 dollar profit ! ! Happy cruising people ! ! <p> Good tips Jacob , but you are leaving out the real secret . It up to you and your work ethic . Ive been a flipper for five years and its anything but an easy living . I spend between 10-15 hours a day online sending and answering emails , researching CL , packaging , listing , and shipping items on ebay/amazon , and meeting sellers for new inventory . Granted , it is nice working from home , but there are no paid vacations or benefits . I work at it constantly because I never want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thousand . This profession is anything but easy . <p> I agree 100% , Rob . It would be nice to program a robot to find our deals for us but its just not happening anytime soon . I do the post-purchase work at my own leisure since the $$$ is made when I buy , not when I sell , and I 'm not into flipping the newest . latest and greatest , so time to market is n't a concern . The hardest work is scouring new deals and it gets very monotonous over time . I find a few weeks off from searching here and there helps , but I hate missing those juicy deals ! <p> To answer your question , use ebay completed listings ( only for items that sold ) as your price guide . Set your prices based on the market and disclose to the buyer any known issues that the product has and price it in accordingly . As far as you getting ripped off , you need to know what the item is worth before you buy it , given its condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purchase then you have n't done the adequate preparation to make the deal . Make sure you know how to fully inspect and test whatever you buy beforehand . You will meet people on Cl who do n't  have the best intentions for you in mind but you can leverage that in negotiations if you are armed with the knowledge you need . <p> Let me add : Base your purchase decision on the lowest price sale you find on ebay on a similar condition item . If you see that the item has recently sold between $700-$1000 and you go out and pay $800 for it hoping to flip it for $1000 on ebay you will more than likely take a hit when you do n't  get the higher end of the range that you were hoping for . Factor in that you will be paying 10%-12% in fees to ebay/paypal . In this scenario , I would hope to sell it for $1000 , make no mistake , but I would n't pay more than $500 for the item . So if it sells for $700 then I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely right . I 'm actually thinking about quiting my job and making this CL thing a full time job . I can buy old furniture for really cheap and make it look brand spanking new and make a good profit . Think about it say I buy a used table for $8 then I sand it down and repaint it . There 's another 46 bucks for material . Thats 12-14 bucks invested . Then say it takes two hours to do it . Sell it for 50-60 bucks . Thats 18 to 28 bucks a hour . There 's also things on CL that are absolutely free that you can make a 100% profit off of <p> HI .. I just discovered this site and I would love to get into this . I am retired government worker and my pension just gets me by . I have over the years played in the buying and selling and going to auctions , garage sales etc . No big money but if I do it part time and regularly then I should at least be able to make a bit of spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the shipping kind of scared me off . The person that taught the course was a retired government employee as well and he switched to selling to Craigslist as well . I am not sure what the date is on this post but hoping I could get into this as I do have a passion for it . My house is small but thinking I would ask my son to put up another shed beside the one I have in my yard that is actually a carport shed(tent) only smaller . Do you recommend Craigslist or Kijiji rather than selling on ebay or ? I do n't  have a website and not sure how to get one or if I need one . <p> Be conscious of where you stand in regard to the 20k in gross proceeds throughout the year . You do n't  want to finish the year at 21k or so in net sales because then you will have to probably pay some tax to Uncle Sam . This is n't an issue for me since I go well over 20k anyhow , but for the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can when you are close at the end of the year . Considering shutting down your ebay operation if you are just under that mark in November/December . Just stick to selling on CL until after the new year . Opening up several ebay user IDs to sell wont circumvent the system since paypal will 1099 you based on your social security # , so the aggregate amount of your sales proceeds through multiple user ids will be the final tally . <p> Ive been buying and selling electronics on CL for about 3 years and recently left my job to do it full time . It definitely works but you have to be very familiar with the items that you are buying and selling in order to avoid costly mistakes . At least 90% of the items I buy are small enough in size to conveniently ship so that I can sell them on ebay . Even after the ebay and paypal commissions , I find I still net more then selling it back on CL , and I sell a lot faster there , too . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I flip . Be aware that if you take in more than 20K in sales proceeds via paypal in a calendar year that they will 1099 you and you will have to itemize your tax return on a Schedule C as a self-employed business , so keep good records ! <p> I find that the majority of CL sellers that I interact with will lower their price when I negotiate in person . People are terrible at the perceived conflict of negotiating face to face , and will bend easily when you are firm . When you know your items inside and out you will generally have a better understanding of what you are purchasing than the person you are buying from and can leverage small functional and cosmetic issues you uncover that were not described by the listing or email exchange . People are generally terrible at describing their items because they are n't  selling with a business mentality . Take full advantage of that . Once you are there they do n't  want to watch your money leave . <p> And always be polite = As mentioned before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you ! Even if you cant meet on a price after you responded to the listing via email/phone/text , if you leave off on a polite foot then there is a good chance that that person will reach out to you later when they still have the item , especially less popular items and items where the seller had unrealistic price expectations from the start . <p> I 've only sold two things on Craigslist a Nintendo DS with a handful of games , and a student violin my wife used in college . Both times , though , I managed to earn a tidy sum of money , and I wish I 'd had about a dozen of those violins on hand . Lots of demand for affordable instruments in good condition . Good pictures and a detailed post seem to be really key to getting good offers , too . <p> Hi Jacob , I really like all the info . that you have shared . But I 'd like to know , where do you think would be the best place online that I could sell my paintings ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is there another place that I can sell them on ? <p> Jacob , great post ! I have been flipping and bartering things on craigslist for years . I recently started a website blog for telling stories and sharing good deals from craigslist and online . It is becauseofcraig.com . I just launched it not too long ago , but it would be a great platform to share our stories with each other . <p> Jacob , Sorry for the slow response . Been busy with kids and work . I do have some cool ideas maybe we could discuss . I entered the website email in email field but I will send you an email from my personal email . Talk to you soon . <p> Love it ! ! I started last winter on cl and sold 2 kitchens , a whole matching living room set , countless tables , chairs , high chairs , tickets , lamps , everything you can think of , without even trying . I even just had 4 of my cats pregnant at same time and gave away 16 kittens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion , common sense , and hard work , I can make a million dollars on just this site . Thats sounds ridiculous , but the more you sell , the more product online everyday . Get to the point where you make 500 a week , you can move to making 5000 a week with good skills . " flip &amp; grip " is what I call it . Flip the product and grip a bunch of cash ! <p> How about getting your cats spayed/neutered ? And did you know that not everyone you find on CL is a good home for the kittens ? You did not automatically find them a " good loving home " by just giving them away . There are some people who will turn it around and sell these animals to labs . And then to make things even worse , how many of those kittens you gave away will be spayed/neutered by the people you gave them to ? <p> Its hard to believe you let your cats get pregnant like that , irresponsibly , unless they were already pregnant when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats and kittens who will now possibly go and make more kittens that the world does n't  need . <p> I love CL and Ebay . I flip roughly 600 items a year on CL and Ebay . Key is good ads , promptness on your emails and a good system of organizing your inventory and cashflow . Peak months I bring in 10k per month cash flow . I started with $100 bill I found on the ground 3 years ago after I lost my job . Have never turned back since and have been flipping last 3 years and creating a company currently . <p> You could route it through a Google Voice number if you 'd prefer to not give out your actual number . Either that , or invest in a cheap prepaid phone since you 'll only be using it to field Craigslist calls , you wont burn through minutes too quickly . <p> Hey , I 'm one of the young readers , younger than most , around middle school age , and there are n't  any jobs available for kids my age . So I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuff . Are those things that people would actually buy ? <p> Thanks for reading ! Yeah , people will buy anything if its in good condition . I would try to sell it on Craigslist first , and if that does n't  work , check Amazon for what you are selling . If anything is valuable , you should check around to see what those items are selling for online , then price accordingly . Get started selling and negotiating young . You wo n't regret it . <p> I must admit its a very nice article and tips you are giving . He is totally correct there is aloooot of money to be made on craigslist i managed to make around 11 to 14k in about 3 months doing this so everything is possible ! ! ! Thanks for writing this cool article . Hope to soon read more articles about selling online . Thanks papi <p> Hey there ! I 'm one of your younger viewers , and was wondering if you could make an entire post on " selling cars " on Craigslist . Share some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks ! <p> Hey Brandon , thanks for reading and commenting . We really appreciate the feedback . I actually plan on doing a couple of car posts in the near future . Mostly on buying , but I will try to write a solid post on my selling expertise ! <p> Craigslist pays my rent , bills and all my expenses . So basically I make a living out of craigslist , its my full time job . I buy from craigslist and sell on Ebay . EBays prices are basically the normal prices you pay for any item or maybe a little cheaper . <p> I used to sell items on eBay when I was in high school , and loved it , but just ran out of product per say . Definitely like the idea of flipping craigslist products , I have always been meaning to garage sale on Saturdays to find product and then resell them .. but its the waking up at 8 on Saturday that really kills me . Thanks for the post though , I may just reconsider . <p> Wow Jacob that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential goldmine for sellers , especially those who are crafty and/or handy , which sadly , I am neither . = Craigslist is very popular in LA , but you do have to be careful , because well its LA . Great tips ! <p> I have n't used CL to purely make money ( i.e. flip ) , but I have sold a bunch of items . I like to check the priceonomics website to find its market value , then I set the list price at 10-25% of that depending on its demand . I do this expecting most CL buyers to haggle , which means we usually end up at the appropriate market value . If someone offers to buy at list price , I can hasten the deal by saying something like " I 'll reduce the price by 10% if you pick it up today/tomorrow . " <p> Great advice . I 've never bought or sold on Craigslist . Well , I did try to buy a piano but someone beat me to it . I often check Craigslist for a nice piano for my daughter but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling , I am thinking of selling some items on Amazon . Will have to see how that goes . <p> Wow , great information . I have to admit that I rarely use Craiglist so I do n't  know much about the prices on there . I can see how some people would n't know what to price their items at . If you know what you 're doing , you could probably get a good deal . <p> I had a friend who used to make a lot of money from seasonal items . He was actually a dumpster diver and would dig through dumpsters after holidays for items that did n't  sell . He had a garage full of stuff he would store until the holiday came back the next year . Then he would sell it online for a profit . Even if he made only a little off the items , he would make some money . Its an unusual way to make some money , but it can pay off if you 're determined to make it work . <p> Oh boy , after seeing that table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It looks brand spankin new . Things are flying out of this house at an alarming rate , and we need to make some money on some of it . I think sometimes we 'd rather not wait around for people , but we have made some good money on several items . <p> One call we received was a bit scary , so we make sure to meet people in public places like Barnes and Noble parking lot . <p> I have sold and purchased quite a bit on Craigslist . It is all about the information in the listing as well as how well you negotiate . Cash talks , but do n't  offer too much . You also have to make sure you do n't  fall for something that does n't  seem right . <p> How much time do you think you put into Craigslist flipping ? That 's neat that you 've found some good margins = There is n't much of a used sales market in the small town I live in , but if I was in a city , I think I 'd buy a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy and sell a lot . Lately , not as much . I 've made $2000 on a car that took nothing more than a 2 hour detail and an annoying trip with the crazy lady selling it . Small markets suck and I just do n't  like big cities . Medium sized towns seems to be my favorite . <p> I love selling stuff on Craigslist ! I have n't restored anything to sell on there , but that does sound like a good strategy if you are handy like that . I like to buy items at a deep discount and then resell them at a premium . Sometime it takes longer to sell , but it pays off in the end . <p> Awesome advice Jacob . I 've done a little Craigslist buying and selling ans i 'm always amazed at how easy it is to negotiate . Most people who are selling really just want to get rid of their item more than they care about how much they sell it for . I routinely get things for half what they were listed at <p> Awesome post ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen table I 'm currently sitting at ) , and it was definitely a steal . A friends wife flips things on Craigslist and I have certainly entertained the idea . I also know someone who buys , refinishes , and sells furniture for a full-time job . Seems like a great way to make money from home . <p> I 've bought and sold on Craigslistits great ! The only thing is , some people are not very trustworthy , like they say they want the item and are going to come and pick it up and never show . So , when I sell , I never promise my items to anyonefirst come , first served ! <p> The spam emails can be annoying on Craigslist , but as long as you have common sense , you can usually weed them out . Love the idea of flipping stuff of Craigslist !

One thing I did n't  discuss was the possibility of utilizing- an IRA- to help your children build wealth . It 's a powerful tool that is vastly underutilized . <p> Most people assume that IRAs can only be funded by adults . But no such restriction exists . Anyone can fund an IRA if they have earned income . Regardless of age . <h> How does it Work ? <p> You can setup a " custodial " Roth IRA for a youngster and manage the assets for them until they reach the age of majority- ( usually age- 18 , but up to age 21 , depending on your state of residence ) . The money grows , undisturbed by taxes , for 50+- years . That 's a lot of compounding , tax free . <p> As the custodian , you make the decisions on investment choices until the child reaches the age of majority . At that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the account is completely owned by the child . They can spend the money in any way imaginable . <p> Not all firms allow minors to have IRAs , but most of the big ones are open for business . Including Vanguard , - Schwab , Scottrade , T. Rowe Price , and TD Ameritrade . <h> Why the Roth IRA ? <p> You could simply fund a taxable account that has been set aside for your child . You would technically own the account and could decide the appropriate time to gift the money . But there are a couple of major downsides to this approach . The first is that you will likely pay taxes on at least part of the- investment earnings from year to year , slowing the compounding process . Second , the account would be included in your available assets and could impact your childs ability to get financial aid in higher education . Third , there could be gift tax consequences at the time of gifting to your child . <p> All of these negatives can be eliminated by using an- IRA in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traditional IRA accounts are tax-deductible in the current year . You receive a tax break equal to your marginal tax rate at the time of contribution . This is excellent for many working adults in a high marginal tax bracket , but not so much for a child . <p> Roth IRA accounts are funded with after-tax dollars . There is no tax break in the year that contributions are made , but all earnings grow tax-free and qualified withdrawals are tax-free . <p> For most young- people , the Roth IRA is preferable to a traditional IRA for two reasons . <p> 1 ) Children are- typically in a very low tax bracket , and therefore do n't need the deduction that a traditional IRA provides . In fact , most kids are not required to file an income tax return because they have earned income that is less than the standard deduction- amount ( $6,200 in 2014 ) . If that 's the case , its all taxed at 0% , which makes the Traditional IRA worthless . <p> 2 ) - Contributions to a Roth IRA can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties . Furthermore , a- portion of the account can be taken out for qualified expenses that might occur before retirement , such as qualified higher education expenses or a down payment on their first- house , without- penalty . I 'm not recommending they raid the IRA account , but it can act as a wonderful backup emergency fund . <h> How Much Can Be Saved ? <p> For 2014 , the maximum contribution- is the lesser of $5,500 or earned income for the year . If your child has no earnings , he or she can not contribute at all . <p> Money from gifts , allowances or investment- income does not count as earned income and , therefore , can not be used towards contributions . Being a life guard or Walmart greeter- certainly counts , but so does self-employment like babysitting , mowing lawns , flipping electronics on Craigslist , or cleaning houses . <p> Ideally , this income will come from sources other than family . Perhaps from jobs that provide a W-2 . But that 's not necessary . <p> If the wage is paid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that include the type of work , the date of completion , the employer , and the agreed upon wage . You can include work done around the house provided it is legitimate and the pay is at the going market rate . <p> Better yet , figure out how to create a simple family business and put your child to work doing age-appropriate tasks for reasonable pay . For example , infants and children can be used for photography , video , and marketing purposes . They should be compensated appropriately for those services . In doing this , your business minimizes its tax liability and your child earns income that will qualify him or her to make an IRA contribution . <p> Another excellent option that I 'm fond of is this : go ahead and- match your child 's contribution each year . For example , if your child- earns $4,000 at a summer job , you can let her decide between spending the money and saving the money . For each dollar that she saves , you match it . ( She saves half of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA contribution of $4,000 ) <p> Or offer to contribute a percentage of what your child contributes , such as 50% ( your child contributes $3,000 to the IRA , and you contribute $1,500 for a total of $4,500 ) . <p> Whatever approach you decide to take , the IRS does n't  care who makes the contribution as long as it does not exceed your child 's earned income for the year . <h> They Will Thank You Later <p> Let 's consider a few scenarios to show the compounding magic of this strategy . <p> 1 ) Ideal Scenario <p> Let 's assume you have- just given birth to a- picture-perfect baby and your family run a thriving photography business . You immediately start using the child in photos and videos for marketing purposes . <p> Well assume the going rate for baby marketing allows you to pay your child $5,500 per year , every year for 16- years . <p> In this case , you open up a custodial- Roth IRA at Vanguard and fund the maximum- $5,500 with the childs earned income . Repeat each year for 16- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your help , will continue maxing out the Roth IRA each year until retirement at age 65 . <p> So we are funding the IRA with $5,500 each year , for 65 years . <p> Compounding at 8% gets you to- $10,972,654 at age 65 . <p> If you assume 3% inflation , and plug the number into the following formula : <p> You get real growth of 4.85% each year , which compounds to- $2,464,177 . <p> 2 ) Possible- scenario <p> Same assumptions above , but instead you can only pay your child $2,000 per year for their photos . <p> In this case , you open up a custodial- Roth IRA at Vanguard and fund $2,000- with the childs earned income . Repeat each year for 16- years , then assume the child starts working and with your help , will continue maxing out the Roth IRA each year until retirement at age 65 . <p> So we are funding the IRA with- $2,000 per year for 16 year , then $5,500 each year , for 49 years . <p> 8% compounding gets you to $5,994,751 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get- $1,590,856 . <p> 3 ) Everyone Can Do- This <p> The child starts working at age 15 and earns at least $4,000 per year . <p> In this case , you open up a custodial- Roth IRA at Vanguard and fund $4,000- with the childs earned income . Assume this continues for 50 years- until retirement at age 65 . <p> Compounding at 8% gets you to $2,478,687- at age 65 . <p> If you assume 3% inflation , you still get real growth of $836,753 . <h> Its More than Money <p> Opening an IRA for your child obviously gives them a head start on saving for retirement . But more importantly , it teaches them a multitude of financial lessons- covering the topics of- taxation , investing , retirement , compound - interest , and the dynamic relationship between earning , saving and spending . <p> Retirement might not be- the first thing on a- young child 's mind , but most kids are intrigued with the idea of money . You can help grow that small see of interest into something substantial . Young children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deviation , but they are old enough to appreciate- a growing account balance . <p> As the child ages , you can educate them on the more difficult topics . You can sit down and show them the math behind compound interest , and the difference in account value- that results from a 5% return on investment versus an 8% return . Explain why investment fees matter , the importance of diversification , and the differences between stocks , bonds , and cash . <p> Forget high school financial literacy courses .

I 'm a father of a very advanced toddler who often helps me in the yard . In the interest of funding a Roth IRA to start a retirement account early on ( in addition to her 529 and UTMA ) , I 'm wondering if she could do simple tasks such as cleaning up yard debris ( sticks , pine cones , dog droppings ( with a scoop of course ) etc .. ) for some of the neighbors nicely landscaped yards for small amounts of pay ( i.e. $5 per week ) and have that qualify as " earned income " . Obviously the concern is the young age of 2 or 3 years old , but not only is she very capable of a task like that , but shed actually have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser and I could n't find within publication 590 as to what they would see as a red flag . Just looking for thoughts and what the process for reporting and record keeping would be . Any info would be much appreciated . <p> Great article , however it all depends on my child having earned income , correct ? Other than the photography example you gave , I do n't  know of too many two-year olds that have earned income . Wouldnt you agree that the majority of children do not until they are of the age to work at a summer or part time job ? So , while in theory this makes perfect sense , its likely not as simple as one thinks and not likely applied until the child is in their teenage years , for the most part . <p> You are correct , many children wont have earned income until teenage years because their parents do n't  know about these possibilities . However , there are plenty of savvy people getting creative and finding ways of assigning earned income to a child , making this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what opening a Roth IRA does for the child . When I was 16 , my grandpa matched my first $1000 earned bagging groceries at the lap grocery store by putting $1000 in a roth IRA in my name with vanguard . It did n't  actually make me wealthy , since this was in 2004 and I actually watched my $1000 decrease over time . But it did show me how important investing in the future was to my family . It also helped me learn about what an IRA was , and the difference between Roth and traditional . I also already had an IRA , so as an adult , I had a place to invest when I got my first full time job . Having that seed planted early has given me the knowledge and motivation to make much wiser spending and saving choices than many of my peers . <p> Thanks Claire , great input here . One things I have to add though , your original $1,000 in Vanguard should have appreciated a great deal since 2004 if you held stock and bond ETFs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market . <p> Awesome article Jacob great details and scenarios . I 've done this with 4 of my 5 kids so far ( and will be 5 for 5 when the youngest gets that first summer job ) . If we could just get every parent to do this for their kids , it would be a serious game-changer . This is my all-time favorite family finance tip . I first heard about it from financial writer Dan Kadlec who dubbed it " The Family 401(k) " . I made a little video featuring the concept for a GetRichSlowly contest ( runner-up ) : LONG ... I like your addition of details around gift tax and financial aid implications . Good stuff , and kudos for getting the word out . <p> Nice post Jacob ! I do n't  have any problems if a parent wants to do this . There are certainly advantages to the Roth . I 'd just assume set up a custodial account where the money is investing traditionally , outside of a Roth . That way it could be used for any expenses they may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are building a great future for the kids . <p> There are additional limitations with the custodial account which is why I would n't recommend their use . The Roth is excellent for the taxation privileges over the long haul , and contributions can be withdrawn at any time . <p> You are so right ! This is a great way to invest in your kids ( if you can afford it ) . I think everyone that can should do this for sure . If I had kids I 'd do this as long as I was already consumer debt free and investing heavily in my own retirement account too . Saving for your kids is awesome , but you shouldnt do it at the expense of your own financial security . <p> I agree with this . I think in most situations , parents should take care of their own retirement needs , then worry about setting aside additional funds for children . Hopefully for many readers of this blog , its a both/and situation . <p> Excellent summary .

The figures you have shown us are astounding but so very easy to attain . I also like the idea of matching what our children wishes to save . The money that can be earned from your suggestions is awesome but I think I like the lessons that can be learned even the more . Thanks for sharing . <p> Hi Mike . There is no impact at all for the custodial Roth , which is another benefit I did n't  talk about . Qualified retirement plans are n't  included for children or parents for financial aid purposes . The 529 plan will impact financial aid , but only a small fraction of the account is included in the calculation . That amount varies depending on whether its a custodial 529 owned by the child , or owned by the parent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children a head start . I think so many so many of us singularly focus on College Savings Accounts only . Youve given us much to think about with preparing our children financially to have a solid footing as they grow older . 
@@44824075 @4824075/ <h> How to Become a Certified Financial Planner ( CFP ) <p> I recently wrote an article on how to become a financial advisor . After writing that , I realized that another article would be necessary to explain how to become a certified financial planner ( CFP- ) . <p> The Certified Financial Planner ( CFP- ) designation is becoming the standard in the financial planning industry . More and more studies are being conducted that ask potential clients their preferences in choosing a financial planner , and most of them indicate strong support for the CFP-- designation . <p> There are many reasons for this . With a million or more so called " financial advisors " lurking in the shadows , its very important to carry a distinguishing designation . In addition , the CFP-- designation mandates a solid knowledge base and provides an excellent regulatory standard in the financial planning world . <p> Without further ado , here is how to become a certified financial planner ( CFP- ) : <h> Required Education : <p> A bachelors degree is required , although it can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning must take the required classes that are approved by the CFP-- board .

In fact , there are over 300 colleges and universities across the country which provide the necessary classes . There are online self study programs , bachelors degrees , masters degrees , and even PhD programs like the one I 'm currently enrolled in . Let me break them down for you . <p> Online Self Study Programs- <p> I almost enrolled in one of these programs before I decided to pursue my PhD . They can be completed at your own pace , on your own schedule . They do not typically count for any actual college credit , but they satisfy the CFP-- requirement . <p> I 've done a lot of research on the available programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big chunk of the online programs . The Dalton courses are expensive and because of that , I would n't enroll . The basic online course is now $3,195 plus- textbooks .

Click Here for an example at the University of Miami . <p> Florida State offers a unique program that is actually professor led . The cost is $3,600 plus textbooks . It seems to be a little more involved and the courses are only offered at certain times so you cant complete the whole thing quite as quick as the other self study options . <p> Advanced degrees <p> Financial planning is a rapidly growing profession with an expanding research base .

This makes a tough situation for the college graduate who is trying to figure out how to become a certified financial planner . <p> If you are in college and want to be a certified financial planner , try to get an internship that will count towards the experience requirements . <p> If you do pass the exam , you can often find a good entry level planning job at a good firm that will- satisfy- the experience requirements .

In other words , there are two separate pieces to the puzzle : 1 ) Passing the CFP ( does n't  matter where you did the basic educational requirements ) 2 ) Networking to find a desirable job ( much easier in a well established CFP program ) Hope this helps ! <p> Pretty low pass rate , but its doable !

I think the entire process sounds exciting and I may end up doing it , but probably not until I can quit my current career in order to fulfill the experience requirements . It does n't  look like you could really do it on the side . <p> Yes , passing the series 65 and giving financial advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's a good option , but many people fear that they cant actually find full time RIA work without previous planning experience and a designation like the CFP or something similar . Its sort of a catch 22 . <p> Great write up Jacob ! I was extremely close to taking the CFP myself , but it just did not work out for me . I have few friends who have theirs and it was a TON of work , but they love what they do and it really is a good thing to have if that is the route you choose to go . As a K-State alum ( Go State ! ) its cool to see that they are the only ones offering the program they are . = <p> This will definitely be useful for anyone with an interest in becoming a Financial Planner great , comprehensive information ! I 'm curious what you 're interested in pursuing since you 're opting for a Ph.D . its been my observation that Masters tended to lean more towards industry careers , while Ph.D . was more research/academic related . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or at least has the potential to provide more opportunities ) ? <p> Thanks Anna ! To sum it up , I 'm interested in both academia and private practice . The PhD potentially provides a lot of value in the private sector ( depending on what niche you decide to pursue ) and is a requirement in academia . Not to mention , I love to learn and I want to be an expert in the field . Does that make sense ? <p> Oh boy , Jacob . I should definitely not become a financial planner . Just reading this post made me nervous ! I can handle things over here at the Hoombah household that is all . Others do not want me meddling with their money . They need people like you , Glen , and Cash Rebel . <p> The CFP designation has always interested me just because I have an extra curricular interest in finance .

I think you said Discover does not charge a fee , but am not sure if there is a way to do it so my other bank ( Wells ) also wont charge a fee . To date , I have only deposited checks via mobile banking in my Discover account , which is super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there is a $5000 max limit with their mobile deposit and $25,000 max limit over any 30 day period . It is cumbersome if you need to deposit a big check . Compare that with Ally Bank at $50K/$250K limits . <p> The section in your blog about Discovers fees , " Discover does impose a maximum limit of 6 money transfers per statement cycle . If you go over that amount , there is a fee . " makes it sound as if this is not the case with other banks . The limit of 6 withdrawals per calendar month is a federal law applying to all savings accounts , imposed some years ago . You will not find any savings account at any bank that does not have a similar fee . <p> Help , I am trying to make a decision between Amex and Discover online saving accounts . Just a college student trying to set up an emergency fund when I need it with good rates . Read both of your reviews on both companies , just want some feedback . <p> I use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find it to be the simplest way to save money , and have my credit card , savings , and checking account all on the same web site .. I find Discover card is accepted almost everywhere in the United States , I was over in Puerto Rico and I was able to use it over there too . <p> Which bank offers free transfers i.e. deposits and withdrawals to the Western Union Netspend account . I currently have PNC and TD bank and I 've noticed that I cant add the netspend account using the account and routing number through PNC , however with TD bank there appears to be a $3 charge for all transfers . Please advise . <p> Hi Jacob , your review and the comments were one of the reasons we gave Discover online savings a try . I read here and elsewhere than deposit times can be longer at Discover than at Amex , so we just tested that theory . We opened accounts with both , and set up ACH links both ways from our USAA checking to each account . On Tuesday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " push " to each savings accounts from checking , and a " pull " into each savings from checking . <p> Results ? the SAME ! Both " pushes " initiated from our checking account arrived into Discover and Amex the very next day . Both " pulls " initiated from savings were reflected right away in our savings accounts , but the money did n't  actually arrive till a few days later , and were held for 5 business days after that at both accounts . <p> Conclusion ? There 's absolutely no difference in the speed of transfers between Discover and Amex . If you want to move money from your checking into your online savings account , initiate the transfer from your checking account , and it will arrive the next day into your online savings account . Of course , if your sending bank is slower , your results could vary , but it wont be because of Discover or Amex . <p> Since Discover has a slightly higher interest rate , a mobile app , and the ability to deposit checks directly using their app @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Thanks again for the review ! <p> I was curious about what you think of GE Capital Banks online savings account ? <p> PS- The reviews you did of both Betterment and Wealthfront were very helpful when making a choice between the two . The pros , cons , and features that differentiated the services were very well structured and easy to read . <p> I have a capital one 360 saving account . I can open another one with them but I was exploring for better options and stumbled upon your article . Should I close my 360 and open a discover saving ? Or keep 360 and open discover . I do have a discover credit card . Please help . Thanks <p> With a good repayment record you can get one or more 0% apr balance transfers , which can last from 10 months to 18 months with a 1-5% fee on the amount transferred . <p> A common fee is 3% , so if you transfer $10k of your Discover balance to BofA , for example , it would cost you $300 right off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you transferred , and shows up at the bank that gives you the balance transfer . But the interest stops accumulating , so you can get a handle on paying off the amount you owe and stop feeling like you 're running up a giant sand dune . <p> This can be done from within Discover ( go to your online account or call them to see what you 're eligible for ) or you can apply for new credit with some other banks . <p> I was able to pay off $45K of debt in a little over two years by doing this . I had an excellent repayment history but a high utilization rate , and some cards only gave me $2000 in credit . But with that 0% balance transfer , I figured out what I had to pay every month to get it paid off by the end of the balance transfer time , and set up autopays so I never missed a payment . My FICO went up to 849 , though that number is capricious as heck . The numbers that matter are your balances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off before any interest is charged . I also relied on CreditKarma.com for financial education and information about what I owed throughout my big financial reset . <p> Thanks for the review , I think I 'm going to switch to Discovers Savings account . Perhaps a couple years ago Ally Bank deserved the praise and business , but they have plummeted in recent months . Their app is regularly down , their interest rate is almost half what it was and most recently , they punitively even locked me out of my own account for complaining about slow / non-existent customer support ( 1-2 days because THEY have the wrong identification information on file ) . Believe it , 15 minutes after I filed a complaint with them over their customer support , they changed my pin and locked my online account " for security review " . Avoid Ally Bank . <p> I agree . I have accounts at Discover and Ally . Customer service at Discover has been very helpful . Customer service at Ally has cost me money , and offered no recourse and no apology . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to Discover . <p> I wanted to comment . Ally is a bunch of aholes.I had an angry well . i wont describe her ethnicity , curse me out about only keeping minimum funds in each account and called it shady.They closed my accounts and sent me all my money <p> What are your thoughts on My Savings Direct , which currently is offering around 1% for their online savings account . They also boast to have Americas highest rate consistently . Think they 're reputable enough , or safe enough to open an account and move money from say AmEx ? Also , for a long time investor ( Roth IRA and 401k for the past 10 years ) but wanting to break into the stock market through stocks and bonds , would you suggest Betterment , the investment firm mentioned earlier ? I very much enjoy investing , and am unsure if I should move towards something like Vanguard or Betterment . Thanks for your thoughts and wisdom ! Really appreciate your blog ! <p> Hey Jeremiah , thanks for stopping in and for the kind words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't say for sure . I typically stick with the bigger banks because I think they will be around for a long time . Regarding stocks and bonds , Betterment is excellent if you do n't  want to spending any time messing with your portfolio . They do a great job at asset management , and require nothing from you ( except a small annual fee ) . Vanguard is great for the DIY investor . <p> Hi Jacob , Thank you so much for your valuable article . I do have few clarifications , &gt; I have read that fund **29;90;TOOLONG free . Does it mean that I can transfer money to my friend who has other bank account ( ex : Chase ) ? I have Bank of America checking account , but they charge fee for transferring money to other banks ( ex : Chase ) . <p> &gt; I am not familiar with APY . For example , If I maintain $5000 in Discover savings account , how much will I receive as interest at the end of month ? <p> Thanks for the review ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across your blog . I called and opened an account with Discover , and I found your assessment to be quite true ! They were great ! It was refreshing ! <p> Greetings Jacob , First I must commend you for this blog . I link it to all my friends who ask about financial help . They want to start saving money now that there finely making it . But there scared of the old systems of investing that were used during the recession . ( just as I am . ) Now I just link them to your blog and tell them : Read this , it will take the fear of investing right out of you . So thanks ! You pair financial expertise , with a modern tech embracing intellect . So cheers to you and your wife ! <p> But , I digress . My main question for you is . I want to use your system of a local bank for my checking account ( I prefer credit unions for their various pros . But when it comes to a checking account , same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank for my savings account . I have been aware of Ally bank for quite some time . But your article here made me see Discover has a similar account type . Have you had any experience with Ally bank ? if so what would you suggest : Ally or Discover ? The pro with discover as of now is I also have a Discover It card . So I could handle all my web-based transactions with one account , and one app. as opposed to Discover for card and Ally for banking . But Ally has been doing modern online banking for so long , and are so highly rated . Is there any Pros/Cons to Ally vs Discover ? Or do they both offer the same free features , same fee rates , etc ? If there the same feature wise i 'd probably go with Discover for the one app convenience . But if there is a pro to Ally that Discover does n't  have . I 'd rather go with Ally . I wan na go with the one that 's the best deal , over just the ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I do n't  plan on chasing the best all the time . Just want to find one that is actually competitive , and stick with it . Even if its a few points off from the current leader . Thank you so much for your time and help . Best wishes to you and the family . <p> Frank , first of all let me say thank you for such a kind and thoughtful comment . Youve really made my day . I do not have prior experience with Ally , so I cant say too much about them . But I do have an extensive background with Discover and Discover credit cards , as you mentioned . From the reviews that I have read , they offer similar features , although I 've seen more positive reviews with Discover . This is primarily due to great customer support ( which we have always adored ) . Neither should charge you any fees , so pick the one that is convenient right now . Sounds like that might be Discover . Thanks for sending us readers and for voicing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thanks for the review of Discover Online Savings Account . The interest rate that they offer is definitely the highest I have seen for a savings account . I also like the fact that their initial deposit requirement is pretty low , not to mention the fact you do not have to maintain a certain minimum balance . I will bookmark them because you can never have enough saving vehicles . Thanks <p> Thanks for the great write up of Discover Bank . I really do like your reviews since they hit the high and low points without too much fluff . Out of pure laziness , I have pretty much stopped rate chasing and have stuck with CapitalOne360. 
@@44824079 @4824079/ <h> Market Timing is Almost Always a Losing Game <p> Buy low , and sell high . Rinse and repeat. - Just like- stock picking , its so easy a caveman could do it . <p> Market timing- seems rather simple at surface level . Just figure out how to determine when stocks or bonds or any asset is priced improperly , and then figure out when exactly things will return- to " proper " pricing . With these two pieces of information , an investor can easily hop in and out of various asset classes while making huge sums of money . <h> What is Market Timing ? <p> When most people talk about market timing , they are referring to the stock market . The other common asset classes , like bonds and cash , are often a part of market timing strategies , but they are secondary to stocks . This is because stocks fluctuate in value much more frequently and rapidly than the other asset classes , and therefore present the greatest opportunity for gains in the event of successful market timing . <p> Rotating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which involves shifting between stocks , bonds , cash , etc. in anticipation of future performance . Examples include holding more cash/bonds in anticipation of a stock market decline , or holding 100% equities when expecting a bull stock market . <p> Rotating equity styles " Examples include shifting from growth to value investing in anticipation of a market decline , or from foreign to domestic equities in anticipation of bad foreign markets . <p> Rotating equity sectors " Examples include shifting between technology stocks and energy stocks in an attempt to be more " defensive . " Or , over-weighting a portfolio with health care stocks because you think that sector will outpace the economy on the whole . <p> Picking individual securities " - Stock picking- is often part of the strategies listed above . <p> There are countless other examples . <h> Is it Really That- Difficult ? <p> Professor and Nobel Laureate William Sharpe- wanted to identify the percentage of time a market timer would need to be correct to break even relative to a benchmark ( index ) portfolio . He concluded a market timer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passive portfolio at a comparable level of risk . ( 1 ) <p> Subsequent studies have- concluded- that market timers need to be correct between 70-85% of the time to outperform a comparable passive portfolio , validating Sharpes work . <p> And why is this the case ? <p> Successful market timing requires two- components being in at the right time , and out at the right time . If you miss either move , you 'll under-perform a simple buy and hold strategy . This is what makes market timing nearly impossible . <p> Consider the following scenario . If the stock market has been on a five year upward march ( much like now ? ) , you might conclude that its " overvalued " based on some valuation scheme or historical indicator . So you sell most of your stock holdings and move to an alternative liquid investment like cash or short term bonds in anticipation of a stock market correction . The problem is that you 'll miss all the gains produced until that correction . Is there any reason the market ca n't continue the upward climb for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you get lucky and exit near the peak , - you 'll have figure out when to buy after the market- corrects . How do you know how big the correction will be ? Should you buy when it falls 5% ? 10% ? How about 20% ? There is no way to tell . And there are a couple of dangers here : The market could continue falling even after you- buy- back in , or you could wait too long and miss the upswing . Most big corrections are quickly followed by big rebounds , and its impossible to know when the market has hit rock bottom . <p> These problems are exacerbated by the fact that a- very small number of days- account for the bulk of stock market returns . <p> An investor in the S&amp;P 500 index would have earned an annualized return of 9.22% throughout the 20-year period ending on 12/31/2013 , - growing a $10,000 investment to $58,352 . When the five best-performing days in that time period were missed , the annualized return shrank to 7.00% , with $10,000 growing to $38,710 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest gains , the returns were cut down to just 3.02% . If the 40 best performing days were missed , - the investor would have lost $1,851 , with his $10,000 initial investment eroding in value to just $8,149 ! <p> The evidence , based on more than- 160,000 daily returns from 15 international- equity markets , is clear : Outliers have a massive- impact on long-term performance . On- average across all 15 markets , missing the best- 10 days resulted in portfolios 50.8% less valuable- than a passive investment ; and avoiding- the worst 10 days resulted in portfolios 150.4%- more valuable than a passive investment . Given- that 10 days represent , in the average market , - less than 0.1% of the days considered , the odds- against successful market timing are staggering . <p> Black swans render market timing a goose- chase . Attempting to predict the negligible proportion of- days that determines an enormous creation or destruction- of wealth seems to be a losing proposition . Of the countless- strategies that academics and practitioners have devised- to generate alpha , market timing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like going to Vegas , market- timing may be an entertaining pastime , but not a good way- to make money . <p> Between 1926 and 1993 , more than 99% of the total dollar returns were " earned " during only 5.9% of the months . For the 31-year period from 1963 to 1993 , 90- trading days accounted for 95% of the market gains. - <p> The implications of this study could well be critical for the average investor . By being " out of the- market " for as few as even one or two of the best performing months or days over several decades , a- portfolios return is significantly diminished . <p> As you can imagine , timing these select few days is nearly impossible for both professional and individual investors . <h> Market Timing Evidence <p> Domestic Professionals <p> If anyone were able to properly forecast market changes and successfully time the market , it should be professionals . Many mutual funds- and hedge funds- have armies of research analysts attempting to predict the future and outperform the broad market . <p> They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new investors , but there- is very little evidence in favor of long-term market timing . <p> A group of professors took a look at more than 400 U.S. mutual funds through the period of- 1976 1994 and found little evidence of market timing ability ( 4 ) : <p> After controlling for public information , we find little evidence that the mutual funds have conditional- market-timing ability . However , the risk-aversion estimates are imprecise and- the power of the tests for timing ability seem low . To corroborate the validity of- these findings , which are based on rate of return data , we perform additional- tests using the mutual funds portfolio holdings . These tests support our conclusions . <p> We find a relatively small number of funds ( around 1% ) demonstrate positive market timing ability at 5% significance , while around 19% of funds exhibit negative timing and on average funds mis-time the market . However , controlling for publicly available information we find very little evidence of market timing ability based on private timing signals . <p> And over in in Greece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researching Greek mutual funds ( 12 ) : <p> Fund managers fail to have market-timing abilities . This finding is in line with the majority of published research . <p> Guru Predictions <p> Beyond mutual funds , there are the " gurus " who often make predictions on TV , or sell investment newsletters to foolish investors . <p> A study by Professors John Graham and Campbell Harvey titled , " Market Timing Ability and Volatility Implied in Investment Newsletters Asset Allocation Recommendations " ( 13 ) tracked 15,000 predictions made by 237 market-timing newsletters from June 1980 to December 1992 . By the end of the period , 94.5% of the newsletters had gone out of business with an average life span of just four years . They concluded : <p> " There is no evidence that newsletters can time the market . Consistent with mutual fund studies , winners rarely win again and losers often lose again . " <p> Individual Investors <p> Individual investors actually do far worse than professional managers . They tend to invest when everyone else is investing , which is usually near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling , which is when markets are reaching lows . Indeed , research shows that the largest- inflow of investor dollars typically occur immediately after above-average mutual fund or stock performance and immediately before under-performance . Likewise , the largest dollar outflows are observed- after market declines , just before upswings. ( 14 ) - ( 15 ) - ( 16 ) - ( 17 ) ( 18 ) <p> The data seems to indicate that most investors ( despite what they might say ) actually follow a buy high , sell low strategy the exact opposite of a successful market timing strategy . There a number of behavioral flaws that explain the phenomenon , but that 's really not the point . <p> The point is that market timing is generally a waste of time , effort , resources , and money . <p> Its a fact the great majority of individual investors will be rewarded by choosing a long-term , index investing strategy . Of course there will always be a few who find success timing the market , just as a few will find success winning the lottery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily stacked against us ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I would encourage you to Google a paper by Meb Faber called " A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation " . People often make the mistake that market timing is about generating better gains in the markets . Thinking like that misses the point . <p> The value of market timing , like a simple moving average system used by Paul Tudor Jones , is that it helps to minimize the potentially huge drawdowns that people can see when markets tank . The problem with individual investors is that they act in exactly the wrong way at these very difficult times . Many people end up selling their portfolio when things are at their absolute worst , even if they know in their hearts and minds that is the wrong thing to do . By doing that they actually lock in those loses which can take years to recover from . <p> So instead of thinking about market timing as a way to see better returns in your portfolio , it is wise to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtrends that happen . Minimize your loss . It is guaranteed that you will not time the exact points to get in and out , but by using a mechanical system to save you from silly errors like selling at the bottom when you cant take the pain anymore you might see better results in the long run . <p> Long story short it is easy to say that buy and hold is better , but when evidence shows us that people cant stomach buy and hold then a better solution should be applied . <p> Thanks for the article and the opportunity to comment on it even if we do n't  fully agree ! <p> Thanks for the great article ! It got me thinking : What about a buy/hold strategy that acknowledges dips/peaks ? For instance , let 's say I want to be 80% stocks , 20% bonds , and I use diversified funds like VTI for stock and BND for bonds . Let 's say I 'm investing $1000 every month . If the stock market just dropped 2% yesterday ( which it often seems to do , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I be better off investing all $1000 in VTI for just that month instead of $800 ? And likewise , if its been on a 6-day streak of increases , are n't  I better off putting more of my money in BND ? Then a couple times a year , I could rebalance to get back to 80/20 , but again , I try to do this with an eye towards the dips/peaks . So if I 'm heavy on bonds , I try to wait for a stock dip before rebalancing , and vice versa . So what I 'm talking about is market timing , but in my mind its on a smaller scale , and more akin to buying produce when its in season . Its not moving large amounts of money after a 10% drop , but rather just watching for a 1 or 2% dip to potentially get a better deal . Thoughts ? Terrible idea ? <p> Very tough indeed . Given retail investors lack the financial sophistication , tools and information of institutional players its nearly impossible to make money . After trading fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy feat to beat index benchmarks . Most people are better off just going and staying long . <p> Timing the market is a matter of luck but responding to the market could be intelligent . Adjustments are typically made to a portfolio not as an attempt to time the market but in response to how the market , sector , or stock is playing out . Sometimes responding to the market looks like timing . And sometimes what looks like timing is just an investors individual response based upon his or her temperament and processing of information . Each investor responds differently . If someone thinks they 're not responding to the market then they 're either not in the market or not alive . But responding to the market does n't  necessarily mean you 're timing it . Now one persons " timing " will be anothers " responding " and vice versa . If its confusing you should be confused . No one knows what 's going on . All you can do is respond intelligently to that reality . <p> Couldnt agree more ! I 'm still in the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found myself in the situation of debating whether or not to deploy capital into one ETF vs another . In this case , I had to pick between US stocks and Canadian stocks , so I ended up making a very loose guess that for the immediate future the US market would likely perform better . In the end though , my guess does n't  really matter as I 'll eventually add more to my Canadian ETF as I balance out my portfolio . My logic was that the US market has historically nearly always outperformed every other market in the world , and with the ongoing energy slump , Canada has been flat-lining . <p> Thank you for a really great , well written and relevant article Jacob ! I totally agree with your views but I would really appreciate your comment on some of the more widespread market timing strategies such as those based on momentum or the MA50/200 . These mechanical strategies claims to bypass human cognitive bias and is said to have performed well in various back tests ( I know , risk of data mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these methods . Please share your opinions ! <p> Thank you for reading and taking the time to comment . I do n't  see a lot of empirical evidence supporting the moving average strategies , but I admit that its not a priority of mine . Momentum is a whole topic by itself , and perhaps an article for another day . <p> I am probably one of the most conservative person with my money on earth , but I have promised myself that after becoming debt free that I will stretch my legs and arms more in investing . This was really informative in regards to market timing . I learned something today ! <p> Great summary about market timing ! You always hear how its nearly impossible to time the market , but cool to see all the studies and research that was done to prove it to be true . Ill have to share this with some people I have tried telling this to = Even professionals and people that spend all their time researching the market are not that great at it . <p> Kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made in a small time period . Seems that a lot of gains are tied to just getting lucky on when you first entered the market ! <p> Your article is very well written . Thank you for taking the time to post . <p> Question about timing the market in regards to recessions : have you done much research on Yield Curves ? Seems like they are good predictors . I do n't  know much about them and wanted to get your opinion . <p> I have n't tired to time the market since I started my dividend investing portfolio back in 2007 . No one can guess where we are headed and hindsight is always 20/20 . I just keep investing every month through the highs and lows of the market and follow my own investment mantra of adding as much new cash as I can to only dividend paying stocks . True in 2008/9 my whole portfolio was in the red big time , but I held each position and kept adding every month to my portfolio . While the market and my portfolio took a dive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . <p> This is a wealth of information . I have been investing since 2000 and am glad I am still in it through the highs and lows . I have a variety of different investments just to ensure I am well balanced . I agree with your points on market timing as it can play a vital role in your bottom line but I have learned to not react at every bit of highs and lows that I experience . <p> I agree that normally individual investors do much worse than professional managers . In the early years I used a manager but as I have educated myself I no longer utilize their services . I would urge any new investor though to use a professional manager . Thanks for sharing . <p> Be careful about stating that individuals always underperform " professional " managers . This is often not the case when individuals index wisely . Many professionally managed mutual funds underperform the market , which is an upcoming article . <p> Excellent information in this post love the value you 're providing to your readers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they often chase performance . " This is why I do n't  try ! I invest in ETFs . I am fully aware that I 'm not a professional . Even the professionals rarely beat the market . <p> Predicting the future is an impossible task , a fools errand , full of pitfalls . Still we listen and soak in all that is said , we even spend a tremendous amount of money to gain an edge in knowing what maybe just around the corner . <p> Of course they agree with me , presuming they continued holding through today , rebalancing the entire time like any rational investor would . And during those big market swings , rebalancing involved selling appreciated bonds and buying stocks at a discount . Theyve done quite well , unlike the fools attempting to time black swan events like 2008 . <p> Spot on again . Do you think the " savers " need the " spenders " and the " non-market timers " need the " market-timers/heavy traders " ? <p> We are staying the course with a simple and strategic set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used to keep our Asset Allocation as close as possible to our AA . I know if we have steep drops we might fall a few % off , but so far it has worked . Big changes will require a " real " re-balance . <p> Wade , thanks friend . In some sense , I do agree with the thought that " efficiency " requires " inefficiency " in the economy , but I 'm not sure to what degree . I think it varies depending on the topic at hand . I , too , like that strategy of buying the under-performing asset class each month , although its a little more hands on and time consuming , would n't you say ? But if you 're talking about a taxable account , the reduction in realized gains/lossed ( hopefully mostly gains ) probably justifies the work . What do you think ? <p> If the buy and hold strategy is the best ( which I truly believe it is ) , then finding a good company ( I prefer industry ) and sticking with it is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance , not whether they are under-performing or over-performing at the time of purchase . <p> After all , what 's the difference between classifying something as under-performing and timing the market ? <p> Take a look at a mutual fund or ETF . Look at its historical returns and ask yourself , " Would this have been a good investment ? Does this industry look like its on the right path ? " and then make your decision . Now , every year when you evaluate your investments , instead of looking at how it did in the past month or year , look at the same historical data . Ask yourself again , " If I had money to do it over , would I invest in this again ? " <p> The answer to that question alone let 's you know whether to sell or buy . <p> Many things I could say here . 1 ) There is a reason why every prospectus in the industry bolds the following text : " Past performance is no guarantee/indication of future results . " 2 ) Holding a specific company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is not rewarded by the market . 3 ) The choice to participate in any market should not be dependent on the current performance of the investment . Stocks and bonds should always be a long-term play . And I never indicated that you should buy something because of its current performance ( just the opposite in fact ) . 4 ) Taking a look at any asset and asking myself those questions will not solve anything because market participants like you and I have no secret information that gives us the edge over the aggregate market as a whole . That 's just a guessing game , as I addressed in my article on stock picking . 5 ) In general , investors should side with decades of research and data on these issues . The research clearly shows that its nearly impossible for the average investor to predict future asset returns .

Borrowers at various income levels can purchase a sensible home for their situation and generally , over time , the home 's value appreciates and provides the homeowner with equity .

@@44824083 @4824083/ <h> The Most Important Financial Decision of Your Life <p> It 's time to talk about big financial decisions . Are you sweating yet ? <p> Are we here to talk about : <p> Buying a home ? No . <p> Starting a savings account ? No . <p> Investing for retirement ? Wrong again . <p> The single most important financial decision you 'll ever make is your spouse . <p> The reason this is more important than every other decision you 'll make is because their opinion matters . They have sway over every financial decision you 'll make . You are also affected by the financial faux pas they make and the successes they have . <p> I 'm not just talking about their potential for earning money . I 'm talking about how they view money . How they spend , save , splurge , and hoard their money . Do they invest ? Will you want to invest in the same things as them ? Do they have a spending problem ? Will they agree with your views on money and agree to abide by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . Money issues in a marriage are among the worst that couples fight over . Marriages exist where one spouse is a spender , and the other is a saver . This causes high amounts of stress and anxiety on both sides . <p> Marriages also exist in which both partners are on the same page . Sometimes you have two spenders who are in debt up to their hairlines , but still spending it as fast as they can . Then you 'll also find the couples who both have a passion for frugality and prudence . You want to find someone who is like minded , and someone that will encourage you to be savvy and responsible . <p> I can say that I have a marriage in which we both share the same views on money . Jacob is the most frugal person I have ever met . He is exceptionally good at saving money . I started off pretty frugal , learned some hard lessons along the way , and am now on the exact same page as him concerning money . <p> A reader , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a couple . I thought this was a great question ! So , if you are looking for a spouse or are evaluating whether your current other half is long term material , we hope this helps you sort it out ! If you are married to a spender and you are a saver , we hope this helps you win them to your way of thinking ! <p> Most every decision you make in life has to do with money . I 'm serious . Just think about it . Everything you do costs money . Even staying at home for the evening costs you money in electric , gas , and water costs . Therefore , before Jacob and I do anything , we consider the cost . We rarely just go out and about on a whim without thinking what errands we can run along the way and evaluating if the gas money is worth the trip . <p> The most integral aspect of buying anything is RESEARCH . A lot of research goes into buying anything from a camera to a mobile home to weekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did research individually , and then more when we were together . Before we bought our mobile home , Jacob spent hours upon hours reading about the costs of owning a mobile home versus renting . <p> Before Purchasing Anything , We : <p> See if we can get it free on Freecycle . <p> Consider if there is a good chance of finding the item at a thrift store or garage sale for a reduced price before buying retail . <p> Check if we can find it used on Craigslist . <p> Check if we can find it cheaper at Walmart or Amazon- before proceeding with a purchase . <p> We have already explained our processes of - how to save money on groceries , cable , and cell phones . We are in agreement on what items we need and do n't  need ( except for dark chocolate . I think its a need , he says its a wantwhatever. ) - Most of our money decisions are fairly easy because we have the same mentality , which is : Find it for free or really cheap and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our mentalities align with one another , our finances are a source of excitement as we work toward the future . For this reason , I think that it is vitally important to choose a spouse that is going to partner with you in building a solid financial future together . If you have any doubts about how finances will affect your marriage , read Frugal Marriage Tips an investigation into the relationship between happiness , marriage , and debt . <p> If you 're not married and looking for a life partner , do n't put this issue on the back burner . And if you are already married and money is a sore spot in your marriage , you should work to fix the issue . Have open discussions about how to allocate your money and find agreements regarding- how to spend , save , and invest money . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Janet Little <p> I would love to hear the mobile home vs. the renting research and information that you found . I think that would be especially interesting , coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I totally agree ! I am in a good marriage , where my wife and I both work , but she makes considerably more than I do . She is a spender and I am more frugal , so we have different checking accounts . We have agreed upon bills that each of us pay each month and therefore rarely disagree about money . Even though she spends , she still realizes the value of money and saves for the future pretty well though . <p> I could n't agree more . Who you marry can change how you save and spend money pretty radically . Luckily for me , I married someone who can save money . Admittedly I save better than she does , but we do make a good match . <p> There 's a couple I know who recently got married . Neither of them are good savers ; they both spend money faster than they earn it . So when they got together their bad habits just accelerated . Now they 're up to their necks in debt . <p> Luckily , I 've got my guy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in both of our families growing up , so I 'm surprised we did n't  talk about it much at all . Neither of us are or have ever been " big spenders , " but there are several big and small purchases we could have done without . <p> I think being on the same page is essential . If someone is considering marriage or a long-term relationship , I would bring up the topic of money right now ! <p> My wifey and I learn the hard way that we are completely different when it comes to money . I have to agree that who you marry and their habits are a very important financial decision . We had it rough the first couple of years because we are just polar opposites . I save and save some more and she is a spender . Our childhood backgrounds are different which only complicated things even more . I came up having little and being thankful for what we got and as she would put it she never wanted for anything . We should have had money and credit talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should have learn about this before we said I do but we did n't  and boy did it cost us . There are somethings you just have to get ironed out before the trouble starts and finances is one of them . We sat down like grownups figured out were we wanted to go in life and put a plan to work for us together . I found that simply allow us to both have extra cash that could be spent on whatever made it easier for my wifey to stick to my frugal/cheap/saving ways . And she helps me loosen up so that life is fun and not always about tomorrow but living a little for today . <p> Couldnt agree more on this one . I 'm incredibly lucky to have such a financially responsible wife . It removes so much potential stress when you and your spouse are on the same page and you can trust that your financial decision-making is aligned . I do think that you can have different mentalities , but in any case you need a system in place that helps you work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think its necessary . <p> While I 'm not married , I agree 100% . It is so important to have open communication , especially around money and goals . It is n't always the easiest conversation to initiate when dating you do n't  want to come across as the girl who needs to make sure you earn enough and drive the right kind of car but we do make money decisions every day . And if were miles apart on our views , we either have to find a way to bridge the gap or go on our merry way . Sometimes when you 're just dating it does n't  seem like that big of deal , but Ive seen disenchantment rear its ugly head later . <p> Chocolate of all types is always a need . That being said , I 'm extremely lucky to have a financially conscious spouse ! N has always been very thoughtful about his spending and lending , and has consistently paid off any loan he had before the due date . He even managed to get his job to pay 90% of his college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked up over my student loan debt and are willing to cut spending to make sure we pay the loans off ASAP . <p> You both are very lucky to have someone financially compatible ! Its hard today to find someone who is n't trying to keep up with the Joneses . <p> You know . That 's what I told him . Chocolate is a need . Mind if I use you as support for my argument ? = ) In all seriousness though , its so encouraging to hear about couples that work together on their finances . <p> I could n't agree morefinances are the number 1 issues in conflicts between married couples . It definitely is important to be financially compatible . If one spouse is frugal and the other is a spendthrift , there will ultimately be a lot of conflict . My wife and I are on the same page so it makes dealing with financial issues much easier . <p> That 's great ! I wish there was some way to reach out to the younger crowd and let them in on the whole finance issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heartache that comes from debt within a marriage . <p> Financial compatibility is key for sure . My wife and I run everything by each other and have a similar look on the big picture . We may quibble a bit with smaller items , but overall , we stick to our goals very well . <p> I like the rundown of how you look for items before making a purchase . <p> I like your comment about efficiency . I had n't  even thought about that- but its true ! It is so much more efficient because you do n't  have to jump through all the hoops to arrive at a financial decision because you 're already on the same page . Great point ! <p> I completely agree with you that a spouse is the most important financial decision you 'll ever make . Fortunately for me , my wife and I have very similar views on money and our financial goals align . I completely understand why money is the #1 cause of divorce . Even though my wife and I agree on 99.9% of financial decisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I cant even imagine what it would be like if we did n't  agree as often as we do . <p> Haha , I saw your title and I thought " I hope they 're not talking about home-buying because who you marry is way more important ! " I 'd say that my husband and I are very similar in HOW we want to handle money , but we differ somewhat on what we want our discretionary spending to be on . Even though we agree about 95% of what to do with our money , we still have conflict over that last 5% ! I cant imagine being married to someone with whom I only agreed 50% of the time I think that we just would n't be very close or connected because of being so misaligned on that huge aspect of life . <p> Vanessa ! What a fine point this is ! We both entered our marriage more like you than Jacob , but have learned together over our 16+ years , usually the hard way . But we both have a willingness to learn from those mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our marriage is a great resource in this department because we do not use our energies to fight each other , we combine them for a greater impact and better results . <p> Love this . " we do not use our energies to fight each other , we combine them for a greater impact and better results . " If only more people could figure out what you two do so beautifully . If only , if only . <p> Keren , my wife and I are the same way she 's the habitual spender , I 'm the habitual saver . Although that can cause some stress , I think you can also reach a point of equilibrium . I help my wife think carefully about our purchases ; she reminds me to live in the now and still have fun while were working towards a better financial future . It balances out in the end . <p> Open communication is key to that . I have to be honest with her when I think she 's spending too much , and she has to be honest with me when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about those things , the more comfortable you get with talking about them and the less likely anyones feelings get hurt . <p> I think about this sometimes when i 'm looking at online dating profiles . Anyone who 's a born spender with a lot if debt is crossed off the list . I just would n't be happy with someone like that . But on the other hand , if I had a spouse who was into early financial independence with me , we could do great things ! <p> Naturally its great when a couples values and actions align . And I 'm thankful my bf and I are the same moderates with great incomes and a future focused plan . Were not uber frugal but if either of were it might be too extreme . <p> However , my parents , one is a spender and one is a banker ( ie conservative ) . They even each other out one guides the other to " tighten the belt " in lean times and the other helps enjoy the moment , without always focusing on money . They both give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoy holidays regularly and work normal hours <p> I totally agree that your partner needs to share similar views . I have had relationships in the past that were horrible influences on my finances , and I am so glad I have finally found such a positive influence , and I have actually changed from a spender to a saver and investor . <p> Relationships can be the downfall of someones finances ! I read an article written by a GIRL advising guys to dump their girlfriends if they were costing them too much money . Kinda harsh , but I see their point ! 
@@44824084 @4824084/ <h> Different Types of Life Insurance Policies <p> Who Should Consider Life Insurance ? <p> If you have financial dependents , including a spouse who does not work or parents who rely on your support , you should have a life insurance policy . In addition to income replacement , life insurance offers the benefit of paying off outstanding debts and liabilities , including your mortgage , car loans , education costs and even funeral expenses . <p> However , life insurance needs change over time and a policy that was adequate at the time of purchase may offer more or less coverage than needed as an individuals income and family obligations change over time . For this reason , among others , financial advisors and estate planners normally recommend consumers buy term life insurance " a pure type of insurance with cheap premiums . We will explore the different characteristics of term and whole life insurance to demonstrate why term is better for most situations . <p> What Is Term Life Insurance ? <p> As a rule , term life insurance policies are for a specified amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 30 years . Because premiums are based on the age of the insured over the entire term of the policy , life insurance with shorter periods have significantly cheaper rates . This is because , over a longer period of time , there is more statistical variance and risk that the company may have to payout on a claim . <p> Term life insurance is also the most affordable kind , but the policyholder receives no return on his or her premiums . For instance , term is considered pure life insurance because there is no savings or investment component similar to permanent policies . <p> At the end of the period , term life policies expire and must be renewed for coverage to continue , usually at much higher rates . Other notable characteristics are that premiums are normally fixed for the life of the policy . <p> What Is Whole Life Insurance ? <p> Unlike term life insurance , whole life insurance coverage is permanent " as long as the premiums are paid , the policy never has to be renewed . Because whole life offers lifetime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , premiums are significantly higher . Generally , whole life is 5 to 10 times more expensive than term life . <p> Whole life policies also have a cash value feature which accrues over time . A portion of whole life premiums are diverted to an account , where the insurance company pays a guaranteed interest rate on the funds or distributes a dividend . The cash value can be used as collateral for low-interest loans or can be withdrawn if the policyholder decides to cancel the policy . The cash value may be used for other expenses such as your children 's college tuition , a down payment for a home , or a business loan . <p> When Buying Term , How Long Should I Buy Coverage For ? <p> Before deciding on the term of the policy , individuals need to consider their continuing need for life insurance by evaluating their personal and financial situation and comparing the pros and cons of different term life insurance plans . <p> 10 Year Term <p> 10 year term life insurance may be appropriate for someone who has children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life insurance should provide benefits to support the family until the youngest child completes college or their education . When getting term life insurance comparisons at sites like **28;121;TOOLONG , consumers can add 10 years to their current age to get an approximate term life insurance quote for the rate of a renewal policy when the current policy expires . However , this assumes your current state of health persists for the next decade and you do n't develop any medical conditions . For this reason , 20 or 30 year term policies are much more common . <p> 20 Year Term <p> While the premiums for a 20 year term are slightly higher than those of a 10 or 15 year term , the policy will not expire before the children are financially independent . A 20 year period gives you ample coverage when you are young and healthy , when rates are the cheapest , and will help you avoid expensive renewal costs . <p> 25 Year Term <p> 25 year term life insurance is ideal for young adults who have completed their education and have just begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes beginning a family , purchasing a home , and maybe buying a business . If a couple plans to delay having children for more than five years , individuals should consider a 25 year term life policy with a guaranteed renewal clause . These policies may be more expensive yet still affordable , but even if an insured develops a medical condition , the company will be obligated to renew the policy . <p> 30 Year Term <p> For most people with families looking for life insurance in their 20s or early 30s , a 30 year term will cover the critical period when children are financially dependent on parents . If purchased between early , a 30 year policy will cover you almost to retirement , when coverage needs will wane and you can let the policy expire . <p> There are many different types of term policies available . From renewal to convertible or survivorship to return of premium , term plans are very customizable to your specific needs . For instance , adjustable life insurance allows policyholders to alter the death benefit of the policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a permanent whole life policy at a later date . <p> Customizing Term Life Insurance Policies <p> There are a number of options offered which can customize a term life insurance policy to meet the needs of individuals . Seniors may wish to consider the accelerated death benefits option which may pay benefits before the person dies to cover the expenses of a terminal illness . Younger consumers may want to add the accidental death benefit rider . An instant online comparison is free and can help consumers decide which extra features they want and can afford on their policies . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Glad to see another solid post about why term life insurance is so valuable and when you should get it . I also think it is important for whole life insurance to be explained so that people can understand why they should avoid it , it is an inferior financial product . <p> What I love about your blogs is that you cover every aspect of personal finances right from simple topics like being frugal , saving on groceries , cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bonds , funds etc ) to life insurance etc . Personal finance is a package with all these things . Keep it up ! . Will keep returning to read . Thanks . <p> I have life insurance through my work ( about 1.5x my salary ) but when we have kids , we are going to get a 30 year term policy . Its long and not for everyone , but I had a friend in high school who lost her father at a young age and his health insurance ensured she was able to go to college w/o debt . <p> I know I am old school , but I ca n't figure out why anyone besides the very wealthy ( using a tax work around ) would go for a whole life policy . I do know why companies push them and variable annuities though.huge fees . -Bryan <p> Bryan , you are definitely right about that one . Most ethical financial advisers and experts simply recommend buying term life insurance and saving the difference in premiums to invest in index funds . After all , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unethical ones push you towards whole life insurance to earn huge commissions , just like you stated . <p> I have Term Life through work and its enough to cover everything if I happened to die . I think it is kind of scammy when companies push whole life insurance as an investment because the returns are pretty poor . Just get life insurance if you have dependents you want to take care of no matter what and find other higher returning investments if you are looking to earn returns . 
@@44824089 @4824089/ <h> What Type of Investment Account Should You Choose ? <p> If you 're new to investing , one of the first decisions that you must make is determining which type of investment account to open and fund . <p> To help you get started , this post will- provide a basic outline of the various investment accounts that are available to you , including individual retirement accounts , employer sponsored retirement accounts , and taxable brokerage accounts . Each type of investment account varies with regard to- ownership requirements , tax treatment , contribution limits , and unique advantages . <h> Individual Retirement- Accounts ( IRAs ) <p> Individual retirement accounts , - often called IRAs , are extremely popular among investors. - An IRA must be owned by one individual , and there are specific guidelines provided by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) that must be followed when establishing an IRA . <p> For 2016 and 2017 , the maximum amount of money that you can contribute is $5,500 across all IRA accounts , or $6,500 if you 're age 50 or older . You can split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not exceed the maximum contribution limit . <p> Contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline in April each year . For example , you can make a 2016 IRA contribution any time before April 18th , 2017 ( the 2016 tax filing deadline ) . <p> There are two different IRA account options- that you can choose to fund . <h> Traditional IRA <p> With the- Traditional IRA , contributions are usually tax deductible ( see below ) and future withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income . <p> You must have earned income ( salary , wages , commissions , self-employment income , alimony , or combat pay ) and be younger than 70-+ years of age to fund a- Traditional IRA . <p> If you ( or your spouse ) participate in a qualified , employer sponsored retirement plan , contributions are tax deductible only if your income remains below the IRS threshold . <p> You- can not withdraw money from your Traditional- IRA until age- 59-+ . If initiated- before then , any withdrawal is subject to a 10% penalty- in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must begin taking required minimum distributions from each Traditional- IRA that you own. - When the money is- withdrawn , the entire withdrawal is- taxed as- ordinary income . The tax rate depends on your taxable income at the time of withdrawal . <h> Roth IRA <p> Roth IRA accounts are funded with after-tax dollars. - There are no tax breaks for contributions made to a Roth account . <p> However , all earnings inside of a Roth- account grow completely tax free , and qualified withdrawals are completely tax free . <p> Like the Traditional IRA , you must have earned income to fund a Roth IRA . However , there are no age restrictions when making contributions . <p> While Traditional IRA contributions are limited by the availability of employer sponsored retirement plans , Roth IRA contributions are limited by your modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) . <p> Like the Traditional IRA , Roth IRAs are subject to the same 10% penalty for withdrawals made before age- 59-+ years old . However , there is an exception to this rule . All of your initial contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> For example , let 's assume that you contribute $5,000 this year to a Roth IRA and the account balance grows to $8,000 over the next five years . You can withdraw any portion of the initial $5,000 contribution , at any time , without penalty . But you can not withdraw any portion of the $3,000 earnings growth . A- withdrawal of any earnings before the age of 59-+ will be subject to the 10% penalty . <p> There is another important rule that you must understand . The- Roth IRA requires that your first contribution be made at least five years before you withdraw any earnings , regardless of your age when the account is opened . For example , if you open a Roth IRA and make your first contribution at age 58 , you must wait until age 63 to withdraw any earnings- from the account . If you violate this rule , the IRS deems the withdrawal a " non-qualified distribution , " where all earnings are subject to taxation and the 10% penalty . <p> As an added benefit , Roth IRAs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Which IRA Should You Choose ? <p> You are allowed to contribute to either IRA account type each year , and you can split your annual contribution between both accounts . <p> Under the IRS rules , the Traditional IRA provides- additional- tax savings for individuals in a higher tax bracket , while the Roth IRA provide the largest benefit for- individuals in a low tax bracket . <h> Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans <p> Many employers offer retirement accounts- to their employees , such as- the 401(k) and 403(b). - These plans offer- tax benefits that similar to the- IRAs , making them a great investment choice- if you are looking to invest more than the IRA limit . For 2017 , The maximum employee contribution is $18,000 , or $24,000 for those- age 50+ . Employer contributions do not count toward this limit . <p> One downside is that employers often- impose a waiting period before an employee becomes eligible to participate in the plan . These waiting periods range from a few months to over a year . These restrictions are put in place to incentivize employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , employers often include a matching contribution for employees who contribute to the retirement plan . For example , your company might offer a 3% match on your 401(k) contributions . If you contribute 3% of your paycheck , the employer also contributes an additional 3% on your behalf . That means you can double your retirement contribution using " free " money offered by your employer . <p> For employers that do offer matching , there is usually a vesting period involved . That means that you must work at the company for a certain period of time before the matching contributions are legally yours . In most situations , if you leave the company before the vesting period is up , you will lose some or all of your employer 's contributions . You are always entitled to your own contributions by law. - You should check with your employer about the specific vesting schedule in your plan . <p> Much like the- IRA accounts , many employers offer a choice between Traditional and Roth retirement accounts . <h> Traditional 401(k) and 403(b) <p> The most common employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans operate similarly , where an employee can contribute a portion of earned income- into the plan , up to $18,000 in 2017 , ( $24,000 for those- age 50+ ) . Your employer chooses the available- investment options in the plan ( frequently mutual funds ) , and- you decide how to invest your contributions . <p> When compared to the Traditional IRA , these retirement plans have a major advantage . The funding limits are much higher ( $18,000 vs $5,500 ) and there are no income limitations preventing participation . Regardless of your income , you can participate if your employer sponsors a plan . <p> These employer sponsored plans have the same tax implications as the Traditional IRA . Contributions are generally made through payroll deferrals ( you choose how much to contribute as a percentage of your overall income ) . Contributions reduce your taxable income for the year and all investment earnings grow tax-deferred . <p> Future withdrawals are fully taxed as ordinary income. - You may begin withdrawing money at age- 59-+ , and early withdrawals are subject to the same 10% penalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributions once you reach age 70-+ . <h> Roth 401(k) and 403(b) <p> The Roth versions of the employer sponsored plans operate similarly to the Roth IRA . Contributions are not tax deductible , but all earnings grow completely tax free , and qualified withdrawals are completely tax free . <p> Compared to the Roth IRA , the benefits include a much higher funding limit ( $18,000 vs $5,500 ) and no income limitations preventing participation. - The major disadvantage is that Roth 401(k) and 403(b) accounts are subject to required minimum distributions once you reach age 70-+ . <p> Important Notes <p> Much like the decision between Traditional and Roth IRA , you must decide how to split your contributions between these employer sponsored accounts. - The maximum you can defer between both Traditional and Roth accounts is $18,000 ( $24,000 for those- age 50+ ) in 2017 . <p> The most important consideration is your employers matching program . Make sure to contribute to whichever account will receive a match , then decide how to handle the remaining contributions after that using my guide- ( Note the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are funding an IRA or an employer sponsored plan ) . <h> Taxable Brokerage Accounts <p> A- taxable brokerage account is an investment account funded with after-tax dollars . These accounts operate like a regular savings account , but allow you to own and trade financial assets including stocks , bonds , and diversified funds . <p> A brokerage account can be opened individually , or jointly with another individual . These accounts are free of the restrictions and rules that govern IRAs and employer sponsored plans . Anyone of legal age ( usually 18 ) can open and fund a brokerage account , and there no contribution limits and no restrictions on when you- can make withdrawals . <p> Unlike IRAs or employer sponsored plans , these accounts offer no tax benefits. - Any interest or dividends that you earn in a taxable account are subject to taxation in the year received . Additionally , there are tax consequences when you trade- an investment . When you sell an investment for more than the purchase price , this is referred to as a capital gain , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital loss . <p> The tax treatment depends on the holding period . If you sell an investment after holding it for 365 days or less , you have a short-term- capital gain or loss . If you sell the investment after holding it for 366 days or longer , that is considered a long-term transaction . <p> Short-term- capital gains are treated as ordinary income , while long-term capital gains are taxed a preferential lower rate . For that reason , it 's better to hold investments for longer than a year . If you sell any investments at a loss , you can use the capital loss to reduce any capital gains , offsetting some of the taxes . <h> How to Choose an Investment Account <p> I 've covered several different types of investment accounts in this article . If you need a primer to help you decide between the accounts , consider these tips : <p> 1 ) Always Take the Employer Match <p> Your first consideration is- your employers matching program . If you have access to a retirement plan at work , and your employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to receive the maximum possible match . That is free money , and you cant beat free . <p> 2 ) Consider the- IRA <p> After contributing enough to receive your employers match , consider opening an IRA if you are eligible . <p> IRAs allow you to establish the account at a provider of your choosing , which means you have complete control over the investments held in the account . With employer sponsored plans , you are limited by the number of investment options provided by your employer . <p> 3 ) Back to the Employer Sponsored Plan <p> If you are ineligible to contribute to an IRA , or if you have funded the maximum amount allowed by the IRS , your employer sponsored plan is the only remaining tax shelter . <p> You can contribute up to the IRS defined limit each year , splitting your contributions between Traditional and Roth ( depending on your tax preferences and plan availability ) . <p> 4 ) Open a Taxable Brokerage Account <p> Once you have exhausted the tax sheltered accounts , you can continue investing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 've always heard you should go with a Traditional IRA/401K if you plan to have a lower income when you retire so you 're in a lower tax bracket . Then a Roth IRA/401K if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket when you retire . <p> That 's always the general advice I 've heard , but this is a Nice Breakdown . Andrew 
@@44824091 @4824091/ <h> Roth IRA vs . Traditional IRA : The Complete Guide for Wise Investors <p> As many long-time readers know , I 've always been a saver . After earning my first paycheck , I opened up an- IRA . <p> When setting up my first IRA , I began reading about retirement planning- and realized that I had to decide between the Roth IRA and- the Traditional IRA . <p> Having earned less than $10,000 that year , the decision was simple . I simply stuffed as much as possible into the Roth IRA , because- most of my income was taxed at 0% . <p> As I continued learning about this topic , I realized that many media sources recommend the Roth IRA . While the Roth can be an excellent choice , this article will provide a balanced look at both accounts to help you make a more informed decision . <h> What is- a Roth IRA ? <p> Roth IRA accounts are funded with after-tax dollars. - There are no tax breaks for contributions made to a Roth account . <p> However , all earnings inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified withdrawals are completely tax free . <p> As a result , Roth IRA accounts provide the largest benefit for- individuals in a low tax bracket . <h> What is- a- Traditional IRA ? <p> With the- Traditional IRA , contributions are tax deductible in the current year and future withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income . <p> As earned income rises , the Traditional IRA provides additional tax savings. - For example : <p> A couple in the 15% marginal tax bracket contributes a total of $10,000 to a Traditional IRA . They save $1,500 ( $10,000*0.15 ) in taxes . <p> When the $10,000 mentioned above is withdrawn from a Traditional IRA at retirement , - the entire withdrawal is- taxed as- ordinary income . The tax rate depends on your taxable income at the time of withdrawal . <h> Which IRA is Optimal ? <p> Conventional wisdom tells us that the- decision- between Roth and Traditional ( true for both- IRA and 401k contributions ) is based primarily on the following question : <p> Do you expect to be in a higher tax bracket now or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is higher in the year of contribution , the Traditional IRA wins . <p> If your marginal tax rate is higher in the year of distribution ( withdrawal ) , the Roth IRA wins . <p> If you marginal tax rate stays the same , you will have the same amount of money in the Roth and Traditional IRA accounts . <p> But the devil is in the details , and the bullet points above are a bit- simplistic for real world application . <p> In America , we have a progressive income tax structure . As you earn more , your marginal tax rate increases . <p> Someone in the 15% marginal tax bracket does not pay 15% taxes on all income earned . Some is taxed at 0% courtesy of the standard deduction and personal- exemption allowances . Some is taxed at the 10% rate , and the remaining portion is taxed at the 15% marginal rate . The resulting effective tax rate is therefore much lower than the marginal tax rate . <p> For Example : <p> Consider a couple ( age 30 ) with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax rates , we get the following results : <p> As you can see , - this couples- effective tax rate is 6.9% ( $3,468/$50,000 ) and their- marginal tax rate is 15.0% . <p> The important thing to understand is that all Traditional IRA contributions are made at your marginal tax rate . If this couple contributes $5,000 each ( $10,000 total ) to their respective Traditional IRAs , we get the following results : - You can see that their tax liability has shrunk by $1,500 exactly , which is equal to their contribution amount multiplied by their marginal tax bracket ( $10,000*0.15 = $1,500 ) . <p> If this couple had opted to contribute the same $10,000 to Roth accounts , they must pay taxes on that money at- the marginal rate of 15% . As a result , they would pay $1,500 in taxes- ( $10,000*0.15 ) and have $8,500 available to invest . The $8,500 would never be taxed again once inside a Roth IRA . <p> They are now both age 65 and ready to retire . Let 's look at their account balances for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can see that I have hidden some of the rows for the sake of space . The assumptions include : <p> 35 years of contributions <p> 7.5% annual rate of return <p> 3% annual withdrawal rate <p> All tax laws and tax brackets remain constant . <p> Tax laws will most likely change , but I cant predict the future . <p> As expected , the Traditional IRA has a larger ending balance because the funds inside have never been taxed . The money will be taxed as ordinary income upon withdrawal . The Roth IRA account houses after-tax dollars which will be withdrawn tax free . <p> Many commentators- say that if your marginal tax rate is the same now and in retirement , it wont matter whether you contribute to the Roth or Traditional IRA . The ending result- should be the same . <p> Look at the after-tax withdrawal amount . The answer is clearly no the Traditional IRA results in nearly $4,000 of additional after-tax income each year . <p> How- Does the Traditional IRA Win ? <p> In the example above , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In this example , - Traditional IRA contributions are made at the marginal tax rate ( 15% ) , while withdrawals are taxed at the effective tax rate . This couple has- no other sources of retirement income , so the Traditional IRA withdrawals are taxed- at a 0% marginal tax rate first , followed by the 10% marginal rate , and so on . <p> On the other hand , Roth contributions are always taxed at the- marginal tax rate in the year contributed- ( 15% in our example ) . Withdrawals are always tax free . <p> The elephant in the room is my final assumption this couple has no other sources of retirement income . <p> This assumption is highly unlikely . Any additional income streams will result in the Traditional IRA withdrawals being taxed at a higher marginal tax rate , making the Roth more attractive . <p> I 'm not arguing that you should favor either account type , only that you should- think about it . <p> This simple analysis shows that Roth is n't always the right choice . You should n't listen to anyone- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always contribute to a Roth IRA if you have a marginal tax rate of 25% or less . " <h> Other Important Considerations <p> Thus far , we have considered one factor the expected after-tax value of the account . <p> There are numerous other features unique to each account type that I would like to highlight . <p> While this makes the decision even more difficult , these unique differences are important in determining which account is right for you . <p> Reasons to Choose the Roth IRA <p> Shelter more money this year- ( behavioral benefit ) If you understand the- example above , you might realize that its possible to save more for retirement by contributing the maximum amount to- the Roth account each year . Instead of contributing $8,500 , the couple in the example could have potentially contributed the full $10,000 to the Roth IRA . <p> For simplicity , let 's now assume that the couple is in the- 10% marginal tax bracket throughout life ( for all contributions and distributions ) , the tax advantages are the same for both accounts . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the couple funds $5,500 in the Traditional IRA , that money is only worth $4,950 after taxes are paid at withdrawal ( $5,500 x 0.9 = $4,950 ) . <p> If instead , they pay the 10% in- taxes upfront and still have enough cash flow to max out the Roth IRA , they are able to effectively save more money . The after-tax $5,500 contributed to a- Roth IRA is worth $6,110 pre-tax dollars in the Traditional IRA ( $6,110 x 0.9 = $5,500 ) . <p> This is an important point that most people do n't  consider when deciding year end contributions . Many think , " I have $5,500 to invest , where should it go ? " In reality , those funds are- after-tax dollars sitting in a bank account , and $5,500 in a Roth IRA will always be worth more than $5,500 in a Traditional IRA . <p> Technically speaking , this example is flawed . If you decide to fund the Traditional IRA with $5,500 and you 're in the 10% tax bracket , your tax savings are $550 in the current year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account to grow , but- very few people will save that money . In other words , the Roth provides a clear behavioral advantage by allowing you to save more after-tax money each year . <p> No required minimum distributions ( RMDs ) - Tax deferred accounts , including Traditional IRAs and 401k plans , are funded with pre-tax dollars . The government has never taxed the funds in these accounts . As such , they require that you take distributions from the accounts beginning at age 70- -+ . In doing so , they force you to pay income tax on that money . <p> Roth IRAs are different altogether . All contributions are made with after-tax dollars . Youve already paid income tax on the money inside the Roth . All growth is tax-free , and distributions are tax-free . Therefore , there are no required minimum distributions . This can provide a very attractive method of passing wealth to heirs . <p> Higher income contribution limits If you participate in a qualified , employer sponsored retirement plan ( such as a 401k ) , there are restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are only tax deductible if your income remains below the IRS threshold . The threshold for Roth IRA contributions- is roughly twice that of Traditional , meaning higher income earners can contribute more easily to the Roth IRA . <p> Roth distributions are tax-free . They are not included in the MAGI calculation . Because of this , you can structure withdrawals from Traditional and Roth accounts to minimize Social Security taxation . <p> Qualify for a healthcare subsidy The Obamacare subsidy is based on MAGI . Traditional IRA distributions increase your MAGI and might shrink the level of subsidy that you are eligible to receive . By using Roth distributions instead , you can better control your MAGI and the subsidy amount . <p> Contributions at any age Any person can open and fund a Roth IRA , regardless of age . You can not fund a Traditional IRA account after age 70- -+ . <p> Avoid state income tax - If you live in a state that currently has no state income tax , Roth contributions become more attractive . This is particularly true if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income tax during your retirement years . The Roth contributions have already been taxed and will not be taxable at the state or federal level when withdrawn . <p> Tax guarantee In my example above I showed that Roth contributions are taxed at the marginal tax rate in the year contributed , and all qualified withdrawals are tax free . If you are fearful of future tax laws , the Roth allows you to " lock in " your current marginal tax rate . <p> Flexibility- An investor can withdraw his or her contributions to a Roth IRA at any time without tax or penalty . This is why Roth accounts are sometimes used as an emergency fund . <p> Reasons to Choose the Traditional IRA <p> Reduce investment income taxation Investment income ( qualified dividends and long-term capital gains ) are taxed at preferential rates . Individuals in the 15% federal income tax bracket or lower do not pay any federal income tax on qualified dividends and long-term capital gains . <p> Using Traditional IRA ( and 401k ) contributions , individuals can lower their federal tax bracket in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is important for those individuals who have lots of realized investment gains , but little earned income . <p> Future Roth conversions Barring a few technical rules , you can convert Traditional IRA funds into Roth IRA funds at any time . The amount converted is taxed as ordinary income in the year converted . <p> There are may situations where a Roth conversion is- optimal . Consider a couple in the 15% Federal tax bracket and 6% State income tax bracket . If they choose Roth contributions , they lock in a- 21% tax rate . If they choose Traditional , they pay no taxes today . If this couple moves or has a major life event that decreases their earned income , they can pursue- Roth conversion at a- lower- tax rate . That 's more money for them , and less for Uncle Sam . <p> Avoid state income tax In our example above , - we only considered federal income tax . Most states also collect income tax . Traditional IRA contributions are not taxed at the federal or state level until withdrawn . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to a 6% state income tax . If you contribute to a Traditional IRA while working , and move to Texas or Florida before taking withdrawals ( no state income tax ) , you completely avoid all state income tax. - The opposite scenario ( moving from Texas to Missouri during retirement ) would favor the Roth IRA . <h> How About a Little Tax Diversification ? <p> The impossible part of this whole exercise is predicting future income and future tax rates . No one- knows where tax rates are headed in the next 10 , 20 , or 30 years . The whole tax code could be re-written . Furthermore , its difficult to- predict future income sources in retirement ( particularly true for young people ) . <p> Because of these facts , The decision between Roth and Traditional IRA involves a significant amount of guesswork . I cant give you a straightforward answer on the optimal solution for you , but here are a few rough guidelines : <p> While I do n't  have any strict guidelines for individuals in the 15-30% marginal tax bracket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider mixing things up over time . You could- split your contributions between both account- types in any given year . Or , fund one type of account each year and base the decision on your annual earned income . <p> The optimal outcome is a- diversified set of retirement accounts , including- tax-deferred accounts ( Traditional IRA , 401k , 403b , etc. ) , tax-free accounts ( Roth IRA , Roth 401k , etc. ) , and taxable accounts . Having different accounts will provide flexibility during retirement , allowing you to structure withdraws from each account to minimize your tax liability in any given year . <p> Have- you made the decision this year ? Did you fund a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By R <p> The question Ive been trying to muddle through gets hinted at here , but missed specifically : How does Obamacare subsidies affect the traditional vs roth ira choice ? <p> Past advice has always pointed towards Roth IRA for lower income investors , but traditional IRA contributions lower current taxable income and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect that might the most beneficial choice for some segment of the population <p> If you qualify for a traditional IRA that is deductible , hands down do the traditional IRA . <p> There is no way on Gods green Earth that 99% of people are going to have a higher tax rate in retirement , than they do when they are working . The nest egg required for such a feat is truly astronomical . if you are aspiring for early retirement , and are modestly disciplined in your spending your tax rate will ALWAYS go down in early retirement . Therefore , save taxes at higher rates , avoid tax phase outs of credits by reducing your adjusted gross income . <p> The next best investment are taxable investments . They are taxed at 0% in the cap gains and dividends if you are in the 15% tax bracket ( very easy to do with deferred retirement contributions ) and you can tax loss sell , to further reduce your taxable income and even carry forward this into future years . <p> Thanks . This is probably one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I searched around quite a bit . I am curious how much of this is true for the traditional 401K vs roth 401k comparison . Again , Thanks , <p> " Roth accounts are flexible " An investor can withdraw his or her contributions to a Roth IRA at any time without tax or penalty . This is why Roth accounts are sometimes used as an emergency fund . " That is why I just opened a Roth . My husbands 403b retirement should cover our needs at current funding . Were lucky to have good contributions from his employer too . But we will have kids in college from 2022-2031 . Although they may well be expected to shoulder a good chunk of the responsibility for their education , we want to help as we can . We can use the Roth funds later and it wont be counted the same way as their 529 accounts in financial aid calculations . Or , if they choose not to pursue college , the contributions stay accessible to us ( after 5 years ) and become emergency funds or give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a family of 4 on one income , including the child credits , our tax burden is pretty low right now . As a retired couple who probably will no longer have a mortgage and with no other dependents I think itll go higher . <p> There 's another possible reason an individual might lean toward a Traditional IRA . If you plan to retire overseas , then there are some potential tax effects . In particular , most countries tax worldwide income including investment income , and most countries tax codes do not consider U.S. tax-advantaged accounts such as Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s to be tax free when making a U.S. qualified withdrawal . There are a few countries that either do n't  tax investment income at all ( Singapore , UAE ) and a couple countries that have tax treaties with the U.S. that protect Roths , but that 's not most countries . However , with a Traditional IRA you pay U.S. income tax first , and that U.S. income tax is almost always allowable as a foreign tax credit when you file your retirement country tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why having a Traditional IRA may not be a good idea , though a Traditional 401(k) is fine . If you have the happy problem of earning " too much , " then you wont be able to make a deductible IRA contribution . However , there 's something called the " backdoor Roth IRA " that is allowed . You make a contribution to a nondeductible Traditional IRA , then you rollover that Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA . There 's no income limit to make a nondeductible IRA contribution , and there 's no income limit for the rollover . The only impediment is that if you already have a Traditional IRA then the tax on the rollover is pro-rated across all your Traditional IRA holdings , so you lose much of the tax deferral . But if you do n't  have a Traditional IRA then you do n't  have that potential tax problem . <p> Of course its hard to predict the future perfectly , though some people may be able to predict where they will retire much less what that countrys tax code will be like in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your advice about diversification is right on target , and that ( generally ) includes having some Traditional and some Roth . <p> Thanks Jacob . Appreciate your website and found this post very helpful . I 'm close to retirement and was concerned I may have contributed too much to my tax deferred account considering the impact of taxes and RMD . My current marginal tax rate is 30.5% thanks to the feds &amp; state of CT . So at face , it makes sense to fund the 403b with pretax dollars , but with nearly a million in this account I 'm considering cutting back on contributions for my remaining years of employment . I have also been funding a Roth for the past six years . When I look at the potential impact of taxes on my retirement income , that being pension , social security , and 403b I wonder what is the right balance between pre and after tax savings/investments . Perhaps there is no clear answer given the uncertainty of future tax code changes and overall investment performance . But your post gives a clear account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It should be helpfull to anyone considering saving for their retirement . Thanks again . <p> Joe , thanks for reading a leaving a thoughtful comment . I agree its difficult to decide on these issues , and the more complex the situation , the more difficult it becomes . I certainly agree there is some benefit to tax diversification , but at high tax brackets its just tough to favor anything other than pre-tax shelters . <p> Jacob great post . Definitely a chess game of finances . Its not all simply " do this if you think you 'll make more . " <p> For the final row of the chart though I after year 35 , when owner of Traditional IRA gets ready to take out his money . .. <p> In this example would it be right to say that 15 is the magic number ? If you plan on being under 15% tax bracket = Use the Traditional . If you plan on being over 15% tax bracket = Go with the Roth . ( Again , estimating as best you can the tax rates 35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Excellent post ! I read your blog , and will admit that I almost did n't  read this post thinking it was just another " ROTH vs . Traditional " article . I must say that I was pleasantly surprised . You brought up a lot of points that I 've honestly never seen brought up in such a post before . Very thorough analysis , much better than Ive ever seen from a " financial advisor . " <p> The real wild card here is that the tax laws remain the same . That 's not a good bet long term . Roth withdrawals are tax free under current law , but so were social security payments at one time . I have two major reservations re the Roth . One is that we do n't  have a major tax change , i.e , flat tax , fair tax , value added tax , etc . Second , like SS , the Roths may ultimately be subject to means testing making some of the withdrawals taxable . My advice is if your not in the 10% tax bracket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tax deduction with the traditional IRA instead of a not guaranteed promise of tax free income in the future with the Roth . <p> I do n't  think anyone is naive enough to believe that tax laws will remain constant for the next few decades . But we cant predict the future either , so a comparison under current tax laws is the best option . <p> For me , this has always been a factor too , though non-quantifiable : Everything else being equal , I prefer to get a known benefit today to an unknown benefit far in the future , even if that future benefit has the potential to be greater . Sort of a variation of the bird in the hand think I guess . <p> Excellent breakdown and analysis of Roth versus traditional IRA . The key here as you 've relayed is for people simply to save , which is a big problem today . I 'm a financial advisor with my insurance and mortgage licenses , and would love to hear your thoughts on using indexed universal life as a tax free retirement vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and willingness to stick to the plan .

I met all of the requirements a few months ago ( paid the annual fee and made $500 in purchases on the card ) and Ive yet to see the miles in my account . I 've waited the billing cycles that it says to wait and called many representatives , and they keep telling me to call someone else , much like Victoria stated above . I 'm holding out hope that my miles will appear before the holidays , but its not looking likely . I would NOT recommend this credit card and will be canceling mine as soon as my account has been figured out . <p> Its a horrible card because you have to jump through 100 hoops to get your miles . Every other airline card I 've had Southwest , Delta , American , Virgin Atlanticthe bonus miles and monthly miles automatically go to your flier account . With this , they wo n't transfer them you have to nag Frontier and Barclay to get them . Eventually I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to call non-stop to get miles Ill just go back to a different card . <p> The credit card ( Barclay ) and frontier will give you the run around when you try to redeem your miles We have accrued the 40,000 miles + miles from purchases and we went to redeem them , Barclay said it was Frontiers fault &amp; then calling Frontier they said its Barclays fault . Frontier agent three way called with my husband and Barclay and Barclay is putting the miles on non existent Frontier numbers and not telling Frontier . Frontier agent said itll take a month to get the miles creditedSaid hed expedite it to a week , but we have yet to see the miles in our Frontier account . we accrued the miles in December and had planned on using them for our trip in two weeks and it has been a disaster . Be leary and give yourself plenty of time to get your mileswe may have to pay out of pocket and now this card was a too good to be true deal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposited in your account after the requirements were met ? Was it right at the end of the first billing cycle ( if you did all the required actions in that first month ) ? <p> We received our points promptly within a few weeks but we have n't been able to use them as all the routes have been cancelled or they have blacked out the option to use miles on the routes that are open . They keep saying to try in a week or so . I am not holding my breath . We have been trying to use them for six months and cant . <p> I received my miles after my first statement and it says on my statement that they sent 40,000 miles plus 1511 miles I accrued buying stuff to frontier and so I called because it was n't showing up on frontiers website and they told me it takes 4 to 6 weeks to show up on frontier so now I 'm waiting 4 more weeks hoping there on the website . <p> How long did it take for the miles to show up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified purchases " and annual fee paid , did you see the 40,000 go in right at the end of the billing cycle ? Or have to wait months ? <p> I think this card compared to most is not communicated well . We signed up for our Frontier card in-flight after hearing the promotion . It was sold to us as " an in flight special " and once you signed up , and were approved you got 40,000 miles . Never once did they say you had to spend $500.00 first in order to get the 40,000 . That to me is not a " promotion . " We have a Spirit card and though the airline has black out dates , etc. the annual fee is $59.00 and we did n't  have to spend a certain amount to get the miles . As a matter of fact , if you buy a pack of gum , you get your promotion miles . I called Frontier to discuss this and the customer service was terrible . We will not be activating the card . <p> Hey Sarah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require $500 to be spent in order to get the miles , I know because I did it . You only have to make a single purchase so it could be a pack of gum or whatever . The standard offer the author of this blog is discussing does in fact require $500 to be spent and is different from the " in-flight " offer . <p> Just read where Frontier and Radisson have a cooperative program for using Frontier points for stays . I know the common philosophy is one does not use air miles for hotel stays but when one is n't in a strong Frontier city , its another option . ( hat tip to " Travel Is Free " ) <p> The other comment I want to make is the reluctance to obtain credit card(s) . I wish the idea that the pursuit of more enlightenment will not hurt and is out there as to how one can use credit carefully with management to benefit . You know , I watched old PBS documentaries on credit strategies employed before Dodd Frank . Although the bread crumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank " , it actually gives one a lot of insight as to how one can benefit beyond the idea that the bank is out to enslave consumers . <p> The individual fear seems to be linked to a lack of self control . Or that the bank is going to make one stumble . <p> I think self control with credit cards can be implemented just as wisely as comparing ones self control to not drinking too much . <p> hey Jacob , I and my husband want to travel from los angeles to new york/pennsylvania in august/sept this year .. can you guys please suggest best possible airline deals for us .. best **26;151;TOOLONG ? ? <p> Southwest , American , or sometimes United are good for domestic flights . Each have credit card offers that were near 50,000 to sign up .

Any advice ? <p> I got the Frontier card and 40,000 miles , hoping to travel to Costa Rica . I tried to go from Salt Lake to Costa Rica from May 2014 to present . As I tried to access flights on the Frontier site , I kept getting a no flights available message . Now it is February and my card renewal is April . The flights to Costa Rita from Salt Lake require a day layover in Denver . Flights to Cancun either state no frequent flyer seats available or on select days I may be able to get a flight for 50,000 miles . Surely a difference from what was told to us when convinced to get the card . What suggestions do you have , if my miles will no longer be available if I do n't  pay the yearly card fee of $130+- for the next year ?

The promotional materials promised two round-trip flights in the continental USwell , from my attempt to book today that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all east coast flights I attempted to book were available as 40,000 total milesNOT the 20,000 advertised .

If I lived in LA , I can book a flight to Florida for the advertised 20,000 round trip . These miles from Frontier are a bit of false advertising if you ask me ! <p> I want to apply for this card , but I 'm wondering if I cancel the card after I spend the $500 in 90 days and get my 40,000 miles , do I lose the miles ? I know on my Delta card that the miles I earned from their AmEx card stay in my Delta Skymiles account even after I cancel the card . Is that the same with Frontier or do I have to keep the card open if I want to keep my miles ? <p> Any cards that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bonuses tied to the actual credit card . Since Frontier is issuing this card and the rewards , I believe they are tied to the card . Youd have one year to spend the points if you wanted to cancel before the second annual fee is due . <p> Credit card issuers never tell the minimum score needed , but upper 600s lower 700s is usually a threshold . They are also interested in the factors that influence your credit score , so keep that in mind . <p> I typically do n't  get new cards but I 'm traveling on Frontier every month to spend time with my kids and new grandson . <p> Ill check it out ( and apply thru your link if I get one . ) What really got my attention .. aside from 40k miles signup bonus , was the double miles when booking thru Frontier .

I agree , the initial bonus is really good here , however the ongoing miles are n't  very attractive . Its just 1% back on all purchases outside of flying Frontier , which pays 2% back in points . There are many other options available that are better . One would be the Barclay Arrival card paying 2% back on everything . Let me know if you have any other questions ! <p> Thanks for the review , Jacob . I am considering opening a Frontier card to help offset the cost of an upcoming flight for my husband and me in July . Do the flights have to cost $400 or less in order for the 40,000 miles to cover the total expense ? <p> This is my every day card .

But many people neglect the simple adjustments which can save a lot of money over time . Well look at one today the low flow showerhead . <p> As you might know , we bought the- Niagara 1.25 GPM showerhead a week ago and documented it in our annual budget report . Weve been impressed by the quality for such a low price . Water pressure is excellent and its tough to notice the decrease in water volume . <p> According to the math below , you 'll recoup the purchase price in less than one month . <h> Water savings : <p> To begin , I 'll have to estimate your water usage . Ill try to stay conservative on the numbers but its tough to please everyone . In addition , I 'll use the 2.5 Gallon Per Minute ( GPM ) showerhead to calculate totals . It seems like the 2.5 GPM heads are widely used and older models have even higher usage . <p> I 'll assume you take 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your average shower lasts 8 minutes . Here we go : <p> Traditional 2.5 GPM showerhead : 25 showers at 8 minutes each means that you will shower 200 minutes each month . Multiplying 200 minutes by the 2.5 gallons-per-minute flow rate , you will use about 500 gallons of water each month . <p> Niagara Low-flow 1.25 GPM showerhead : Continuing the math . Multiplying 200 minutes by the 1.25 gallons-per-minute flow rate , you will use about 250 gallons of water each month . Youve just cut usage in half . <p> Now let 's look at the yearly totals . <p> With a traditional , 2.5 GPM showerhead , you 'll use 6,000 gallons of water per year . <p> With a 1.25 GPM , low-flow showerhead , you 'll use 3,000 gallons of water per year . <p> So for us as a couple , well save 6,000 gallons per year ( 3,000 x 2 ) . - Adjusting for inflation and basing my cost on this 2004 article , I 'll estimate water at $2.25- per 1,000 gallons . <p> We will save $13.50 this year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat the water requires a little more work so Ill draw from a trust source - the- Ask Mr. Electricity- site : <p> " Energy required to heat a tank of water <p> A Btu , or British thermal unit , is the amount of energy needed to raise one pound of water from 60-F to 61-F at sea level . ( Wikipedia ) <p> For a close middle point , well use an estimate of 1.5 cents/gallon for heating costs . This will vary depending if you have an electric or gas water heater , its- efficiency- rating , and the local cost of gas/electricity . <p> So 6,000 gallons of water multiplied by 1.5 cents/gallon means well save roughly $90 per year in heating costs . <p> That 's over $100 per year from a single shower and 2 individuals ! <p> Yes , these are rough estimates . Yes , they are too simplistic for most real world applications . But I think they prove my case . <p> Let me know if the numbers make sense to you .

The savings will be nice , but granted , they probably are n't  enough to turn to many heads . So , let 's couple this idea of saving money by using less water , with helping out the environment by using less water .

I believe that I can easily make some tweaks on water saving and also air conditioning and heating . Thanks a lot for sharing this with us . <p> Wow , I had no idea something as small as replacing your shower head could have a such a huge impact ! Is there a noticeable difference when using the low-flow head ? Can you tell that the pressure is lower or anything ? Ill have to look into that , because that savings is nothing to sneeze at .

Were trying to save some money on our utilities while we save up to invest in some solar panels . I cant wait to see how this affects our bills ! <p> I have a disabled son that sits on the shower floor when he bathes . It would be convenient to put in one of those shower heads that is connected to a hose for manual movement of the shower head . Would such a shower head change the water pressure in the shower ? <p> That is really crazy that we waste that much water when we shower each month . 500 gallons could be saved for a lot better stuff . I think I might have to get that low flowing shower head to not waste anything . It should save me a couple of bucks . <p> Some newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and save the water bills at the end of each month . I have been told that they never lack the much needed water pressure and that they can provide more spray coverage than usual " water saving " shower heads . Any thoughts on that ? <p> I did n't  know that the shower head could have so much affect on my water bill . Saving $100 dollars a year would be a great thing . However , I do worry about how comfortable the shower is with a low flow faucet . If it is pretty much the same then the decision is a no brainier . <p> Wow you did your research ! That 's very impressive and makes a great case . You really do n't  have to sacrifice your shower experience to save some money .

Ive run these numbers before and its just astounding how great this investment is . I 've argued before that people should wait to invest in stocks and invest in shower heads first .

This cash can be used for anything , providing flexibility in a potential time of need . <p> In addition , workers with wage insurance may be better prepared to take a new job rather than waiting and ending up in long-term unemployment . In a post confirming the importance of wage insurance , White House research economists reported the following : <p> " The long-term unemployed have a 20 to 40 percent lower probability of being employed 1 to 2 years in the future compared to the short-term unemployed , so helping workers take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensuring that they can continue to support themselves and their families . <p> Evidence suggests that workers transition out of unemployment more quickly when they have wage insurance : a Canadian experiment showed- that wage insurance increased entry into full-time work by 4.4 percentage points at the 26-week mark . This is particularly important given that today workers who become unemployed tend to remain unemployed for longer than they have in the past . " <p> The cash payment provided by wage insurance can help keep unemployed persons out of poverty , allowing them to search and find new employment as quickly as possible . <h> What is SafetyNet ? <p> SafetyNetG is one of the new providers in the wage insurance space , offering a straightforward policy that covers many types of unemployment and most- disabilities that prevent one from working for 30 or more days . <p> Here is how SafetyNet works : <p> 1 ) You decide the optimal amount of wage insurance <p> SafetyNet offers four different plan options : <p> You pay $5/month in premiums and receive a lump sum benefit of $1,500 <p> You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $3,000 <p> You pay $20/month in premiums and receive a lump sum benefit of $6,000 <p> You pay $30/month in premiums and receive a lump sum benefit of $9,000 <p> Within a policy year , SafetyNet will pay out one lump sum benefit for disability and one lump sum benefit for unemployment. - The maximum wage insurance benefit for any person ( total amount of lump sum benefits paid ) through SafetyNet is $24,000 . <p> 2 ) You pay for coverage <p> Your first payment is not due for 30 days which is also when you can first file a claim . <p> 3 ) You receive coverage <p> SafetyNet is very clear about what is covered under their wage insurance policy . <p> The following events will qualify for a lump sum payment : <p> Job loss due to layoff , job elimination , business closing or other employer-initiated separation not specifically excluded ( see below ) <p> Disability your doctor has stated that you have a medically determined sickness or accidental injury that is expected to prevent you from performing all of the essential functions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusions are also clearly defined . Under the following events , you are not eligible to receive any payment under the insurance policy : <p> Job loss or disability that occurs in the first 30 days of coverage <p> Job loss or disability due to acts of war , or nuclear or natural disasters <p> Normal routine downtime for seasonal and other jobs ( like construction ) <p> Disability due to normal pregnancy , alcohol or drug use , or elective surgery <p> A job loss you were told about before you bought the coverage or if you quit , retire or are fired <p> A disability that starts within the first 6 months of coverage if caused by a condition you were treated for within the 6 months before you bought the coverage <p> These are the standard exclusions found in any insurance policy that are necessary to protect against moral hazards . <p> If you file a claim and receive payment , SafetyNet has specifically noted that this alone will not cause your premiums to change . <p> 4 ) Decide if you want to continue coverage <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will terminate mid-year only if you reach the maximum lifetime benefit of $24,000 or you fail to pay the required monthly premiums . You can choose to end coverage at any time . <h> Closing Thoughts <p> Supplemental wage- insurance can provide valuable income during periods of unemployment or disability . As job dislocation continues to increase , income protection insurance is becoming an important financial consideration . <p> If you have a large emergency fund set aside to cover your expenses during unemployment , you may be able to self-insure without purchasing insurance coverage . However , you should make sure to have enough set aside to get through- several months of income loss . <p> If you do n't  have money saved , consider researching and selecting a supplemental income insurance policy to protect yourself. - SafetyNetoffers a policy that is worth considering , featuring straightforward pricing and transparent terms and conditions . However , - policies are only available in Wisconsin and Iowa at this time . <p> If you purchase a policy , the insurance premiums will reduce your available cash flow while you are employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saver if you are unable to continue working and require income . <p> Have you used any form of wage insurance ?

@@44824104 @4824104/ <h> Its Time to Fix Your Undiversified Portfolio <p> Modern Portfolio Theory ( MPT ) is the brilliant mathematical- model behind- the investment concept of diversification . Nobel- Prize winner Dr. Harry Markowitz introduced the theory- in 1952 ( 1 ) , and forever changed the world of finance and investing . <p> He- proved- mathematically why holding a bundle of non-perfectly correlated assets is superior to holding a few concentrated positions . He showed that by holding an appropriately diversified portfolio of assets , investors could maximize returns for any given level of risk . <p> I do n't  want to get too far into theory , because most people just do n't  care . And I do n't  want to address the underlying assumptions of MPT which have been questioned in recent years . Those things do n't  matter to most investors . What matters is minimizing- investment risk and maximizing returns . <p> Any primer on Modern Portfolio Theory must begin with a recognition that investors do not like risk and need to be compensated for bearing it. - Investment risk is often defined as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data strongly supports this assumption . For example , from 1926 to 2011 the average geometric return on U.S. Treasury Bills was 3.6% . Over the same period the average return on large domestic- stocks was 9.8% , while small domestic stocks returned- 11.2% . This additional return is also called the equity risk premium , and is the result of the increased risk ( more ups and downs ) accompanying stock ownership . <p> Perhaps more importantly , Modern Portfolio Theory showed that- not all investment risks are rewarded with higher returns . The total risk of any individual security consists of two uncorrelated components : the market , or systematic risk and the firm-specific , or- idiosyncratic risk . <p> The entire capital market and all investors therein are exposed to unavoidable systematic risks , such as currency problems , fluctuating interest rates , war , recession , inflation , and government interventions . You cant get away from these , but you do get compensated for bearing the risk . <p> The idiosyncratic component- simply reflects the reality that each company is exposed to a unique set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Idiosyncratic risk can include competition , lawsuits , fraud , bad management , - financial constraints , etc . This type of risk is not rewarded , because it can be eliminated through proper diversification . <p> In broadly diversified indexes such as the Wilshire 5000 and the- Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index , idiosyncratic- risk approaches zero . Investors whose portfolios are- based on such broad indexes are subject only to- systematic risks . By contrast , a portfolio made up of- just a handful of securities , no matter how carefully- researched , is subject to high levels of idiosyncratic- risk . This is why- stock pickers- and sector investors almost always hold inefficient portfolios that underperform index investors on a risk adjusted basis . <h> Research <p> We can observe the average investors inclination to hold an undiversified portfolio quite easily in the research that has been conducted on the topic . <p> One excellent study on the topic , " - Equity Portfolio Diversification " ( 2 ) , was performed by Drs William Goetzmann and Alok Kumar . The authors analyzed the portfolio decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount brokerage house from- 1991 through 1996 . In general , most investors were grossly under-diversified . <p> An average investor holds a four-stock portfolio ( median- is three ) . <p> Over-all , the evidence indicates that most portfolios have significantly higher- volatility levels relative to the market portfolio , and investors are not compensated- for their higher risk exposures . <p> In addition to widespread under-diversification , the authors find evidence to- further support my argument against stock picking . If you read the arguments of many individual stock pickers , you 'll notice a very strong ( and foolish ) belief that they are somehow superior to other investors . Even though there is absolutely zero evidence supporting the idea that individuals can outperform the market over the long haul after accounting for taxes and fees , theyll argue about it . But there is n't an argument . Its fact versus myth . <p> We also observe that less diversified investors trade more frequently and pay- considerable transaction costs . The average annual trading cost for investors in our- sample is 1.46% of their annual income . Using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate that the average trading cost of active investors is 3.90% of- their annual income . These transaction cost estimates indicate that investors in our- sample pay considerable transaction costs but still fail to diversify appropriately . <p> What comes next should not surprise you . The investors who held the least diversified portfolios- earned far less than the most diversified group of investors . <p> The unexpectedly high idiosyncratic risk in investor portfolios results in a welfare- loss as measured by the Sharpe ratio of individual portfolios . This evidence in itself- is not very surprising . More surprising is our finding of significant differences in the- portfolio alphas . The least diversified ( lowest decile ) group of investors earns 2.40%- lower return annually than the most diversified group ( highest decile ) of investors- on a risk-adjusted basis . The economic cost of under-diversification is higher for the- group of older investors , where the risk-adjusted performance differential between- the least diversified and the most diversified investors is 3.12% <p> Because less diversified investors trade more frequently , these- performance estimates indicate that the net returns earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consequently , the net performance differential- between the least diversified and the most diversified investor groups is likely to- be higher . <p> The moral of the story is this : a well diversified portfolio tends to outperform a portfolio constructed by picking stocks . In other words , own index ETFs and stop trying to buy individual stocks . Or as stated by the authors : <p> Most investors could have improved the performance of their- portfolios by simply investing in one of the many available passive index funds . <h> How You Can- Properly Diversify <p> Many- investors have the wrong idea when it comes to diversification . I commonly hear people talk about buying 10-20 dividend paying , domestic blue chip stocks as a form of proper diversification . This is foolish . As is holding a portfolio comprised of- 100 technology companies , or 5000 health care related- companies . <p> These portfolios are not properly- diversified . Heed the words of Dr. Markowitz on the very idea of diversification : <p> Not only does the E-V hypothesis ( MPT ) imply diversification , it implies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right reason . " A portfolio with sixty different rail-way securities , for example , would not be as well diversified as the same size portfolio with some railroad , some public utility , mining , various sort of manufacturing , etc . The reason is that it is generally more likely for firms within the same industry to do poorly at the same time than for firms in dissimilar industries . Similarly in trying to make variance small it is not enough to invest in many securities . It is necessary to avoid investing in securities with high covariances among themselves . We should diversify across industries because firms in different industries , especially industries with different economic characteristics , have lower co-variances than firms within an industry . <p> Proper diversification in a portfolio requires- 2 components : <p> 1 ) Diversification Within- Asset Classes <p> Diversification within- an asset class reduces a portfolio 's exposure- to risks associated with a particular- company , sector , or market . <p> If you want to invest in established large companies based in the U.S. , you should n't just buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to invest in- as many as possible within that market segment . For example , you could just buy the S&amp;P 500 index and own 500 of the largest domestic firms . Doing so will eliminate some idiosyncratic risk , and reduce overall volatility while providing the same level of returns . <p> This holds true across any asset class , not just large cap stocks . Let 's take a look at Vanguards- comparison of risk ( volatility ) between- individual stocks and the average mutual fund within- various asset and subasset classes . <p> As you can see , mutual- funds have far lower standard deviation than- individual securities within each asset class. - This is a perfect example of Modern Portfolio Theory in action . <p> Continuing with our example above , instead of simply buying large domestic stocks , why not look into small company stocks and international stocks ? They are still stocks , but each market segment is not perfectly correlated , which provides additional diversification benefits . Just take a look at the reduced volatility achieved by adding 20% foreign developed stocks to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The same benefit is achieved when diversifying across sectors . Do n't  just buy health care stocks , buy consumer staples , and energy , and financials , and everything else that you can . Each additional sector provides additional diversification benefits . <p> 2 ) Diversification Across Asset Classes <p> Diversification- across asset classes reduces a portfolio's- exposure to the risks common to an entire- asset class . <p> Historically , the returns of most major asset categories have not moved up and down at the same time . Stocks , bonds , cash , real estate , and commodities often behave very differently at any given time . One may go up , the other may plummet. - By investing in different asset classes that move up and down under different market conditions , an investor can reduce overall portfolio volatility and protect against significant losses . <p> For example , take a look at a portfolio that can be split between stocks and bonds . <p> Of course , stocks have outperformed bonds with higher volatility . But what 's most fascinating is that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with 80% bonds and 20% stocks . They have the same volatility , but the portfolio with stocks will achieve a higher return . This is the direct result of diversification and MPT . <h> Summary <p> Do n't  get lost in the details . The end result of theory and research is application , and it should be relatively easy to apply this knowledge . <p> Invest in broad indexes and stop trying to pick a few stocks. - <p> In doing so , you 'll eliminate idiosyncratic risk almost entirely , and therefore be compensated for all of the investment risk present in your portfolio . <p> With low cost index providers like Vanguard , you can own tens of thousands of companies by simply purchasing a few ETFs . For example , an acceptable portfolio for the average American investor might contain : <p> 40% Total U.S. Stock Market ( VTI ) <p> 25% Total International Stock Market ( VXUS ) <p> 20% Total U.S. Bond Market ( BND ) <p> 10% Total International- Bond Market ( BNDX ) <p> 5% U.S. Real Estate ( VNQ ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can further spice things up with small cap index ETFs , value tilted index ETFs , emerging market index ETFs , etc . These investments still track an index , and- are widely diversified . <p> But if you choose to chase excess returns , realize that you are essentially betting against market efficiency and hoping- that a particular market strategy which may have outperformed in the past , will continue to outperform in the future . I wont argue with you here , but do remember that past returns are no guarantee of future returns 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Dan <p> If you are recommending to diversify vs. a " growth " model ( ie. small caps ) on the principle that " past returns are no guarantee of future returns " then investing as whole should not be recommended . <p> A diversified portfolio is certainly more stable and if the investor is going to react to instability , full diversification is the best option . <p> Most , if not all investments in the asset classes your recommending should have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for investors with 5-10yr horizons high diversification makes sense . However for investors with much longer 30-40 yr horizons ( I assume this includes younger investors like yourself ) do you still recommend diversification beyond a small cap and an emerging market index fund ? <p> I do n't  know what you mean by a " growth model . " I 'm recommending diversification because its the only free lunch in the investing world . Its a mathematical fact that investors can reduce volatility by holding a bundle of not perfectly correlated assets ( read Markowitz paper to see that ) . All investors should diversify , even if they desire to hold 100% equities , and even if they have 40 years to invest . <p> Yes diversification reduces volatility but that does not equal greater returns necessarily . Index funds and most ETFs by their nature are diversified . I guess my question is : Would you recommend diversification beyond a few well diversified small cap index ETFs and maybe some exposure to international markets through a diversified ETF for an investor with a 40 year horizon who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great too , if you have the time ! Thanks <p> Dan , I would still recommend a broad portfolio for someone with 40 years . Small caps are just one sector , as are emerging market funds , both of which you are recommending in your first comment . That means you are leaving free diversification benefits on the table , as well as assuming those two funds will outperform the broad market , or any other sector , over the next 40 years . You might be right , or you might be wrong , who knows . I 'd at least own 25% ( VTI ) for domestic coverage , plus 15% international developed index ( VXUS ) , and probably some REITs . Or in other words , roughly 50% of my portfolio in the most diversified ETFs , and roughly 50% split between small cap , emerging market , low beta , value , or any other strategy that you hope outperforms the broad markets . <p> Thanks . From my research , slicing and dicing adds risk with little return . A position of 5% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that International Bonds do n't  do much either . I considered both REIT and International Bonds , but a wise sage said " keep it simple " . So I did . Thanks again for the detailed post . <p> It depends what type of slicing and dicing . A portfolio significantly weighted towards value , emerging markets , small cap , low beta , etc. has provided higher returns than the cap-weighted total stock index in the past . Depending on the factor , there may ( small cap , emerging markets ) or may not ( value , low beta ) be added volatility . Thanks for the thoughtful comments , Wade . <p> Wade , good looking , efficient portfolio you 're holding . Its not a big deal for a portfolio like yours , but ETFs over mutual funds for a few reasons : 1 ) Fees are lower unless you have can afford Admiral shares in each index ( at Vanguard ) . Some can afford Admiral , many cant , and some funds are n't  offered in Admiral . 2 ) ETFs are almost always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond total stock/total bond in a taxable account . 3 ) ETFs hold less cash because of the redemption process .

This allowed us to knock out nearly $30,000 in student loan debt within our first- year of marriage . <p> Our personal plan wont work for everyone , and it can take years to eliminate debt if you are prioritizing other financial goals . If you anticipate making loan payments for many years , refinancing or consolidating might be- your best available option . <p> As I discussed in my last post , - consolidation- is the process of exchanging one or more federal loans for a new federal loan ( at the same interest rate ) . This can be advantageous if you want to qualify for income-driven repayment plans- ( and loan forgiveness ) , but it does not save you money on interest . <p> Alternatively , you can refinance your student loans . Refinancing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new loan . The difference is that refinancing can include both federal and private loans , and is done through a private lender . <p> The primary reason to refinance your student loans is to obtain a lower interest rate and reduce the amount of interest paid over the life of the loan . <h> How to Obtain the Best Interest Rate When Refinancing <p> When refinancing , your interest rate will depend on your creditworthiness. - Refinancing is best for people whose financial position ( employment , cash flow , and credit ) has improved since they graduated from school . Many of the private lenders consider the following information when determining the interest rate on a new loan : <p> FICO score <p> Monthly gross income <p> Monthly debt-to-income ratio <p> College degree and career outlook <p> To qualify for the best rates , you need to show great credit , stable monthly income , and low levels of existing debt . <h> Should You Refinance Your Student Loans ? <p> Its possible to refinance both private and federal student loans . For either type , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save you money ? <p> Does it offer better terms and conditions ? <p> The first consideration is very simple . Compare your existing loan rates to the rate offered by the new refinanced loan . A lower interest rate saves you money over the life of the loan . <p> After comparing rates , - compare any other benefits are you receiving . If one offers significantly better terms , you should consider that in your decision . Many of the larger companies in the refinancing space ( LendKey ) - have started offering more favorable terms and conditions than many of the- private lenders who originate student loans . However , federal loans carry several special borrower protections that you need to consider- before refinancing . <h> Special Considerations for Federal Loans <p> 1 ) Income-driven repayment plans <p> If you refinance your federal loan(s) through a private lender , you lose the ability to- qualify for the repayment plans offered by the Government . <p> 2 ) Loan Forgiveness <p> Many of the repayment plans mentioned above also provide loan forgiveness after 20 or 25 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) - program forgives the remaining balance on your Federal Loans after you have made 120 qualifying monthly payments under a qualifying repayment plan ( all income-driven repayment plans qualify ) while working full-time for a qualifying employer ( Government organizations at any level and non-profit organizations ) . <p> The most incredible part is that after 120 monthly payments ( 10 years ) , your remaining- loan balance is forgiven tax-free . You do n't owe any tax on the forgiven portion . <p> 3 ) Borrower Protection <p> Federal student loans offer protections like deferment and forbearance that allow you to postpone payments if you have financial difficulties . If you have subsidized federal student loans , you can defer your loan payments interest-free. - Some- of the best companies in the refinancing space now allow temporary unemployment protection , among other borrower perks . Even then , private loans are generally less flexible and less forgiving than federal loans . <p> 4 ) Parent PLUS Loans <p> Parent PLUS loans are the oddball of federal loans . As I outlined in my previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment plans . Many parents also want to shift the responsibility of these loans to their children . As such , you never want to consolidate these loans with other federal loans . <p> One great option is to refinance these loans through a private lender . Its possible to- obtain a lower interest rate , and parents can- shift the responsibility of the loan to a child . <h> Who Should Refinance Their Student Loans ? <p> Because refinancing can take a little bit of time and effort , it does n't  make sense for everyone. - To determine if refinancing is the best solution , consider your debt repayment schedule and compare with the categories listed below . <p> Demolish your debt- within 2 years <p> This category includes individuals with low levels of debt , and individuals whose number one priority is getting out of debt FAST . <p> Vanessa and I were part of- this category . We made it our mission to become debt-free in our first year of marriage . We did n't  mess with consolidating or refinancing our loans . Instead , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could pay down the debt quicker . <p> You could refinance through a private lender for free , but that does take some time and effort to realize modest interest savings . <p> Debt-free in 2-10 years <p> Individuals in this category might have modest levels of debt , and other important life goals that are competing for dollars . Most borrowers fall within this category , and refinancing can be an excellent option here . <p> If you have subsidized federal loans , you might be able to obtain a slightly lower interest rate through refinancing . If you have private student loans- and/or unsubsidized federal loans , refinancing can save you a lot of money over time . <p> The income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness- offered on federal loans are much less important here , because those programs- require 10 , 20 , or 25 years of continuous payments . If you want to be debt-free in less than 10 years , you wont be eligible for those programs . <p> What 's much more important is obtaining the lowest interest rate possible on your loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your loans and reduce the amount of interest paid . <p> Debt-free in 10+ years <p> This category includes many professionals , saddled with years of student loan debt . <p> Some of the income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness options should be considered before refinancing . If you want to make the minimum monthly payments ( under the income-driven repayment plans ) and/or qualify for loan forgiveness , you need to avoid refinancing your federal loans . <p> If you are n't  interested in the federal repayment- programs , or if you have private- student loans , you should consider refinancing . Government programs aside , you can likely obtain a lower overall interest rate through refinancing because interest rates are historically low . <h> How to Refinance Your Student Loans <p> Hopefully by now , you have given thought to your available options .

If you live in a location that is comparatively expensive , you will be forced to allocate more income to necessary- expenses , including housing , food , insurance , and taxes . If you live somewhere with a lower cost of living , your overall expenses will be less . <p> If you are highly paid , you have the ability to save a larger percentage of your income than someone who is paid less ( all else equal ) . But- the same framework still applies you must decide how much to consume and how much to save . <p> If you choose to spend all of your income , there is n't a lot of applicable financial advice . You will be forced to continue working indefinitely , because you will be unable to afford your ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to spend less than you earn , you can save the difference and begin investing . <h> What is Investing ? <p> Saving is the process of spending less than you earn , creating a pool of financial resources . <p> Investing is the process of committing your resources to a goal , with the expectation of obtaining a future benefit that outweighs the cost . <p> To illustrate , consider a few investment examples : <p> Human Capital <p> Your human capital is the economic value of your knowledge and skills . You can develop your human capital through an education program that teaches you a specific skillset . <p> In exchange for your investment ( time and money ) in the education program , you gain knowledge/skills that can be used to earn a higher income in the future . <p> In doing so , you must expect the future payoff ( better employment opportunities ) to outweigh the cost ( your time , energy , and effort ) . Otherwise , you would n't waste your time . <p> Home Ownership <p> Home ownership is often viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is an underlying assumption that the long-term value of the home ( economic and emotional ) outweighs the total cost ( mortgage , insurance , taxes , repairs , etc . ) . <p> If that assumption is not true , there is no reason to- purchase a home . <p> Creating Financial Wealth <p> Maybe you are n't  interested in obtaining a new skillset or buying a home . Maybe your goal is to accumulate a large pool of financial resources , so that you can retire early or change careers . <p> Creating- financial wealth involves the same cost-benefit analysis . You can choose to restrict your spending today ( deferring consumption is the cost ) and invest your savings- in financial assets that are expected to provide more wealth in the future- ( the benefit ) . <p> If the expected future payout is large , you will be more willing to defer consumption today . If the expected future benefit is- small , you will be less willing- to save today . <h> Why Should You Invest ? <p> Investing allows you to grow your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth that should be considered : <p> 1 ) Inflation <p> In economics , inflation is a sustained increase in the general price of goods and services over a period of time , resulting in a reduction in the purchasing power of currency . <p> In other words , prices continue increasing , making- each of your dollars less valuable over time . <p> If your groceries cost an average of $100 this month , and inflation is 3% over the next year ( historically , inflation has averaged roughly 3% each year ) , the same groceries will cost about $103 one year from now . <p> If you save the necessary $100 today and put that money in a checking account , you wo n't earn enough interest to keep pace with inflation . As a result , you wont be able to afford the $103 grocery bill next year . <p> If instead , you invest the $100 in a bond that is offering a 4% return on your money , you will have $104 available next year . Even though the groceries will cost $103 after inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase an extra $1 in groceries . <p> Investing provides a way to- maintain the purchasing power of your savings . <p> 2 ) Compounding <p> In addition to maintaining purchasing power , investing allows you to create additional wealth through the power of compounding . <p> Over time , you expect a financial gain in exchange for your investment . If you reinvest your earnings , the growth can be exponential . For example , consider the following graph : <p> Because she started investing at age 25 , - Susan had 10 additional years for her savings to compound . Even though Bill invests more money overall , he lost the first decade of compounding . <h> How Much Should You Save and Invest ? <p> Suppose you are able to begin saving money ( your income exceeds your expenses ) . - The next step is figuring out how much to save , and how to invest- your savings . <p> The optimal amount to save and invest will depend on your personal preferences , including : <p> Goals : All investing decisions begin with your goals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your specific financial goals . If your goal is to retire early and travel , you need to save and invest a significant amount of your current income to create a portfolio can that support your future lifestyle ( so that you do n't  have to work ) . <p> Risk Profile : Once you have a specific goal in mind , you must decide how to invest your savings to achieve that goal . There are a wide variety of investment options available to choose from , and each has a different level of risk involved . As a general rule , risk and reward are inseparable when investing . If you want the possibility of a large future reward , you must accept more risk ( typically risk is defined as the potential for loss ) . <p> Expectations : Your investment expectations play a massive role in your decision to save and invest . You will be much more willing to invest if you expect a large future benefit . For example , the stock market has provided investors an average return of roughly 10% each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are predicting lower future returns in our current economic environment . If stocks provide a lower return , perhaps 5-6% each year moving forward , there is less incentive to save and invest . <h> How to Start Investing <p> Determine your financial goals , - and use those goals to guide your investment decisions . <p> You can construct your investment portfolio using a wide array of available investments , but most investors stick to traditional asset classes like stocks and bonds . More obscure asset classes are sometimes difficult to evaluate , and often carry higher fees and/or excessive risk . <p> Available investments include : <p> Stocks : Historically , stocks ( also called equities ) have had the greatest risk and return of the common asset classes . Stocks represent ownership in a publicly traded corporation . The best way to own stocks is through a diversified fund that invests in numerous different stocks . <p> Bonds : Bonds have historically provided lower returns- than stocks , with less volatility ( risk ) . - Bonds represent- debt .

This includes art , coins , stamps , wine , etc . <p> Commodities : This category includes precious metals like gold and silver , agricultural products , oil and gas , etc. - <p> Cash Equivalents : This includes cash and cash equivalents , including certificates of deposit , savings accounts , and money market accounts .

@@44824109 @4824109/ <h> What are Stocks and Why Should You Care ? <p> What comes to your mind when you hear a conversation about- investing in stocks ? <p> Do you think about gambling , or Wall Street , or stock brokers , or the most recent financial crisis ? Perhaps you 've heard the media use all of these terms interchangeably , creating more confusion about stock ownership . <p> Instead of relying on loosely defined financial jargon , this article will explain what stocks represent , and why you might be interested in owning them . <h> What are Stocks ? <p> Stocks represent ownership interest in a company. - When you purchase the stock of a particular company , you become a " shareholder " in that business. - Stocks are often called equities because the shareholders legally own the net assets of a company , which is also known as equity . <p> Companies issue stock to raise investment capital- that is needed to grow the business or create new projects . If a company decides to raise capital through a public stock offering , the stock shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock exchange where the company is listed . <p> There are two main types of stock , called common stock and preferred stock . <p> The majority of publicly issued ( and traded ) stock is common stock , which is what most people think about when discussing " stocks . " <p> The remainder of this article will focus on common stock , but feel free to also visit my guide to preferred stock if you are interested . <h> Why Do Investors Choose Stocks ? <p> Stock ownership provides several benefits that attract investors . <p> 1 ) Share in- the companys profits <p> When you purchase the stock of a publicly traded company , - you are entitled to- a portion of the companys- financial gains . <p> Company profits- are the foundation of any stock 's value , and- profits depend on earnings . For this reason , stocks are often valued in relation- to earnings . For example , a stocks price will often fall if a company misses their estimated quarterly earnings . Similarly , the stock price will increase following positive earnings news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a companys profits in the following ways : <p> Dividends A dividend is a payment to shareholders as a distribution of profits . Dividends are typically paid to shareholders quarterly ( four times per year ) , but companies may issue special dividends at any time . Not every company issues dividends and a company may increase , decrease , or eliminate future dividend payments , depending on the performance of the business . The most common type of dividend is a cash payment to shareholders , although firms can issue dividends in the form of more stock . <p> Capital Appreciation Instead of paying dividends , a company- might decide to retain earnings . It can reinvest the earnings into future growth by creating more products , hiring more employees , increasing advertising , or any number of capital expenditures that are expected to increase earnings over time. - By creating additional earnings , the company becomes more valuable , which- increases the stock price per share . When the value of your stock increases over time , you can sell the shares to another investor and realize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may be wondering- if dividends are a magical source of free money . The answer is no . <p> Dividends + Capital Appreciation = Your Total Return. - <p> Dividends are one way a company can distribute earnings . But after paying a dividend , the value of a stock actually declines to reflect the reduction in earnings . If a stock is trading at $50 per share , and the company declares a $5 dividend , the price per share falls to roughly $45 after the dividend payment is made. - If instead , the company decided to retain the $5 in earnings per share , the value of the stock would remain $50 . <p> Remember to focus on the total return of your investment . You can always sell shares to generate income if that is what you desire . <p> 2 ) - The right to vote in shareholder meetings <p> As a shareholder , you are entitled to receive ( quarterly/annual ) reports- which discuss the financial health of the company . <p> Corporations are usually required by law to hold annual shareholder meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors . If you are a shareholder , you can attend the annual meeting and vote. - If you can not attend- the annual shareholder 's meeting , you can request an absentee ballot to voice your opinion . <p> Shareholders control the direction of a company by appointing the board of directors. - The board of directors is responsible for increasing the value of the corporation while protecting shareholder interest , and does so by appointing professional managers and officers in the corporation , such as the Chief Executive Officer- ( CEO ) . Managers are responsible for running the company on a daily basis , improving productivity , and ultimately increasing revenue , which increases the value of outstanding- shares ( stock ) . <p> This distribution of power is known as corporate governance . For the most part , corporate governance is highly effective in protecting shareholder interest . The biggest problem is that- shareholders need to own a large percentage a companys- stock to influence important votes or decisions . Most investors do not have adequate ownership interest because many large firms issue millions or billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few individuals attend shareholder meetings on a regular basis . <h> Are Stocks Risky ? <p> There are significant risks associated with stock ownership . These include : <p> 1 ) Price Fluctuations : - <p> Above , I described the importance of capital appreciation in stock ownership . But- stocks do n't  always increase in value , and sometimes stock prices plummet . Take a look at this chart showing U.S. stock market performance over a recent 15-year period : <p> As you can see , the overall trend is positive , and stocks have provided an average- return of approximately 10% each year over the last century . <p> However , there are times when the stock market delivers extreme losses . In these years , the economic environment takes a downward turn and companies experience a significant reduction in earnings . In reaction , many investors get scared and sell their shares of stock . When most stock market participants are- trying to sell , and very few are trying to buy , a companys stock price will continue declining until sentiment reverses- and investors return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you purchase it , you can continue holding the stock and hope the stock price will rebound ( which is usually the case unless the- firm is going bankrupt ) . Or , you can sell your shares and realize a capital loss . <p> 2 ) Residual Claim in Bankruptcy : <p> If a publicly traded company goes bankrupt , the companys assets are usually liquidated and sold . The common shareholders are the last in line to share in the proceeds , and will receive nothing until the other claimants have been paid ( including the tax authorities , employees , suppliers , bondholders , and preferred shareholders ) . <p> Thus , if you are a common stockholder , you have what is called a residual claim ( which may be nothing ) . You could lose your entire- initial investment in the event of bankruptcy . However , you can not lose anything more than your initial investment because shareholders have limited liability under the law . <h> Should You Invest in Stocks ? <p> Over the last 100 years , stocks have provided exceptional growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with- large losses , but the overall trend has remained positive and many investors have built substantial wealth by staying invested in the stock market . <p> It 's not a good idea to invest all of your money in the stock of one company because- your entire investment portfolio would be tied to the earnings of that particular company . If the company experiences problems , the value of your stock will most likely fall , and you could lose your entire investment if the company goes bankrupt . <p> To mitigate that risk , you can invest in thousands of different stocks through a diversified fund or robo-advisor . In doing so , you can own the entire U.S. stock market and foreign markets at a very low cost . To determine how much to invest in stocks , you should first consider your financial goals . Stocks are best held for many years , making them an investment most suitable for your long-term goals . <p> Is there anything else you would like to know about stocks ?

You have to do this so you can track what you earn and effectively manage the rewards . <p> For example , before you begin applying for an American Airlines ( AA ) Citi credit card , you need to make an American Airlines online account . You 'll keep the AA account open forever , and it will be used to collect all of your AA miles ( including any future miles earned ) .

@@44824119 @4824119/ <h> Which Type of Stock Market Order Should You Choose ? <p> After creating your online brokerage account , the next step is placing a financial market order. - The order process is determined by- the- bid-ask spread for each security . The bid is the highest price that an investor in the market is willing to pay at a given time , while the ask is the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell. - When- the bid-ask price coincides , a trade takes place . <h> Types of Orders <p> When- you are looking to place an order , you can control the timing and price of the transaction through different order types . <p> Market Order <p> A market- order is a request to buy or sell a security immediately at current market prices . This type of order guarantees that the order will be executed , but does not guarantee the execution price . <p> A market order generally will execute at or near the current bid ( for a sell order ) or ask ( for a buy order ) price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes the bid-ask spread will widen . <p> Limit Order <p> A limit order is a request to buy or sell a security at a specific price or better. - Although a limit order allows you to specify the trade price , there is no guarantee that the order will be executed . <p> For example , you want to purchase shares of XYZ stock for no more than $10 . You can- submit a limit order for this amount and the order will only execute if the ask price of XYZ stock is $10 or lower . <p> Or , maybe you want to sell shares of- XYZ stock for no less than $10 . You can- submit a limit order for this amount and the order will only execute if the bid price of XYZ stock is $10 or higher . <p> Stop Orders <p> A stop order is a request to buy or sell a stock once the price of the stock reaches the specified price , known as the stop price . When the stop price is reached , a stop order becomes a market order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two common stop orders : <p> A sell " stop order- is a request to sell at the best available price after the bid price goes below the stop price . Investors generally use a sell-stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock they own . <p> For example , if the current price of ABC- stock is $100 and you want to protect against a significant decline , you could enter a sell-stop order at $90 . If the market bid falls to $90 , - your stop order is triggered and a market order is entered to sell at the next available market price . <p> A buy " stop order- is a request to buy at the best available price after the ask price goes above the stop price . Investors generally use a buy stop order to limit a loss or protect a profit on a stock that they have sold short . <p> Stop-limit order <p> In a normal stop order , once the stop price is reached , a market order is executed . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order becomes a limit order to buy ( or sell ) at no more ( or less ) than the- pre-specified limit price . As with all limit orders , a stop " limit order does n't  get filled if the securitys price never reaches the specified limit price . <h> Timing of Orders <p> In addition to specifying the type of your order , you can specify the timing . <p> Day-only orders- are good for the current day session only . If your broker does not fill your order that day , you will have to re-enter it the next day . <p> Good-until-cancelled ( GTC ) orders will remain active until you decide to cancel ( although brokers may limit the order to cancel after- 60-90 days ) . <p> Fill-or-kill ( FOK ) orders require that the entire order be immediately executed in full . If this is not possible , the entire order is cancelled . <p> Immediate-or-cancel ( IOC ) orders require that at least part of an order be filled immediately . Any part of the order that can not be filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for partial fills . <h> Quantity- of Orders <p> You can also specify the volume of your order : <p> Minimum-quantity orders require a minimum number of shares to be executed in order to complete the- transaction . If the minimum is not available , - none of the order will be executed . <p> All-or-none ( AON ) orders specify that the order must be executed in its entirety or not at all . <h> A Quick Example <p> Most financial securities- are traded in a similar way through a brokerage account , and the order process is fairly uniform across brokers and financial markets . <p> For example , if you want to purchase Apple stock , you would search for the Apple- ticker ( AAPL ) and find the current bid-ask spread . You could then place an order using the options discussed in this article . <p> If you have $5,000- and want to invest your money as quickly as possible , you could specify a market order that is good until cancelled . Your broker would then fill the order immediately at the most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overpriced this week , you could set a limit or stop order specifying the price that you want to pay . If other market participants agree with your assessment of Apple ( being overvalued ) , some will begin selling their shares . If the majority of Apple- investors decide to sell their shares , the price of Apple stock will begin to fall and your order might be executed ( depending on the price you specified ) . If the market disagrees with your assessment and investors continue purchasing Apple stock , the price per share will rise and your order will not be filled . <p> I hope this article- helps you understand stock market orders and allows you get started as an investor .

However , we 've saved our people at Walmart edition for when we had some REALLY good pictures . <p> However , this is not an article about the crazy high prices at Walmart . No , no , no . This is about the crazies that frequent Walmart . Unlike a lot of people , we do n't  hate Walmart on a personal level . Even though we are not fond of the idea that they are putting the rest of the grocery industry out of business , we find their ad matching policy most advantageous to the frugal lifestyle we adore . <p> In the article , - how to save money on groceries , I detailed how we shop for groceries , and why . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week on groceries for two people , and we feel we eat like kings . So it is utterly shocking when we witness people with carts piled high with items we never even considered buying . The real hoot is that they pay full retail prices for these items ! Its like they do n't  realize that just because it is for sale at Walmart does n't  mean it is a good deal . <p> Adventures in Crazy Town is all about the pictures , so here is Cart #1 : <p> I found this beauty nestled between the Ramen noodles and the Corn Flakes . Not only do they have Coke , Dr. Pepper , condensed Campbells soup and Cocoa Puffs tossed in their cart , they are also bringing home the bacon . Literally . And they probably paid $4-5 for their one pound of bacon . <p> The reason this is hilarious is because just an hour before , we got 10 lbs of bacon for $1.69 per lb . Check out our loot.Cash Cow Couple : 1- Crazy town citizen : 0 <p> Check out Cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mission Impossible if you ask me . Mission Impossible to save money that is . Nothing in this cart was on sale , and I do n't  even want to think about how much money that dog food cost or how long it lasted . Just another reason we do n't  think you can afford a dog . Plus , who buys cookies in tiny little cups ? The dollar store sells cookies like that in a large bag for $1 , but then of course youd have to pack them yourself . And who wants to do all the work when you can pay for the convenience of prepackaged cookies ? <p> And finally , for my favorite cart of the day , Cart #3 : <p> This cart is piled high with high fructose corn syrup snack foods ranging from mini donuts to fruit gushers to Pop Tarts to juice . But hey , at least those fruit gushers are off brand right ? That should save her a some change . Oh ! and do n't  forget that hair spray <p> We witnessed the people at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out of Walmart with 8 avocados for 31 cents each and look of bewilderment on our faces .

Hey old lady who nailed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hope you enjoy the Strawberry Flavored Personal Lubricant ! <p> Funny thing is the dog food was the healthiest thing in that cart !

Except that none of it needed to be purchased in the first place ! I 'm glad we do n't  have any Walmarts near here ! <p> Ha ! You 're right about the dog food being the cheapest . That 's funny . How do you save money on groceries without going to Walmart ? Weve discussed what we will do once Walmart eliminates their ad match policy . I was just wondering if you had any good suggestions or tips . <p> I prefer target better ( though I 'm sure some people can buy the same unhealthy stuff ) . But at Target , there are at least fresh vegetables and fruits . I did not see any at Walmartmainly prepackaged frozen foods and snacks . <p> Our Walmarts are really quite a disaster here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lately we 've been saying , Maybe we can go once per month just to stock up on ridiculously priced items . Now that I 'm eating healthy foods , I find my eyes are always on other peoples carts more for the nutritional scan than the price scan , but I 'm never going to be the same after reading this article . Now I will be looking for both ! I know you two would appreciate this story our HEB was out of our cheap , store-brand spinach . CJ comes walking over to me with a box of spinach and a look on his face like someone just stole his guitar ( mix of sad and mad ) . I said , " Oh no no ! We are not paying for THAT ! " In the end , we did but only because we did n't  want to go to another store . <p> Walmarts pricing strategy is extremely interesting . They typically have a number of " anchor " products at a very good price but the rest of their products are not necessarily priced competitively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of these certain anchor products , so only these products need to be priced very aggressively . The rest of the products can be priced a bit higher because once in the store most people buy them anyway , as you just showed very clearly . <p> You would really not appreciate seeing what I buy for my dog or the groceries in my cart . They are organic / grass fed and gluten free but there are packaged goods in there . I try to look for sales but you guys spend much more time than I do . We all have different values ! I would not give up my dog for any sum of money . One day when she is gone , I will probably not get another one for a long time , but that 's due to the time commitment , not the food/treat budget .

Now , as adults within a marriage , we openly discuss everything , including money . <p> How do these dynamics work in our- Millennial marriage ? <p> Jacob is nearly finished with- his PhD in Financial Planning . Between the two of us , he clearly has the most knowledge about financial matters . However , this does not excuse or exclude me from being a part of our financial life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our financial situation is , how money is being spent , saved , and invested , and what to do in case of an emergency . <p> Its important for both partners to be knowledgeable about the familys financial decisions because the older you get , the more complex your money situation will become , especially if you are building wealth . Make sure you start now , so you can learn as you go . This will make it less overwhelming later in life . <p> Jacob is the CFO of our family , and I respect- his role as the leader of our finances . Its fine to have separate roles , if you discuss those roles and respect each other . We are a team when it comes to finances and everything else in life . <p> Have joint goals <p> Make sure you marry someone who is going to be your partner and truly wants the same things as you . As mentioned above , Jacob and I talked about our finances extensively before we were married . We knew that we both wanted to pursue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial and lifestyle goal. - We want to be free to live our lives according to what we feel is truly important , like spending time together , with friends and family , giving back to the community , and pursuing our passions . <p> Your money talks should be ongoing <p> We credit our financial success to the ongoing conversations about our financial situation . No topic is off limits , and we continue to- discuss our financial situation . This type of conversational freedom within a marriage takes time and effort . <p> Open communication is the key to financial success , especially within millennial marriages where financial management roles are more equal than ever before . <p> Do you agree ? <p> *Chase commissioned this online survey about personal financial views and habits . The survey was conducted between June 9th and June 17th , 2016 .

Full details of the study are available at Chase.com/TheTalk. - <p> Its sometimes hard to agree on money decisions , but we always try to make sure that we are on the same page by talking on these with willingness to listen to each others perspective and side . I think two things that also help for a successful marriage is that you understand your partners money mindset and stop keeping secrets . <p> Money is the biggest source of tension in relationships , so being open is very important . My wife and I discuss money and our goals frequently . She does n't  have any interest in running our finances and leaves that up to me . I 'm completely fine with that . The most important thing is were on the same page when it comes to spending , saving and future goals . <p> I agree with you 100% ! My wife and I often have discussions about our finances and goals , and its made us a stronger couple because of it . We used to try and keep " his and hers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend on whatever we wanted , but over the years this became unnecessary due to our communication and openness about our finances . While I more or less handle our finances , my wife understands where the money is going and what were saving for it helps us both forge a good path forward for our family . Thanks for another great post ! <p> I and my wife talk about money openly and honestly . We make sure that we agree on every decision , and if not , we try to talk further . It is really open communication and willingness to go for extra mile to achieve financial goals and make a marriage successful . 
@@44824128 @4824128/ <h> Should You Invest in Preferred Stocks ? <p> This article will help you understand the characteristics that define both types of stock , and can help you decide if preferred stock belongs in your investment portfolio . <h> What is Preferred Stock ? <p> Preferred stocks ( sometimes called " preferreds " ) are a type of stock with bond-like- features . <p> Most preferred stocks pay a regular dividend- that is very similar to the- regular coupon payments offered by bonds. - For example , a preferred share might offer a 6% dividend yield . If you purchase a share for $100 , you could expect a $6 annualized dividend payment . <p> Also like bonds , the market value of each preferred share fluctuates with respect to- interest rate changes and the issuers creditworthiness . The value also partially depends on the business performance and earnings potential of the issuer ( to a lesser degree than common stock ) . <p> While most bonds have a fixed maturity date , preferred stock is often issued in perpetuity . To recoup your initial investment , you generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , many preferred shares are sold at a discount to the initial face value on the secondary market . <p> The stock is- called " preferred " because shareholders receive preference over common stockholders with regard to dividend payments and bankruptcy claims . <h> Why Do Companies Issue Preferred Stock ? <p> Companies issue all forms of equity ( and debt ) for one reason to raise capital that can be used to improve the business . <p> Many companies that issue preferred shares are required by regulators to have adequate capital to support their debt liabilities , and preferred stock is a relatively cheap way to maintain a healthy- debt-to-equity ratio . Although preferred shares behave much like bonds , they are treated as equity on the balance sheet . This is important because- too much debt can result in- a downgraded bond rating by the rating agencies , which can lead to a number of other corporate problems . <p> Perhaps even more importantly , preferred dividends can be suspended if a company faces financial hardship , while- bond interest payments can not . If a company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered in default and risks being forced into debt reorganization . <p> Another reason- that companies issue preferred stock is to restrict voting rights. - Common stockholders can vote to appoint- the companys- board of directors , among other things. - Preferred stockholders typically do not receive voting rights , - and therefore have less influence on corporate policy decisions. - Companies that want to limit the control they give to shareholders can issue preferred stock as an alternative ( or supplement ) to common stock . <h> What are the Advantages of Preferred Stock ? <p> 1 ) Consistent Income <p> The dividends provided by preferred stock can be an excellent and predictable source of income . In many situations , preferreds offer a- much higher yield than corporate bonds . <p> 2 ) Preferred Status <p> Dividends must be paid on the preferred stock before any common stock . Furthermore , most preferred dividends are cumulative . If a- company fails to pay a dividend in full , the company must make payment at a later date . No common stock dividends can be paid until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial distress where the company must be sold or reorganized , the interests of preferred shareholder are usually placed ahead of common stockholders , but always behind the debt holders ( bond owners ) . <p> 3 ) Tax Advantages <p> Many preferred dividends are considered " qualified " by the IRS and taxed at a preferential rate ( the same rate as long-term capital gains ) . <p> In contrast , corporate bond interest is taxed as ordinary income . <p> 4 ) Convertibility <p> Convertible preferred stock contains a provision that allows the holder to convert the preferred stock into common stock under certain conditions . The provision usually states a future date when conversion may begin and specifies the conversion rate from preferred to common stock . <p> This feature allows preferred shareholders to share in the potential- upside of the underlying common stock . However , not all preferred stock offers this provision . <h> What are the Disadvantages of Preferred Stock ? <p> 1 ) - Limited Growth Potential <p> Common stockholders share in the growth of a company through higher stock prices over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks is almost entirely a function of the dividend yield . Preferred shareholders receive limited benefits following an improvement in the issuing companys earnings . <p> If the preferred stock can be converted into common stock , this problem largely disappears . But many preferred- shares can not be converted . <p> 2 ) - Interest Rate- Risk <p> Remember that preferred stocks pay a consistent dividend , much like the coupons paid by fixed income securities ( bonds ) . <p> As is the case with bonds , preferred stocks are extremely sensitive to changes in interest rates . As interest rates rise , the present value of a preferred stock falls ( and vice versa ) . <p> The difference is that preferreds are issued in perpetuity ( they have no specified maturity date ) , while bonds are issued with- a specified maturity date ( often a maximum of 30 years ) . <p> Because preferreds are issued in perpetuity , they are even more sensitive to interest rate changes than long-term bonds. - When interest rates rise , the value of preferred stock will often plummet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bonds because of their call provision ( discussed below ) . <p> Thus , preferred stocks are subject to asymmetric interest rate risk , which ultimately makes them unattractive to many individual investors . <p> 3 ) - Call- Provisions <p> Almost all preferreds are callable at par value at the issuer 's discretion , normally following- a specified amount of time past the issue date ( often five years ) . - This provision hurts preferred stockholders when interest rates decline . <p> If interest rates fall , the issuer will likely call the preferred stock and replace it with a new offering at a lower rate , thus lowering the companys overall- cost of capital . <p> Like bonds , preferred stocks are rated by the major credit-rating companies . Preferred stocks generally receive a lower credit rating than comparable bonds for two reasons : <p> Preferred stock dividends do not carry the same guarantees provided by coupon payments from a bond . <p> In the event of a bankruptcy , all debt holders ( including bond owners ) are- paid before preferred shareholders . <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In financial distress , a- company will always delay or eliminate a preferred dividend before it will default on its debt . <h> Should You Invest in Preferred Stock ? <p> Most investors consider investing in preferred stock as an alternative to bonds because the dividend yield can be very attractive . <p> If you want to draw that comparison , you must also consider overall investment- risk , and preferred shares are far riskier than comparable bonds . For example , during the 2008 financial crisis , many preferred shares plummeted in value while most bonds performed very well . One of the most widely owned , diversified preferred stock ETFs ( PFF ) was destroyed during this time , falling from almost $50 per share to less than $20 per share over the course of 18 months . If you are willing to accept that level of risk , common stock offers far more upside potential in times of economic prosperity . <p> This scenario highlights another problem with preferred stock . Because of the unique risks highlighted above , you should never own individual- preferred stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of different preferred shares . The annual expense ratio of most preferred funds is very high , and even- high-quality options like ( PFF ) carry an expense ratio of 0.47% annually . On the other hand , diversified bond funds and common stock funds can be found for around 0.05% annually . The additional 0.40% in expenses will directly reduce your net return . <p> Ultimately , preferred stock- combines- the disadvantages of both common stock and bonds . Like a bond , preferred stock does not participate in future earnings growth of the issuing company . However , a bond has greater legal protections than the preferred and has a maturity date at which the principal is to be repaid . Like common stock , the preferred has fewer legal- protection than the bond . However , the potential increase in the market price of the common stock is lacking for the preferred. - The only real advantage for preferred stock is a higher dividend yield , but even that is not guaranteed in times of financial distress . <p> If you understand the risks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-quality , diversified ETF during times of market turmoil . During these times , many preferred shares can be purchased at a steep discount to par value- providing growth potential and a large dividend yield . 
@@44824129 @4824129/ <h> Common Asset Classes for Investors <p> When an individual first decides to begin investing , the available information and choices can be overwhelming . That 's actually a significant topic of research in behavioral economics when presented with too many choices , people often do nothing . <p> In light of that fact , I 'd like to briefly discuss the common asset classes that are available for investors . Usually an investor will hold more than one class to provide the benefits of diversification . By owning several asset classes , there is less overall risk and less volatility ( or change in the value of your investments ) . <p> Ill structure the following classes according to risk levels . The first classes will be less risky , less volatile , and less rewarding to investors . <h> Cash Equivalents <p> The main reason to own- cash and cash-equivalent investments is to preserve capital in the short run . Cash investments include savings accounts , certificates of deposit , money market funds , treasury bills , and other similar investments which- offer a fixed rate of return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FDIC ) . <p> These investments have high liquidity ( ability to be quickly converted to cash ) and high stability ( they are n't  likely to decline in value ) . They are typically used as a short term investment for goals or purchases that will take place within a relatively short period of time . They are also used to house a typical emergency fund . <p> The big problem with these investments is the low return they provide . In todays economy you 'll basically get no return on your investment , leaving you with less purchasing power than your began with after taking into account inflation . <p> As such , they should not be used for longer term savings or long term investing . <h> Fixed Income ( Bonds ) <p> Bonds are call fixed income investments because they periodically pay fixed interest payments to investors at a specified ( fixed ) date . <p> Here is how it works : You ( the investor ) loan money to a government or corporation . In return , they promise to pay you a fixed amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . <p> Bonds are commonly either taxable ( U.S. Treasury bonds and corporate bonds ) or- tax-free ( like municipal bonds issued by local or State governments ) . <p> They are also typically categorized by maturity date . Short term , intermediate , long , etc . This is when the issuer pays back the investor his original principal . <p> Bonds are extremely sensitive to interest rate changes . If interest rates rise , the value of a previously issued bond goes down . This makes sense if you think about it . Why would a new investor pay full price for that old bond that pays a lower interest rate than the current issue ? They would n't . So to compensate for the lower rate on interest payments , the bond must be sold at a discount . The reverse applies if interest rates fall . <p> Fixed-income assets are often used as part of a diversified portfolio because they generally behave differently than stocks- do . When stocks have gone down , bonds have done just fine . At the same time , returns on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks . <p> Fixed-income assets are not good long-term investments by themselves . There is a good deal of research showing that owning 100% bonds is actually more risky than owning something like 75% bonds/ 25% stocks . This is because of lower growth potential and other bond risks . <h> Stocks <p> The main goal- of stock ownership- is to provide growth and to earn returns in excess of inflation . The stock market has consistently outpaced inflation over long periods of time and has provided the highest historical returns for investors . Over the last century , stocks have averaged around 10% growth per year , and close to 7% after factoring in inflation . <p> When you buy a share of stock , you are buying ownership in a business 's earnings and assets . You are then entitled to receive a proportionate share of the profits through dividends and increases in the company 's share price . Mature companies are typically a better source of dividends , because young- companies ( and IPOs ) often prefer to reinvest profits . <p> Stocks involve more risk than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in value many time throughout its history and as a result , stocks ownership should n't be considered unless the investor can keep the money invested somewhere between 5-10 years . Even then , there is considerable risk . <p> The absolute worst thing to do is to sell stocks when the market falls . You are locking in those huge losses instead of waiting for the recovery ( which has always come ) . <h> Real Estate <p> Real estate has been a solid investment for a long , long time . The historical returns are lower than stocks , but some might consider them more stable . <p> Investors can own rental homes which provide continuous cash flow from tenants . This can allow the investor to pay off the mortgage and build considerable equity in the home. - There are also commercial real estate opportunities and other property options . <p> Real estate allows easy access to leverage . With just a down payment , an investor can own a home and all the potential profit that accompanies ownership . - Real estate also has nice tax privileges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning and fixing physical real estate is n't your cup of tea , consider owning Real Estate Investment Trusts ( REITs ) . They allow you to invest in all sorts of real estate indirectly through a managing company . As an added benefit , you get better diversification . <h> Precious Metals and Commodities <p> Precious metals have long been a form of currency . I 'm talking thousands of years . Investors can own physical metal or own shares of the companies that mine or trade precious metals . <p> Similarly , commodities are physical goods that are also frequently used or traded . Investors can own those goods directly in the case of buying- farmland , or indirectly by owning companies that are involved in the harvesting , producing , or trading of these goods . <p> The good thing about precious metals and commodities is that they provide additional diversification benefits to investors . They often behave quite differently than stocks and bonds . The downside is that they can be extremely volatile and risky . Prices go up and down very quickly . <h> A Note On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listed can ( and probably should ) be owned through mutual funds or ETFs . The greatest benefit in owning these vehicles is diversification . They allow an investor to hold thousands of companies through just one investment . <p> For example , by owning an index ETF , an investor can hold thousands of companies even the whole stock market via one investment vehicle . Research indicates that owning thousands of companies is much less risky than owning just a few . As a result , returns are stronger and more stable for the investor . <p> Let me know if I 've properly described the asset classes . Thanks for reading ! 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I use ETFs almost exclusively . I like them because they are easily diversified among asset classes or specific industries . I also like to get short with them on occasion with the inverse funds . But like all other investment vehicles , do your homework . Not all ETFs are created equal . <p> Jacob ! A guitar pickin wise guy can never see this info in print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the debt , but well be ready for investing soon , so keep the marvy content a comin ! ! <p> My friend was recently asking me about the basics of investing , as she 's nearing the end of her debt payoff phase . I think I 'll send her here as this is a good overview for someone in her situation . <p> I go back and forth on whether to go the route of ETFs or index mutual funds . I like the low costs of ETFs &amp; lack of minimums , but there 's something nice about being able to specify a certain dollar amount to go to a mutual fund , rather than buying shares of ETFs and always being a bit off my asset allocation . <p> Thanks in advance ! Means a lot when individuals like you refer people to the site . Yeah , I think that the dollar amount is the only thing that I really miss about mutual funds , but the ETF advantages are just too great to ignore . Lower cost is first and foremost , but as you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment is usually preferential . Are you all in with mutual funds still ? <p> Yep , just mutual funds for us . I noticed with ETFs that I 'd subject myself to market timing ( trying to buy on a day , or specific time of day , that seemed like a dip ) and that 's never a good thing . Plus , since were just indexing , the costs are already pretty low ( though , as always , ought to be optimized ) . <p> Nice overview , Jacob . Currently , my wife and I have quite a bit of money in cash . We may be having some major changes coming up , so we want to have easy access to the cash if necessary . It pains me to see us getting less than 1% when the market is returning 20% , but I know its the smart move . <p> Thanks Jamie ! I 'll write about each in upcoming posts but for now just know that ETFs are usually a better option for the majority of investors .

@@44824130 @4824130/ <h> Primary Financial Markets and the Initial Public Offering <p> When you begin investing , it can be difficult to understand the complexity of financial markets . One important aspect to understand is how securities ( stocks , bonds , etc. ) are traded . <p> A capital market is where most long-term financial securities are bought and sold . Capital markets are classified as either primary or secondary , depending on whether securities are being created and sold directly to investors by the issuer ( primary market ) or resold among investors ( secondary market ) . <p> Companies and government entities sell new stock and/or bond issues on the primary market to raise capital that can be used to fund business improvements or expand operations. - The process of creating and offering new securities is very similar for stocks and bonds , although the most publicized transaction in the primary market is the initial public offering ( IPO ) . <p> The IPO marks the first public sale of a company 's stock and results in the company- being " publicly traded . " <h> The Initial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a company is first founded , the only shareholders are the founders . If the company needs to expand , - it may issue more shares to other investors , - diluting the existing ownership control. - During this time , the company and its shares are considered private . In most cases , private shares are not easily exchanged . <p> If the company needs more investment capital than private investors can offer , or if the founders want to cash out and diversify their portfolio , the company can consider an initial public offering ( IPO ) where the company stock will be sold to the public . This process transforms the business into a publicly traded company . <p> When a company decides to go public , it first must obtain the approval of its current shareholders ( the investors who own its privately issued stock ) . Next , the company 's legal team- must certify that all financial disclosure documents for the company are legitimate and updated . The company then finds an investment bank willing to underwrite the offering . This bank is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stock , and facilitating the sale of the company 's shares . <p> Before offering its securities for public sale , the issuer must register with and obtain approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . This federal regulatory agency must confirm both the adequacy and the accuracy of the information provided to potential investors. - SEC approval requires that the company file a- prospectus , which describes the key aspects of the securities to be issued , the issuer 's management , and the issuer 's financial position . <p> Once a firm files a prospectus with the SEC , a quiet period begins and the firm is limited on what it can communicate to investors . During this time , potential investors may receive a preliminary prospectus . This preliminary version is called a red herring because a notice printed in red on the front cover indicates the tentative nature of the offer . The purpose of the quiet period is to make sure that all potential investors have access to the same information about the company " that which is presented in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might provide an unfair advantage . The quiet period ends when the SEC approves the details in the firm 's prospectus . <p> Putting on a Road Show <p> After SEC approval but before the official IPO date , the underwriting investment bank begins promoting the company 's stock offering through a road show , which consists of a series of presentations to potential investors ( typically institutional investors ) around the world . In addition to providing investors with information about the new issue , the road show helps the investment bank gauge the demand for the offering and set the expected price per share . <p> The main purpose of the investment- bank during this process is to provide accurate underwriting . This involves purchasing the securities from the issuing firm at an agreed-on price and bearing the risk of reselling them to the public. - Compensation for underwriting and selling services typically comes in the form of a discount on the sale price of the securities . For example , an investment bank may pay an issuing firm $20 for the stock that investors will ultimately purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security offerings , the lead investment bank can invite other bankers to form an underwriting syndicate . The syndicate shares the financial risk associated with buying the entire offering from the issuer and reselling the new securities to the public . The lead investment bank and the syndicate members put together a selling group , normally made up of themselves and a large number of brokerage firms . <p> Selling the Shares <p> Setting the initial price per share is important for both the issuing company and the underwriting bank . <p> The issuing company is paid by the investment bank according to the underwriting process . If the issue price is too low , the IPO will sell out very quickly and price of the stock will rise on the secondary market . But because the issuing firm is only paid when the primary issue is sold to the investment bank , they will be unhappy because the issue price could have been higher. - If this issue price is too high , the investment bank loses because they might have trouble selling the entire stock issue . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set , the SEC must approve the offering before the IPO can officially take place . After approval , the IPO shares are then sold directly to investors . <p> Traditionally , almost all- of the original issue shares go to institutional investors and other special groups targeted during the road show . Individual investors are typically unable to purchase shares at the original issue price and are forced to trade on the secondary markets . For this reason , IPOs usually represent a poor investment . <p> The exception to this rule is- Motif Investing , who offers direct IPO investments to retail investors . I 'm hopeful that other banks and brokerage firms will follow suit . <h> Final Thoughts <p> This process of creating and offering new securities is very similar for stocks and bonds . Most new corporate bond issues also require an investment bank to underwrite and assist the process . <p> The market for government bonds is established- differently .

Much to my surprise , I enjoyed this little adventure ! Spring is in full bloom and it was just lovely outside . The sun was shining , the streets bustling , and the music blaring . <p> People were so happy and friendly . I walked around aimlessly for a while , people watching and people waving . During the people watching , I experienced my first Oh-Wow ! moment . I was turning the Dillard 's corner , headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of speakers coupled with some sort of enormous subwoofer .

A consumers paradise ! The combination of Friday and Easter had everyone worked into a frenzy . The first thing I spotted was a line of about 25 individuals waiting to pay . <p> The masses of people reminded me of a very important money principle . Looks are often times deceiving .

@@44824135 @4824135/ <h> People Pleasing Will Make You Poor <p> How many times have you gone and spent money that you did n't  have just to avoid conflict or that awkward conversation that would have forced you to admit that you just cant afford it ? How many times have you said " okay , I 'll do it " or " just this one last time " or any other phrase that indicates you 've lost the battle and given in ? <p> I used to struggle with this . I had trouble saying no and telling people that I did n't  want to partake in the activity or event that they had planned , even if I knew it was n't a wise decision . I did n't  want to offend anyone , or miss out on the action , so I usually just gave in. - I felt like telling them no would make them mad , or cause them to question my friendship , or make me look like a loony . I mean its obvious that everyone else can afford to go out to eat , drink , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the biggest breakthroughs in my life came when I finally found my voice . You know , the voice that allows me to stand on my own two feet , look people dead in the eye , and say no . <p> And to this day I still believe there is no financial lesson more important than learning how to handle your financial affairs without fearing the opinion of others . <h> Learning to Say No <p> One of things that eventually led to me to she 'd my people pleasing tendencies was the realization that most people do n't  actually have any money to spend . They are living on someone elses borrowed dime . Even though you might not realize it , the majority of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck , with very little saved for a rainy day . Even fewer have put aside money for retirement . <p> In other words , the people who are living it up are broke . Many have nothing to show for the lavish lifestyle except a boatload of consumer debt and a revolving credit card balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to make pointed comments or get offended when you tell them no . They tend to be judgmental about the all important phrase , " I cant afford it . " Most of their lifestyle choices are decided by- immaturity . Its the desire to look big , sound big , and talk big , despite having a very little bank account . <p> But those truths did n't  help with some of my behavioral flaws . Even though I understood that I did n't  want to live paycheck to paycheck , I also wanted to enjoy life . And some of the wisest financial decisions can be isolating because they force you to miss some of the activities that are enjoyable. - Without a doubt , especially for young people and those in debt , the best financial decisions require a cost . They require some temporary pain . They require some sacrifice . <p> But I would argue that the temporary pain- is so much less than the long term gain . Not just because you 'll start seeing a much more positive financial situation , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of worth in life , but far from it . <h> How To Change <p> There is n't a magic pill that can make transform you into a self-guided frugal master overnight . There are just lots of choices and forks in the road that require you to make difficult decisions . However , I do know a few good guidelines that continue to shape our life . Here they are . <p> Decide What You Want <p> You 'll never accomplish anything financially if you are n't  forward thinking . You have to actually consider the trade-off between immediate consumption and delayed gratification . Everything is a trade-off . <p> Each dollar you spend today is a dollar that could have been put towards a different goal . So do you know your goals ? Do you want anything beyond the current moment ? If so , you 'll have to evaluate what is most important . If not , go spend it all . <p> We decided that we wanted to pay off all of our debt ( about $20,000 ) , so we did it in about 7 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live frugally and sell crap we did n't  need ( like a car , clothes , gifts , etc . ) That was the trade-off . We had to give up a few temporary pleasures to reach a bigger and more important goal . <p> If we would n't have sold our stuff , been frugal , calculated our spending habits and lifestyle , we would have effectively been saying that we valued current consumption more than being debt free . Its- a- matter of priorities . <p> Let me say that again , where you choose to allocate your financial resources indicate where your priorities currently lie . <p> Be- More Honest <p> Once you decide that you value financial freedom- more than material possessions and the typically inflated American lifestyle , its time to put your money where your mouth is . <p> When friends , family , or complete strangers ask you to blow money , say no . You have to say no . Even if it hurts , say no . <p> Begin standing up for yourself . Explain why you cant go spend money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a- house , and that every dollar spent on overpriced meals at the local restaurant keep you that much further from your goal . You can even make it quantifiable with a debt calculator , and then explain that saving $100/month will help you pay off that debt 5 years sooner . <p> Do n't  fumble around and act like a pitiful mess . You have nothing to be ashamed of . If they say something stupid or attempt to make you feel like a fool , just smile and mention that sometimes in life , temporary sacrifices must be made for long term goals . <p> Be- Your Own Master <p> If they insult you for being open about your financial decisions or lifestyle changes , never talk to them again . If someone is so narrow minded that they ca n't respect your decision to change , they probably are n't  good company . This whole exercise will teach you a lot about the dangers of- people pleasing and caring about the opinion of fools . <p> Once you set your priorities , state your case , and stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward . <p> This means spending time with people who are open minded and who respect your financial constraints . Find the friends and family members who applaud your decisions and understand the situation . Theyll encourage you and make it easier to continue changing your financial habits . <p> This does n't  mean that you must avoid having any kind of fun . It just requires that you be conscious of spending and willing to lead . Sometimes you have to speak up and suggest a different meeting place , or a different activity , or a home-cooked meal . Good times do n't  require big money . <p> Keep in mind that you 'll always be broke trying to impress other people . A sound financial- mindset does n't  worry about what other people want . Its not a comparison to the family that lives next door . Its about your own life , your own family , and your own future . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Great postI agree , saying No was the key to our familys successes ! It is not easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but has anyone ever said success is easy ? Part of the key , from our experience , is having a plan and sticking to it .

I am a Financial Advisor , and it is amazing to me that people still are surprised that I dislike needless spending . I have found the most difficult situations for me are when family events are arranged around excessive eating and drinking . It is expected everyone will bring 15-20 bucks worth of alcohol and food stuffs ( specific brand names even ! ) . My wife and I are committed to behaving financially sound so we ask if we could eat prior to attending a get together and then not drinking anything while at the event so we are n't  mooching off others .

We definitely know where you are coming from with those situations . They happen way too often . Luckily for us , we have understanding families who know we write this blog and that we are committed to a simple lifestyle . Still , it can get challenging with friends or others who just do n't  understand . Keep at it though . The frugality will pay off , as you are well aware ! <p> Saying no is definitely a key to saving money , but sometimes it is a bit harder to cut out the people that like to spend . My parents tease us about our vacations sometimes , since well take an inside ( Cheaper ) cruise cabin rather than a balcony , but they do n't  press too hard . I definitely would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told them it seriously bothered us ( it does n't  ) I 'm sure theyd stop . <p> Youve hit the nail on the head here . Too many people spend many they do n't  have , to buy things they do n't  want , to impress people they do n't  like = <p> All joking aside , I 'm pleased to say that over the years , as I 've become more frugal , so my close personal relationships have been with more frugal people . I did n't  plan things like this ; I think we just " attract " people similar to ourselves . <p> So those friends who are always spending money ( weekends away , rounds of golf on the weekend , shopping trips etc. ) just slowly fell away while those who enjoy more frugal activities have grown ever closer to me . <p> Now I do n't  very often have to " bow out " of situations as most of my close friends and family are on a similar page to me or at least understand my frugal lifestyle enough not to get too offended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion . <p> For new years eve , we went to a prix fixe dinner at a nice gastropub . One of the people invited bowed out of dinner but still wanted to come to the countdown at our friends house afterwards .

Had we known earlier she could n't come , we would have switched dinner plans to accommodate but I think she felt bad in declining and did n't  do it until a few days prior . <p> I have bowed out of social commitments for price reasons in the past and I will continue to do so in the future . I think more of us frugal people need to be vocal about when we cant do something , and possibly offer a cheaper alternative if one exists .

My biggest takeaway is to simply decide to is of value to you . If you value financial freedom then your heart will be there and you will make the necessary sacrifices to attain the results you desire . If we cant say NO or even if we try to keep up with the Jones as the saying goes , we will leave this earth in a great deal of debt .

Yet you 'll find them chatting on their latest $300 cell phone with the $60/month unlimited everything plan , or maybe surfing the $75/month TV programming , but only if they are n't  busy dining out and having drinks <p> This post really resonates with me because I used to have trouble saying " no " and often did things or paid for things I otherwise had no interest in . Once I found my voice , I was pleasantly surprised by the reaction it received . Most people were totally fine with me not participating and it turned out to be an encouraging experience . Now I have no qualms about saying " no , " and if someone gets defensive about it , I explain calmly that I 'm just flat-out not interested . <p> I admit that sometimes I please people when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with them . I hope these tips will help me lessen this trait and eventually will not be a problem to me anymore . Thanks for posting ! <p> I love the Bill Cosby quote at the end ! This is something that I really struggle with , since I am a natural born people pleaser . Most recently I found out that I had been " assigned " at work to bring treats for the group one day . I was really frustrated because this situation of bringing treats to work was in place before I arrived so I had no say in it . And we have a ton of expenses right now because we are in the process of adopting a child . I did NOT want to waste money on feeding my coworkers . I ended up taking some apples to work that I had purchased for myself to eat- so at least I did n't  spend any more money , but I still felt frustrated that I had to do it .

@@44824136 @4824136/ <h> How is Your FICO Credit Score Calculated ? <p> Your credit score , a number ranging from 300 to 850 , represents your trustworthiness as a borrower . A higher credit score can help reduce your insurance premiums and improve your ability to qualify for new employment , housing , and loans at favorable interest rates . <p> As I shared in my previous article , individuals have a number of different credit scores . The most important type is your FICO credit score , which is used in roughly 90% of all lending decisions . <p> FICO , a private corporation , uses an algorithm to analyze your credit reports and generate a credit score for each report . Although FICO does n't  release their exact credit scoring model , they do provide a basic breakdown of the individual credit scoring factors that are considered . <p> The remainder of this article will provide a detailed explanation of the five scoring factors that are used to calculate your FICO credit score . <p> Source : myFICO <h> Payment History ( 35% ) <p> Your payment history is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lenders are most concerned about your ability to repay outstanding debts .

When a charge-off occurs , most lenders will sell your debt to a collections agency , a move that also goes on your credit report . Lenders can also pursue wage garnishment through a court judgment as a means to collect any outstanding debt . <p> While late payments will negatively affect your credit score , the charge-off process is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge-offs and collections can not . <p> Any negative remarks will remain on your credit report for seven years , except Chapter 7- bankruptcy which remains for ten years . However , the negative effect on your credit score will diminish as time goes on because recent payment history is heavily weighted in the FICO scoring model . <h> Amounts Owed- ( 30% ) <p> This category is often called credit utilization , which is the ratio of your current credit being used to your total credit available . <p> For example , if your credit card balance is $2,000 and the overall credit limit is $10,000 , your credit utilization is 20% . <p> The credit utilization for each individual account matters , but your total credit utilization across all accounts is far more important . Furthermore , revolving lines of credit ( credit cards ) are more heavily weighted in the utilization ratio than installment loans . <p> FICO and VantageScore both recommend that your credit utilization remain below 20% . Their line of thinking is that a high utilization ratio indicates an overextended credit profile , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More specifically , FICO recommends that you use maintain low credit utilization over time . They officially state , " a low credit utilization ratio will have a more positive impact on your FICO Scores than not using any of your available credit at all .

So even if you pay your credit card balances in full each month , your account balance wo n't necessarily show on your credit report as $0 .

If credit inquiry was initiated by you ( e.g. loan or credit card application ) , that is known as a " hard credit inquiry , " which affects your credit score .

@@44824138 @4824138/ <h> Honestly , Youre Far Too Generous <p> There have been multiple times in the last year that I have observed a phenomenon that I can no longer ignore . For far too long , I 've watched the guise of generosity do more harm than good , and its time to talk about it . <p> In a recent occasion , I witnessed ( first hand ) an event that involved catching up with old friends over a meal . Some of the parties involved had known each other for years and years and had simply drifted apart . As you know , life has its ways and often separates friends , family , and loved ones , so of course its always wonderful to just get together and see what 's new in life . To talk , laugh , and reminisce on the olden times back way , way ago . I do n't  object to this sort of behavior one bit . <p> But that 's where the festivity began to erode .

That time had come when everyone felt bloated and satisfied . You know what I mean , that wonderful period in between eating and actually having to acknowledge the enormous check . That period of satisfaction came to an abrupt end as the waiter uttered the infamous " How should I split the check tonight ? " <p> What came next was painful to observe . Someone did the unthinkable and decided to pay for the whole dinner . They not only paid for those overpriced meal plates , but also the appetizer(s) that was ordered by the other party without any consideration of price , the overpriced $2 soft drinks , and a quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolish . <p> Call it inside information , but I knew a fair amount about the financial status of the parties involved . I vaguely knew who was making the money , and a bit about the financial goals of those involved . <p> Without getting into gory details , just know that the party who volunteered to pay for the whole thing was being far too " generous . " The money spent on that meal was not excess cash flow , but money that was needed to fund another very important ( and soon-to-arrive ) financial goal . <p> And this was n't a once-off occasion . <h> What It All Means <p> Now please , do n't  get me wrong here . Being generous is often a wonderful thing . Helping someone in need is great . As is being kind to someone else because you care about them . <p> But let 's place a distinction between giving when you have the means , and giving when you dont. - Big difference . <p> There is also a big difference between giving because you want to help someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impress them . <p> The latter distinction in each category is worrisome . And I fear quite common . <p> There are too many people who love to raise their hand and volunteer to pay for all parties involved . Theyll pay for meals , drinks , lavish gifts , and more . The problem is that they do it for the wrong reasons . They want to impress other people , or appear well-off , or just simply to be liked . <p> But that 's not really being generous at all . Its just people pleasing . <p> Maybe the most shocking thing about it all is that recent research actually suggests that overly generous behavior can be repulsive . People pick up on the fact that generosity can be overdone and exaggerated . They do n't  want you to pay for all their bills , because that seems inherently unfair. - And it is . <p> When someone chooses to continually exercise the right to misplaced " generosity , " they simultaneously waive the ability to make sound financial decisions .

Even if the parties involved in paying were well-off it really does n't  make sense unless it is owed back or the other person is in dire straits , but at that point they should n't be eating out at inflated places to begin with . A know a number of people that will cover the whole cost of a meal because the other covered it last time or surprised them with something of equal or similar value before like a concert or sports game . <p> Ive been guilty of this behaviour in the past buying rounds of drinks at the bar , even though I knew it would n't come back to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people I was with . But you 're right , I feel uncomfortable with over-generosity so I 'm sure those who were with me felt the same way . <p> This was a wonderful post that really brought back some memories . As a military Soldier it was almost the custom for the highest ranking person to pay for drinks and meals on many of occasions during social outings . <p> Sometimes , you could see the anguish on the face of the person who was paying because they knew the meal was overpriced and there so called friends would order much than they could eat because they did not have to pay for it . Many times they really could not afford to pay for the meals . <p> I agree that sometimes people raise their hands voluntarily and offer to pay for the wrong reasons . Continuing to practice this type of behavior could be a sign of their own thought process as it relates to finances . I have learned that many people do not have a true handle on their finances and this type of behavior , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interesting post . I think if you are going out with one other person and offer to pay the tab , that 's fine as long as you are willing to let them pay for you next time . When one person insists on paying all the time , it can become awkward for the other party . Its just easier to split the bill . <p> Good post on a certain to be controversial topic . Let me ask you this situation : should you pick up the tab if you have the means , and you know you are in a superior financial situation to your peers ? <p> Although I do n't  try to make a habit of it , I find that paying for meals with friends is almost a way of saying thanks . I totally disagree with MD that there is a " generosity count " going on that needs to be reciprocated , especially among friends who do n't  see each other that often . <p> I have wrestled with this scenario a few times . I try not to eat out often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't seen for a while . <p> Some cultures , despite the commitments and financial situation , it is customary for the bill to be paid by one party . Not my culture , but I know the Chinese , its a huge part of the show and culture . They will scrimp and save on other things , but not on meals with a big group . <p> I love a fine meal so fine , that you could n't in fact make it at home , given the techniques they use . I prefer classier joints , for the atmosphere , and the increased chance there might be well behaved adults there ( and perhaps no children ) . If , in the future , I know others cant afford that restaurant , but I chose it over catering for them at home , I think its fair and not being showy , to pay for the meal . I mean you do n't  ask for money from friends when they eat at your house , or even if I order take away pizza for us all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their home , then I hope theyd feel it was equal . <p> Your post hits me . I like giving and helping someone in need because I stand in the saying that it is better to give than to receive . However , sometimes I 'm a people pleaser . I go for fancy places or order expensive foods just to be " in " . How I wish I stop being one . <p> If " it is better to give than to receive " , this automatically places the recipient in a worse position than the giver . It means when somebody gives me something and I receive it , they are by their own volition but not by mine making themselves better than me . My question is : why value one act higher than the other ? Giving and receiving are actually two ends of the same thing , so how can one be better than the other ? In fact , the giver has a moral responsibility to consider the position of the recipient because the giver has a choice . The recipient has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are happy to have their gifts turned down . <p> The only thing wrong here is the " this was n't a once-off occasion . " If someone does this too often , then it can become a burden and make others feel uncomfortable . However , as a PhD student on a tight budget who sees their oldest , dearest friends about once a year or less , I love being able to pick up the check for entire meal or a night full of drinks . I budget for this and only do it once every year or two . All of the people I am with are professionals and could do the sameand some of them do . Lastly , I disagree with the comment from MD about expecting reciprocation . Giving to family/friends should never have strings attachedyou will be disappointed . The rest of MDs points are spot on . <p> Loved your post Jacob . " People pick up on the fact that generosity can be overdone and exaggerated . They do n't want you to pay for all their bills , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many such " generous " people if not all is that in case " similar " generosity is not reciprocated at some other occasion by someone else , the people who were generous before feel like they got the unfair deal ( which was self-inflicted btw ) . There are very few people who are generous in such occasions without any reciprocity expectations whatsoever . So with the " self-inflicted " emotional and financial pain along with causing awkwardness to others involved AND an opportunity for pricey restaurants and other venues to rip us off in the name of family/friends reunions , it is not worth it . The best way would be to choose cheaper/smarter venues where people with all financial statuses feel equally comfortable and are able to fully enjoy without awkwardness and where the cost is fairly split among all thereby protecting the " self-respect " of every involved individual . Such a nice experience would also encourage the friends/family to meet more often and stay in touch once the process has been set . For those who are very well off and wish to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within friends/family where the generosity can be positively used without being generous on pricey venues/restaurants , which are out and out profit making organizations . <p> Such an outstanding comment MD . Youve gone beyond what I was able to convey and added a few more excellent points . I could n't agree more about it creating an odd environment which can lead to hard feelings or resentment . The same holds true with family , especially when these decisions put one or more groups in an awkward or uncomfortable place with no way out !

To make matter worse , existing robo-advisors , such as Wealthfront and Betterment , will not manage these employer-provided plans . <p> Blooom was created to bridge this gap , offering a completely automated investing solution for- employer-sponsored plans. - Blooom is a registered investment advisory ( RIA ) which acts as a fiduciary on your behalf , optimizing and maintaining your retirement accounts for $10/month . <h> How Does Blooom Work ? <p> When you sign up from Blooom , you connect your eligible retirement accounts and the service uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze and optimize your investment portfolio . <p> Here is a nice overview of the process : <p> You still own and maintain control of all accounts , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your behalf . By law , Blooom is not allowed to take any money out of your retirement accounts , but they are allowed to manage your investments . <p> In essence , the Blooom approach to investing can be boiled down to five steps : <p> Your Blooom advisor reviews and approves the recommended portfolio , which is then implemented by Blooom on your behalf . <p> Steps 1-4 are automated by the Blooom algorithm , while the last step can require manual effort . This entire process usually takes less than 10 days to implement ( but never longer than 30 days , according to Blooom ) . <p> Its important to note that you maintain control of your retirement plan , and you can request plan changes directly through your plan administrator. - Blooom will advise you any time changes are made in your account , whether those changes were initiated by you or Blooom . <h> Continued Blooom Support <p> Once the portfolio is established , Blooom provides ongoing support at no additional cost . <p> In addition to maintaining your portfolio , Blooom offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certified financial advisors on staff to answer any money-related questions that you may have via email or chat . <p> Our contact at Blooom has emphasized that this support is not limited to investment questions . You can ask about anything related to your finances and their team will make every attempt to provide an accurate , easy-to-understand response . Because Blooom acts as a fiduciary ( must legally put your interest first ) , this advice should be sound . <p> The ongoing investment management and personalized financial advice are included in the- $10/month fee . <h> Bloooms Investment Process <p> I recently went through the Blooom onboarding process , and my experience is detailed below . <p> The wider the gap between your current age and target retirement age , the larger the recommended allocation to stocks . As you approach your desired retirement date , Blooom automatically shifts the asset allocation in your retirement account toward bonds . <p> Step 2 ) Connect your retirement account(s) <p> The next step is connecting your retirement account(s) . <p> When you search for your plan provider , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blooom can connect to your account . <p> Step 3 ) Review portfolio recommendations <p> After you connect your retirement account , Blooom reviews your existing investment portfolio . This review is free for everyone , and payment is not required to view the Blooom portfolio recommendations . <p> You will first be presented with Bloooms analysis of your existing portfolio . <p> The three areas of concern for Blooom are asset allocation , diversification , and fees . In my example , - Blooom does n't  care for my allocation to U.S. large-cap stocks . <p> When you click next , Blooom will then recommended a diversified portfolio that utilizes the investments available in your specific retirement plan . <p> Here you can see that Blooom recommends a diversified blend of stocks , with no allocation to bonds . Given my age , Blooom is obviously favoring the growth potential of stocks in the portfolio , although such an aggressive asset allocation will make some investors uncomfortable . <p> If you are unhappy with the recommended allocation , clicking next will allow you to change your desired asset allocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most conservation allocation shown by Blooom is 80% stocks , 20% bonds , but Blooom wont allow me to select this allocation . The most conservative allocation supported by Blooom is 84% stocks , 16% bonds . <p> Its clear that- Bloooms algorithm heavily favors stocks if you have an investment time horizon of 20 years or more . This decision is understandable because stocks have provided superior investment returns over long periods of time , but many investors simply can not stomach the volatility that accompanies a 100% stock portfolio . <p> Step 4 ) Begin service <p> After reviewing Bloooms portfolio recommendations , you will be asked to provide your credit/debit card information to complete the process . <p> If you decide to complete the onboarding , Blooom will immediately begin making the recommended changes in your retirement account . <h> Blooom Fees <p> Blooom charges a flat $10/month , regardless of account size. - The monthly fee can be paid by debit or credit card . <p> Cash Cow Couple readers will receive their first month free through our link . <p> There are no contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time without penalty . <h> Blooom Account Options <p> Blooom supports the following types of accounts : <p> 401(k) <p> 403(b) <p> 401(a) <p> 457 <p> Thrift Savings Plan ( TSP ) <p> It does n't  matter where you work , or where the account is held. - If you can access your retirement account online , Blooom should be compatible . <h> Blooom Limitations <p> Limited Scope Blooom manages every linked retirement account separately using the 5-step process previously described . The algorithm is not designed to consider any outside investment accounts or your overall investment portfolio , which- can be problematic in certain situations . <p> There are other stock and bond funds available , but the average expense ratio ( roughly 1% annually ) is ridiculous when compared to the S&amp;P 500 index fund ( 0.02% annually ) . Instead of allocating a portion of my retirement plan to these overpriced asset classes , - I invest in similar funds ( with lower expenses ) within my IRA accounts to maintain my overall desired asset allocation . <p> Bloooms algorithm sees a diversification problem because it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such problem exists . If you have accounts that are not managed by Blooom , you can partially remedy this problem by using a free Personal Capital account to calculate your overall asset allocation and fees . <p> Limited Risk Profiling In each investment account , the target asset allocation is determined by your current age and desired retirement age. - This makes partial sense because Blooom focuses exclusively on retirement accounts , where the assumed investment objective is retirement . <p> However , age has very little to do with risk tolerance . An investor can be risk-averse or risk-tolerant , whether young or old , but this information is not captured by Blooom in their asset allocation recommendation . Instead , Blooom allows investors to adjust the recommended asset allocation manually . <h> Blooom Review Summary <p> If you need help managing your employer-sponsored retirement plan , Blooom is a great hands-off solution . After connecting your account(s) , Blooom manages and maintains your investment portfolio for a flat $10/month . There are no hidden fees or surprise charges . <p> For the most part , Bloooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and low-cost index investing , both of which are supported by years of investment research . The only potential downside is oversimplification , as the service fails to consider outside investment accounts . <p> If you 'd like to have Blooom analyze or manage your retirement account , they are offering our readers one month of free service . <p> Thank you for reading my Blooom review . If you have used the service , please share your- experience with a comment below . <p> Blooom Review 2017 <p> Summary <p> Blooom will manage all of your employer-sponsored retirement plans for $10/month . Although there are some important limitations , you will have a hard time finding a better solution elsewhere . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> I used Blooom ( do n't  forget the extra " O " ! ) for a few months and I really liked it . I think they made my portfolio a little too diversified for my taste so I simplified it and decided I could rebalance on my own . I do n't  use it anymore but I do recommend it to my colleagues who cant be bothered with managing their 401k. 
@@44824140 @4824140/ <h> Understanding How the Stock Market Works <p> I cringe when I hear news- commentators talk about " the market . " They often describe a- mythical beast that ca n't be tamed . Its up , its down , its a bull , no its a bear ! <p> Because of this coverage , stock market investing is- often very misunderstood . Many- Americans equate the- stock market to " Wall-Street " , or insider trading , or rocket science that ca n't be understood . These misconceptions often result- in a costly mistake failing to invest in equity markets altogether . <p> But none of that is true . <p> The market is usually just slang for the stock market . And when you hear people reference either , they are usually commenting on whether the market is up or down . If someone says that the market is up , they mean that the stocks that make up the market have increased in value for the day . So to better understand the stock market , let 's look at its composition . <p> What 's a Stock ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock in a company , you actually own a portion of that company . Because of that fact , you have the right ( but not obligation ) to attend the shareholder 's meetings , vote on important company decisions ( like the board of directors ) , and you have a right to collect a share of any future company earnings . Most people choose to own stock for the last reason alone . <p> Company earnings can be retained for growth , or paid to shareholders . Typically , - smaller firms and high-growth firms choose- ( with the permission shareholders ) to reinvest the dividends to help the company grow faster . That usually leads to increased stock prices , and the possibility of greater dividends in the future . Other companies choose to consistently pay dividends each year to shareholders . <p> The driving force behind all stock ownership is the right to claim a portion of the earnings produced by a profitable company . Strong earnings lead to more investor interest , which leads to higher stock prices . <p> Stock Exchanges <p> Stocks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) and the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System ( NASDAQ ) . Each of these exchanges has its own rules and regulations that govern which companies can be listed on the exchange . <p> None if that really matters because do n't  have to know which stock is listed on what exchange . If you invest in ETFs or index mutual funds through a fantastic company like Wealthfront , or use a discount online broker such as Optionshouse , its all done for you . <p> Indexes <p> Individual stocks are grouped together to form an index . The index is then tracked and often used as a general reference for overall stock prices . <p> For example , The Dow Jones Industrial Average ( The DJIA or The Dow ) , The Standard &amp; Poors 500 ( The S&amp;P 500 ) , and the NASDAQ Composite Index ( The NASDAQ ) are all famous indexes that are often times quoted as a reflection of ( you guessed it ! ) " The Market . " <p> They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted average of 30 significant stocks in the U.S. <p> The- S&amp;P- 500- is a- stock market index composed- of the 500 largest and most important companies- publicly traded- in the U.S. stock market . <p> The NASDAQ- is both an index and an exchange . The- stock market index is composed- of the- common stocks- and similar securities- listed on the- NASDAQ- exchange , and has over 3,000 components . It is highly followed in the U.S. as an indicator of the performance of stocks of technology companies and growth companies . <p> These indexes and many others are useful beyond market tracking . They form the basis of sound passive investing . Research shows that " index investing " outperforms active stock trading over the long haul . Index investing literally means buying shares of an ETF or mutual fund that is tied a specific index . So the investor owns a portion of each company inside that index . I 'll write more on index investing in an upcoming article . <p> Stock Pricing <p> Stock prices fluctuate each day based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . If stock owners begin selling a stock , and others are n't  willing to purchase , its price will go down until it reaches a point when buyer demand increases to meet seller supply . If potential investors all want to purchase a stock , and none of the current stock owners are selling , the price will be driven up . <p> The important thing to remember here is that day to day stock pricing is volatile ( difficult to predict and wild ) . The stock market moves up and down like a yo-yo . This should make you scared of trading , not investing . There is a huge difference . Trading involves temporary guesswork , its nothing but a gamble . Investing is a long term process that involves purchasing ownership in companies with the intent to hold for long periods of time . Research shows that investing is much more profitable than trading . <p> Investing is inherently tied to the true value of a company . Value is often determine by profits , growth , and other technical information . Well guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which creates room for lots of speculation and volatility in the stock market . <p> If a company reports lower than expected quarterly profits or a temporary production setback , traders get scared and sell . If a company reports spectacular growth , traders want to buy , pushing prices higher . <p> This is how the market also behaves on the whole . If the economy reports slow growth or high unemployment , traders get uneasy and sell . This causes the entire stock market to drop . It does n't  have anything to do with a specific company , its just knee jerk reactions by millions of people who are far too worried about trying to pick stocks and day trade . A habit which , according to research , results in huge trading costs and much lower overall returns than those who just buy and hold for the long run . <p> This is why a long term approach is crucial . There is no need to worry about temporary swings because the value of stocks have always increased as the earnings of the underlying companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in the U.S , as have the dividends paid by successful companies . In fact , stock market returns have averaged more than 10% per year over the last century . <p> In summary , be an investor , not a trader . Long term investing is profitable . You do n't  need to try to pick winning stocks or time the stock market . Simply- choose a few good index- funds- and let your investments to grow . It works , and its easy enough . <p> I hope that understanding how the stock market works is no longer a mystery to you .

You have to believe that ( regardless of what pundits , friends , and doom-and-gloomers say ) the stock market will continue to function as it always has : a bumpy ride , but always with an upward trend .

I 'd love to get your opinion <p> Thanks Brad ! Glad you enjoyed it . By weighted average I 'll assume you mean market capitalization-weighted indices ? There are several weighted options out there now Fundamental , market-cap , etc . Anyhow here are my thoughts : 1 ) An Equal Weight Index will give more " weight " to smaller or midsize capitalization stocks RELATIVE to the corresponding market cap weighted index . This applies whether its sector specific or broad market . 2 . When smaller capitalized companies and mid-cap companies perform better than the broad market ( they have in recent years ) , then an equal weight index will do better than its market cap weighted equivalent . 3 ) Equal weight indices have higher internal stock turnover , which leads to higher transaction fees and overall expense ratio . Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 ) Any outperformance of the equal weighted index can and will be eroded by the additional costs required to achieve that outperformance. 5 ) IMO Stick with market weight . If you want smaller cap exposure ( which has outperformed large caps in recent years ) , buy the corresponding ETF ( ie. VO , VB , VXF ) . This strategy has proven more effective over the long haul than equal weight indices , mostly because of the lower expense ratios . <p> Great article Jacob . One of the best introductions to the stock market that I 've read . <p> There 's not much I can add , apart from a brief concern about quantitative easing . <p> One of the strongest drivers of stock market prices is the extra liquidity caused by printing money . Governments around the world have printed so much money that stock prices no longer reflect the underlying earning abilities of the companies . <p> Recently , when the US Federal Reserve hinted that it may eventually reduce the rate at which it prints money , the stock market plunged . <p> Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until the music stops . <p> Thanks Stuart ! I do n't  disagree with you one bit , but I try not to worry about the Fed and printing consequences . We do n't  know what theyll do , and we do n't  know how the markets will respond . The best thing for the average investor to do is commit to long term index investing and try to buy more when the market tanks . There are n't  many other options right now , except maybe physical real estate . But that 's a whole other beast .

Thanks again ! <p> I 'm trying to figure out how to best utilize my card for the Amazon quarters . I see that Amazon gift cards are included in the third and fourth quarters and that Amazon gift cards are included in this offer . It seems the most obvious route to use during these quarters is purchasing Amazon gift cards to get the 5% discount that doubles . I also wonder if I 'd get the $5 off discount for reloading atleast $100 onto the card for an additional 5% off Anyways , if I purchase this gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift card will I still receive 5% off after I guess double-dipping so to speak or should I save the giftcard balances I plan to purchase next year when the deal ends and use my Discover card to get like 25% off with subscribe and save ? thanks ! <p> When you click through on the Discover Deals portal , one of the listed conditions is " Pay with your Discover Card " . They used to not enforce it , but I would n't be surprised if they can do so now quite easily ( I 'm sure they could before , but maybe did n't  care enough ? ) . Rather than just applying the cashback percentage to the transaction amount reported by the retailer , presumably Discover Deals ( the portal ) is owned/affiliated with the Discover Card , and so the Card can verify that at least some portion of the purchase through the Deal portal was paid for with a Discover Card , and thus only apply the reward to the portion paid with the card . What I 'm a little worried about is if they deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods , so for example if you make a $52 purchase at Sears and pay with $2 in Shopyourway points about to expire , the right way to do it would be to apply the bonus to the remaining $50 . Or if you did the reverse , $2 on the card and $50 in points , you would get a bonus only on the $2 . However , none at all of my Discover Deals click throughs for Sears or Kmart in the past month have shown up . Almost all have had at least a few bonus points applied . so I dread that its because of that . I do n't  mind for the ones mostly paid with points , but if its a few points and a lot of Discover Card $ and they deny the whole thing , that would suck . <p> Would someone be able to provide a list of merchant gift cards from Discovers reward program ? I current have the Chase Freedom card and the program changed to only redeeming gift cards and air flights . The list of merchant gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We love the Discover It card ! And we also use the Chase Freedom card . My husband drives almost 100 miles round trip to work , so we get to have 5% cash back 3/4 of the year while using both of these cards . You cant beat free cash . <p> What ? Driving a hundred miles per day gets you 5% cash back for 9 months a year ? I guess I am missing something as I am driving 90+ miles per day for work and not getting that deal . Should I contact the DMV or the credit card companies ? <p> I think this card is greatIm like my Discover card for sure . I always use the shopdiscover feature if I 'm buying something online and I like that you can redeem for gift cards for greater value . I often get the staples gift cards $20 for a $25 gift card . Discover also has useful rotating 5% categories . 
@@44824144 @4824144/ <p> More college graduates are struggling to make student loan payments than you might think . The current total outstanding student loans is $1.41 trillion ! It 's one of the highest forms of personal debt , second only to mortgages , and the default rate climbed to over 11% in 2016 . <p> One way to reduce this burden is- by refinancing student loans to a longer repayment period and a potentially lower interest rate . <p> While student loan refinancing ca n't prevent every default , it can potentially lower the rate as cash-strapped borrowers are given more time to repay their balance beyond the standard 10-year repayment term . Many students think the only discount they receive on student loans is the 0.25% interest rate reduction when they schedule automated payments . In reality , that is far from the case . <h> Benefits of Refinancing Student Loans <p> There are two primary benefits of choosing private student loan refinancing : lower interest rates and extended repayment terms . Let 's look at how you can benefit from both . <p> Lower Interest Rates <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may qualify for an interest rate that is significantly lower than your current rates . It 's also possible to secure a lower interest rate by selecting shorter repayment terms when refinancing . <p> For example , choosing a 5-year variable rate loan can give you an interest rate as low as 2.43% . Typically , the shorter your repayment term the lower the interest rate you will pay for both fixed and variable rate loans . That means extra money in your pocket because of a smaller total interest charge . Keep in mind that banks and tech lenders often use different underwriting criteria , and some research is required to make the informed decision . Interest rates are heavily dependent on creditworthiness , so it literally pays to compare the different rate ranges in the refinancing marketplace . <p> Longer Repayment Term <p> If you are currently struggling to make your monthly loan payment on the standard 10-year repayment plan , extending the term to 15 or 20 years will reduce the payment to a more manageable amount . Keep in mind , you will end up paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , due to the additional interest charged , but it is still better than risking default and damaging your credit score . <p> Private refinancing does n't add to the cost of your existing student loan balance like federal consolidation loan does . When you consolidate your federal student loans with the government , your new interest rate will be a weighted average of your old loans rounded up to the nearest one-eighth of a percent . <p> With private student loan refinancing , you might not pay any application or origination fees . Also , if you can pay your refinanced loans off early , you will not be assessed a prepayment penalty . <p> Private &amp; Federal Loans Can Be Refinanced Together <p> While private refinancing has historically been reserved only for private student loans , most refinancing lenders will now allow you to combine your private and federal loans together into a new private student loan . This can be a great money-saving opportunity if you do not plan on using the federal student loan benefits such as forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans . <p> Interest Rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can also receive a 0.25% interest rate reduction when you schedule automated monthly payments . Plus , enrolling in automated payments reduces the risk of forgetting to make a payment and getting charged a late fee as well as possibly damaging your credit score . <p> Paid Interest is Tax-Deductible <p> Even though refinanced student loans are a brand new loan , they are still considered a student loan by the IRS . This means you will receive Form 1098E each tax year stating the amount of interest paid on your refinanced student loans . You can deduct this paid interest just like you currently deduct the interest paid on your original federal and private student loans . <h> Do You Qualify for Private Student Loan Refinancing ? <p> You might be curious if you qualify for student loan refinancing . While there are several variables that are considered for any credit application , here are a few ways to improve your chances of getting approved for the best refinancing terms . <p> Have a Loan Balance of at least $5,000 <p> First and foremost , you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some lenders require at least $10,000 . <p> Have Good Credit <p> Since private refinancing is underwritten by a private lender , you will need a decent credit score of at least 600 to qualify . Having a score of 700 or higher will help you qualify for the lowest interest rates on your desired repayment term . <p> Use a Cosigner <p> Depending on your credit score , you might need a cosigner to qualify for the best interest rates when refinancing your student loans . Using a cosigner with a higher credit score means the lender will use his or her score to help determine the interest rate . As the primary borrower , you are still responsible for making the monthly payments , but if you do n't make the payment , your cosigner will be expected to make the payment instead . <p> After at least 12 months of consistent payments , your lender may allow you to release your cosigner while allowing you to keep the same low interest rate for the remainder of the repayment term . <h> How to Start Refinancing Student Loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest rates of the top lenders . If they qualify , they could soon be saving thousands of dollars in interest charges because of lower interest rates . And , they could stop the struggle of making their high monthly payments as well . 
@@44824145 @4824145/ <h> How To Be Successful In High School <p> Were you successful in high school ? What does success look like ? Would you change the experience if you could ? <p> There is more freedom in every aspect of life during high school . You can now drive , play sports , join clubs , get a real job , and even take college courses. - With all of these possibilities , - how do you make the right choices ? <p> I 'm only in my twenties , - but when I look back at my years in high school , I 'm always somewhat disappointed in myself . I could done , and been , so much more . I neglected some of the most important aspects of high school in favor of wasting time and acting like a child . <p> In this post , I hope to persuade high school students to think about the future . I also want to motivate parents to better lead their high school children in the right direction . <h> On Learning <p> I 'll begin by saying that I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my years in high school . The decisions made will affect the rest of your life . I- graduated valedictorian of my class , but still missed the mark in so many ways . <p> In high school its perfectly acceptable to be average . And average now means that you attend class . That 's the first problem in our education system . Its far too easy to just get by . <p> I made the commitment to get good grades in high school , and finished with a perfect grade point average . If you want to go to college and wont commit to anything else in this article , commit to doing the work required to get As in high school . Great grades will lead to great opportunities in college . <p> Along with grades , your overall ACT score is probably of equivalent importance . - If you 'll put in the work to study , you 'll be rewarded with a lot of scholarship money . I did n't  study near as much as I should have for the test , but- still managed to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride scholarship in college is with excellent grades and a good ACT score . That combination landed me a couple of full-ride scholarship offers . <p> Take every college credit you can during high school . They are often free or really cheap and you 'll be able to use all of those credits as you begin college . Its pretty easy to graduate with a bachelors degree in 3 years if you bring in a number of college credits . I wish I had been able to take more , but at least I managed to finish English I/II and College Algebra . <p> Standardized tests are n't  the only measurement ( might not be a measurement at all ) for intelligence and growth . What will an A in gym class or geography do for you ? Not much . Which leads me into my greatest high school failure . <p> The most important thing a high school student can learn is the importance of critical thinking . There was very little critical thinking in the- classes that I took , and I took the toughest courses- offered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grade . But that did very little for me in life . It was n't challenging and it did n't  force me to grow or think . <p> Start reading ( a lot ) outside the classroom . I sure wish I would have . Reading ( mostly ) non-fiction books about topics that interest you will make you a better person , and a more intelligent human being . Its my opinion that reading consistently will teach you how to be successful in high school and in life . <p> The overwhelming number of available books is rather astounding . You could read every day of your life and never run out of high quality literature . That 's why its so important to start reading ASAP . You 'll quickly find topics that you are drawn into , and when that happens , you 'll be dangerously close to finding a personal passion which you should follow into a career . <p> Speaking of personal passion , one of the only fiction books I 'd recommend is The Alchemistby Paulo Coelho . <p> If you 're interested in personal finance , I 'd recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its a fantastic starting point and will teach you almost everything you need to know about personal finance . <p> If History is your thing , check out A Century of War . Its challenging and will stretch the mind . <p> If you need additional recommendations , - just leave a comment or shoot me an email . I 'd love to hear other book recommendations from readers . <h> On Working <p> I had a few jobs in high school . I sacked groceries at Price Cutter a few summers . I also ended up mowing lawns in some capacity nearly every summer . I bought and sold stuff on Craigslist. - All of those jobs were fine . I learned something new from each of them , but I 'd recommend a different path to my younger self . <p> Continuing on the read , read , read bandwagon , I 'd try to find a way to monetize ( make money doing ) something that you 're passionate about . There are a million ways to do that. - You have to remember that anything you can see , touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't  have to reinvent the wheel , just learn how they do it and improve on their successes . <p> If you like technology , learn how to build computers or fix electronic equipment , or set up routers and wireless networks . <p> Enjoy cars ? Install stereo equipment for your peers , or start a detailing business , or learn how to buy and sell used cars . <p> Have a career path you 're interested in learning more about ? Get out there and ask for an unpaid internship . You 'll learn a ton and if it works out , you 'll have a much easier time navigating college and finishing early . <p> High school is a perfect time to try something new , take a risk , or even start a business . <h> On Sports and Other Activities <p> I played sports my entire life . I have two older brothers , so I grew up with a ball in my hand . To this day , I have mixed emotions about the whole thing . <p> On one hand , I learned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and dedication . I realized that you should n't just quit when things get tough . I learned the importance of encouragement as positive reinforcement for team members ( took me way too many years ) . I stayed in good condition and benefited from the exercise . And , possibly most important of all , I developed a competitive edge and a drive to- succeed . <p> On the other hand , I do n't  know if I can count the number of- hours spent in or around sports . It will suffice to say that sports took up a good chunk of my life- until I stopped playing in college . In high school , I played year round , often several hours per day . Because of sports , I may have had a few priorities out of whack . <p> Many parents and students view- athletics as being the most important thing in life . This phenomenon starts before high school and continues into adulthood . I knew so many people in high school who cared about nothing more than their next sporting event . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other activities , like learning and thinking about a career . <p> Do n't  ever underestimate the importance of being a learner . The ability to learn and think will far outlast the ability to throw/catch/dunk a ball. - Financially speaking , studying will usually be far more rewarding to the average high school student . Its much easier to obtain a full ride scholarship for grades than it is for sports . I know because I had a partial scholarship to play soccer in college and multiple full ride offers for my grades . <p> At the very least , consider all your options and decide carefully on where you choose to spend your precious time . Every hour spent at a sporting event is one less hour spent elsewhere . <h> On Socializing <p> I remember how tough high school relationships could be . I was the skinny , average sized guy who was pretty good at soccer and golf , but that did n't  carry much weight in the halls . I had a few friends , but man it was all so touchy . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other inmates . For some reason , many students just refused to get along . <p> And so everyone competes in an effort to be " cool , " which leads to immature actions and a lot of gossiping . Just walk away from it all . None of it matters and no one will care about the high school rumors after graduation . Its far more important to be honest , fair , and willing to learn . <p> Try to make real , genuine friends . Look for people who are honest and trustworthy ( smart and driven wont hurt either ) . There is a chance you 'll stay lifelong friends , but the odds are n't  in your favor . All that to say , treat people well and try to make the most of every situation , but never get too caught up in trying to be cool . Focus on learning and developing skills that will last a lifetime . <p> I 'm not sure if video games are still the big hit with high schoolers like they were for my friends . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else . Some months I would probably average 3 hours of playing per day . That 's insane ! I was borderline addicted and I wasted so many hours . <p> Do n't  be like me . Video games wont teach you how to be successful in high school or in life . If you enjoy video games , figure out a way to manage your time . There are so many more important things to do and learn . I 'm not saying to avoid all video games ( or other forms of entertainment ) . - I loved playing those games and have a lot of fond memories with my friends . I 'm just stressing the importance of time management . <p> In the end , your time is so very important . <h> Wrap Up <p> Let 's end with- a high school photo , so you can see how cool I was . <p> That 's my guide on how to be successful in high school . Please share- your thoughts below 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> You have given a lot of good advice here Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to my college years and adult life so much . Dual enrollment has been a huge money saver for me something every high schooler should do ! Thanks ! <p> Wow , really , really good post . You touched on a number of topics that resonate with your readers , including me . <p> I 100% did not read enough . I was lazy . I enjoyed and did well in the sciences , but reading never interested me much during high school . It took until grad school before I found an appreciation for it , but now that we have kids and the evenings are our only quite/free time I just do n't  have the motivation to pick up a book right now . Quick reads in the form of news/blogs are all I 'm into for now . <p> I 'm a big advocate of sports for a number of reasons not the least of which are the health and social aspects . Keeping a balanced lifestyle is important to us as my wife and I both have graduate degrees and actually met on our collegiate track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you are but I can tell you that as an adult , I carry many of the lessons I learned back then . The one about taking college credit is especially important since I did it . Between AP classes and college classes , I entered my freshman year of college an entire semester ahead . Had I not purposefully been a double major , I would have graduated early , saving a good bit of money . <p> In high school , I did the rest , too , except for the job . My parents would n't let me work during the school year no matter how hard I begged . I was just talking to a classmate about that , too . The importance of working in high school . Its the beginning of many good habits . <p> These are all great lessons to learn and I wish that I wouldve learned them in high school as well . As much time as sports took up for me I think it was all worth it . My best friends , to this day , I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great work ethic . Could I have done better in high school , sure , but I do n't  think I 'd change a thing . <p> I 'm with you on the sports part . That took up so much time . I was just thinking through those years myself and one thing I should have done ( but did n't  because it was n't " cool " ) was forensics . Public speaking and being able to express yourself is a great skill to have that I neglected because no one wants to stand out in high school . As they say , " Education is wasted on the young . " <p> Wow , once again we agree completely , Jacob ! High school in this country is a complete joke . Kids are totally unprepared for life and college . I was so bored in high school . I could easy get As and Bs without studying at all and just zoned out in all my classes and did my homework and test prep in the morning before school started . Weak ! I feel like I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder when I got to college to make up for it . <p> I guess your school was much different from mine . We had plenty of challenging classes that required critical thinking , and I very much enjoyed those . I was able to take those because I was done with high school math by my sophomore year so I had a bit more flexibility . It also allowed me to goof off a little my senior year where my last semester I took Swimming and Lifesaving , Athletic Weight Training and had early release ( I got a little far ahead on my course work early on ) . It made for a very relaxing semester before heading off to college to become an Aerospace Engineering . I do n't  regret taking it easy that semester since I did n't  have an easy semester until after college ! I would say your advice is pretty much spot on and as much as it would be nice to think most high school kids would pay attention to it , they probably wo n't ( those darn kids ! ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paths then this post is totally worth it ! <p> Maybe I overstated it a bit , but I do n't  feel like most high school courses are challenging based on my experience and feedback from others . That 's great if you had some though . Thanks for the thoughtful comment . Glad you enjoyed the article . <p> Jacob , I found myself getting all pumped up and a bit emotional during this post . I want to comment on it all , but I have to say that I think the advice you offer for high school students is top notch . I wish I too had someone sit me down and tell me how important those formative years were . I played sports ( great but not really that big of an impact on my life now ) . Many of the current students I teach in elementary are at practices almost every night of the week and games on weekends . There is little time to develop outside interests and parents want their sons to be starting quarterbacks and pitchers . The change of that happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I love what you said . If I had been reading as much in my teens as I was in my late 20s and into my 30s , I would have " figured it all out " a lot sooner . My list of books is too long to list here . I believe you have a character limit ! If I could say what makes the most difference with my students who succeed and those who just coast along , it is reading . Those who read write better , think better , and make better connections between ideas . Ok , I 'll stop here , but I think this post is so very , very important . Thank you for writing it . <p> A poignant post , Jacob and beautifully rendered . I wish I knew too . I am 43 and I have some young guitar students who are very bright and have completed many hours worth of college credit in HS , and for that I am sincerely happy . But I missed the boat there and paid loans until April of this year .

I never had any problems with customer service and they are open 24/7 . The cool thing about the serve card when using bill pay . Instead of waiting two or three business days for a regular checking account to deduct the money out of your account . The serve card does it automatically . When you hit send money to whatever bill you 're going to pay , the money is out of your account . Its a good way to know how much money you have in your account after buying or paying a bill .

Special promos too , just recently received a email saying if i spend 150 this month I will receive a $10 credit . Its a great card for someone trying to stay away from the regular checking and saving accounts . Someone on a budget and does n't  want to pay 12 0r 15 a month on fees .

If I want to send money to someone , does the prospective money receiver need to have a serve account as well in order to receive money from me ? I would think she/he needs to have a serve account but who knows . <p> Actually , I tested this out and YES the receiver needs to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email is sent to the receiver informing them to receive the money they need to log into their Serve account or create one . <p> I 'm sorry Jacob but can you verify some things for me ? I 'm not understanding completely . <p> I see this is useful for CC signup bonuses as you discussed . Is the 1k limit per month per credit/debit card , or per account ? In other words can I add multiple cards to the Serve in the same month ? <p> As far as using the Serve to pay off a different credit card in your example , the advantage there is its an easy way to liquidate the money on the Serve card , correct ? <p> You can also use serve to earn CC rewards on stuff you otherwise could n't run on a CC , correct ? Using : bank account -&gt; credit card -&gt; Serve -&gt; Serve Bill Pay flow , you can earn points on anything from rent , to utilities that do n't  accept ( or charge extra for ) credit card payments , correct ? Rent is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my bank account so he shouldnt have any problems receiving from the Serve bill pay . <p> Hey Tim . Its $1k per Serve account , per calendar month . You can switch cards in between , but they often require verification which is a pain . And yes , Serve is excellent because you can " spend " $1k on your credit card to earn rewards , then easily liquidate that money by withdrawing it , paying credit card bills directly , or even sending money to an individual . <p> Hi Jacob your awesome I love your way of writing . just a quick question does the 1000$ load from a credit card work with the English calendar month meaning if I finish loading my 1000$ on the 29th of June can I start again on the 1st of July or do I have to wait a full month from the last 1000$ load ? ? ? 
@@44824148 @4824148/ <h> Leverage the Roth IRA for Your Childs College Education <p> I recently completed a pro-bono financial plan for an individual here in Texas . One of the sections that was covered was education planning . This is very common and most parents ( or grandparents ) have at least considered setting aside funds to help pay for a childs ( or grandchilds ) education . <p> In the education section of my report , I recommended against the use of a 529 plan or any of the other dedicated education vehicles in favor of the Roth IRA . This article will explain why . <p> Which- vehicles are commonly used to fund educational expenses ? <p> 529 Plans are commonly used for education planning purposes . They actually work much like a Roth account . After-tax dollars are used to fund the account , and earnings compound tax free . All- distributions are tax free if the money is used for qualified educational expenses . But if the 529 money is used for anything else , all earnings are taxed as ordinary income and subject to a 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some States provide an income tax deduction for funds contributed to a 529 plan . <p> Coverdell ESA accounts- are quite- similar to 529 plans , with two major differences . They can be used for elementary , secondary , and post-secondary educational expenses . So if you want to send your children to a private high school or something similar , they are attractive . The other major difference is that you are only able to contribute $2,000 per year per beneficiary . This low limit is what pushes most people away , and you can forget about setting aside a large lump sum . <p> Regular Taxable Accounts are sometimes used as well . After-tax dollars are put in the account and invested . That money can be used for any purpose , at any time . There are no tax advantages and the money inside does not grow tax-deferred or tax free. - As a result , taxable accounts should n't be used if the sole purpose is education funding . <p> Roth IRA accounts are technically a retirement account , but they are sometimes used for education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roth IRA does n't  receive an up-front tax deduction like a Traditional IRA , but all growth is tax-free and qualified distributions taken after age 59.5 are tax free . The result is no tax-drag on the funds inside . If funds are withdrawn before age 59.5 for educational expenses , you can still avoid the 10% penalty , but any- earnings withdrawn are taxed as ordinary income ( remember the contributions can be withdrawn at any time , free of tax and penalty ) . <p> Who should consider using a Roth for education funding ? <p> Most parents are n't  entirely- sure about funding a childs education . If they do want to pay for college , most do n't  know how much . Its a tough decision that depends on numerous changing variables and life goals . And these people are the ones who should seriously consider the Roth for education funding . <p> Using the Roth IRA will be most advantageous to those individuals who are n't  currently maxing out their annual IRA contributions ( or- their spouses IRA contributions ) , and who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed the income limits ) . <p> If you are already contributing the maximum amount to an IRA for your retirement , it wo n't make much sense to reduce your retirement savings and carve out a portion reserved for educational expenses . Your best bet will probably be a 529 plan if you 're sure you want to save additional- funds for higher education . <p> But if you in one of the three categories below , - this article should provide- you some food for thought . <p> Not currently maxing out your own IRA account contributions <p> Not currently maxing- out your- spouses IRA contributions <p> You can increase the amount you save in a defined contribution plan at work ( 401k , 403b , etc. ) for retirement , freeing up space and increasing the flexibility of your IRA contributions . <p> If you 're in one of the three categories above , and you 're unsure about how much you want to set aside for education funding ( or if you want to fund at all ) , the Roth becomes an attractive funding vehicle . <p> In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made sense for several reasons : <p> She was not currently funding- an IRA for retirement purposes . <p> She did n't  have enough cash flow to fund both her retirement and the education fund <p> She was unsure about the exact dollar amount to be used- for educational purposes <p> Bonus : She was going to be age 59.5+ when the child began college ( no tax on any Roth withdrawals ) <p> The Roth IRA ensures flexibility . <p> Instead of playing a guessing game with the amount of funding needed for higher education expense , you can just commit to maxing out your Roth IRA contributions each year . - Then if you do decide that you would like to help your child pay for college , you can do so without suffering major financial- consequence . If you decide against it , also fine . Youve built a nice nest egg for retirement . Or maybe instead of paying for college , you want to give your child some capital to start a business . Well , you can easily gift them funds out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions , but not earnings until age 59.5 ) . <p> You get no such flexibility with a 529 plan . You either spend the money on educational expenses , or you eat a nasty 10% penalty and pay ordinary income tax on all withdrawals . <p> In summary , if you are having to choose between setting aside funds for your childs education or your retirement , choose to fund the Roth IRA today and decide what to do with the money later . <p> The Roth is a far superior investment account . <p> When you choose to fund a Roth IRA instead of a 529 plan , you can almost guarantee a larger ending balance . This is because 529 plans often have administration and management fees that erode investment returns . Sure , there are some excellent , low cost 529 plans . And there are some 529 plans that just plain suck . Its luck of the draw depending on where you reside , but on average they will cost much more than a simple Roth IRA . <p> With the Roth account , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous low cost ETFs that have annual expense ratios below 0.10% . Since fees are one of the most important factors in long-term investment performance , you will come out ahead with the Roth IRA ( all else equal ) . <p> Closely related , you will also have far more flexibility with available investment options in the Roth . <p> What about financial aid ? <p> Money inside a Roth IRA is n't counted as an asset for financial aid purposes . This holds true if the account is owned by the child or the parent . <p> Although retirement accounts are not counted as assets in need-based financial aid calculations , distributions from them are counted as income the year after they are taken . This is true even if the distribution is a return of contributions from- a Roth IRA . All distributions are counted as income , and income is weighted- much more heavily than assets in the expected family contributions for financial aid . The law currently expects that the following will be available to pay for college expenses : <p> 50% of a students income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income ( based on a sliding income scale and after certain allowances ) <p> There are strategies to mitigate this unfortunate tax scenario . For example , take a Roth distribution 2 years- before the child begins college that can pay for multiple semesters . Then wait to take another until the child is entering Spring semester of their junior year . Distributions taken then or after will not matter because the FAFSA report is done- in the Summer/Fall- on the previous years income . That 's probably a post for another day . <p> Money inside a 529 plan is counted as an asset , and 5% 5.64% of the account balance is included when determining expected family contributions and financial need . This is true regardless of whether owned by child or parent . However , withdrawals from the 529 plan are not included as income . <p> Final Thoughts <p> You should not sacrifice your own retirement to fund your childs education . I truly believe that. - There are multiple ways to fund college , including scholarships , grants , work opportunities , and even student loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retirement savings , and you should n't feel guilty about choosing to use your Roth IRA solely for retirement purposes . <p> However , if you are n't  maximizing your IRA contributions for retirement , strongly consider using the Roth IRA to fund your childs educational expenses . It provides great flexibility , and you are not obligated to use the money for education. - Its an outstanding tool for those individuals- who are n't  able to fully fund a retirement account and a college education account at the same time . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Drew <p> My wife and I are expecting twin girls in the next couple of weeks and we have been discussing planning for their education . Currently , both my wife and I max out our own Roth IRA accounts each year . So could we open Roth IRA accounts in our daughters names and then if they end up needing the money for education they can use it and if not it would be just more for their retirement funding ? Thoughts ? <p> Very interesting article and sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 529 . I do not have access to a Roth . I have been buying I-bonds for my sons education . Although the nominal interest rate is low , you still receive a real return above inflation . There is no credit or market risk . No fees . If you use it for education , there is no tax . Its a good alternative for those with little tolerance for risk . <p> Interesting article , and very thorough . Obviously , parents can also use funds from a Traditional IRA to pay for college though the question of which is more advantageous tax and earnings wise has to do with the tax rate in the year of contribution versus the tax rate in the year the funds are distributed . Question , though : One of your recommended strategies is to pull a years worth of tuition out TWO years before college starts to avoid the distribution being counted as income on the FAFSA . Assuming the rents are n't  59.5+ , would n't that incur the 10% penalty ? <p> Hilary , thanks for reading . All contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free as a return of basis . If the parents have been saving in a Roth each year , and the college cost is modest , they might avoid withdrawing earnings altogether . Earnings withdrawn for educational purposes before 59.5 also avoid the 10% penalty but not income tax . I 'm not entirely sure if or how the time delay would change the scenario . <p> I 'm hoping my kids will get through with scholarships and grants , but know that 's not always an option . Coverdells are more akin to savings accounts and are n't  volatile to the marketright ? <p> I love this Roth IRA option . It really does bring the best of it all together . I guess if you 're already maxing it out looking at other options makes sense , but if not , you 've made a super compelling argument . <p> Coverdells can be invested in stocks , bonds , etc . They are not savings accounts . The Roth is a great option for someone who is unsure about the future , and not currently maximizing retirement contributions , but certainly not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 529 savings plans are not the only type of 529 out there . He said that there are some states that also offer 529 prepaid tuition plans which allowed me to contribute money back then in order to lock in prices at a state university years . I generally paid a premium over current tuition prices to account for inflation , but considering the rate of tuition growth in years back then , paying in advance often is what I did because it sounded preferable .. <p> The one thing I really like about the Roth is flexibility . You obviously should n't raid your retirement account if you do n't  have to , but if you have a super emergency that drains your regular emergency fund , its nice to know you can fall back on the Roth . I like the idea of using a Roth for educational purposes but my state gives a decent tax deduction and the administration fees are actually pretty low . Not Vanguard low , but close to it . I just put enough to get the tax break to make it worth my while .

We enjoyed seeing all of the major cities and sampling the finest foods at half price ( thanks , Groupon ) . In addition to the discounted foods , the short domestic flights were booked using British Airways Avios each way . And one of our immediate family members had a car nearby , which allowed us to drive between the cities- at no charge . They even graciously agreed to pay for gas , since we booked everything and continue to advise them on travel rewards . <p> Using reward points , we stayed a total of 6 nights in hotel properties . When you book hotel rooms with points , typically you do n't  pay taxes . So we paid nothing out of pocket . <p> Out of the hotel stays , our time was split evenly between Hyatt and Marriott properties .

We had 2 large beds in the sleeping room , plus a large pullout sofa in the small sitting room that was relatively comfortable . The 42 inch TV was mounted on the wall , - able to turn in all directions . <p> The free breakfast was excellent . Unlimited Starbucks coffee- and- these delicious little breakfast sandwiches made with- real fried eggs , cheese , and ham . They also had amazing pastries , doughnuts , fresh fruit and yogurt , and the usual cereal and oatmeal with toppings . <p> The General Manager was a really nice guy . I chatted with him about vacation and his career . His friendliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent experience , Hyatt charged me a whopping 5,000 points per night .

You can find these cards and compare them using the link at the top of this page . <p> We Enjoyed Marriott , Too <p> Marriott was mostly good , with a few cons . The hotels were clean , the staff usually friendly . They did offer breakfast , but it was quite limited compared with Hyatt . It was mostly prepackaged foods and liquid eggs . <p> We tried- two different- Townplace Suites , and one Fairfield Inn . The first Townplace outside of Houston was my least favorite . The room was small and the air conditioner was way too noisy . The next Townplace in Austin was nicer and we had a suite . There was a living room/kitchen , and two separate bedrooms with closing doors . <p> The Fairfield Inn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rooms was spacious and very well kept . The breakfast still managed to absolutely suck . <p> These rooms were either 7,500 points or 10,000 points per night , which is the norm for Marriott properties in big U.S. cities . They do have more expensive properties in most cities , but its usually in certain locations like downtown. - We- typically find the most value in the lower level Marriott properties . <p> To get Marriott points , Chase currently offers a Marriott credit card . <p> Closing Thoughts <p> I cant complain about- any of these properties , considering they were- free . <p> Have you recently stayed at any hotel chains ? Did you pay with points or cash ? <p> Love a free hotel breakfast !

I did a status match from hilton gold which is pretty easy to get over to diamond ( 90 day trial ) and then applied for the card so that the two free nights would turn into two free suite nights = <p> Marriotts are ok imo . I 'm hoarding my points though for an air and travel redemption but managed to use the free cat 1-4 night from the card for a wedding . <p> Yeah , the travel packages are a pretty good deal , but I 'm on the fence .

Hilton props have been our go-to hotels since a fantastic trip to the Black Hills in 2007 . <p> I 've had good experiences at Hyatts but have n't stayed at Marriotts too much . I have Priority Club points so I usually stay at Holiday Inns . I realize they are a step below the above , but I 've usually had good experiences . Some Best Westerns too , but I realize they can be hit or miss . <p> Hyatt wins over Marriott every time over seas . Hyatt is known there as a business persons hotel , and is set up according to the needs of business people . I have stayed n Hyatts in Barcelona , Tokyo , Bangkok and Hong Kong , that I can recall . All were paid for by my company and all were excellent values .

I 'm sad to have a distance relationship with them , but retirement is my time to choose when I want to do things and what I want to do . People do not understand that too well . I think kindness and grace are required attitudes in this new journey for others but greatly for ourselves . I must embrace the new me and enable that new me to evolved and be happy in the process . Good luck on your retirement ! Enjoy each moment of it ! ! <p> I 'm thankful that this is not a problem for me because I 'm so interested in so many meaningful things . However , I do know that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 4-Hour Work Week , too . I think you have to know what type of person you are and consider what makes you happy and fulfilled before retiring . <p> This is one of the reasons I never intend to give up some kind of work lifestyle entirely . I like having something to do , whether its a personal passion project or working for charity or just a laid back , simple job . <p> My mantra is " work while still young " . I still envision myself as someone who can retire before I turn 50 and just enjoy life and spend the rest of my life with my beloved family . I 've got a meaningful job which promises career growth and I think I can settle with until 50 , I am hoping . I believe I am just happy that Ive come across a combination of a job and passion at the same time . <p> I have to admit that if I 'm not careful I can even feel this way about vacation time . The first few days are *amazing* as you chill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things you 've longed to do . Then after a while it becomes " normal " you do n't  quite appreciate it quite as much as in that first " honeymoon phase " . Then eventually , if you 're unlucky , things can start to get almost boring . <p> While I certainly plan for early retirement , I do n't  plan to just sit around doing nothing ( well , not all the time , anyway ) . I have a whole list of other things I want to accomplish early retirement will just give me the freedom to tick them off my bucket list . <p> Very interesting topic . I feel both " traditional " retirement supporters and early retirement have valid points to stand on . I enjoy my job very much and have most of my investments in tax advantaged retirement accounts , so what incentive do I have to stop working early ? If you 're still able to spend time with family and travel often , then there is no real hurry to retire . Its all about what a person wants to achieve out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early retirement is an opportunity to pursue what you 're passionate about and what makes you happy . When Mr. Frugalwoods and I retire early in a few years ( at age 33 or so ) , we do n't  plan on not working , we plan on working differently and on things we care about . Well be on a rural homestead , so itll be more " work " than ever before , but we wont be constrained by 9-5 jobs that consume most of our time and are uninspiring . That 's what early retirement means to us , and I know its different for everyone . Thank you for this thoughtful piece ! <p> I really like this article . I often think about what my life may be like with " early retirement " and honestly I do want to work in some fashion . I just do n't  know at what . So the excitement can come from doing new things and knowing that if it does n't  work out , there is nothing wrong with it . Plus in-between those new projects/gigs/whatever I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a balance in life that I desire . Less work and more play : ) . <p> Early retirement is just a phrase thrown around for being free to do what you want with your time instead of being tied down to a day job because you need to pay your bills . <p> I do n't  think I could ever retire completely but then again I 'm only 31 , things could change by the time Im 65 . My aim is to be financially free within the next 7-10 years by having a passive income to cover my cost of living so I can follow my passion/s . In a sense that could be considered early retirement but I like to look at it as having a choice of whether to work , play , travel , learn , volunteer or sleep in till noon every day or change it up and do something different every day . <p> In a lot of the comments here , I find the premise of a perennial passion . Passions subside , you lose interest , that 's the natural flow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for decades upon decades , more power to you , and I 'm very happy for you , but you must take into account the drive , the potential , the satiety feeling , monotony and boredom , just to name a few , of the different individuals . Not everyones passion is going to last forever . @Ree Klein : Sure , you can give up worrying about your first group , but I hope you 're not being judgmental about them . If they 're happy , and that 's their way of life , then that 's that . <p> You make a very important point ! Happiness comes in all forms and I did n't  mean to pass judgment on anyone for living a life that brings them joy . I can see how you felt my comment conveyed such a sentiment . Thank you for having the guts to call it out = <p> I suppose my underlying message was that I needed to focus more on my own potential rather than being the cheerleader behind potential I saw in others . Its much easier to hang your hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Its easier to blame than to shoulder personal responsibility . I do n't  do that anymoreIm holding myself accountable for realizing my own potential . <p> As for passion to pursue a particular interest , I 've been passionate about a lot of interests . Some fizzled , as you say , some did n't  pan out and some Ive long heldtheyre part of me . I agree with you that passion for one thing only is rare . I was merely trying to say that early retirement wont be such a difficult transition for those who engage their passions . <p> Most people who have commented on this post will be just fine in ER as theyll be firmly in the motivated camp , theyve bothered to start up a blog for one thing , whereas most people are just readers/consumers of blogs ; it would be interesting to hear from more readers who are not other blog writers = <p> I think the majority of people may fall into the latter group ( unmotivated to do their own work or find their own passion ) though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of these once had that spark but the daily grind has gradually worn it away . <p> I find work colleagues vaguely talk about wanting to quit working , if they won the lottery for example , but there is n't much entrepreneurial spirit knocking about . <p> As long as I am working a job I really enjoy , I do n't  think I 'd ever retire too terribly early . My job gives me a feeling of being needed and is extremely rewarding . I also think I 'll always be writing until I am so old and brittle that I can no longer move my fingers . <p> I 've had good fun discussing the topic of early retirement with older people . They simply could n't understand why anyone would want to quit working at age 35 and sit around for the rest of their lives . But early retirement is so much more than that . And thanks for sharing the Steve Jobs quotethats one of my favorites . <p> I think there are two types of people : those that are driven to learn , build and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I thought everyone would be driven once they found their passion . But after years of seeing the " potential " in people , I found that so many do n't  really care to explore and activate that potential . Ive been so deeply saddened by that fact and felt it was such a waste . <p> People in the first group will never " retire " in the classic sense even if retirement comes very early . Its the people in the second group that will struggle . They do n't  really want to find something to get passionate about because that would mean they have to put in effort to explore , learn and DO SOMETHING . <p> I 've given up on worrying about the second group and focus my attention on being in the first group ! Great conversation post = <p> I definitely believe that if nothing else early retirement affords us the time and freedom to pursue our true passion . Retiring early can be great but if you do not think about what you are going to do with your time it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world but money does not equate to happiness . Instead , if we have something that we are passionate about that makes us jump out of bed each morning we are much better off . <p> Personally , I would rather live a life with a medium salary and a passion than to be retired with a lot of money and no passion or purpose for the rest of my life . Society has painted the picture that retirement is all rosy , but in actuality there is much more that has to be contemplated before we jump for early retirement . Thanks for this awesome article . <p> I 'm also surprised when boredom is an issue . There are so many ways to spend you time other than work . I wonder if its really a lack of things to do or the fact that the early retirees identities were so closely tied to their occupations ? Also , as someone mentioned , these people are probably very committed , goal-oriented people to have achieved early retirement ? I wonder if there 's a letdown after the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoy then you 'll feel better about your job . If you were to retire early I think its very important to still do something you enjoy , whether its a hobby or volunteer . You need to keep your mind occupied . <p> I read one that retirees who do part time work or pick up an engaging hobby are much more likely to outlive someone who retires and does nothing . Its like our bodies are programmed to find some sense of purpose even when it is time to " rest . " I personally am kind of on the workaholic side of things so I can def. see how that 's possible . <p> If you are working at your passion , I wonder , why would you retire early ? If you are n't  working at your passion , should n't you be trying to find a way to do so ? I have to agree with Steve Jobs on this one ! <p> It always amazes me that this is actually a problem . I know for me , I 'm so clear about my visions and goals that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do what I love ( whether I 'm working at a job or whether I 'm reading and taking cooking classes while I 'm retired ) . I just know I wont be sitting around getting bored and / or depressed . <p> This is a great article and I 100% agree . I have never really understood the " early retirement " crowd . yes , they want to retire , but do they really ? If they " retire " only to pick up some paying side job or part time work , then did they really retire ? Can we just start calling early retirement financial independence ? <p> I think the desire to have more freedom and time , which I found to be very strong , is not the same as total freedom and unlimited time . Now I have found a happy medium by working at some volunteer work which I am passionate about , doing some occasional work as a Mystery Shopper for variety , travelling and learning to grow my own vegetables and source organic meats . My life is varied and interesting but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world when I had no place to be and nothing particular to do . One must seek fulfillment , it will not come by itself . <p> FI is a much better term although really we need a new term for people who have managed to learn how to live a frugal lifestyle and so cut the cord from a higher paying job and are now earning possibly way less but finally following their passions and are much happier . I meant why wait till you have 25 years worth of living expenses before trying something new if you are n't  happy , and know you can get by with living on much less anyway ? I know I 'd much rather have the bigger Financial cushion but I do n't  want to trade another 10 years of my life to get it , when it might turn out fine if I quit my job next week and start turning over some money on some fun side gigs and part time work . As long as income covers expenses , then I 'm happy 
@@44824154 @4824154/ <h> Wasteful Habits Are Sickening <p> I 'm rather disgusted right now . I just came back from a special lunch date with lady Cash Cow . You have to realize that we do n't  eat out much . Maybe once per week , and only when specials are available . <p> Recently we found a local joint that is famous for Taco Tuesday . Each Tuesday they offer 3 beef or chicken tacos with rice , beans , chips , and a never ending salsa bar for $3.69 . They make their own tortillas in house , complete with a window for all to see . Its a rockin joint , always filled to the brim with other good folks . <p> Everything was going as planned . We ordered and awaited our tasty Tex-mex . Minutes passed , and I stood waiting for the order at the little window . I grew weary and was instructed that our food was sitting there , ready to eat . <p> It was all downhill from there . They had made one of the plates with the tiny , store bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both ordered . I smiled and informed the gal at the window . She gave me an odd look and then grabbed the plate and scraped the entire order into the trash . <p> I almost teared up . She threw away $4 . Literally , just threw the money in the trash can . And right in front of me ! <p> Shocked , I immediately responded with , " You know , we would have eaten those . They were perfectly fine for consumption . I just ordered something else . " She shrugged her shoulders and offered a fake " Oh , sorry . " <p> Do you understand how sickening that is ? What a purposeful , disgusting expression of wastefulness . Why wouldnt you give them to the customer , or to another worker , or to the next unknowing customer who actually ordered crispy tacos ? Give them to anyone , anywhere , but do n't  throw a plate full of food in the trash ! <p> After discussing the matter for a solid 5 minutes with Vanessa , I finally regained composure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden for long . <p> Not long after , I offered to get us some water . While weaving through the crowds of other diners , I noticed a disturbing trend . Their tacos had an odd shape to them . Wait a minute , those werent tacos at all . As fate would have it , many of the customers werent eating tacos on taco Tuesday . <p> No , our fellow diners had opted for taco salads , nacho platters , tostados , and a few other tasty dishes . Why is that wrong , you ask ? <p> Well , remember that Taco Tuesday involves a taco platter for $3.69 . They had just paid $6-7 for the exact same ingredients and perhaps smaller portions . Literally , the exact same ingredients just shuffled around in different shapes . <p> Instead of layering tortilla , chicken , lettuce , and cheese , they received crispy tortilla , lettuce , cheese , chicken . For that sly arrangement , they paid 80% more . For the price they paid , well have enjoyed this weeks feast and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correlation . Its all wasteful . Its complete disregard for dollars . Which is essentially a complete disregard for the countless hours spent working a job that they complain about . <p> Despite my sadness and disgust , I managed to gobble down my plate . It was tasty . I attempted to forget about the choices that other- customers were making in an effort to enjoy conversation with my wife . And it worked . We had a nice time . <p> After getting a to-go box for our leftovers , we were ready to leave . Yes , we take home food . Well get another meal out of the remaining <p> 2 chicken tacos and 2 flour tortillas , plus salsa . This is an excellent way to avoid eating too much while stretching our dollars further . <p> So they overpaid for the food , then wasted half of it . Words cant describe how wrong that is. - The amount of waste that can be observed day in and out in this country never ceases to shock me. - On the way out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I saw was yet again deeply disappointing . Many of the customers had left half a plate of food . Perfectly good food . And it was headed straight for the trash can . <p> Please , for the sake of the Cash Cow Couples health and longevity , do n't  be wasteful . We- just cant take it . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> If people want to waste their money , I guess that 's their prerogative . <p> The food waste would bug me too . I understand why they might have to do that ( and the few times we returned food in the US they usually let us keep the original order as well , presumably for the same reason that they cant resell it ) but to do that in front of you ? ! <p> I hate to see food wasted . I was recently at a fast service restaurant where the same ( well a similar thing happened ) . I ordered onion rings but fries came with my order . When I mentioned it to the girl at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sick to my stomach to see the food ( even if it was junk food ) go to waste . I would have eaten them if I 'd known they were just going to throw them away . Or I would have given them to one of the many homeless people standing outside . <p> There are actually people in the UK who dumpster dive as you 'd call it , for the food businesses are throwing out . We call it Freeganism here in the UK ; there have even been TV programmes on it , where high profile chefs have joined in . Its crazy that these businesses throw away perfectly decent food , for fear of litigation because you can tell when food has gone off , you do n't  have the pay attention to the best before and use by dates . You just need to use your nose , eyes and mouth ! <p> That makes me sick too . I HATE wasted food with a passion . We get creative with our food that is going bad . I just put some pears that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vodka . If someone gives me a wrong order , I will let them know but say please do n't  let this go to waste . It should be assumed that it shouldnt go to waste ! I know employees are told certain things to do , but its just not right ! Wasted food everywhere , when so many people are going hungry ! Its interesting about the taco tuesday phenomenon . People eating the same ingredients in different forms at an 80% price increase . Now that really gets me thinking ! Its all in the packaging and marketing . <p> I worked at a pizza joint and they wanted us to throw away pizza that was made wrong or from canceled orders . I would always pretend like I 'm throwing it out and hide it in the back . During breaks or after work we would all fest . They paid us so little I considered it part of the compensation for working there anyways . <p> I 'm with Levi about some takeout/delivery places . That was the official policy at the pizza place I worked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or take them home for later rather than dump them . Its a shame to throw away perfectly good food . <p> In some states , you can not re-sell food that has been made for another customer . And often , if businesses did , they would be waiting a very long time ( and risking the food getting cold or spoiled ) until someone ordered that exact order given how many are special orders . Working in fast food for a couple years , I understand this policy . Though , we would often eat the leftover food on our breaks instead of throwing it away <p> I worked at a fast food restaurant in high school and , at the end of the night , we were told that we had to throw the leftover food ( ie fries that had been sitting in the holder , chicken we did n't  sell etc ) into the garbage . If any of the staff wanted to bring it home we had to pay for it . <p> This policy was made worse by he fact that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us who was SO skinny because she never had enough to eat . When there was food , she gave it to her children . It was heartbreaking to see all of that food ( unhealthy , but food nonetheless ) go into the trash when she could have taken it home . <p> Nothing is more frustrating to me than wasted food . When I go out to eat , especially to fancy restaurants , its troubling to see how much people waste . When you know how many people go without food , its so sad to see extensive waste . <p> The wasteful habits of people are especially noticeable around the holidays . People throwing away food while there are thousands of people wandering the streets looking for food . Something is very wrong here . <p> Ugh , that 's horrible . The other night my boyfriend and I were out eating , and received the wrong order . The waitress took it back and I can only hope someone in the back was able to eat it . Likewise , we would have kept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't offered . In any case , we always order the specials , too . I never stray from a value menu . <p> Seeing the amount of food that goes to waste in a restaurant is kind of scary . I remember working in food service in college and was usually the person who would take the garbage out at the end of the night . There were so many nights where I was supposed to toss an entire pan of wings in the dumpster . Luckily , since I was the needy college student , I opted to simply " steal " the wings and take them home with me . I could enjoy free food and save some of the waste . <p> I hate it , but I totally believe they threw that out . People do n't  worry about wasting money unless its theirs ( and even then they do n't  worry enough ) . Rather than boxing it up and giving a nice meal to someone less fortunate , it went in the trash . Seriously not cool . And I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ! If I 'm going out to eat , its specifically because the restaurant has specials going on . <p> I have seen this many many times at chain restaurants . It is very wasteful . I especially agree when there is still a fairly large portion of the Earth 's populations struggling with hunger . We were at Chipotle and it happened . A perfectly fine $7 burrito was thrown away because cheese was accidently add onto the order . In my head , I was screaming just give me the burrito , not throw it in the trash can . However , it happens every day mostly due to food policies put in place . In this country , you can be sued for anything . Many places are being careful and treating customers as nice as they can . There was another time , we were at Jamba Juice and they made an extra smoothie by accident . No , they did not throw it away this time . The lady just gave it to us . Free of charge . = <p> I do n't  worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice and they may have paid with vouchers or coupons , someone else may be paying or their business is . Or as someone else said , they 're eating what they prefer . After all , if you 're prepared to shell out to eat out , you want to enjoy it ! <p> Ugh . I know exactly what you 're talking about . Wasting food drives me nuts . Its super-easy to save it , too . I cant tell you how much my husband and I have saved just by freezing soups and sauces . And I almost always order the biggest dish I can when I 'm out , just so I can get two or ( if Im super-lucky ) three meals out of it . Seems like the smarter alternative . <p> I applaud your reaction to food waste , Jacob . Its a sad state of affairsjust like all our parents told us , starving people in other countries really would love the food that were too quick to throwaway . <p> I 'm a little desensitized to it now , honestly . I do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in food waste . Thanks for the perspective . <p> I get more upset about the wasted food than wasted dollars . SO much food gets wasted in kitchens every day because people do n't  consume their entire plate or a waiter brings out bread and only a small portion gets eaten ( well , some places do recycle bread unbeknownst to the consumer ) . <p> As Kathy pointed out , this does have to do with health code issues . But , it still bugs me to see rampant food waste . <p> Personally , there are times I pay more to eat something healthier but its a personal decision . The place I cant stand spending money for food : movie theaters . The mark up on those snacks are beyond the pale . <p> I was thinking the same thing as Kathy and BrianI guess if they realized immediately they could have given the tortillas to another customer but after some has possibly touched itthey probably do n't  want to take that chance . And there might be some health regulations . One pet peeve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diners are asked if they want to take it to goand say NO ! There 's usually plenty of food left and can be eaten for another meal , yet they do n't  want it . Why not ? Do they just not like eating leftovers ? I cant stand that waste . We always take leftovers . <p> I would n't worry about what other people eat . And while throwing the food away was wasteful , it is possible that Dept. of Public Health rules prohibit them from setting the plate aside to serve to someone else . The server may have reacted too quickly in not waiting for you to agree to take the plate anyway , however , she may have been following health regulations . <p> Kathy is most likely right about the health department thing . In the state I live in , once food is taken from the window it has to be eaten by the table it is delivered to or thrown out . I 'm sure the restaurant probably has a policy where they wont leave it at your table if you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free food ( which you were not doing , but I am sure some people would ) . <p> I guess I 'm a bit torn on this issue . On the one hand , I absolutely agree that needless food waste is one of Americas biggest problems . I think I saw a stat they says we throw away 2/3 of the food we make . Crazy ! But on the other hand , I do n't  necessarily get sickened by people paying more money to get exactly what they want . If those people find value in having their taco salads arranged just so , let them pay for it . I do n't  see that as waste , I see that as a clever strategy by the Tex Mex joint . <p> That is so sad that they just threw the food away . I 'm sure that most customers who order there would not have offered to eat it to prevent waste . Also , I 've never worked in a restaurant but I wonder if so much food gets thrown away ( produce that is about to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it . <p> Haha , are n't  people funny Jacob ? Not even looking at the specials .. or ordering 5x as much in drinks as their meals cost . Of course , never forgetthose people are what allow the restaurants to offer people like us specials .. WITHOUT going bankrupt ! That realization may help take some of the sting off your observations . -Bryan

One of our accounts was hacked , and the individual was able to steal some financial resources . We are working with appropriate parties to recover the loss , but the entire process is extremely frustrating and time consuming . <p> If you have n't yet experienced this type of cyber-crime , be thankful . But more than that , you should take precautions to minimize your risk exposure so that this does n't  happen to you . <h> The Growing Threat <p> The volume , scope and cost of cyber-crime continue to increase rapidly- in our- increasingly complex , and highly connected financial- world. - Cyber-crime is up 20% since 2014 and is the fastest growing economic crime , according to- PricewaterhouseCoopers 's ( PWC ) latest biennial survey . Juniper research recently predicted that the rapid digitization of consumers ' lives and enterprise records will increase the cost of data breaches to $2.1 trillion globally by 2019 , increasing to almost four times the estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies to make a point this is a growing threat across the globe . If you use the internet to manage any of your financial accounts , you are exposed to this threat . <h> How Does it Work ? <p> There are numerous different hacking methods that can be used to steal your personal information . Some of the most common types include email phishing scams , where the criminal sends out a targeted email that mimics a legitimate organization or personal contact . If opened or downloaded , the email/attachments often infect your computer with malware to track or steal your personal login information . <p> Other hacks can easily track keystrokes and login information when entered using an unsecured internet connection . This is common at restaurants , coffee shops , airports , shopping malls , and the other numerous places that offer free , unrestricted WiFi access . Many consumers believe these connections to be secure , but they are wide open and easily exploitable . <p> There are an increasing number of other , more sophisticated hacking techniques that are highly targeted . With these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they are able to gain access to even one account or credit card , they are able to exploit and steal assets or other economic information . Sometimes they steal- account- information through brute force attacks on encrypted accounts or logins , - but do n't  immediately use it . They use the first account as a gateway to crack more accounts , then execute a planned attack . <h> How to Protect Yourself <p> The bad news is that attacks continue to evolve and become more sophisticated . The good news is that with a few simple precautions , you can greatly improve your cyber-security defense and protect yourself against many of the most common types of cyber-theft . <p> 1 ) Install a password manager <p> A password manager is a necessity in 2016 . Most people- have numerous online accounts , scattered across- multiple devices , each requiring a password . Having multiple accounts is n't a problem , but recycling the same password over and over is a major problem , because it makes your accounts much easier to hack . Instead of using one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to use unique combinations- for each online account . Furthermore , each password- should be long , difficult to hack combinations of letters , numbers , and special characters . <p> What I 'm describing is a password manager . Password managers generate and store all your passwords in a secure environment . Most can- even auto-fill login information for each of your stored accounts , and sync your passwords across all your devices ( computer , mobile , tablet , etc. ) . - Password managers allow you- to have unique , lengthy , difficult to crack passwords for each of your online accounts . These passwords are automatically saved on trusted and verified devices , which means you no longer have to memorize each unique passcode . <p> Furthermore , the best password managers do much more than that . LastPass- allows users to automatically log into any specified online account . With one click , LastPass will visit the appropriate url , input your saved username and password , and log into your account . This saves a lot of time . You can also securely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , credit card information , etc . All of this is encrypted securely on your local machine , untouchable by outsiders ( and even the LastPass employees ) . <p> When we were hacked , a trusted source immediately pointed me to LastPass . The free version is excellent , and the premium version allows you to sync your passwords across unlimited devices for- a mere $12/year . Lastpass is continually rated is one of the top three password managers , and is the cheapest premium password manager on the market . I have been extremely happy with the service thus far , and I did extensive research on available options before decided on LastPass . As an added bonus , if you sign up using our referral code , we both- get a free month of the premium version ( which I already purchased upfront ) . <p> 2 ) Enable two-factor authentication <p> Most password managers , including LastPass , allow you to add- an additional layer of security when you access your accounts , called two-factor authentication. - This- requires you to enter a unique security code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specified- device , in addition to your standard login . While not completely foolproof , two-factor authentication- makes password cracking much more difficult for hackers . <p> 3 ) Avoid unsecured- WiFi networks <p> Your home Wi-Fi network comes with built-in security on the router , but it 's not foolproof . If your network provider supplies you with a router I 'd and password , you need to change the- default settings . Cybercriminals know the defaults for major network providers , making these devices extremely vulnerable . <p> Never access anything important using open ( unsecured ) WiFi hotspots . This is one of the easiest ways to get hacked . If you are traveling and need to access anything important , try to use your phones secured internet connection . Most modern smartphones allow tethering , and basic browsing uses little data . <p> 4 ) Be careful with emails <p> Phishing scams are increasingly common , and can be- difficult to spot . Hackers are learning how to make these emails look official and enticing . Be careful when opening any of these emails . <h> Conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad things that can happen in our digital world , but you need to be aware of the increasing threat , and take precautionary steps to protect yourself . Making a few changes in your user habits will significantly improve your online security . If nothing else , take the following precautions : <p> Avoid using personal information ( such as important names , dates , or phrases ) in your passwords . Hackers can easily find lots of public information on you , which makes password cracking very easy . <p> Instead of using a common password for your accounts , consider using LastPass- or another dedicated password manager . These programs allow you to use unique , extremely strong passwords for each personal login , making hacking much more difficult . <p> Avoid using public WiFi as much as possible and never log into secure accounts while connected to an open network . <p> Do you have any other important security tips for our community ? Share with a comment below . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> LastPass has been one of the best tools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like myself that have a couple of passwords I use for EVERYTHING , LastPass is a lifesaver . I went back and created strong passwords for all my accounts and store it all in LastPass . Great tips Jacob ! <p> Nice post . I am a big fan of password managers . I am a long time Dashlane user . I am sure it is similar to LastPass . I love the ease of changing passwords , syncing my password changes to the phone app , and many other features . I will never go back to remembering passwords . Also , you can store just about any sensitive information into the program , such as credit cards , bank account numbers , and more to help with auto-filling forms on websites . I save a great deal of time not trying to figure out passwords I cant remember and never having to fill in forms on a website . <p> 1 ) Frankly , I do n't  take any of the precautions you recommend and have never been hacked . Its implied that you used a password that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have taken a few precautions which seem to have served me well . <p> 2 ) make the password difficult . I have even written the password down but I do n't  write any User IDs on the same piece of paper as the password . As time has gone by , I have come to rely on mnemonics . I still write the password down but as soon as I memorize the mnemonic , I shred it . An example would be the upcoming presidential election : Hillary Clinton vs . Donald Trump on November 8 becomes HCvs.DT1108 . It would take me a few days to remember November 8 but I could simply google " Election Day 2016 " until I remember 1108 . <p> I also customize the passwords with a code of alphanumerics representing each account . So in this case HCvs.DT1108A2 would be the password for one account and HCvs.DT11087F would be the password for another account . A2 and 7F would be appended to each new password for their respective accounts although sometimes I switch it up by doing something like A2HCvs.DT1108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would be HCvs.DT1108 and for others it would be DTvs.HC1108 . I also switch up the order of words which compose the mnemonic by doing " Yoda speak " which is object-subject-verb . Instead of " Jacob was hacked " , Yoda would say " Hacked Jason was " which means the password would change from " Jwh " to " HJw " <p> This may seem elaborate but has evolved over many years and now seems second nature to me . <p> 3 ) change passwords often . In the aforementioned example , soon after November 8 , I would change the password . I probably change passwords 3 to 5 times per year . This is kind of a pain because I do it en masse so I have to spend an hour logging into my accounts &amp; changing passwords . <p> 4 ) do n't  bother with #2 and #3 for stuff that does n't  matter like passwords to Yahoo , Facebook and Gmail accounts or even stuff like accounts at your electric company , cell phone provider , etc . <p> 5 ) Regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a password manager after being hacked . If your financial accounts were hacked , why cant your LastPass account be hacked through the same means ? If you have taken precautions subsequent to the hack to avoid being hacked again , do n't  those same precautions obviate the need for a password manager ? <p> Hello Dan , much of what you 've written seems misguided . 1 ) Nothing is implied , and none of what you 've written in your first sentence is true . 2 &amp; 3 ) Your elaborate password routine is unnecessary for anyone using a password manager , and seems like a lot of wasted time and effort . Reputable password managers generate extremely long , complex passwords that are nearly impossible to crack . The manager also remembers each of them so you do n't  have to . Lastpass can even change passwords automatically for some of the most commonly used websites. 4 ) The " stuff that does n't  matter " to you , matters to most people . I would n't want a hacker snooping around all of my personal information , my emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use that information in many ways . 5 ) I do n't  have time to fully explain Lastpass to you , but you need to read much more before jumping to unfounded conclusions . Lastpass is extremely difficult to crack when setup properly , and nothing is stored on their servers , so hackers cant steal anything from their database . <p> I actually would also recommend looking beyond the password tools 2 factor identification to the brokerage or financial companies 2 factor identification as well . Fidelity and Schwab both offer these functionalities for free if you just remember to ask <p> You can do that , and many sites now offer 2-factor I 'd for free . But I think that becomes unnecessary if using a password manager correctly . Once you enable 2-factor in Lastpass , and change all passwords into 12-16 character random combination strings that are almost impossible to crack , you are well protected . <p> I like 1Password because they have a one time purchase fee option in addition to a subscription option . Then again , I think that LastPass may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available in 1Password . <p> Thanks for sharing , Misha . I read quite a bit about both , and Lastpass is consistently adding additional features , like you mention . They also appear to have a bigger portion of the market share , which is a positive sign for the companys longevity . I 'm sure 1Password fills the same role though , if that 's your preference . <p> It is so scary to think how much personal information can easily be stolen through cyber-hacking ! I know personally , when I set up passwords I always have different ones for each account and make sure to have at least one capital letter , a number , and asterisk or exclamation point !

( This week we splurged on really nice steaks . ) <h> What did we make ? <p> I did n't  use a recipe for this meal because I already knew how to prepare it . <p> Steak - Bring steak to room temperature . Add salt and pepper to both sides of steak . Heat skillet on high until butter or oil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook from 2-5 minutes on each side , depending on how you like to eat- your steak . <h> Why does it matter ? <p> Everywhere you go , brown rice is offered as the " healthy " alternative . <p> In fact , the other day at a restaurant , brown rice was offered for an extra $1.50 . Outrageous . You can buy an entire bag of parboiled rice for that same amount and come out ahead nutritionally . <p> What is parboiled rice ? <p> Parboiled rice is a type of white rice that has been boiled in the husk and precooked before being dried again . It is actually prepared from brown rice that has been soaked , steamed under pressure to force water-soluble nutrients into the starchy endosperm , then re-dried and eventually milled . This method drives nutrients , especially thiamine , from the bran into the grain , so that parboiled white rice is nutritionally similar to brown rice . <p> So , parboiled rice is nutritionally comparable to brown rice . Better yet , parboiled rice has a lower glycemic index and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We decided to add parboiled rice to our diet for 2 reasons : <p> 1 . Low glycemic index . <p> In laymans terms , glycemic index ( GI ) is the scale that measures how quickly a food gets converted to sugar ( glucose ) in the body . The higher the score , the more that food will cause a blood sugar spike . <p> Frequent spikes in blood sugar are unhealthy because they cause the body to produce insulin . This insulin then goes into fat storing mode , which can lead to weight gain . Furthermore , individuals with digestive problems , blood sugar problems , and even chronic illnesses are negatively impacted by big glucose spikes . In healthy people , its less of an issue , but probably still is n't ideal . <p> Parboiled rice has a GI of about 38 , which is lower than brown rice that ranks- in at- 55 on the GI scale , and white rice which has a glycemic index of 89 . So not only does parboiled rice have similar nutrients as brown rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> You can further reduce the glycemic load by eating rice with other foods , including fat and protein . Instead of eating rice , eat chicken stir fry with butter and olive oil ! <p> 2. - Good source of resistant starch when cooked then cooled . <p> The reason that parboiled rice must be cooked and then cooled before consumption is because the cooling process changes the structure of the starch in parboiled rice , lowering the GI further and increasing the amount of resistant starch . <p> Cooling brings retrogradation , this increases the formation of type 3-resistant starch which can act as a prebiotic and benefit gut health in humans . <p> The majority of people have no idea what resistant starch is . I know I did n't  until Jacob started researching and why- the good bacteria in our gut needs to be fed . <p> Wait , what ? Why would we feed bacteria . Do n't  we want to get rid of bacteria ? <p> No . <p> Bacteria has such negative connotations in our world today . But many types of bacteria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your gut is full of various species of- bacteria that keep it functioning properly . <p> Kris Gunnars explains , " Resistant starch feeds the friendly bacteria in the intestine , having a positive effect on the type of bacteria as well as the number of themResistant starch has several beneficial effects on the colon . It reduces the pH level , potently reduces- inflammation- and leads to several beneficial changes that- should- lower the risk of colorectal cancer , which is the 4th most common cause of cancer death worldwide .

Check out the video and other resources at Free the Animal . <p> Most people do n't  realize how important resistant starch is to the body .

The owners have to be creative in the way that they use space , resulting in unique and customized homes . <p> At first glance , I thought the people living in them must be nutty . Who would live in a house the size of a bedroom ? What could possibly make someone want to do that ? <p> In reading various online blogs , I discovered a number of- reasons why people choose the tiny house lifestyle , and it made me fall in love with the whole tiny house movement . <p> Some people choose to live in a tiny house because they want to leave a smaller ecological footprint . <p> Others like the idea of living minimally and focusing more on experiences and people , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , still others live in tiny homes for financial reasons . Tiny houses are tiny , so most people who own them do n't  have a mortgage . Furthermore , a lot of tiny homes are built on trailer beds so they are taxed as personal property instead of realty . <p> Personally , I like the idea of living in a tiny house because of simplicity . To make it work , we- would have to drastically reduce the amount of personal belongings kept in the home , and the items- that remain- would be meaningful , useful , and intentional . <p> On the other hand , Jacob and I are n't  so sure about the tiny home market . Spending $25,000 is n't so bad , but a lot of purchasers are spending far more than that . We do not understand why anyone would spend $100,000 on a tiny home when traditional homes can be found in that price range . Tiny homes tend to depreciate for a number of reasons , and the target market is much smaller than a regular home . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplified life with less clutter , but we do n't  think it makes sense to seriously consider- a tiny house given the current resale market . <p> If you 've never seen a tiny home , check out tiny home #1 and #2 .

This is definitely not a good deal , but if you 're debating whether or not to build- one , $100 might be worth your stay . <p> Another option is to watch Tiny , - the documentary about a couple who builds a tiny house . ( The film can be found on Netflix. ) - After only 1 hour of watching what took this couple 1 year to build , you 'll be inspired to declutter your house and focus on- what- really matter in life . <p> So I 'm curious .

You would n't believe the limited edition Charizard cards I have stashed away . <p> Then came remote control cars . I owned many , including a gas powered car that could run 55- MPH and a plane that I could n't control . <p> I was a bit obsessive compulsive as a kid . When I found a hobby , I was all-in , all the time . As a result , these hobbies were extremely expensive . Every time I started chasing a new hobby , I would run out and buy the latest toys . I had little self-control , and honestly , I did n't  know any better . My parents were fairly typical American consumers , and I learned many of these habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money a problem ? <p> There is nothing inherently wrong with spending money on enjoyable things . Ultimately , money is just a tool used to purchase happiness , satisfaction , security , and lasting memories . <p> Without a doubt , some of my childhood hobbies were enjoyable and memorable . Every kid enjoys- a unique set of hobbies when growing up , and I was no different . <p> But spending money , and spending money wisely are very different things . That 's a crucial distinction- that I never understood as a child . <p> My decision to- pay full retail price for all of my gadgets was not a wise decision. - Every time I went to the store to purchase- that $35 water gun , - $4 pack of Pokemon cards , or- $200 R/C car , I paid 7-8% in sales tax ( on top of the retail price ) . I also ate 100% of all future depreciation , because I purchased everything- new in box . <p> Had I looked around on Craigslist , at garage sales , or inside the neighbors trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for much less. - I could have let someone else purchase these items new and eat the depreciation . Then , I could have paid pennies on the dollar to purchase them used . <p> With age and experience , I 've matured and developed more self-control . I 'm far from perfect in my financial decision making , but I now consciously evaluate my priorities before spending money . I talk with Vanessa and we evaluate our financial situation , and then we make a decision . Long gone are the days of impulse purchases at Toys R Us . <p> But , when I hear people talk about their own financial decisions , it reminds me of my childlike mindset . Instead of evaluating a purchase to decide if its prudent ( or acceptable in the eyes of- a spouse/partner ) , many adults make impulse financial decisions on a weekly basis . Some make- frequent trips- to their favorite retail store to- buy , buy , buy . <p> And in the midst of all this spending , its common to hear that money is tight . And very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be asked : What are your financial priorities , and how are you spending your available- resources ? <p> Important Conclusions <p> It turns out that water guns are no different than any other toy . And toys are much like clothes , which are like cars , and jewelry , and furniture , and books , and appliances , and most other items you 're imagining . <p> Many consumer goods- can be found " used " for a fraction of the price . If you spend a little time searching , many of these used items are in excellent condition . That 's the big secret that took me 15 years to uncover . <p> Its not that purchasing an item " brand new " is wrong . We sometimes- purchase items new in box ( electronics on sale , outstanding- deals , or when its difficult to evaluate the quality of used ) . But its an expensive habit that is hard to break . And for most goods , I would argue that- a well-kept used item should have a lifespan that is nearly equivalent to new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items from the consumer who bought it new , you will save a fortune over your lifetime . <p> It took me several years and a few thousand dollars to figure it out . This ones to you learning quicker . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By theprettygeek <p> I completely agree with this article ! <p> I currently work in the cellphone business . I see it every single day . Customers will come in and buy the latest , most expensive iPhones for their children . The parents always foot the entire bill . These kids have no concept of money , saving , or earnings . Alot of kids break their phones constantly or go through multiple units . I try to educate the parents on saving money and not spending $750-980 for their high school childs cell phone . I explain it as " its like buying a Porsche for your kids first car " . They should drive around in an old beater , not a brand new Porsche . That way if they break it ( which they most likely will ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to spend $400 towards a new phone , buy a phone second hand for like $50-150 , or reactivate an old phone laying around the house for free . A majority of the parents buy cell phones for their kids even in elementary and middle school . Imagine a nine year old in 3rd grade with an iPhone 7 or 6s . <p> Ultimately , I 'd say only 25% or less of our customers take my advice . <p> Which is extremely sad ! I 've heard from kids that they will be made fun of in school if they have a flip phone , an old Android phone , or anything else not an iPhone . <p> Buying used is a lot easier with the internet . I think it is important to balance the time you spend trying to find the deal against what you save . For me , chasing around to different stores to save a little money is n't worth the time or energy it takes . If I can buy used online , though , I 'll do it . Also , I do n't  buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love buying used I recently went to a yard sale where they were selling a whole bunch of excellent condition , adorable baby clothes , some brand new with tags on . I filled up a big bag for $5 , came home and added up the approximate cost if I 'd purchased the items brand new it was hundreds of dollars . I grew up with a Mum who was always " getting bargains " and frequently bought gently used items , so I guess Ive always had that mindset . <p> You were cute kid , Jacob . = I think we all had those phases where we collected things and later wonder what they heck were we thinking ! I find people who have difficulties buying used often grew up in homes where money was scarce , so buying second-hand brings up bad memories for them . Its why I always say money is emotional . There is nothing wrong with buying used or for that matter new , either . Its about priorities . I have no problem saving money and buying something used , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Thanks Shannon ! Definitely agree that money is emotional ( for everyone ) . I do n't  think there anything wrong with buying something new if money is n't a concern . As you said , you 've got to prioritize spending , saving , investing . Buying everything new takes a huge chunk out of that ability ( for most people ) . <p> Once , I bought a basket for $5 at a craft fair and I lost it . I cried and cried once I realized it was gone ( aka Mom was n't carrying my stuff for me ) . I thought that if I cried enough , my mother would go buy me another basket . She did n't  . That may have been the best lesson I learned about money : be responsible for your own darn stuff . <p> I was actually pretty frugal as a kid / teenager . I used my babysitting money at consignment stores , mostly . It was n't until I turned 18 and started earning real money while in college that the wheels came off . I did n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did take out loans for school when my earnings could have helped . It was n't until I was 28 that frugal Meghan returned . I think this was because I was given so much by my grandmother . She gave me basically anything I wanted and presents from my parents were overboard as well . I never wanted for anything , so I never had to learn patience . <p> I had many of the same things you did when I was growing up . I loved my pokemon cards and my gas powered remote control car . I spent a lot of money when I was younger , but I enjoyed everything I bought . Also , I bought it all with cash that I had saved up . Looking back could I have saved more money ? Sure , but all of that may have added up to $2,000-$3,000 . I 'd trade that much money for how much fun I had growing up I think . <p> I think its a matter of being raised with an impression of what is " normal " . When going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame someone for doing so ? When I was a kid we did n't  have Craigslist ( or the internet for that matter ) , but we certainly bought our share of things from the Thrifty Nickel ! Glad those days are over ! <p> I love your story . Its so easy to be a collector when you 're a kid . Although I have to say Ive never heard any kid who collected water guns . That would be awesome though ! Youd be formidable in a water gun fight . <p> When I was growing up , I collected baseball cards . I remember there was a collectors shop that was going out of business and I went there and just bought everything at discounted prices . I went home with thousands of cards . My parents still have an entire closet devoted to them . By the time I reached high school , I looked back on that spending with regret . What would I do with all those useless cards ? To this day , I cant bring myself to throw them away even though I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Craigslist ! I am totally with you about getting things used . I am thinking about taking up tennis and I immediately went to Craigslist for used rackets . It will likely save me $30 $40 . <p> I think , where applicable , renting before buying is another smart move . For example I have many guitar students who go out and buy a guitar and then only stick with it for a few months . Money down the drain . <p> I buy new cars , but on the flip side i keep them until they are dead . If I want a higher dollar item , i try to abuse credit card sign up bonuses to bring the price down to " used " levels . My credit takes a hit , but its back to over 800 in around 10 months . <p> Very interesting . I remember growing up my parents were very frugal and I always wanted a super soaker but only had a puny squirt gun . Needless to say , I could not compete with my friend . I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ( you younging ! ) I 'm still holding out hope that they 're worth something . Shaquille ONeal rookie card should be worth something right ? ? Anyways , I bought a refurbrished DVD player recently when my old one broke , and it was half the price and works perfectly . <p> Awesome post , Jocob ! Sadly , I 'm relearning the " buy used " lesson . I have always been a fan of the used car , but alas , its trueI have bought nearly everything else new . My partner and I are consolidating households into a small 2bdr home and we 've had a series of three garage sales so far . <p> WHAT AN EYE OPENER ! ! ! Everything that we thought had value , turns out that others think its value is far less . Its hard to let go of things you paid " good money " for for a song . Wait , just a verse of a songbut go it must . <p> I 've vowed to first look for whatever I need used before buying new in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ! <p> I 'm not great at buying things usedI need to get better at using Craigslist or finding things secondhand versus always buying them new . I know you guys are pretty big on Craigslist , but I 'm a total noob when it comes to it . <p> I also wanted more and more water guns . Its funny to look back at that time in life and wonder what we were thinking haha <p> If only we all knew about indexing and compounding interest our allowances from childhood would be worth thousands today ! <p> Sometimes I go the other way and wonder 10 or 20 years from now what things I wish I would have known . We 've got a 5-6 year plan to pay down our condo now using some retirement money and while it all makes sense to me and the numbers look like they work really well in our favor I wonder how things will be years from now and if there 's anything I wish I would have done differently . I do n't  see it now , but who knows what will change over the years ? 
@@44824167 @4824167/ <h> 10 Reasons To Get a Credit Card Today <p> Credit Cards are an excellent financial tool . I have written about the pros and cons of cash in the past , but I 'm always so shocked when I hear any advice on completely avoiding credit . <p> Why would you avoid a free short term loan , with a ton of added benefits ? <p> My assumption , of course , is that you pay off your credit card balance every month . If you fail to pay to do so , credit cards are a nightmare . But if you use them responsibly , you should own at least one . Here are 10 reasons why : <p> 1 . Improve Your Credit Score <p> Every time you charge something on a credit card , and pay it off on time , you are building your credit score . The longer this process carries on , the higher your score will go . - You probably know this already . <p> What you might not have known is how important your credit score might be . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the numbers . Did you know that nearly all types of insurance providers now check credit score ? And for good reason , credit score is a reliable predictor of future claims . <p> Using a credit card to build your credit score will ensure you get the lowest mortgage rates available , the lowest insurance premiums , and a host of other benefits . <p> 2 . Rewards <p> Travel rewards and cash back rewards are another huge reason to own a credit card . Companies frequently kick back the equivalent of 5-10% to the consumer just for swiping their plastic . <p> Why would you pass that up ? Most places do n't  give a cash discount anymore , so credit cards now fill that role . <p> 3 . Internet Purchases <p> You ca n't use cash to buy something online , and numerous discount stores now operate solely through the internet . Even if you can buy it at the store , you 'll pay extra in gas and time . <p> You could use debit , but that offers no perks whatsoever . <p> 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide you periodic statements that detail your spending . This means you get a free record keeper/expense tracker . You can see when and where you charged something , and for what amount . <p> For individuals who do n't  keep solid records , like me , this is a life saver . <p> 5 . Emergency Money <p> Credit cards are a free short term loan . When treated as such , they become an excellent backup emergency fund . If an unexpected expense comes up , one of two things could take place : <p> You are n't  carrying enough cash to cover an unforeseen event . For example , maybe you 're out of town and need a service , but are n't  near your bank to withdraw money . <p> You do n't  have enough money available to cover an unforeseen event . For example , your car breaks down and your checking account cant cover the expense until you 're paid next week , leaving you helpless without a free short term loan from the credit card company . <p> 6 . Interest-Free Money <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your credit card is interest free. - Between the time you make a purchase with your credit card and the time you make payments , you are actually able to make money . If you were to hold money in an interest bearing account , the credit card company is actually making you money with their short term loan . Interesting to think about ? <p> 7 . Purchase Protection <p> If you make a purchase , but the seller tries to scam you or provides false information , the credit card company will fight the battle for you . Usually you can just file a claim and they will fight on your behalf . If you were to pay with cash , good luck trying to win that battle . It would take far more time , money and energy than the product was probably worth . <p> 8 . Warranty Protection <p> Many credit card companies offer free warranty extension . So if you buy an electronic with a one year warranty , theyll double it and offer another year . If the item breaks within that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fix or replace the item . <p> There are other protections as well . Rental car damage waiver is another good example . <p> 9 . Loss or Theft <p> What happens if you are robbed while holding $500 cash ? Well , you lose the money . <p> What happens if you are robbed with your credit card ? You call and cancel , losing nothing . <p> The same holds true if you misplace or lose these items . Cash is gone , credit is easily replaced . <p> 10 . Convenience <p> Its just easier to carry around a little plastic card than a wallet full of $20 bills . This especially holds true during travel . No matter where you are , a credit cards simplifies the experience . If you leave the United States , many of these same advantages travel with you . No more worries about exchanging currencies either . Many credit card companies will provide the exchange for you . <p> In closing , credit cards are a wonderful financial tool for those who are disciplined enough to pay the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love credit cards , especially travel hacking ! I think I signed up for 8 credit cards this year probably want to open another 10 next year . You cant beat the rewards ! And when you have tons of bills to pay anyway , might as well earn something worthwhile in return ! <p> It is great to have a credit card if you can control your own spending habits . Credit cards can be dangerous if you do not have a tight control . Physically taking out cash to pay for things has an impact on your spending . Swiping can make you lose track . However , credit cards are great to earn rewards on purchases you have to make . American Express has great benefits of offering extended warranty and travel insurance . Credit cards are only good if you pay off the balance every month . You are very right on the face that you are borrowing money for free for 21-30 days . The time value of money eventually adds up . <p> At the very least , if there is a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporarily ) . I stress this in my emergency fund posts as well . Though we should all have a cash emergency fund , if there is no ability to access that , say on a holiday weekend or any weekend for that matter from the bank , one can rely on the credit card for a few days and pay back to the credit card after the weekend . <p> There are some good perks with having credit cards it does boil to the person who is using the card . Some people do not understand that it is on " credit " not free money . I will be honest when I was young I had to learn this lesson . <p> Credit cards are n't  that bad in themselves , its how we use them . I think as long as someone is responsible with their usage , pays off their balances each month and generally sticks to their budgets even when using themthey can be a great asset . I can certainly agree with point #5 , for those who for different reasons do n't  have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saviour ! <p> I 'm a big fan of credit card rewards and bonuses . If you pay your bill in full , there is no reason not to take advantage of the rewards . I still use cash when it is financially beneficial like when the store offers a cash discount . <p> Overall a pretty good list . I believe that numbers 1 and 10 are very solid reasons . However , I believe people have to really be careful about #5 , Emergency Money . While the intent may be good , only use the card in the event of an emergency and then pay it back ; however , the reality is that if people had the money to start with ( and could use a debit card instead ) , they would not have to resort to using credit . And what happens if a second emergency or unexpected occurrence arises while they are trying to pay off the card from the first use ? I believe a better approach is to commit all effort to building an adequate emergency fund , which is tied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The use as emergency money is really only viable if someone has great cash flow and can definitely pay it off within a month . This assumes they spend far less than they earn . Another option would be a flexible HELOC . I 'm not big on the whole 6 months in cash emergency fund idea , but to each his own . <p> No doubt that there are different approaches that might prove viable for each individual and their specific circumstances . I try to maintain three months of living expenses in an emergency fund while a friend maintains $100,000 . A little overkill in my estimation , but it works for him . <p> Tricky subject . I do n't  think choosing to use credit cards is a slam dunk decision though . I recently found a study that tried to isolate the impact of credit cards on spending and , while the overall data showed no increase in spending due to credit , there was a curious pattern in the data . Those credit card users who paid their bill off at the end of each month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who carried balances paid less than cash users in the control group . I think more studies are needed but this evidence is particularly tricky for personal finance bloggers and others who are trying to game the rewards system . The game might be playing us all . <p> Hmm , consumer behavior is peculiar . While I do n't  disagree that its not a one size fits all type of argument , I just cant see any reason to avoid the reasons I listed above . Credit cards are hands down a better financial tool than cash , but that does n't  mean users necessarily make the right choices . <p> Well , one reason to potentially avoid them is that they might hurt your bottom line . Paying 5% more and gaining 1 or 3% in rewards is a losing proposition , though that CC user would probably never see it that way . For that consumer ( and they might not be the credit card user we typically think of ) the right way to win the credit card rewards game is to not play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in any position to establish a spending baseline for themselves . Additionally , they 're likely completely unaware of any impact their choice of payment ( cash , credit , debit ) might have on their spending behavior . So , when they say they 're spending the same amount as " they would have " with cash and earning rewards , they do n't  have the evidence to state that conclusively . They 're hoping . While credit cards might provide a variety of benefits , when you consider the fact that none of us is likely able to parse out the impact of payment method , using cash might or might not be " nonsense " . <p> For me , its too difficult to draw definitive conclusions re : credit cards at this point . Though as a former employee of a credit card company , I am wary . Individual consumers typically have no idea about the financial savvy and cunning of the companies they are dealing with re : credit . Its prudent for us to be very , very cautious . <p> Fair enough . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that curious pattern I referenced : it was the responsible users of credit who spent more . Irresponsible users spent less . <p> I love my credit card and all that it affords me ( free travel , the ability to accrue interest by having my money sit in my accounts before I pay my credit card off at the end of the month ) , but credit cards are dangerous if not used properly . <p> Having a credit card makes travel easier too . If you want to rent a car with a debit card , many of the agencies will want to put a significant hold ( think $1000+ ) on your card in case of an accident , especially if you are overseas . The same can happen with hotel rooms . If you do n't  have that kind of money sitting around , you get hit with an overdrawn penalty or your card is denied . To a lesser extent many gas stations do this too if you pay at the pump . <p> #7 is so true . I have had to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something I ordered and I never got it and they could n't provide a tracking number . My credit card company assumes I am correct and fights on my behalf . I hate to see a small business lose revenue , but I also hate paying for something I have never received . <p> I just recently got my first credit card two months ago . I was against them for so long . I wanted to only pay for things I could afford . Since getting a credit card , I 've paid it off every month and I will soon have enough for a free flight ! Traveling is my addiction and I ca n't fund that if I am trying to pay off debt aggressively . Its been good to me so far . <p> The problem arises when you have too many credit cards and your wallet is uncomfortable to sit on because its so thick . I was on a rampage over the last year , opening as many cards as I could to reap the rewards , but I 've essentially stopped because it was getting way too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maximize my rewards . Now most of my transactions are on one of five cards . <p> How it helps your credit score is a great point ! I got my first low credit limit , " student " credit card at 16 years old . I was taught how to use it responsibly ( it was only for gas until i went to college ) but the benefit of starting to build credit early was that I had a very good credit score by the time graduated college and needed a strong score . <p> Well done , Jacob ! ! ! I wonder what % of cardholders pay their balance each month . We used a credit for 14 years before we began to do that . What a relief it is to know there will never be a dime of interest paid on that thing ! Have a nifty one ! ! ! <p> I always try to make sure to purchase items using a credit card if I can manage it . The protections are so much better than what I would get using my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge plus . I agree with you about not understanding people wanting to avoid credit cards . If you have $20,000 that you spend yearly that you can put on a simple 1% cash back card . You are giving up $2000 over the year by not using a credit card . I think everyone would find an extra $2000 a year to be useful . <p> I LOVE credit cards and try to purchase EVERYTHING with them so I can maximize my points . Good point on the history of purchases . I track everything on excel anyway , but I love being able to cross reference on my credit card statement to make sure I have n't missed anything . <p> Couldnt agree more ! ! If you can pay your bill in full each month and you are n't  changing your spending habits just because you 're buying on credit card ( which amazingly some people do ) , then its crazy NOT to have a credit card ! Were taking our family of four to Disney World for free next year and were planning a free trip to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned literally tens of thousands of dollars of free travel just by opening the right cards over the past few years .

@@44824170 @4824170/ <h> Variable or Fixed Rate Student Loans : Which Should You Choose ? <p> Whether you are applying for new student loans or refinancing- your existing student loans , - you must decide between variable interest rate and fixed interest rate loan options . <p> As is the case with many financial decisions , you should consider your personal risk tolerance and time horizon before making the decision . <h> Fixed Interest Rate Student Loans <p> With a fixed rate loan , - the interest- rate will never change . As a result , your total monthly payment will- never change and any future interest rate changes will not impact your monthly payment . <p> Fixed rate loans- typically- have a higher initial interest rate than variable rate loans , but the rate never changes over the life of the loan . You are paying a higher initial interest rate to eliminate any risk of future interest rate increases . <p> When interest rates are low by historical standards ( as they have been since 2009 ) , fixed rate loans are more attractive than variable rate loans because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When interest rates are higher than average , the opposite is true . <h> Variable Interest Rate Student Loans <p> Most variable rate loans are- tied to an underlying interest rate benchmark , such as the Prime Rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) . These benchmarks are set by central banks , such as the Federal Reserve . When the economy does poorly , the Federal Reserve and other central banks reduce short-term interest rates to encourage borrowing . When the economy heats up , the Fed often increases interest rates to slow economic growth and combat rising inflation . <p> When you apply for a variable interest rate loan , lenders use one of these benchmarks as the baseline rate . The lender then adds a fixed profit margin to the baseline rate to achieve a profit . Usually , the fixed margin is dependent on your credit profile . Excellent credit will reduce the fixed margin while poor credit will increase the margin . <p> The interest rate on a variable loan may adjust monthly , quarterly , or annually , depending on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your credit ) never changes . Some lenders limit how much your interest rate can increase during each adjustment period , and most limit the maximum interest rate change over the life of the loan . <p> For example , I previously obtained a private student loan through Discover Bank . The variable interest rate was tied to the 3-month LIBOR rate , which meant that it was adjusted four times each year ( once per quarter ) . The fixed profit margin never changed . When the 3-month LIBOR rate increased slightly , so did my monthly payment . <h> Other Important Considerations <p> There are a few key considerations that apply to both fixed and variable rate loans . <p> The Loan Term - Most companies offer a variety of loan terms that you can choose from when obtaining a loan ( such as 5 , 10 , 15 , or 20 years ) . Shorter length- loans- will offer a lower interest rate- than longer loans , all else equal . If you can afford the higher monthly payments , you can obtain a lower rate by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student loans offer a fixed interest rate that does not depend on your credit . Private student loan rates are largely determined by your creditworthiness as a borrower . If you have excellent credit , you will qualify for the lowest possible interest rate . If your credit needs work , you will need to obtain a co-signer with excellent credit , or you should expect to pay a higher interest rate . <h> Choosing Between Fixed and Variable Rate Loans <p> If I were choosing a new loan , here is how I would approach- the decision . <p> Fixed Interest Rate Loans <p> If you 're uncomfortable with fluctuating monthly payments , - then consider a- fixed rate student loan . The interest rate and required monthly payment never change over the life of the loan . <p> In our current economy , locking in a fixed interest rate can be beneficial . Rates are expected to rise over the next couple of years , which will negatively impact variable rate loans . If you plan to pay off your student loan over a long period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment , regardless of any future interest rate changes . <p> Student loans originated by the government always carry a fixed interest rate , but its often higher than the best rates offered by private lenders . If you have an outstanding federal- loan , you might be able to obtain- a lower fixed interest rate by refinancing . <p> Also , keep in mind , you can refinance multiple times if interest rates take an unexpected turn . For example , if you obtain a fixed-rate loan and interest rates fall , it 's possible to refinance into a variable-rate loan at the lower rate . <p> Variable Interest Rate Loans <p> If you plan to pay off your loan relatively quickly , or if you expect interest rates to remain stable or decrease , a variable rate student loan can save you money because the initial interest rate will be lower than a comparable fixed rate loan . <p> Because interest rates have been historically low since the 2009 financial crisis , it is reasonable to expect rates to rise in the future . However , history has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates will rise or fall . <p> If interest rates increase , you should be prepared to make higher monthly loan payments . The longer it takes you to pay off the loan , the higher your probability of experiencing an interest rate increase . Although you can mitigate some of this- risk by choosing a lender that caps its variable rates . <p> Have you decided between a fixed and variable interest rate student loan ? Share with a comment below . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Joanne <p> Very good and clear article on Fixed and Variable rates . My son is going into his last year of college and we most likely will refinance all these loans in a year or two . I usually opt for fixed because I am not a risk taker and rates have been low for so long , but I am really considering a variable on this last year loan because he will be refinancing . The rate difference is about 2% between the fixed and variable rates he was given is aprx. 2% . Any suggestions would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tough decision . If interest rates rise , it could make sense to lock in a fixed rate today . But , if the loan will be repaid relatively soon , variable can make sense with the lower initial APR . Keep in mind , if interest rates continue to rise over the next two years , the refinance rates will also be higher in the future . <p> Great Post guys ! I have been debating about refinancing my wifes and my student loans . I have not pulled the trigger yet because it honestly terrifies me . This article helps me understand between the fixed and variable loans . One day here in the near future I will have to sit down , do my research , and pull the trigger . <p> This is a great discussion . In todays environment , I would think twice about using a variable loan since like you said interest rates are as low as they have ever been . And the Fed has come out and said they will raise rates this year barring any huge world events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off loans quickly yourself will be the main factor on how fast they 're gone . If you 're doubling up on your monthly payment , the interest rate wont matter as much . <p> Hello Syed , There are tradeoffs , but I want to highlight something important . If someone is wanting to " double up " on monthly payments and get out of debt quickly , it could make sense to take a variable rate loan because the intro rate will be lower than a fixed rate loan . The optimal strategy will depend on the amount of time until the debt is repaid in full . 
@@44824173 @4824173/ <h> Cash is King , Or is it ? <p> Are you a member of the cash only club ? You know , the one that always invites Dave Ramsey to be the keynote speaker ? <p> Or perhaps you like to borrow ? Maybe you never carry an ounce of change and you leverage credit cards for all your spending ? <p> Its a polarizing topic and everyone seems to have a strong opinion . <p> Either way , it might be worth considering each alternative . Depending on the individual , the old " cash is king " mantra may or may not hold true . I 'd like to present 5 reasons for each side of the argument of cash vs. credit , then Ild like to get your take in the comments section . <h> 5 Reasons Why Cash Is King <p> Emergency Reserves and Liquidity I 'm no believer in holding a huge " emergency fund " in cash if you have a stable income that pays all the bills each month . At the same time , unforeseen expenses can occur , like a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never want to be forced to withdraw investment money . Holding cash provides a buffer so you can avoid credit card interest . Of course , other options are also available ( and possibly better ) such as a HELOC . <p> Purchasing Power This is probably my biggest motivation to hold cash reserves . Cash provides leverage during price negotiations when you are making a purchase . Used cars are an excellent example , as people want the full payment . Housing can be an example if you can afford a large down payment . Even Craigslist transactions can be manipulated by tossing out the infamous : " I 've got cash in hand . " <p> Investment Flexibility and Security Cash wont lose its value during a stock market cash . Furthermore , holding cash can indirectly protect your investments by giving you the peace of mind to not sell them during- bear markets . If you have a cash reserve , you wo n't feel dependent on investments to pay for daily living expenses . Another advantage is that if an investment opportunity presents itself , you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would either be forced to sell shares of other investments , perhaps at a time when the market is down , or forgo the investment opportunity altogether . <p> Avoid Interest and Fees I do recognize that some individuals really struggle with spending too much money . I would call it a severe discipline problem , but nonetheless , they probably should n't carry a bunch of credit cards around , swiping and jollyhooting at will . Doing so usually results in outrageous interest charges because most of these same people do n't  pay off the bill each month . In this case , carrying a small amount of cash could be a nice solution . <p> Cash-Only Transactions Some ( small , local ) businesses still do n't  accept credit cards , debit cards , or checks . Vendors on the street corner probably do n't  either . Other local shops might offer a discount for using cash . This is getting rare , but I suppose worth mentioning . <h> 5 Reasons Why Cash Is Not King <p> Paper Trails Cash leaves no trail . When you spend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a couple of reasons . For those who are attempting to track their spending , its a black hole . Beyond that , it leaves a terrible proof of purchase . Credit Cards allow easy tracking and receipt for all purchases . <p> Purchasing Power Cash earns no interest , therefore it loses value over time . Inflation eats away at the purchasing power of cash , so it should n't be held for no reason . This is an argument against holding a large cash emergency fund . <p> Rewards Cash purchases do n't  usually involve any kickbacks . Say what you will about reward credit cards , but they are here to stay . Its foolish insist on paying with cash if a credit card will give you 5% back for every purchase . Furthermore , there are ways to get thousands of dollars in free travel accommodations through travel rewards . <p> Lack of Protection Cash offers no consumer protection. - Good luck getting your money back if you 're ripped off in a cash transaction . Credit card companies have a statutory duty to protect you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes even doubling the warranty period . Other benefits include free roadside assistance , and collision-damage coverage when you rent a car . <p> Ease of Loss Cash is easy to lose , misplace , or forget about . Beyond that , it can be stolen . If any such events take place , you are out of luck . Its gone and the only way to feel better is to weep a little bit and apply for that new credit card so it does n't  happen again . <h> Final Thoughts <p> I guess I 'll close by stating my opinion and adding the Cash Cow touch . Cash(flow) is king , hands down. - <p> When you spend far less than you earn , it becomes easy to create liquidity . New cash is always on hand each month . You can then choose what to do with it . <p> At the same time , spending far less than you earn is also indicative of excellent discipline and wealth management , which means you probably do n't  need a huge cash reserve , and you probably do n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we choose to carry very little cash and make all purchases on credit . <p> What 's your take ? Do you agree that cash is king ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I had the argument about credit cards and rewards with my co-worker once . He was a die-hard Dave Ramsey fan , who believed that credit card companies were only out to get you and that you were paying extra by using a credit card . My stance was that the extra you are paying for credit cards are already built into the prices because of the fees charged to stores for processing them , so you are paying them whether or not you pay with credit card or cash . <p> Were like the Cash Cow Couple ; we carry little cash and charge everything for reward points . We , of course , pay our credit card bills in full every month . = My daughter has even gone so far to confirm that we do because she " does n't  want to waste family money on interest charges " . I 've never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a business owner , my income fluctuates so this gives me peace of mind . <p> I use my credit card for all purchases big and small . I know some people say that you spend more when you use plastic , but I 've never found that . The only time not having cash is annoying is if you end up somewhere that does n't  take credit cards ( rare in NYC ) or somewhere that makes you charge a minimum purchase ( usually $1o in my experience-annoying ! ) <p> Well done as usual , J ! We use cash for fun stuff , eat outs , drinks , very small grocery shops . We need no protection for these purchases . Everything else goes on the credit card or auto bill pay . So we have a nice mix and although cash flow can always improve , we are comfy at the moment and getting comfier by spending far less than we make and investing . <p> I use a credit card for almost purchases that I can nowadays , because I might as well get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only time I really use cash is for gas , because most of the stations near me charge more for using credit . And the ones that charge the same price are usually just higher priced . Its also great for being able to keep track of my purchases and seeing exactly where they went . <p> I also agree with you that having cash on hand is an important thing for cash only transactions . It also depends on the person as well . If you know you are going to abuse that credit card cash is definitely king ! <p> I definitely use credit cards for the most part to earn rewards and to keep a paper trail . However , I 've always paid my balance in full every month and also spend within my means . I do also use cash when there is an incentive to do so : cash discount . I paid for my used car in cash so that I would n't need to pay any interest . <p> I use both ! For the most part , I use my one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track my spending . I always make sure to carry cash on hand just in case there 's a minimum purchase amount for credit card use . I find that I do n't  keep track of my spending as well when using cash , so that 's the biggest reason I do n't  use it as often . Most people I know rarely keep cash on hand . <p> That 's a solid point counterpoint , Jacob . I have a post in the works on the possible impacts of credit cards on spending behavior , so I 'll have to save some of my thoughts for that . For what its worth , we do use credit cards for just about all our spending . There are plenty of instances when cash has reaped better rewards than any credit card though . Small businesses especially seem to be willing to give a discount for cash ( I typically will suggest 10% and often get it ) . My guess is that it allows them to not only avoid the fees to merchants for CC transactions , but also get to avoid reporting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls through my hands quickly . I feel like I spend less when I pull out the card . I just recently got my first credit card at age 28 and have been good with only using it for groceries and going out , while paying it back every month . Before that , I 'd only use debit and of course only buy things I can afford . I got a credit card because I 'm really into traveling , but cant really afford it , so I want those rewards ! <p> Few years ago I was all for using cards ( I have debit cards , but its the same idea wanted to steer away from using cash ) . Even my savings were in the bank . Then our banks started increasing their commission and I mean really increasing then . Now its pretty normal to place some money in the bank for instance and after a while , when you go and get it out , you have LESS money than what you saved there . Their commissions are so big , that even the small interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you 're LOSING money by keeping it in the bank . <p> I plan on closing down 2 of my personal accounts these days , since I 'm sick and tired of losing money .

But if you mismanage student loan debt , your credit could suffer . Poor credit is guaranteed to negatively impact your financial future . <p> Your credit is comprised of a credit report , and a credit score. - Your credit report is your history of account and payment information . Creditors , insurers , employers , and other businesses use your credit report to evaluate your trustworthiness as a borrower . You can download your credit report free from- annualcreditreport.com- each year . <p> Your credit score is a three-digit number intended to reflect the quality of your credit report . Your FICO score , which ranges from 300 " 850 , is calculated based on several different pieces of information- in your credit report . If your report shows only- positive remarks , your credit score will likely be very good . If you have problems on your credit report , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can check your credit score for free through many credit cards , or Credit Sesame . <h> How Student Loans Affect Your Credit <p> Your FICO credit score is based on five- different categories : <p> Student loans show up on your credit- report , and influence your- credit- score all five of these categories . Let 's talk about each , ordered from most important to least important : <p> Payment history : - If payments are made on time , student loans will improve your credit score as part of a positive payment history . Student loans in deferment or forbearance are not considered late , and contribute to a positive payment history . Late student loan payments will lower your credit score , just like late payments on any other type of account. - If you have late payments or- missed payments , those negative remarks- will stay on your credit report for seven years . <p> Amounts owed : - Student loans are considered an installment loan . An installment loan generally has a starting balance that 's repaid over time with a fixed number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this category , too . Credit cards are considered a revolving line of credit . The amount of available credit you 're using on revolving accounts is more heavily weighted than- installment- loans , and- the total amount owed on student loan debt does not have a significant effect on your credit score . <p> Still , prospective lenders will consider student loan balances when evaluating whether or not you can manage additional debt . For example , if you 're looking to get a mortgage , prospective lenders want to know that you can afford to make your monthly payments. - If you have a lot of student loan debt , - the lender is going to factor your debt into their assessment of your ability to make additional debt payments . Many lenders want to see a reasonable- debt-to-income ratio before making additional loans . <p> Length of credit history : - Student loans can lengthen your- credit history , which is a positive remark on your credit . The age of a student loan is measured by the number of months since the loan was first opened . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight drop in credit score if the lender makes a hard credit inquiry . The good news is that many firms who offer student loan refinancing will not pull your credit until the last step- of the process ( when you finish applying ) , and you can shop around and check rates- without a hard credit pull . - Even when your credit is pulled , the effect is small and short-lived . Your score will continue trending upward if you make timely payments . <h> Summary and Conclusion <p> With student loan debt , payment history is likely to have the largest impact on your credit . Being- an installment loan- also helps diversify your credit profile , which should increase your credit score over time . The other factors contributing to your credit are- less affected by student loan debt . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> Good article .

For the time being , I have a reliable ride , low repair costs and low insurance costs . My co-workers laugh at me for my car , but they have loan / lease payments . Shouldnt I be the one laughing ? = <p> Old guy again , Hey , waaay up there in the blog I thought I saw that you kids got a newer car and got rid of the green Saturn , but I do n't  think I saw the post about what the newer car was . Wahaddya git ? So here I am within a few weeks of my truck turning 200k ( 199734 mi today ) and 15 years ( June 28 ) . And since my last post I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said at a certain age you start to loose the fiddley bits ( coolant leak-old rubber , engine idler pulley assembly ( and belts ) - just dang old , and broken parking brake cable corrosion ) . There reaches a point where maintaining the old car becomes an expensive hobby . After 200k , I have reached that point . I am glad you have the confidence in your car to drive 22 hours . I do n't  . I am waiting to loose a radiator , starter or an engine mount past 200k . And that 's a good indication that its time for a new ( or newer ) car . For me , I 'll take the depreciation hit , I 'll go new , nobody abused the vehicle except me . I do n't  care about resale value because I 'm keeping it at least 10 years anyway . it does n't  have resale value at that point . Fortunately I have had 15 years to fund my " next car " piggy bank so no financing for me . I actually paid cash for the truck 15 year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an observation out there : I have had some folks say since the truck is long paid off I should simply keep it AND buy a new vehicle , that way I would have a backup vehicle and have a truck if I need to haul stuff . This does n't  sound to financially practical to me , the truck will sit out on the curb waiting for me to drive it ( vehicles really should be driven up to operating temp a minimum of once every 2 weeks in my experience ) and in the mean time , I 'm paying insurance and taxes on it . Plus I 'm sure more stuff on the truck will break due to non-use rot and I still have to change the oil . The alternate is rent a truck from my local enterprise rent a car when I need to haul at $75 a day . and Rent from enterprise at $45 a day for a backup vehicle ( plus $15 cab each way ) . Your thoughts ? I know the U.S. lawyers hate it , but I 'm actually thinking of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely subcompact sedan ) and getting a 4ftx4ft harbor freight utility trailer.That should meet my minimal hauling needs and the personal prop tax should be alot lower ( and no insurance ) . An observation , for those few new car models that have not grown into behemoths and changed size classes in the last 15 years , pricing stays steady with inflation . A Hyundai Accent is a good example . It is still the same subcompact class . In 2002 a 4dr GL auto Accent would MSRP at $11249 . Today the equivalent model 4dr SE auto will MSRP at $15745. the CPI inflation calculator indicates inflation from April 2002 to April 2017 should take 11249 to 15298 . So new cars really have n't gotten more expensive , if the model your comparing at has n't  radically changed over time . And the cool thing is that so much that used to be options is now standard . I do n't  think you can buy a car without air conditioning anymore . And as for Hyundai , their quality has vastly improved from way back then , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand has become cheaper over time ? <p> I 'm 27 years old and i 'll probably be driving 10-20 year old cars and trucks the rest of my life . They have already met their depriciation , and not only that , they 're still going to do what the brand new version does . Your 1995 chevy silverado can still haul wood and cement from the home depot as good as the 2017 model . Your 1988 honda prelude still gets good gas mileage like the 2017 civic . Your 2000 ford explorer sport can still get through the snow in winter or through the mud for a camping trip as well as its 2017 version . These vehicles are still good . Sure these cars and trucks might be lacking in bluetooth stereos with Wi-Fi capabilities , maybe they do n't  have a key fob or an immobilizeror maybe they do n't  even have air bags . But you do n't  need those bells and whistles and even so you could modify your old vehicle to include those features anyways ! <p> But just wait 20 years and see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember owning one and all the memories come back . And by that time , the 2017 model that some sucker spent half his income on , can be yours for 2 grand . <p> I recently had to replace my bought as new 2001 Honda Accord , I was not happy about it but unfortunately it failed to the point there was n't much of a choice . Between a likely transmission fault ( or solenoid , but everyone running into this check engine says it ends up being the transmission ) , necessary break repair , a cracked radiator and loose belts the repair cost would have been about $6500 at the dealer and I 'm sure less at another repair shop or some DIY but not enough less to justify the cost . $2500 or less I would have had it fixed , but $4000 $6500 is not worth another component failing in the next few years . Weighing the options I got a used 2016 car with a lot of warranty left on it . The plan is to give the new car to my son as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . <p> I prefer the older vehicles , and I am currently transitioning from a 2010 Camry to a 1998 Acura RL 3.5 . The Camry is a great car , but I doubt it will hold up as well as this 98 RL has my father purchased it new . <p> Well , I drive an 1998 Audi A8 . Yes , in 1998 , this car cost over 40 k . But I bought it in 2006 for under 5k with 80 k on the clock . A lot of money ? Well , its an Audi , the A8 was their flagship premium car when it was manufactured , it was in great shape when I bought it , and its ALL ALUMINUM . Yes , the BODY is Aluminum . No rust . <p> I have put over 90 k on it since 2006 and it has cost me exactly $3,478 for maintenance and parts and tires and brakes and other replacement since then , a full 11 years later . That includes an Alternator I just replaced this week . When you divide $3,478 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury car , that 's great . <p> Its all wheel drive , has all the bells and whistles ( that all still work ) and has been super reliable . It only broke down ONCE when the fuel pump gave out at 155 k . Ca n't blame the car for that . The car gave me plenty of warnings that the fuel pump was failing , but I ignored them until it finally completely failed about 20 miles from home . Otherwise , it has never made me call a tow truck . <p> One more thing . Its a TANK . Even though the body is Aluminum , the car weighs close to two tons . You have massive protection around you with airbags galore and strong crash impact beams to protect you from people texting and running into you because they had to Tweet how fabulous they look driving with their new iPhone . And its comfortable . After all , in 1998 it was the finest car Audi ever produced . Yet , it gets about 28 mpg on the highway , and that 's good enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ V8 . <p> My goal was to keep it until 2018 , the 20 year anniversary . But it still looks and drives like a vehicle a full decade younger , so I may push it to 25 years . Trade in value is probably only $1,000-$1,500 and I 'll never find a car of this quality or reliability for a grand . So I 'm keeping it for a while longer . <p> I love my 1998 Gmc Sonoma . Got it for$850 and had to do some minor fixes like tune up , replace belt and hoses , water pump and cleaned out the radiator . It ran a bit rough and so I ran 3 big bottles if fuel injector cleaner through it during the first 3 tanks of gas . Ran smoothly after that . Now needs a few things fixed , but nothing major . Body is in extremely good condition . Has original paint . Can not be happier with this truck . Takes me everywhere I want to go without complaint , though it gets a bit toasty during summer since the act needs replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this truck is perfect . <p> My beautiful 2002 Saturn SL ( also green ) is in the shop today for a tune-up , and leaving it behind actually brought tears to my eyes . I love that car so much . Its very low-maintenance , easy to keep tidy , super-reliable , and completely devoid of any unnecessary bells and whistles . It gets me from place to place safely and comfortably , and that 's all I need my car to do . It drives like it was made for me and I cant imagine how I 'd get around without it . My dad reminded me that cars do n't  last forever , but with any luck ( and being extra-kind to it ) I 'll be driving this car for a long , long time . <p> I 've only purchased one new vehicle in my life . That was 20 years ago . Well sort of new.it had about a thousand miles on it . Currently our family has three cars a 2004 Toyota Sienna with 178000 miles 2005 Saab 9-3 with 116,000 miles and a newly acquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars were purchased way below cost . All from private owners . The Saturn was just purchased for $500 and the car is immaculate even has a new engine cradle and completely redone engine and no rust . I have no doubt that well go for at least another five years . The car that I bought new 20 years ago was a Saab 900 which just died due to someone putting too much oil in it . It had 218000 Miles . This is why we got the Saturn . I maintain our cars meticulously and do almost all the work myself unless its something major . We have no use for a car payment life is too expensive already . People say that an old car is more expensive though and that is simply a lie . Fact is that the amount of expense we put into a used car is far lower than a car payment plus the high insurance cost . On my Saab 900 even though over the past two years it was a very old car it gave me very little trouble until someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite car to date is the Saturn because its DIRT cheap its in great condition its easy to work on and I do n't  have to worry about people messing things up in my car , like I have to worry about with my beautiful Saab 9-3 . I keep that car in the driveway and only drive it a few times a week . Never to Walmart ! <p> Great points ! totally agree with everything . Just wanted to mention one more reason why you really do n't  want newer car . Automakers have gone nuts with computers and cars are becoming more and more computerized . Even worse , with more computers , every part in a car becomes more proprietary . These days , lots of critical cars in newer cars are n't  even available through third party . so bottom line : If your clunker from way back in 1999 breaks down , you can probably find spare parts and fix it yourself . If your newish clunker breaks down 20 years from now , nobody will have parts to fix it except dealer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most new cars being made now are pre-destined for junk-yard regardless of anything else due to proprietary pars and sheer lack of pars availability . <p> I have a 17 yr old Volvo , that was my moms , until 8 yrs ago . She became too i 'll , to drive . It has 130k miles on it . It needs major work , which will amount to about $2000 . I am reluctant to spend that much on it , but cant afford a car note . Plus the car has sentimental value to me ( once being moms ) . I need to decide what to do , soon . Fortunately , it is still running . <p> I have had three Saturn SL s . It is all I have had in the the last 20 years . I had all three in the yard until November . My roommate owns the first SL1 which is a 1996 green one like yours , bought in 97 . I guess I could have kept it bought I bought a 97 SL 2 with only 9,000 miles from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had to buy another 99 SL 1 from an old lady with 19,000 miles on it . I now have 117K on that one . In total about 240,000 miles of Saturn driving . I was looking for another car but each time I return to Saturn and think that my car can do that and it does n't  cost much . Some rust is eating my undercarriage now brake lines , transmission lines , oil pan . Most expensive repair was $215 because most things are doable on your own that go wrong . It helped having the T boned car of the same color in the back yard . Mine looks pretty shinny still . You can paint the black bumpers with black plastic furniture paint to make them look new again with only cleaning them first . The 99 seems to be the best year for lack of repairs . This post goes on forever , so many people replied . <p> In 99 they updated the engine for the third time , a lot of the other things stayed the same but it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 years to work the issues out by that point . I had a 94 SC2 totaled , 99 SL2 traded for 02 SC2 and briefly a 95 SW2 I used as a beater/hauler that I picked up for $500 and sold for the same . The only real issues I had were oil consumption and the sunroofs never made it past 60k . <p> My older daughter bought a 1987 Toyota pickup , in 2004 or so , very basic but with an automatic transmission . It has the R22 engine which will last forever . Parts do fail , the master brake cylinder has gone out on it twice , and after she moved on to a newer ( but less reliable Subaru ) I took it home and fixed it up for something to do . I found an 88 in a nearby junkyard , and scavenged the interior , changing it from vinyl hell to upholstered seats and carpeting . I stripped the cab down to the bare metal ( left the dash in place though ) and treated a tiny bit of rust , put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new carpet , door panels , seat and uncracked dash . I also fixed the fan with a new switch and some replacement wiring from the donor truck . <p> For the outside , I spray can painted it myself under my carport . I have had training , so I prepped and taped it off , and used a Rustoleum appliance epoxy that was a pretty good match to the original paint . 5-6 coats later , I started on 4-5 coats of satin clear . It worked great , is easy to touch up and has been very durable , after it hardened up . I took the sides off the inside of the bed , cleaned up inside then sprayed primer and more spray on bedliner inside them then resealed them . I treated surface rust with por-15 rust conversion treatment , and fixed one hole through the bed , with JB Weld . Then I made a mistake . I did a herculiner do it yourself bedliner . Wish I 'd done a commercial one , it was not as durable , at all . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rear ended two cars , I had to do some work to push the front end back out . I did that with some help from some friends ( with hydraulic rams ) and installed a new bumper and front fender . <p> My Mom and I eventually bought this truck from daughter #1 for daughter #2 , but d2 was going to college and did n't  need a vehicle . So this truck was a spare , and was borrowed by friends and driven infrequently for a few years . D2 finally got her license at 24 ( ! ) and Mom and I took the truck to Seattle from Idaho to deliver it to her . Its pretty basic , yes , but it has legs . I can pass people at over 75 , going uphill . It may not get up to speed fast , but once there , it goes and goes , at remarkable speed . <p> I drove to Denver once in one day , in about 15 hours . The thermostat needed to be replaced once I got there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I took 2 days headed home . <p> The factory ac still works . It had n't  been serviced in years , but a local shop checked it out , replaced one $5 seal , recharged the freon ( yes , freon ) and it works great . Not new car cold but it works . <p> Before the final delivery to D2 , I replaced a few parts ( the jack went missing at one point ) and got a nice plastic bedliner for $30 that worked great , with minor repairs . I also touched up the paint on the newer fender and tailgate I 'd gotten from a boneyard ( already repaired and installed ) that I 'd been meaning to do . I also got the windshield replaced ( man , did it ever need that ! ) and they treated some rust under the winshield trim when they installed it . I also got the side and back windows tinted . <p> It was a 29 year old truck when I delivered it to D2 . The rear axle seal went out recently , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think about if needed repairs were more than the truck was worth . Nada listed this truck as low $1200 , high $2700 . I read up on the engine and the reliablility , and the simplicity , and gave the repairs the go ahead . The truck now has over 230,000 miles , and is still chugging along . <p> I 've probably put way more into the truck than its worth . That 's just money , not just the time I 've spent . But the time was fun , a labor of love , and the darn thing just keeps going , reliably . Ca n't ask for much more than that . <p> I have a 2003 Ford Focus that I 've had since it was new . I got myself into financial trouble back then and my dad bought me this car and told me I was going to drive it until it dies . I 'm still driving it 13 years later . It does have a little more comforts than some of the cars mentioned here like power windows and locks , keyless entry , heated seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still pretty minimal compared to todays cars . It has 125,000 miles on it and has never needed any major work other than an alternator . <p> I agree about driving old cars . I have a 1990 Ford F150 with 140,000 on it . Its a blast to drive . My mom has a 1998 Ford Ranger with 221,000 on it and a 2005 F150 with 275,000 . She says she will never buy another new car . I wont either . My price is 5,000 max . I do n't  see the need to spend more than that . Its also a plus when you can do repair work yourself . <p> I love this post . It reflects my feelings about cars pretty well . I love cars , do n't  get me wrong . But they are expensive to own and operate . All I need the car I drive every day to do is get me to work and back economically and maybe with some added quirky flair . I may take it too far some times but I have n't paid more than 1,200 dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're handy with a wrench and can read a manual then you can really take your savings to another level . I have a 1987 VW Fox that I 've had for about 4 years now . It was in nice shape when I bought it and ran well but needed some things . The brakes front and back needed to be rebuilt , it needed some brake lines replaced as well as a couple of wheel bearings and the timing belt changed . All total I did the work my self for under 250 in parts on top of my 600 dollar investment and then I tossed a local shop 50 bucks to check my work and just like that I had an 900 dollar running driving automobile that has paid me back in spades . Its never left me stranded and has needed nothing but oil changes since I did all the initial repairs . It consistently averages 31 MPG and costs me my state minimum in excise tax ( 25 dollars ) . Now a 600 dollar car is n't for everyone . The work I did for 250 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone on top of the 250 in parts at a shop and they would n't have taken the time to find the parts for the best price . They would have called NAPA and paid much more . <p> Yes I agree completely . To drive a very old car , you need detail knowledge about the car , and what can go wrong . Not many people are willing to invest that kind of time and effort . But once you have that kind of familiarity and skill in maintaining your old car , these old clunkers can go a long long way for heck of lot less money than any much more expensive newish cars . <p> My husband loves buying new cars , but I have been thinking lately that it could be beneficial for us to keep our old cars and work on getting them back to the point of functioning . I like how you point out that older cars get better gas mileage and are more practical . I imagine that we could do some research and find out how we can use new parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes new cars cost a great deal of money . I saw my parents buy multiple new cars at eventual cost rivaling that of a home purchase . That is a serious financial mistake . I own a very very old car , and a very old truck both of which are my daily driver . My car is very easy to repair as everything is within easy reach . Truck is a bit harder , but at least I do n't  need to jack it up to do most things . Key here is to get an older car which is easy to maintain , and learn to do the work yourself . Things like replacing brake pads , replacing fuel filter , even water pump and timing belt are within reach of DIY owners . All told , I spent about $4000 for all my car/truck purchases during last 30 years of drving ( that 's 2 compact cars and 2 trucks ) , and no more than two or three thousand dollars for total for parts costs . All very easily manageable financially ! <p> I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thinking about buying a new one , and then i decided i did n't  want to stress out about people dinging my door and full coverage insurance . I would rather spend money doing other things . <p> Exactly my thoughts . When my car was new , I was stressed out about people dinging and used to park far away etc . Now , I park in the tiniest gaps that my car can fit in without worry . Love the freedom to park anywhere . <p> We drive an 89 Camry with 73k miles , we bought new . And a 90GT Celica with 74k miles , we bought new . People wave us down or stop to ask if we are interested in selling the cars . Garage kept , so . Look like out of the show room . Had two 77 Celica hatchbacks , bought new back when . One got beat up , but in 1989 sold it to someone beating down our door for it . Sold for approximately $700.00 . Only had 110k miles on . Great fun this website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the money . Reading these comments have been like walking down memory lane . Also back in 1972 my husband had an opportunity to pick up a slick , one owner , 1970 Buick GS Stage I. We bought it for $2,800.00 and in 1989 sold it to a great goy who put it into his Car Collection in Ohio . He even sent us pictures of our gold , with black top , Stage I sitting along side the others beauties he had in his massive heated garage area . We kind of hated to let it go but two new cars had to take over our two car garage . The Buick we know is in good , loving hands . <p> I have a 1993 Ford Taurus with 70,000 actual miles on it . I take good care of it . I had an electrical harness get chewed on by fruit rats . I got a replacement for $20 at the junk yard . Everything else has been items that you expect to wear out . If I live long enough to get to 250,000 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F-150 Inline 6 198500 miles and running strong . Been driving it for 21 yrs . and I do love this truck . No frills , manual drive and windows . AC works great . Knock on wood it will take me to retirement . 1995 Jeep Grand Cherokee is my wifes and is just as dependable with 248,000 miles . Gets us where we need to go . She mostly drives her 2003 Volvo wagon with our three girls . It is a little cramped but ill be dang if I 'm gon na drop $30000.00+ for a new car . Thanks for these posts . I was saved from making a financial mistake . I never new there were so many cheap skates out there . I thought we were all alone in this world . Thanks . <p> Proudly drive a 1991 Saturn SL2 purchased 3 months after production began . We bought 2 Saturns that day . The SL2 and an SC2 . The SC has since departed but we still have , and love , our old SL2 . It was equipped with minimal options . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not much else . The clear coat paint has worn off most of the surfaces but that just helps make it unappealing to thieves . Slightly less than 100K miles on it and I expect to see 50K more before retiring it . Too bad GM chose to close down Saturn . It was one of the best cars that came out of the US in decades and the company was " unwilling to have an unhappy customer " . That made it unique . <p> Saturn may have made quality vehicles at one time , but they were garbage by the 2000s . Plastic throwaway mentality building by that point . That 's when they lost their way . If you want to buy an old one , just make it 1999 or earlier , or you will regret it . <p> My sons first car at 16 is a 1996 Covertible Manual , Red Miata . She turns heads at her age with 130,000 miles . So cute , she is a little sister who would protect her owner- my son for many years to come . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article by chance , and its funny that I recently bought a dark green 1997 Saturn SL1 that is the spitting image of your Saturn ! Mine had only 98,000 miles when I bought it for $2,350 . That 's high for a 1997 Saturn but it is in really great condition . It was a one owner and definitely had been kept in a garage . It is like yours was with the manual windows . Im delighted it has a manual transmission , too ! The air conditioning works quite well and it appears to heat up quickly . By the way , the reason your Saturn was slow to heat up in the Winter was because the thermostat went bad . They get stuck in the open position when they go bad , so that 's why it took so long to heat up in cold weather . <p> My plan for getting a car was to save up $500 cash each month and look on Craigslist every day for cars that had less than 100,000 miles , were built in 1997 or sooner and were selling for $5,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the Saturn . I noticed the choice cars were Ford Taurus , Lincolns and Cadillacs that met my criteria . Some of them had extremely low miles . It would have been a lot more work and money to keep a luxury car in perfect condition . I have an old geezer neighbor that had a 1986 Cadillac in absolutely perfect condition . That 's a geezer hobby and I suspect I 'm falling into that trap because I turned 62 this year . I honestly prefer the simplicity of my 5-speed spartan Saturn hobby as opposed to managing the maintenance of an old Lincoln . <p> Anyway , my Saturn is in excellent condition and when I took it home , I went on youtube and learned the art and science of automobile detailing . I used compound on the finish and followed that with fancy wax . Its totally deep shine now . It almost looks black from shade-side angles . I treated the bumpers and I love those non-painted bumpers nothing looks worse than modern cars with big paint chips knocked out of their painted bumpers . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detergent , scrub brushes and a wet-and-dry vacuum cleaner . No more stains ! It looks new . All I had to do was wipe the seats with a cleaner . They were in pretty clean condition . I learned to sew up a little tear in the drivers seat by watching another vid on youtube . <p> I cleaned and treated all the rubber window and door seals and all the black plastic that is exposed to the elements . I learned how to clean the engine and engine compartment and now that looks new , too . My previous car , a 1991 Toyota Camry had awesome Michelin , expensive tires with only about 20,000 miles on them , so I had them put on the Saturn wheels . After I did that , I scored a combined 40mpg ( I live in a rural area with 2-lane roads and 55 mph . ) I have the standard Saturn plastic wheel covers , but thankfully they are in good shape and cleaned up nicely and look shiny . <p> I changed the brake fluid , transmission oil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old . Ill probably get four struts soon . I want a rebuilt power steering pump because I think it is too noisy . All in all , I 've ended up with a nearly 20 year old car that looks and drives new ! <p> Paying cash for a car , always a good idea . Going with a used car to let somebody else take the depreciation hit , usually a good idea . Keeping a car past 20 years maybe not such a good idea . If you can own a car for 20 years at all may be dependent on several variable factors . <p> How much you depend on the car ( i.e do you have a second car as backup or public transportation ) How much you drive a year . What sort of climate you live in ( hot and dry , near ocean with sea salt spray , in cold where rock salt is used on the road ) Ability to find replacement parts easily after 20 years . <p> I have recently run into all these issues with both my mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past few months . Both were bought new . <p> My pickup ( with 188k ) stopped dead in the middle of the road coming home from work a while back and I had to have it towed in to the shop where Jim , my mechanic works . This particular mechanic has been working on my vehicles and moms vehicle for 20 years . I did mechanic work in my younger days , transmissions , engine rebuilds , struts etc. but I no longer have the tools or patience , Jim does . I just do the simple stuff , fluids , belts , filters . <p> The next day , while my 14 year old truck was in the shop , I was driving mothers 20 year old car ( with 79 k- yes , seriously 79 ) . While I had her car , the transmission went wacky in a parking lot and I could n't get it to go forward , backward lock in park , nada . So I ride back to the same shop in a tow truck again . When I call mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they feel funny . <p> Jim had already repaired my truck in the morning . Apparently some of the insulation had degraded off the 14 year old wire harness and it was shorting out the ignition system against the block . So I took my truck to work from the shop . <p> Later Jim called and said " You are fortunate that the transmission went out , if you put your foot on that brake much more , you would n't have had any rear brakes " . Moms car looks great from the top , no rust and paint is intact , but looking at it from the underside is totally different . The steel rear brake lines had rusted to the point where they were leaking . He showed me where the brake fluid had eaten the paint off of the rear suspension arm . The deterioration to the underside was very evident once I got under the car on a lift . The transmission only required a simple part , but because the car was so old it was no longer available . Fortunately he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were under the car he started poking at the left rear frame rail with a screwdriver and rust flakes started falling on the floor . Then he tells me to turn around and check out the rear bumper from the back side . Its rusted , Swiss cheese . You cant tell from looking at the car when its on the ground because that piece of steel is totally wrapped in a big plastic cover . <p> Jim only agreed to fix mothers car , if I agreed to get her a newer car within one year ( the frame rails and bumper really bothered him ) . I 'm working on that now , expect to have her in something newer before fall . <p> From your blog , it sounds like you kids either avoid driving or have some alternate means of transportation . That 's great . Not all of us are in that situation though . <p> Even if the vehicle is n't used much , the environment takes its toll on all the materials in the car . Nobody thinks about all the plastic and rubber " fiddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day . Some of those " fiddly bits " could affect the cars safety . Ironically mothers car passed state safety inspection every year for 20 years . <p> From my personal observation and experience , the safe and economical lifespan of a car is 13 to 15 years average , depending on the manufacture of the car and assuming good maintenance . A little used car may get 20 years on an outside estimate , but beyond 20 years it becomes a hobby . And hobbies can be very expensive and time consuming . <p> 13 to 15 years gives you lots of time to sock away money in your " next car " savings account . <p> I usually buy used vehicles . New or used , I generally drive them into the ground at about 300,000 km ( 186,000 miles ) . I had a F150 I bought used . At 15 years and 200,000km , it was not worth repairing anymore . Too many things going wrong . And its replacement was also used and my current F150 has 200,000km and still running ok at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plug , it is going to auction or the wreckers . My used Blazer died at abuot 300,000km . It died on me in town and the service people never could find the reason for it not working . So bye bye for that one . Then I replaced it with a used Dodge Neon one year old and I kept that ticking till 300,000km and then it had way too many problems to keep it . I did replace that with a new Toyota Corolla and it has 194,000 km on it now and I plan on keeping it till it dies or becomes too unrealiable . I live in a rural area and cant risk having a so so vehicle . If one lives in town , you can risk using older vehicles that have problems as you are never far from help . Out here , a break down in the winter would be extremely unsafe . But why someone would waste money buying or leasing new vehicles every 2 years is beyond me . <p> Thanks for the post . Cost of Ownership is so important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If is cost more to fix it than it worth ? " . It is time to consider moving on . Many new cars have New Tech that is has not been in production many years . The CVT Transmission , Direct Fuel Injection , and Computer Infotainment management systems . One could imagine what price or where you have to take it to get it fixed when the warranty is over . <p> I 'm 69 years old and have a 1997 Toyota Corolla with 79000 miles and a 1998 GMC Sonoma with 105000 miles . I have spent a total of just over $2000 in the past 2 years for repairs . Total insurance and tax cost is about $400 per year . Many of the reasons for keeping an old car apply to me , but the cost of taxes and insurance are primary . I 'll keep both these vehicles until they die and only then will I replace . I just think of the money I save each year . <p> Every car my wife and I have ever owner has been more than 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No matter how small the value is , it is a positive value and contributes to our net worth . Financed and leased cars contribute zero to net worth and deduct from it you ca n't claim to own something you do n't  really own . Plus , I can actually change brakes and do other reapirs on my own on older cars . With newer cars there 's not much you can do and some require special tools that only dealers have . <p> Its great to read through posts like this . I live on what I call a " smart " neighborhood block . Most every one drives a 10-5 year old car or van , but sends their kids to nice private schools . I feel very strongly that there are better areas of life to spend ( or save ) your money . I also stress buying nice vintage furniture ! <p> I currently own and drive a 1971 chevy C10 longbed . I love this old truck . Its got a bit of rust and several dents and a faded worn out original paint job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio and nothing powered . BUT Its been reliable for the most part and the fact that it turns heads every now and again is kinda nice . I mostly like it because I can do most of the repairs myself , I can haul things or go camping . And it still gets me from point a to point b . Just today I replaced a hose on it because the hose was cracked . <p> I agree , Jason . My Toyota is 16 years old with 145,000 miles . It is reliable , gets good mileage , has a large trunk , and looks great . I have driven some new vehicles ( SUVs ) that were nice but I cant seem to part with my 2000 Camry ! <p> I have 2 cars . A 1990 Honda Civic hatchback and a 1995 Honda Civic sedan . Both cash cars , very basic , both run great and are excellent gas savers ! Got them cheap too . People around here do not seem to like them though probably because they are slow ( I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad name ) The 90 is pretty fun to drive actually . I hope to never get rid of it any time soon . They are both manual so unless I abuse them , they will not have transmission problems . On a long trip of 200 miles or so , either one will get about 42-45 mpg . I try to keep them running in top shape so they do not break down at the worst times ( not that they really break down to begin with ) Glad to see someone who has similar views about cars like I do ! Drive that saturn until the wheels fall off and then some ! <p> I love that I came across this charming post . I absolutely love my 93 Plymouth AcclaimI will be so unhappy when I have to give it up . If Chrysler was still selling this car I would buy it again . What I love is the simplicity Zero frillssimple dashboard Great visibility .. No cockpit feelbench seating .. classic unique profileproud that it has the orig Chrysler hubcapsincredibly roomy for a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars a BMW X1 and I currently have a 2014 Dodge Durango I 'm the only owner purchased it brand new and I love it but , I 'm sick of the monthly payment almost $600 plus tags are about $500 a year too UHG . I have 2 kids who are messy too . Looking into selling it and just buying a Used 2004 Ford Expedition for cash safe , reliable and still big enough for our family . Trying to be fiscally responsible . I do n't  think I 'll ever buy a brand new car again . Thanks for this article ! ! <p> Great reading this . I 'm from india and I drive an 8th generation 2007 Honda Civic that I bought for around $3000the 1.8 litre I-VTEC mill is pretty peppy at high rpms , efficient at low rpms and gets ok gas mileage ( 10 kilometres per litre with sedate driving ) . its been 6 months since I got the car and i havent spent a penny on it apart from fuel and a new Honda badge as the original one had become dullplan to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old accord buying used is definitely a financially sound move ! Specially in countries like india where new cars are priced exorbitantly . <p> I drive a 2001 Buick Park Avenue in Toronto . It has 266,000 kms on it and I paid $9200 for it ten years ago when it had 129,000 kms . It is by far the best car I have ever owned . Three years ago it needed $1200 worth of repairs for tie rod ends , lower control arms and struts and then $300 for a water pump . I spent $450 last year fixing the air conditioning . Those are the only repairs it has in ten years besides routine things like tires , oil changes and breaks . Our winters and road salt have been hard on the paint and it is starting to rust pretty bad . But it still drives so smooth , and it has the most comfortable leather interior and cushy seats , it is like driving a couch . I only pay $40 a month to insure it and I plan on keeping at least 5 more years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 Saturn Ion . I bought this baby new with a six year contract . I laughed out loud when I was reading this article . I can relate to all these pointers , except 6 , 12 and 17 . The drivers seat is extremely flat- There is no cushion ! I have driven my car 240,000 miles . ( It is now in the shop to replace the ORIGINAL clutch . ) I will never get rid of my Saturn . Even when I buy a newer car ( used ) . I will pay cash . There is no freedom like being out of debt ! There are other things I 'd like to spend my money on , and a nice fancy car is not one of them ! <p> Glad I came here . It is freaking 2016 and I got so used to my 95 Jaguar xj6 that I 'm considering travelling 4 hours to get the same car . I used and abused the 95 beyond repair and will save it for parts . The 97 , I expect to grow old in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I will never pay a car note and I expect to replace my wifes 2002 Santa Fe with a 2012 model . I can not do car notes , and I know that with proper care , if the 97 Jag powertrain is solid , I will have it for at least another 10 years .. Thank you for the great site = <p> I drive a 2000 Odyssey . We have 4 kids , one who just started college . It has 189,000 miles . We got it 4 years ago when we moved back from overseas . We thought we were going to move again " but are still here . I 've had to put more money into it than I wanted , paid $4500 plus at least $2500 in a couple major repairs . I try to do everything I can myself , but cars are more complicated than they used to be . I totally agree that cars depreciate and are a lousy investment ! <p> I owned a 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue , best car ever . Unfortunately , went to a dealer just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there several hours later buying that vehicle . My husband coerced me into thinking it was the best deal ever . Have regretted it ever since . I am now considering this " newer " vehicle and buying a newer Intrigue . They are an excellent car on the open road , handle really well and hug the road &amp; I think they 're pretty safe . The newer vehicle has to many " gadgets " on it and I want it gone . To much technology . <p> I love this ! I work and my wife stays home with the kids . We have a few rules for cars that fall into line with what you are saying . <p> 1 . If you ca n't pay for it with cash , than you do n't  need it . A car payment is the worst . It ties up money on a monthly basis , and you loose a bit every month to interest . 2 . Get something that is easy to work on . Almost all common issues with older models have been hashed out on car forums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tutorial on how to fix the car on Youtube . <p> Any car made in the last 20 years is not going to have much of an issue getting to 150,000 with little headache . I would say with that Saturn , you may want to change that timing belt at around 100,000 . Thatll be the thing that does it in , and its totally preventable . They are crazy easy to do . <p> I have a 2002 Prizm I bought at an Insurance auction for 2-3k when it was a year old . It needed new hood , headlights , radiator . I agree with all your notes . I 'm a bit longer in the tooth then you &amp; I will say the lack of car payment &amp; all the associated extra costs has saved my bacon during layoffs , career building jobs , etc . Parts started to be easy to get after 5 years &amp; i find it relaxing that I know what every little noise is &amp; which to disregard . <p> I currently have a 16 year old Dodge Durang0 ( yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been considering buying a new used vehicle in case this truck dies all of a sudden . Ive been considering manual transmission , but I do n't  want to be stuck with a car if I break it on the test drive as I currently do n't  have enough ( if any ) confidence driving stick . I have n't practiced since the one time with my dad , due to my busy schedule . There 's a few in particular that are less than 3 grand . Yes , they are about as old as my truck but they have less miles on them and they have a lot less rust on the outside than my truck . I would be using the car for every day use ( driving to work and to the grocery store , among other things ) . The question is : do these cars run ( well ) ? That I 'll have to find out . I 'm like you . I tend to be frugal in just about everything , but especially cars at least until I can afford a bit of a younger one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , look at the human analogy of that ? Our younger generations are n't  necessarily better . <p> Great to save money , but the older cars are just not as safe . grisly stories of people who just loved their old cars but in a slow speed crash suffered terribly . Be safe first . And now most cars have wonderful new affordable safety features . <p> I make more than enough money to be a new car , even a really nice one . In my youth I would have bought a new car every few years . However , as I 've gotten older , the appeal of saving is more attractive to me than driving a sexy car . I drive a 1993 Ford Taurus , with over 200,000 miles . It gets me from point A to point b , which for me is home and a train station . That 's all I need it for . <p> 1996 Oldsmobile Ciera with 163,000 miles on herAlways starts , comfy ride , 26 mpg . Looked good until this last winter now has some rust on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  know ) that I have n't been able to remove tried everything anyone said but nope .. and the upholstery is starting to give at the seams . Costs about $1000 a year for tune-up , oil change , maintenance.Keep good tires on her . Friends tease me horribly , but they are making $300/month car payments and I am not hah ! Hope to get another 100,000 miles out of the old girl ! <p> I THINK I HAVE TO DISAGREE IN GENERAL AND SAY THAT : THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN DRIVING OLD CARS NOW V.S. IN THE 70s and 80s and 90s I HAVE NOTICED THE PRICE THEY WANT FOR USED VEHICLES AND IT IS INSANE . TOO TOO MUCH MONEY FOR VEHICLES WITH 150 TO 200 THOUSAND MILES THAT IF YOU FIGURE THE REPAIR COSTS THAT SHOPS WANT / REALLY/ MAKES THEM WORTH NEXT TO NOTHING . example 2001 tracker last year 140 thousand miles and price 6000 dollars . Huh ? 14 year old car . Bought a old ranger with 156000 and its been nothing but fix this fix that service this service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealers are so over priced and want to give you nothing for trade in and do nothing to the car but toss it on the lot and double the price . i tell them are you crazy ? i can buy a new one for 20000 but you want 9000 for one with 100000 miles on it ? no warranty and repairs to come . well really i 'd say if your lucky you might get a cheap car and get good service out of it . i just do not believe its the bargain it used to be as repair costs are 4 times more expensive and the cars themselves at least double what they used to be . <p> Just like any purchase , you need to check over a used vehicle . A vehicle is only as good as its been driven &amp; cared for . And just because a dealership ( or seller ) wants X dollars does n't  mean that 's what they will get for it . <p> I love this ! I drive a 16 year old car and I plan to drive it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " embarrassing " , but the amount of money I save is definitely worth it ! Its getting me that much closer to paying off my student loan debt , and that 's what matters . <p> Funny , my daily driver is a Saturn . I own a 1998 SW2 Wagon and a 1999 SC1 Coupe . I purchased both for less than $1k , rebuilt the engines , replaced bad parts , and own both for less than $3500 combined and they run like new ( with all new parts . ) They 're basically new cars . I love my Saturns . I plan to run my Wagon into the ground , and sell my coupe soon to buy a truck so I can haul boats . My 3rd car is a 2014 Mustang GT . It cost me $40k out the door . I love the 400 horsepower , but having $40k in my bank account would probably have been nicer . <p> I still drive a 2004 Chevy Cavalier ( automatic ) that i have to manually shift the gears in because the transmission has been giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at over 200,000 miles , its still kicking . and spitting , vibrating , rattling , etc. , etc . I hate that if I leave it sitting more than 2 days I have to jump it off , but I love that I have not had a car payment for a lot of years now ! <p> I also went down a similar route of upgrading/downgrading cars until I got to my 8th car , a 2003 ford focus . I intended to upgrade again this summer but after reading this excellent post I have changed my plan . I shall run the little focus into the ground . Maintainance costs are so much lower than getting that newer , shiny car . Even when you get that new car it still has to be maintained , more money on top of the thousands it cost to upgrade . It is the most economical method in getting the best value from something . This same method of frugality shall now be applied to my smartphone , clothes and all my " stuff " . I shall say no to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ans 1998 GMC Sonoma . Both need some costly repairs the Corolla needs about $700 and the Sonoma needs $2000 . Even that is far less than buying even a used car . I will probably fix the Corolla and just drive the Sonoma until it dies . By the way , the Corolla only has 78,000 miles and the Sonoma 104000 . Low mileage for old cars . This blog made up my mind to repair and keep ! ! ! <p> Great blog post . We bought a used Mazda 6 several years ago and sold an older vehicle that had high maintenance costs . Transitioning to a one-car family was tough at first , but now we have it down and do n't  plan to go back . Thanks for sharing the benefits of owning a used car . I look forward to reading your other articles on hypermiling . <p> Buying used cars is an insanely huge way to save money ! Of course , you do want to look out for major damages and check the vehicles history before you buy it . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for repairs . You can even buy used replacement parts ! <p> This is a great post . Am so in agreement . Our Toyota Corolla is nearly 20 and still passes its MOT every year . Its hilarious , the garage do n't  know what to say . Am in the UK and getting parts is proving increasingly difficult ( small things like a recent door hinge ) but we will carry on using our car as long as we can . It cost us $1000 and we 've had it for around 8 years . Its not a beautiful car but very beloved by us . <p> here 's a pic of my 1993 Taurus Wagon . http : //imgur.com/GRRSg5n Taken about a week ago . Its only got 95k on it , and I owned it since 2007 ( when I bought it with about 60k on it ) . I also have a 05 Impala , but the wagon seems to have a smoother ride , I love the thin steering wheel and even the steering is smooth . I can haul a lot of stuff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I want it to last forever . <p> It got a little rust on the bottom of the doors , but I ground that down and repainted . Someone had cut the rear defrost wire , and I never bothered to see why they did that . The drivers side window is a little weirdyou have to press the switch in a certain place for the window to go down , and the rear doors only open from the inside . I bought an instrument cluster from a Sable , and now I have a working tach in the car . I modified a garage door remote where I just push a button on the glove box to open the garage door . <p> I 'm 17 years old and bought my 2nd car which is a 86 ' Toyota Corolla Sedan , its a pretty rare car , people love it , its basic , gets great gas mileage , has a sunroof , and no blindspots what so ever , plus its easy to take care of ! I 'm also a fan of stanced cars and that scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that works wonders ( probably better than cars today except for speed wise ) is just as great . <p> I love this article ! I own a 1998 Toyota Camry . I am all about frugality . The paint is chipping off of it pretty badly now , but its nothing a new paint job cant fix . Painting is n't all that expensive either . I would say that owning an old car is completely worth it in the long run and will save thousands of dollars . <p> Painting a car is n't cheap by any means . If you go to a cheap place to get it done , then that 's what you will getA CHEAP WORTHLESS PAINT JOB . I think its a good thing to buy a great car with low miles and keep it for a very long time . My car is a 2003 honda S2000 . Yes I paid a fortune for it brand new , however I am keeping it for a very long time . <p> I think that it is really wise to drive older cars if they are reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite affordable . It seems that a lot of people do n't  understand that . However , I do think that it is important to make sure that the vehicle is reliable through things like repairs . <p> I have a 1986 Pontiac Bonneville , she old as hell and eats gas , but it get me from a to b and it has n't  broke down once . I paid $900 for it and it does as good of a job getting around as any other car . I think I 'm driving this old beast til this planet runs out of oil . <p> Glad to hear it ! Same with me and my 96 Olds.didnt cost me anything .. willed to me by a dear patient who took really good care of it .. Hope you do n't  mind Im going to make this my new slogan " I plan to drive this old car til this planet runs out of oil " LOL <p> I drive a 1992 Honda Accord with 491,000 miles on it . I drive 60 miles a day , but it gets me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belt . I 've learned that cars only have so many parts and as long as the body holds up , you can just keep on driving it . I get teased sometimes when I go on dates , but I just like the larger balance in my savings account from not dumping money into cars . <p> My current car is a 1995 BMW 318i . Its fun to drive , eats up highway miles well , and only sips gas . I do n't  see the reason to purchase a newer one . Ill have to admit , seeing the newer ones does bring on slight jealousy that fades when I see part prices . I 've had no real problems out of it like my old Accord from the same year . Most parts are easy to find and cheaper online . It will literally save you THOUSANDS if you avoid the dealer like the plague ! It runs well , except for a small oil leak and broken ABS sensor . <p> I live in London England I have two yes two 22 year old Rover 214s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e bay without even looking at it beforehand . It needed a new clutch but had covered just 37k miles . I did the work myself but I 'm no mechanic I just learnt it from a book . Since thin I 've had it about 9 years . It has now done about 100k and still going strong . Mind you in terms of reliability it was never its strong point . I 've had to replace the clutch , gearbox , brakes , cylinder head gasket and all 16valves when the timing belt broke . It was even written off in 2011 when a BMW hit it but again I repaired it myself with secondhand panels -new bumper , lights , bonnet , wing . Would I ever sell either of them ( the other is mint with just 24k ) ? not as long as I can help it as there are also very few of them around . We do n't  appear to make much in England these days as it has become a dumping ground for foreign goods and cars . <p> My husbands car has n't  worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my car like you two . He actually has an 80s Porsche 944 just like the one in your picture . How long did you have it for and did it require a lot of auto repair ? We cant keep sharing a car , but I 'm wondering if we should fix his Porsche or sell it for another car . <p> Had it around 2 years , and luckily it did n't  need many repairs ( which can get expensive on an old Porsche ) . They are fun little cars , but I would sell it and get something better on gas , and cheaper to repair . <p> I enjoy your humor about your car . Having to not worry about dings and stains in your car would be wonderful , but I 'm not sure I could handle how slow it would be . Do you ever see yourself selling your car for salvage parts in the future ? <p> I have a 1995 Ford explore with over 200,000 miles on it as well 1997 Mercury Mountainair with over 2000 miles on it that looks a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 years second owner and it runs like a charm but ive had it on non opo .. for three years now it wont pass the The smog omissionsso I 'm going to retire it and give it to cars for kids and hopefully they can bring it back I still drive my 1997 Mercury and I 'm gon na drive it until the wheels fall off I love not having to Car payment ! ! ! thanks for sharing and reminded me why I have an old car = <p> When I was growing up , my parents always bought used cars . My dad felt like they were less expensive to have repairs done on them . Surprisingly , we never had major car troubles throughout my childhood . <p> I 'm not necessarily disagreeing with your post I just want to share my own experience/wisdom with driving an older car . <p> I used to drive a 2000 Ford Taurus up until 5 months ago . Bought in in 11 with 87k miles on the clock . It now is too unsafe to drive with 139k miles and 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over $5000 to keep it on the road . The work Ive done to name a few : brake pump , A/C compressor , several coolant hoses , several suspension components , CV boots and joints so many repairs , Ive lost track . Now , the brakes nearly locked up on the freeway and need $600 in work , the exhaust needs replacing , Ford quoted me $3100 to fix several oil leaks , the CEL was on for a while because of a failing fuel pump , it needs new struts , and I cant sell it because it is currently unsafe to drive even around the block . To repair it , it would probably need at least $2500 in repairs for a car that 's worth around $1800 not worth it to me . I bought it for $4500 in 11 , put $5000 in repairs , and it needs about $2500 in repairs now . If I would have spent $8000 on a 2004-2007 Civic or Corolla in 2011 , I would have been way ahead . <p> I agree with you about new cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet . I would never go out and buy a shiny , 2015 car because in 2-3 years , itll no longer be a shiny 2015 car . Itll be an older car that 's exponentially losing its value . Cars loose a ton of value the moment they drive off the lot . <p> If I had to recommend something , buy a 4-7 year old used car , drive it for 10-12 years , and then replace it with another 4-7 year old used car . I just bought a 2008 Toyota Corolla and plan on driving the damn thing till the wheels fall off . Sure its not brand new and is a little dated , but it gets 30MPG , parts are common and cheap , and I paid cash for it . Compared to a new car , it was a steal . It cost about $5,000 more than what the Taurus would have cost to repair but at least I do n't  have to keep dragging it back to my mechanic every month and getting worried sick every time I hear/smell something funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's be real here there 's a certain point where stuff starts to break faster than the cars worth . <p> If the 2008 Corolla is still running and not costing me much to maintain in 10 years , you 'll be damn sure I 'll still be driving it . But once that thing starts costing more than its worth , I 'm selling it and finding another " new to me " car . <p> I would not recommend to ANYONE to go out and buy a 20+ year old car today . Just look around how many &lt;1995 cars do you see driving around ? Not many because after 20 years the car becomes an antique . The only way driving a 19 year old car makes sense is if you have owned it for 19 years and know exactly it 's maintenance history . Buying an extremely old used car like that is a HUGE risk . <p> Do n't get me wrong I LOVE the Saturns , Toyotas , and Hondas of the 1990s . Great cars . But there is n't a huge difference in the early-mid 2000s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are A-B cars , still get good gas mileage , they 're still humble and worry free they just are n't falling apart . <p> Hi , I ordered a 1993 Mustang 5.0 coupe Calypso Green from Ford in February 1993 . In March 93 I picked it up with my girlfriend who would later become my wife . We went on our honeymoon in that car . Its still my daily driver , the Noble Steed . 260k miles , she can still laydown some patch , chirp the tires shifting into 2nd ( with a near empty tank of gas ) , and I get 2-3 solicitations a year from guys who want to buy my car . I think I made my last payment in March 1997 . Great car . <p> Generally , people like and love their old vehicle , whether cycling or car and sometimes they attached to vehicle by heart and they always want to use it so they care their vehicle in a good way . I am also using my car for past ten years and it gives good feelings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this blog . <p> Absolutely loving all the stories on here ! I also own a volvo 340 that 's just over 24 years old with a little surprise under the bonnet . But the rest looks standard and " of the era " Interestingly everyone seems to grow fond of older cars , they carry stories and memories that new cars just do n't  . I feel this is what gives them a character and makes one smile . I love the 944 above , I always look at them and 924s aswell but the logical mind outways the heart unfortunately ! all those points you mentioned are very valid , interestingly Ive gone the opposite way with regards to point 17 . I used to not care at all what happened , and now I actually care ! haha .. maybe i should move on before its to late ! <p> Thanks for this post . It was fun to read and inspiring to see someone else who appreciates the benefits of an older vehicle . My husband and I own a 1982 Toyota Corolla wagon . Everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as mileage is mind boggling for vehicle of itss age . 36 mpg city driving as we never take it out on interstate . We get offers to purchase it on a regular basis . The highest offer so far has nee $4000. 4cylinders and 5speed transmission . Needless to say , my husband refuses to sell . <p> I drive an 87 chev s10 blazer that I bought in 97 or 98 , so I 've had it for about 18 years . I do n't  make much money and havent had a raise in over 10 years . The brake and gas lines were replaced on it , and the mechanic says everything is so rusty underneath . They put " too much " salt on the roads in Wisconsin . Good enough . I had some painting done on it about 5 or more years ago but when I start looking at what they want for an SUV and its practically got 3 tires in the grave it is a huge investment and how long witll that vehicle last and what was fixed on it already . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once the roads are bare of salt , it seems like I 'm the first one at the car wash washing my almost 20 year old truck . People drive around too much and the car as almost 200 , 000 on it and it is only 5 years old . Com on . Then they want over $15,000 for it . In todays world everybody is always trying to keep up with the Joneses . So far my Blazer the heater works , the 4+4 works , got me out of a steep ditch , reliable in witner when it gets cold out . After reading the posts I feel much better about my almost 30 year old blazer . <p> I live in Wisconsin and I know what you mean . I had a 2000 2 door hatch focus with 205,000 miles . I should of bought used I was a fool and got new . I only did because 2 mechanics were saying it was getting soo rusted underneath and risking to put up to fix when needed . I miss that car now I have car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . However I keep my cars forever . I had a chevy sprint 234,000 miles on it til a cylinder went so I thought I should get a new vehicle . Geo Metro 200,000 some miles on it was starting to use oil way too much . I use to drive alot those cars only lasted maybe 6-6=1/2 years . then my focus would of been 17 years almost 4 months but it was gone to need a few expensive repairs . So I thought it was time now I regret it . All i can say I hope this new one lasts as long as my great focus . Why did they have to give up the 2 door hatch . all the hatch space in these new vehicles I call it a cubby hole . My focus hatch was unbelievable nothing compared to all the stuff I stored in there all the time . Or what I could store . I miss my car soo much . though after this I do n't  know if I will ever buy new again but then again I only buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for at least 200,000 miles if possible . I hope my new yes a kia soul lasts like my last gems I owed ! ! <p> I drive a 23 year old car for almost exactly the same reasons . Especially 16 . Temperature Control Issues my front electric windows do n't  work so we have to avoid driving in the heat of the day during summer . Certainly encourages less driving ! <p> I got the car my paternal grandfather bought when it was a year or two old . So , its been in the family since 1985 And other than maintenance and fuel , the car has n't  cost me anything . There 's something nice about that . Its fairly low-option and the A/C does n't  work now , but the car does run . Its a 1984 Chevrolet Caprice Classic Sedan , and I expect its retaining its value since it already hit rock bottom and maybe itll go up from here too ; Two people inquired about buying it since 2010 . <p> Love this post ! We have a 99 Honda Accord that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the missing-the-new-car smell moment but I do n't  want to go back to the time when we had car payments . You 're right about the associated costs of owning old cars . Even with our cars age and 171k mileage , we pay $550/year on comprehensive insurance . I read that insurance for newer cars with monthly payments could cost over a thousand . Just this fact is enough to make me allergic to buying new cars . <p> I have essentially the same car you have , except mine is a 99 Acura TL . Ijust had a huge repair bill , but I bit the bullet and decided to keep the car , because I am already paying on another car loan , and fixing the old Acura was the only way I could continue to drive an Acura . <p> 1986 Cutlass Ciera ! My parents purchased it off the Showroom Floor when I was a kid , then it got handed down to me after many well cared years with them . The car is 29 years old , been stolen twice , wrecked several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Has enuf miles on it to have driven to the moon and back . Its my daily car , hard to find parts for it now , usually have to McGuyer stuff together and modify alot of stuff . The heater does n't  work right anymore and its not the most efficient on Fuel .. and the Muffler is tied on with wire for nowbut it still starts &amp; drives did put a $2000 Transmission in some time ago and the Shop tried to talk me out of pouring that much money in an old carbut the occasional big fix and having NO car payment is pure Heaven . I still have the original owners manuel and pictures of it from advertisements out of a 1986 magazine . The File with all the Repairs and Maintance over the Years is Thicker than a Bible . The car outlived the place we bought it from ( Winders Chevrolet ) in Columbus Oh . <p> I used to drive a 1998 Subaru Legacy Outback , but then it died just shy of 200k so I decided to forego buying another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would ride my bike or take public transportation and its been great . <p> Cool story you got there ! Being a car aficionado since my birth because of parents and grand-parents being in the field , I also did mistakes by driving sporty cars . Thankfully not to big mistakes as people who buy new car ! I always let people pay the big first-second years of huge depreciation ! <p> Since we live more a mustachian lifestyle , we sold our two cars and bought an old good Toyota Prius from 2006 with 100000kms . Since then , every single cost tied to the car decreased dramatically compared to our previous cars ! It is such a great and huge car that every forum I checked mentioned it . Even taxi cab driver like it a lot as I read stories where people drove it until 500000kms with doing only regular service and changing few times the tires and breaks . <p> I cant stop to recommend it ! ! ! Even though since less than a year we first recommend our new daily habit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings back so many memories . My best friend in high school ( 2000-2004 era ) had one of those saturns , with no bells or whistles . <p> My car is still depreciating . I bought it new ( yeah , I know ) , and its now rolling up to 9 years old . I 'd love to get another 10 years out of it . It still looks pretty good and has n't  started to show its age , but I think in a few more years it should get interesting . <p> I 've got you ALL beat ! ! ! One of our two cars is now , in some circles , an ANTIQUE as of this month ! It is now 20 YEARS OLD and purchased new by us ! ( The other one is 15 years old also purchased new ) . <p> The key is to choose carefully including Consumers Report articles on ratings/mechanical longevity , be regular and meticulous on maintenance , and even train yourself in auto mechanics so you not only can do a lot of your own maintenance and repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodic replacement and repair . <p> Keeping a vehicle for so long has many advantagessome already mentioned . But I find some additional ones . You get to know the quirks and mechanics of the vehicle like the back of your hand . Even a change in the sounds made you 'll recognize and even many times pinpoint ( even if having another do the repair ) . Additionally , from a financial standpoint , it allows ANYONE to get the nicest , most " decked out " car that they desire ! Why ? Because even though all of those options will add thousands to the initial cost it really comes to nothing when prorated over 15 or 20 years . You get to drive the car of your dreamsand do n't  have to pay a lot for those " goodies " . <p> The last benefit ( at least potentially ) is whenever you want to sell your car , you get a huge PREMIUM for it . Its a one owner , excellent condition/well maintained vehicle with all of the maintenance records since day one ( we keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item(s) and cost listed . Someday , its quite possible a collector may pay $5K for our now 20 year old carto then put into their auto museum = <p> Gon na be honest my car cosmetically is in amazing shape its a 02 Nissan sentra with 75k it was my moms 8 years ago . She left it to me in her will when she passed . Took me almost one year to bring myself to drive it . But its the best car Ive ever owned only had to invest in new brakes and struts normal ware and tare . I had to modify it alittle to get rid the " old lady look " ( love you mom ) but I absolutely love this car and would n't trade it for a Rolls Royce . <p> My chariot is a 1999 Explorer Sport named Buster . I 've put all but the first 3 miles of the current 113K on him .. The only rust is on the running bars and I 'm leaving them on ( like sacrificial zincs on a boat ) which is appropriate because I run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Impressive . Ive been driving my current car for eight years , the longest stretch for one car for me . Unlikely I will make it to nineteen with it , but I 'm hoping for at least five more . <p> My husband just sold his 2002 Mazda Protege and upgraded to a more " civilized " car a 2012 Infiniti sedan . He needed a nicer car for his job ( he drives for hours at a time with his boss/colleagues and calls on executives ) and I fully supported him , but he still has some buyers remorse and is thinking about trading down again to save on gas/ins/car payments . <p> Sometimes I 'm a little embarrassed by my mothers car , 1991 Subaru Legacy when I look around the church lot and see all these much newer , glam cars/suvs . However , this car is a tough one . Has a few bumps /bruises and cat scratches , down to 3 hub caps , air that does n't  work but , it also has comfy bucket seats , a deep trunk for hauling , power windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can travel in the snow . Well that 's is if it is n't too deep as it is a lower car . It runs and is in decent shape under the hood . Mine is an 11 yr old Hyundai Santa Fe with 98000 miles which I can only hope will continue running as well as that Subaru . Certainly do n't  make them the way they used to . Now its all plastic , no bumpers to help soften the blows and runs by computer . I 'll take the old any day . <p> While we have a 2001 Isuzu Rodeo as the " family car " aka my wifes , I drive a 1989 Isuzu Trooper , The heat works , the AC almost works , it has an AM/FM Cassette , lots of body rust , &amp; a drivers seat that needs to be reupholstered . The straight shift is geared low so its like starting off in a tractor trailer but it runs good , with the seats folded , itll haul anything and I do n't  worry about messing up the carpet with lumber or topsoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love that SUV . <p> I love it ! Our 1999 Taurus station wagon suddenly needed a new engine ( blown head gaskets and heater core a few thousand $$ repair ) so we decided to let her go . Moment of tearful silence , please . We have a late model Honda Fit and a Ford Fiesta in the driveway for real life commuting . What we needed was another take-stuff-to-the-dump , bring-home-lumber , take-dogs-to-the-beach vehicle like our station wagon had been . So we replaced a 1999 wagon with . a 1996 Nissan Pathfinder . It has " only " 101K miles on it and the service we bought through completely inspected it , cleaned it up and put new tires on . It is fantastic , and I hope it lasts another 19 years and 100K miles , because I love that we paid cash for an SUV that can get snowed on , bumped into , etc etc and we do n't  have to care ! <p> I also always liked your first car . . . that 944 had class &amp; style ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a ton of hard earned cash . Cash that will build a nice nest egg over the coming years ! <p> We have a 10 year old Sienna and a 9 year old Tundra . Weve decided to sell both of them to upgrade to something newer that better fits our big familyprobably a Suburban . With six in the family there are few options that fit that many . But I definitely wont be buying new . 70k for a new Suburban is a bit much . <p> 94 lincoln towncar. i only get about 19 mpg , but it beats having a payment . ive enjoyed learning how to do a little maintenance myself : oil changes , air filter , fuel filter , fuel pressure regulator , relays . nothing serious but it makes me happy to learn a few new tricks . this old thing barely has any paint left on the outside , the windows do n't  work , the radio antenna was stolen , the ( huge ) trunk does n't  close all the way , several other cosmetic/electric problems , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its only got 168k miles and ive got my fingers crossed for another 100k. i 'm taking that $300/mo new car payment and stashing it in my savings every month . at one time i did the math and it would take driving 50k-80k miles/year ( cost of gas ) in a new $18k 50mpg car to be cheaper than the linc. no thanks . <p> My car is now 11 years old , and is still running great . It has lower mileage compared to most cars that are as old because I did n't  use it very much while in college . I think the reason that most compact cars do n't  get gas mileage as good as older cars is because of all the safety features ( and other features ) that have become standard/required over the years . So even if you make technology improvements to squeeze a few extra MPG out , all that added weight cancels it out . <p> I 'm not saying that I do n't  get why you still drive it because I do , but I personally will be trading my car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little newer . Being a single girl with not much car knowledge means I need to make sure I have something newer and a little more reliable . <p> It makes a lot of sense to keep driving such an old but reliable care when you lay it out like this . My wife and I spent a ridiculous $30,000 for each of our cars in about a years time . Yes , that is $60,000 for two cars . I have regretted that decision for a while now , because at the time we both had cars that were not even 4 years old yet . <p> When we first graduated college and started earning good money , we were caught up in the rat race and were all caught up in material things . Not that we do n't  like nice things , but really $60,000 for cars ? ? ? I do n't  even like cars that much . <p> The good news is that we both bought Hyundais that come with a great 10/year 100,000 mile warranty . And we do n't  owe anything on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive these cars into the ground . We will see if they make it 19 years . Our initial goal is at least 10 years . <p> Anyone reading this comment and thinking about dropping a huge chunk of dough on a car , think twice . That feeling of joy right after the purchase is very fleeting and fades to regret pretty soon . Especially when you start thinking of what you could had done with the money to move you closer to financial independence . <p> I totally agree I just gave up my 2000 2 door hatch ford focus with 205,000 miles on it . bought a new one did n't  spend as much as your vehicle . To me Ive been all stressed out kicking myself . Should of ran it til the wheels popped off . But it needed a few pricey repairs and was getting rusty underneath and the mechanics were saying it was getting unsafe to fix . I can see there concerns because its hard to see the underneath . I just hate all the technology in vehicles and I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like my radio die if something in whatever runs it the computer dies . Then I will have to listen to the hum of my tires down the road . I miss old vehicles and I plan on keeping my new kia soul at least 10 years hoping to get more . Still trying to get over taking the plunge . I just fear used because everyone I know who buys used get lemons with tons of repairs . I 've had 3 cars all with over 200,000 or more miles on them . I 'm glad I do n't  drive as much . With hopes that this one will last forever . Oh yeah my vehicles were a 3 cylinder chevy sprint great car and my Geo metro not as good as my chevy. both got me through every snow storm never stuck and I drove 45 minutes on dry pavement more in winter . My focus have to laugh I changed jobs drove less then 5 I get stuck in a giant drift down the street . Only because they do n't  do snow fences no more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get my soul so I would have more ground clearance . I know I should of bought a used AWD SUV like I said fear of other peoples experience but after reading this page . i might next time then again I hope not to . Oh yeah all my cars were manual never had no motor or clutch work . I really hate having to pay car payments makes me soo stressed and I keep trying to calulate how long til I am done . <p> I have 3 cars . A 67 Ford Ranchero my dad purchased new . A 53 Studebaker Commander I purchased a year ago , and a 03 Subaru Impreza WRX ( yellow ) . I have no payments for any car , and Ive never had one . I do n't  mind driving an older car and even though I live in a well to do town , most of the people here see older and modified cars regularly so it does n't  seem to matter to them . <p> As much as I 'd like to own , ok wait no , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not own one . I have no desire to have a car payment , nor drop however many thousands on a new car . I 'm approaching 200k mi. , on my car , and a friend of mine with a car one year newer ( STi as well ) has 307k . He tells me that if I maintain mine and keep it stock , itll just about run forever . it kind of deturs me from purchasing a new car , or modifying mine as the dependability will drop . Everything on mine is so far in perfect equilibrium and as long as it keeps running , I 'm happy . <p> I also like that my car is a special edition colour , and it becomes cooler every year because people whom are younger and have the same colour of car seem to find more and more creative ways to destroy theirs . " Oh , I installed X new part in my car to make it faster , then because of a fuel leak caused by the faulty install , my car burnt to the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see my car to failure from old age . <p> My other two cars , well The Ford has sentimental value , and the Studebaker is just rare and cool . I 'm also restoring it . I could go on and on about what I think people think about when i see what they drive and value , or what I think they value , but again I 'm not them so its only speculation . <p> We currently have a 2006 Saturn Ion 2 , I bought it 8 years ago on the 22nd of December . My husband and I met 7 years ago this week and we 've been sharing the car since then . He bought me a van that I had for 2 years but after it was totaled in a head on collision thanks to the poor choice of the other driver who had no license , no insurance and was high we decided not to replace the van and just share the Saturn again . Its been a little over 2 years and its still going well . We bought some Radian carseat so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , that was 2 years ago . We still all fit in the Saturn but recently switched our almost 5 year old son into a booster instead of the Radian so that the adult sized 13 year old ( 57 ? &amp; 135 lbs ) boy could be more comfortable back there with his little brother &amp; sister . <p> Great story and thank you for sharing ! My dad and brother both own Ions about that same year and they have been good cars . I love how you guys do n't  complain about it , you just share it and make it work for the whole family . Well done ! <p> I am a " collision " repair person . I use the term loosely because I really restore old cars but it shares the same knowledge . Some years ago I discovered the salvage auto auctions , bought my wife a loaded kia van . In all we had 2k in a 8-9k van . Sure I had my time but that 's free right ? So with that initial " buy in " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to pay for the next . When we sell the mileage and residual value are such that the " salvage " is no longer a concern to a buyer . Not talking about buying cars cut in half or anything I would n't put my family in anything unsafe . I know I have an advantage in this area because of my " knowledge " but I intend to live out my days never having had a car payment ! . And I 'm 43 <p> Great story , thanks for sharing Vince ! I 've not yet gotten into the salvage game , but I know it can be profitable . Kudos to you for being wise enough to avoid the payments , I 'll be right there with you when i hit 43 ! Thanks for commenting and please stick around ! <p> After a lot of bad luck with cars we bought a 2012 Ford Focus , which was idiotic . We are seriously considering going carless once we flip it right side up ( like I said , idiotic ! ) . Our city is walker/biker/public transportation friendly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I still drive the same car I had in college . It took a dump on me the other day , and I was kind of in a bind , so I had to shell out the $950 to replace the fuel pump . Under normal circumstances , I would have fixed it myself . <p> I still take the bus , ride the train and ride my bike to commute . It keeps me sane . <p> I recommend YouTube for that . Our son bought a car back in January ( his money , he pays insurance , all my kids have to be 18 to get licensed ) . He shopped hard . Found a 1996 Volvo . Seats were worn but otherwise it was solid . <p> He who once could n't work the automatic doors on our van now changes his own oil , his own plugs , various filters and other parts . He took a pt job at an auto parts store near his college , for the discount ! He even goes to u-pull it for small parts . I 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frugal land ! <p> Good for you ! We just bought a brand new ( 2013 ) Toyota Sienna . I wanted a slightly used one , husband insisted on getting brand new . I let him have his way because its cheaper than a divorce . But , oh my lord , it pains me to drive it ! Its a great ride , the kids love it , but I keep looking down at the fuel gauge . I keep thinking , what ? ? ? I used up a quarter tank already ? ? ? I just went grocery shopping ! So , me and the kids go for lots of walks now . If I really have to drive somewhere , I wait til the husband gets home and I drive his fully paid 2005 Prius . We hardly drive the van anymore and if this keeps up , my husband is gon na end up driving this van when he retires . Hahaha ! <p> Awesome ! Reminds me of a Honda Civic I had in high school I would probably still own it today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car is a lot nicer than what I need ( first real dumb purchase after college ) , but I imagine I 'll drive that thing until it gives out . <p> Props to you for being able to resist all the temptation ( new cars ) out there ! <p> We played the new car revolving door game for years and now realize how stupid it was . I have an 08 Altima with 110,000 miles and plan to keep it for at least another 5-7 years . I used to commute over 300 miles per week , but have cut way back over the last couple of years . <p> I drive a 2003 Pontiac Vibe . I bought it used this year with less than 70,000 miles and I love it ! It does n't  have power locks or power windows but it drives well , is great for hauling things around , and gets decent gas mileage . I plan to drive it another couple of years and then sell it to buy a newer ( 2008-2009 ) Vibe . The Vibe is actually the same car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Being that they are all Toyota parts I never have to worry about not being able to get parts if I need them . Thankfully I have not needed any work on my Vibe so far ! <p> I really want my 02 Corolla to last forever but with a check engine light on from since before I bought it , I do n't  know how things are now ( I still get great gas mileage so part of me thinks the engine light is actually a malfunction , not an O2 sensor or catalytic converter issue ) . My 02 Corolla really makes me miss my 2000 Ford Focus wagon which I 'd still be driving if it werent totaled as that car was pretty loaded . <p> I will say I do like the luxuries in a vehicle ( power doors and clicker for safety reason , power windows , adequate A/C and heater , functional radio ) but more so because while were not frequent drivers ( we both take public transit to work ) , when we do drive , its often for a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my father about 3 hours away . I do pay cheap insurance on my <p> My husbands 16 years old car is no longer running , but I have mine which does and is in great condition . I got it new in 2008 and it has a great mileage , it was n't driven too often ( around 25k miles on it ) and will surely serve us for at least 5-10 years . Insurance is VERY cheap , we do n't  need too much gas , really a good deal . <p> My car is a 2002 Chevy Cavalier . Its a grandads car , literally . My dad bought my grandfather this car a year before my grandfather could no longer drive . When he stopped driving it , the car sat in a carport for 3-4 years , then my dad started driving it . By the time I graduated from college and the car was passed on to me , it was 10 years old , but only had about 66,000 miles on it ! Its worth about $2,000 according to property tax assessment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my next purchase will be a nice , used Camry = <p> I have a 2006 Saturn Ion and I still drive it , sinse the Saturn had the recalls about people wrecking and dieing , that is GMs Fault , they knew what was wrong with it , but look what they did Oh go ahead and drive it it will be fine , i 'm so pissed at them , its not even funny that 's peoples lives , they did n't  even care , when my Saturn dies , I 'm never buying a GM car ever again <p> I love my old clunker ( a 2001 Ford Focus with 140,000 miles ) . Its cheap , and if something happens to it I wont feel like my life is over . I can replace it for around $4,000 if needed , and to get it fixed all the parts are fairly cheap . It has been pretty reliable as well . <p> I agree ! My first car was a 1997 VW Jetta . I put many miles on it and was sad to see it go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put over 200,000 miles on it . Funny how an old car can become a dear friend my earned the nickname " Rock it ! " <p> We have a 1998 Honda Civic DX that 's been in our family since for , yes , 19 years now . She now has 227,000+ miles and needs a new engine . Still driving it now with a broken water pump and bad head gasket ( Blue Devil sealed up the leaks for awhile but does n't  last forever , apparently ) but it seems silly to sink $2k into the car , lest the transmission goes next ( its an automatic ) which is the next thing to go . So sadly , I may need to put our beloved Civic out to pasture . If I were a mechanic , I might keep her running , but it just does n't  seem worth the risk . Thoughts , anyone ? <p> Keeping an old car might work in certain places , but here in the UK we have to have our vehicles tested each year for road safety , road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustard and you will barely see a 96 anything over here anymore . The government have massively increased road tax on these gas guzzlers and its already shocking over here , so there is no incentive to keep one ! <p> I got rid of my 96 Rover 4 years ago mostly because the Government introduced a scrappage scheme and I got -2,000 off the price of a new car . Combined with some serious haggling , I got an awesome deal and my car could have been sold 1 year on for more than I paid for it . When I bought my husbands brand new car for him , I also got an awesome deal- so again , 2 years down the line we could have sold it for more than we paid for it . Tip- buy the model that is going out , that the dealer have some stock of . You cant choose everything , but they just want shot of the old shape model . <p> Old cars might seem economical , but they are often not and you do n't  realise until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel in my new car , than I ever did in my old one because new technology has moved efficiency on and this ones engine is twice the size ! I no longer have to waste 10-15 minutes of fuel trying to defrost or keep it warm in winter . I no longer get locked out because the locks have frozen . I can not believe the improved quality of ride in my new car either . I am happy to take it on long journeys because of its comfort and reliability . <p> If you are savvy when buying an old car , you may get a few years out of it , but when you 've got to shell out more on fuel , more on tax , more on breakdown and repairs and you have to keep replacing it every few years , well its not looking so savvy to me . <p> Even on a 96 you will still find they have an onboard computer and its not like you can do all the repairs yourself . Do n't  get me wrong , I fully intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the ground . But as a single female , I could not take the risk and expense of keeping on breaking down . Breakdown companies have limits over here to how many times you can call them out . <p> Out of interest , where do you all keep your car ? Its money saving to keep a car in a garage where its not exposed to the elements and where you do n't  have to waste fuel and deicer defrosting it . <p> Contrary to the popular opinion on this thread that having an old car keeps you humble , there seems to be a good deal of pride around having an old car ! Just because I have a newer car does n't  mean I see it as a status symbol , does n't  mean I 'm not money saving or not humble . After all , if you work so hard to save all this cash and you own your own home outright and do n't  have any debts etc , you do n't  have to sit on all your cash like an old miser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reliable car is a very sensible purchase . <p> Hi Lizz , thanks for sharing your opinion but I 'll have to correct a few points that simply are n't  true for the majority of readers . 1 ) New cars are almost never a good deal . They depreciate quicker than used models . 2 ) Cars in the U.S must also past inspections for all those reasons . That has nothing to do with age , if it runs properly . 3 ) You must not have read the article . Our car is more fuel efficient than brand new compacts being released today . We average 41MPG on the highway . Again , you 've set up a straw man about a gas guzzling tax , which is n't applicable . 4 ) I drive my 1996 Saturn on a 22 hour " journey " at least 3 times per year . I 've never had a single issue . 5 ) I do n't  spend any fuel when defrosting a car , and neither should you . Try elbow grease . In addition , I 've never had my locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older used car . You are taxed on purchase price . 7 ) We do n't  own a garage and renting one might be more ignorant than buying a new car . 8 ) If you choose to buy a car new , so be it . But please refrain from setting up arguments that are n't  true in an attempt to sway others . The fact remains that a new car purchase is often a poor financial decision . It will depreciate . And you will always be better off looking for a 2-3 year old car if you insist on having something newer . <p> Hey , I think that 's a bit harsh . I 'm not one for buying brand new cars either but here in the UK the maths of it are a bit different with the government trying very hard to make it too expensive to run older more polluting cars in order to get them all off the roads . So road tax in the UK is a *lot* more if your co2 emissions are too high for example and theyll load your insurance premiums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety features . If I drive very carefully I get over 62mpg from my car , I could n't afford to run a car that got around 30mpg with current petrol prices here . And I wont get started on the astronomical repair costs but will point out the last two repair bills on my old car came to more than the purchase cost of my current fairly new one . On the bright side you can buy small cheap city cars here I 'm talking something like a 1 litre or smaller engine new enough to still be under manufacturers warranty for around $5000 maybe less . The moral of the story is you need to do the maths rather than just deciding older is cheaper . And that learning to do your own car repairs is probably one of the best financial investments you 'll ever make ( at least the way they are charged over here ) . <p> I drive an 07 Mustang that I bought brand new once I got my first " real " job out of college . It was n't the smartest financial move at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to drive it at least at least another year or two . I have a weakness for cars &amp; have a constant internal struggle with myself when I see all the new models come out each year = <p> I have a 2002 Saturn SC1 ( Sport Coupe , which makes it cool ) with 120,000 miles on it . I got it back in college in 2005 for about $10k and have driven it ever since . I think its been paid off since about 08 and the payments were only $152/month anyway . I get a lot of crap from co-workers about the car , but it runs fine for the most part ( does suffer from all of the same issues as noted above , must be a saturn thing ) . I will never understand why people care so much what I drive . I do n't  care what they drive so why is this such a big deal to them ? Usually when someone gives me crap I just point out that its paid for and I have enough cash set aside to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up pretty quick . <p> Bill , cool indeed . Really funny that you have the same issues . My father owned an early 90s SC and it was an excellent car , but also suffered the issues . As you said , must run in the family ! It really is amazing that other people feel the need to judge your wise financial decision to drive an economical car . Happens all the time . I think its because they are insecure about their terrible purchases , which leads them to attack your wisdom . Well done , good sir . <p> We moved from a 1996 Jeep Cherokee to a 2006 Toyota Matrix , mainly because the costs of consistently the Jeep seemed to make switching a positive ROI . At least that 's what the CBA saidalways hard to predict future repair costs of a vehicleI suppose past costs provide the best forecasts . <p> Still , we hope to have our car until its at least 17 years old . Maybe until our future kid is 17 years old . = <p> Cool post , friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than what 's cool , with your vehicle choice . <p> Thanks 40 ! I bet the gas savings would justify that switch , but as you say , repairs can be tricky . I have a huge problem with people forecasting big repair costs based on age alone . Its not accurate and my parents have owned newer cars that were far more trouble than ours <p> Like the point that it keeps you humble its true ! Cars are only a means of reliable ( usually ! ) transport . Good for you guys for only having 1 car , and for keeping this one for so long . I 'm sure it makes your budget REALLY happy . <p> That 's impressive . I bought a used Pontiac Sunfire in 2003 and drove it for nearly 10 years . Many of the benefits you listed above applied to my " baby " as well . Folks would always give me a hard time , but I did n't  care . It was paid off and inexpensive to operate . I finally had to retire it when the a/c went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it than the car was actually worth . Plus , we had a real baby joining the family , so it was time for an upgrade . I 've never understood the fascination with fancy , expensive cars . They get you from point A to B just like the beaters do . Anyway , be proud of your Saturn and keep on driving it ! <p> 99 Accord with 263k . I agree with your list , except my car runs very well and is still fun to drive . I will upgrade when my wife can no longer stand her car ( an 06 ) and hands it down to me . I spend $1/k per year on repairs/regular maintenance , but I drive 15-20k/yr , so this is still much cheaper than a car payment . My last Accord was sold at 287k , so hopefully I will hit the 300k mark this time . <p> No car payments ? I approve . However , is there any way you could downsize to two vehicles ? Cost of any vehicle is quite high ! My brother owned a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we sold it to a family friend who drove it close to 300k ! <p> Great stuff Jacob ! No need to purchase a new car when yours works just fine . I drove my 97 Altima which was bought used for 10 years . It did n't  even have a CD playerit was a tape deck , but I had a converter thing which could play CDs from the tape deck if I really wanted . There were some mechanical issues but I think I could have kept it a little bit longer . ( It did break down on my a week before my wedding ) . And since we were planning on starting a familyI wanted a car with the newer safety features : ESC , anti-lock brakes , etc . Pretty crazy that you can sell it for more than you bought it for . <p> Thanks Andrew ! You know what , I really wish ours had the tape deck instead of CD ! Those tape decks allow such easy ipod hookups through the speakers and they work far better than those stupid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car ( no need in NYC ) but I would have probably gotten rid of that bad boy awhile ago depending based on my geographic location . It does n't  look like it would handle well in bad weather ( especially snow ) and I like the creature comforts of being able to play my music and control temperatures . They may cost me extra , but if I have to spend quality time in my car I find them worth the money . Good to point out that you should never view a car as an investment , unless you 're Jay Leno . <p> Of course we could argue the point , as I 'm certain " many " older/high end cars do NOT appreciate after taking into account inflation and the foregone cost of actually investing in other assets . But we wont argue because its not applicable to 99.9% of people or vehicles . = <p> My friend had that exact car ( in that exact colour ) back when we were in high school ten years ago . I have some fond memories of that Saturn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am planning on getting at least another three years , possibly more ( just depends how expensive it starts getting to fix ) . I love looking at new ( to me ) cars and dreaming , but then I realize my car is still pretty darn new It does n't  look that old . Its a hatchback that we share as well works fine for us . <p> We have three ( 3 ! ! ! ) cars right now . A very old Toyota Corolla that my wife uses for commuting . A six year old Rav 4 that will serve as a car and as a truck once the third vehicle moves on . And a 22-year-old Toyota pickup . The pickup was purchased long ago to help me with my rentals and I 've kept it because I had so many other remodeling projects going on . But once my current basement project is done , the truck can finally go away . I guess I 'm going to have to go ahead and write the mandatory car post one of these days to explain myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sames reasons why I still drive a car over 12 yrs old with close to 200k in mileage . I wasted a lot of money in my twenties buying car with payments . Its always good to see a young couple like you and your wife who are wise and diligent with their finances . <p> I have had the same car for 11 years . It was the same one that I got at age 16 . I used to be one of those people who wanted a new car desperately . I then realized how ridiculous it was . My car may not be shiny and new and has no features whatsoever , but it runs . It has been way more reliable than my friends new cars . People may have made fun of it , but mine is paid off . I 'm not the one with $600 month car payments . I would die if I had a car payment , because Im more frugal than I used to be . I see brand new 22 year old graduated college students purchase brand new 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldnt throw money like that away . Over the years , I 've realized having a new car is n't that important ( at least to me anyway ) . I 'm hardly ever in my car . <p> Great and entertaining post !

Its got 94,000 miles on it right now and I absolutely love the little thing . Its no frills , too base model and manual to boot . I know its newer , but it was still a frugal purchase . Brand-spanking new , fresh of the dealership lot , it cost $14,000 . <p> Haha , I love it . I think you missed one Jacob . Some cars were just built better back in the 80s and 90s .

@@44824182 @4824182/ <h> Debitize Review 2017 <p> Credit cards are a fantastic financial tool if used responsibly . They offer a multitude of perks , benefits , and rewards . <p> But all of the potential benefits pale in comparison to the double-digit interest rates charged by the issuing bank . Credit cards simply do not make sense if you carry a monthly balance and are forced to pay interest on the debt . <p> This dilemma has led many individuals to champion debit instead of credit .

" This is how stocks and mutual funds are traded and tracked on the open market . Google these tickers to get more information . <p> Ill list the portfolios in order of ease . Well start with the most simple on top . <h> Target Date Retirement Fund <p> The easiest possible investment option for the DIY investor is a standard target date fund offered by a reputable company like Vanguard . Not surprisingly , these funds have a target date that is meant to represent your estimated retirement age . The holding are reflective of the investors age and are automatically shifted properly over time from stocks to fixed income . And they do n't  even charge you for doing the work ! The expense ratio is a measly 0.18% . <p> Lets- look at the one recommended for me . The 2055 fund gives me a 42 year investment horizon- which puts me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except I 'll be financially free at a must younger age ! Anyhow , the ticker is- ( VFFVX ) and here are the current holdings . Its actually a great set up , with solid holdings and an ideal allocation of stocks and bonds . If you want to set it and forget it , think about investing in one of these . <h> 2-Fund Portfolio <p> Literally so easy a caveman could do it . And hed be a rich caveman in 40 years time . - Its very possible to get complete portfolio diversification , and excellent returns , in just 2 Vanguard funds . I 'd hold less bonds , and probably just consider the target date fund listed above because the expense ratios are very similar , but this one potentially requires rebalancing and checkups. <h> 3-Fund Portfolio <p> Three fund portfolios are commonly quoted by financial professionals and authors as a great starter portfolio . They are almost always three equal parts made up of U.S stocks , international stocks , and bonds . This is a decent option for the investor who is actively learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion , there are far better options for people who are n't  really interested in investing and those who understand and enjoy investing . The former should just stick their money in a retirement date fund . The latter should throw a few more ETFs in the mix . <h> 4-Fund Portfolio <p> Rick Ferri , CFA , is credited with authoring this porfolio as the cornerstone investment portfolio . It adds real estate in the form of REITs to the mix and no longer slices the pie in equal pieces . It is the launch point for most other complex portfolios and is easily modified . <p> Rick- proposes that investors first determine their bond allocation . You might be wondering how to do that . The easiest way is to hold the equivalent of your age in bonds . So at 23 , I 'd hold 23% of my money in a bond fund . I actually think its a little high , but I 'm rather risk averse and prefer the growth possibilities of stocks and real estate while I 'm young . <p> With the remaining funds , allocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to- REIT . For example , for 60/40 and 80/20 portfolios , you would end up with the following : <h> More Advanced Asset Allocation Models <p> There are an infinite number of options past the four fund portfolio . Its all up to you on what you feel comfortable doing . Many long term investors like to either hold more value stocks or more small cap stocks . They have historically provided higher returns than their counterparts . Or you could combine the two and just own 10% of Vanguards small cap value ETF ( VBR ) . - Other options include more real estate exposure , emerging markets , commodities , or other more specific investments . <p> Here are some more examples : <h> Bill Schultheiss " Coffeehouse " portfolio <p> This simple 7-fund portfolio was made popular by Bill Shultheis book The Coffeehouse Investor . He advocates 40% in an intermediate term bond fund and 10% each in various stock funds . This portfolio contains only 10% international stocks , which is much lower than many of the others you 've seen . Not necessarily right or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Closing Thoughts <p> You may be wondering what I 'm currently holding or what I recommend . Well , I 'll show you . My portfolio looks a lot like the one below , except I 've lowered my emerging market and mid cap stock holdings by about 5% each . In place , I 've added 10% REIT exposure . I 'm also holding no bonds , although I 'm think of adding 5% short term corporate to the mix . <p> *Much of this info and more can be found on the- Boglehead forums .

I set up the allocations in our 401k accounts to match VTSAX as closely as possible , with the exception of 5% of our total investments in short and mid term bonds . I cant really say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though they closely match VTSAX , are made up of lots of funds . I guess it behaves like a two-fund portfolio , more or less . Anyway , great article , dude ! <p> Are target date funds good for a 65 yr old , in low tax bracket with mostly taxable money savings ? i have 65k in IRA at Vanguard , but the rest , taxable , is sitting in an old ING account . I 'd like to set and forget it by putting it all in Vanguard Target Income , since I 'm retiredWhat are your thoughts Jacob ? I was considering Vanguards PAServices , but do I really need to pay them too or can I just set and forget in the Income fund ? ? Also , would it be better for me to buy the funds individually in the Income Ret fund and replace TBI with a muni bond fund ? ? Thanks so much ! <p> Do you think we need to also consider the bid/ask prices when factoring in the " expenses of ETFs " ? It could add . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's the commission fee for buy and sellwhich is $10-$20 depending on your online brokerage firm , and also the bid/ask spread or premium , which could also vary depending on the market your orders are sent . <p> For the sake of simplicity for any other readers , I 'm going to say not to worry about the spread . Of course it is a consideration , but I do n't  think its worth worrying about . YMMV . There are no commissions to buy/sell through Vanguard or other similar firms . And for the individual investor , I see no reason to do much trading outside of Vanguard . <p> This may be a silly question but do n't  the funds held in a target retirement fund like VFFVX also charge management fees ? Does n't  the investor pay those AND the TRF expense ratio ( 0.18% for VFFVX in above example ) ? In short , do n't  TRFs have double costs ? Or is everything truly encapsulated in that single ( low ! ) expense ratio ? <p> I currently have all my 401k contributions and matches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fees on most of my options are over 0.35% which I find is wasteful . We are with Charles Schwab so there are no Vanguard/Fidelity options but at least their target date funds only have an expense ratio of 0.18% . <p> For my Roth IRA I am doing the exact same thing with Vanguard , but I only have $5,500 in there ( this years maximum contribution ) so for now I will stick with the Target Date fund . I 'd like to eventually do 3-fund portfolio to get my expense ratios even further down ! <p> Its odd that the target date funds are much cheaper than the other options . Are the index funds over 0.35% or are actively managed funds all that you can choose ? Target date funds are excellent and hassle free . You wo n't lower the ER much , but you can get it down a little with a customized portfolio . <p> I 'm like Done by Forty , I need fight the urge to tinker . The majority of my IRA is in the Target retirement fund you have up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years back and added emerging markets . Now Ive been wanting to add Reits ! My 401K did n't  have the Vanguard Target retirement fund so I have something similar to the coffeehouse portfolio . <p> Hi Jacob , Thanks again for another article on asset allocation . I am always interested in seeing the mixes that others try , and I do get a bit of the " grass is always greener " feeling when I see other allocations . I suppose that 's naturalI simultaneously feel the draw for more simplicity ( Imagine just having two funds ! ) and the complexity ( A little REIT , a little Pacific Rim , maybe Emerging Markets ) . <p> Mostly I am now fighting the urge to tinker . I am determined to stay with our asset allocation for at least a few years , and to ignore the urge to change things each time I learn of a new strategy .

You can then use these rewards to directly- book flights or hotel rooms for travel . <p> This Barclaycard Arrival Plus is one such example . After spending $3000 on the Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard- within the- first 90 days- of receiving it , you would get back 56,000 miles , or over $560 in free travel . <p> And you get to choose how you redeem the miles ! You can spend it on airfare , rental cars , and anything else that is coded as a travel related expense . This is n't the case with most travel credit cards . <p> Another note worth mentioning is that both you and a spouse can apply separately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each within the first 90 days , you can secure more than $1000 in free travel . <h> About Barclays <p> Barclays is a British- multinational- banking and- financial services- company- headquartered in London , United Kingdom .

It has operations in over 50 countries and territories and has around 48- million customers. - As of 31 December 2011 Barclays had total assets of US$2.42- trillion , the seventh-largest of any bank worldwide . <p> This is a large and well established company who will- continue to operate and issue credit cards. - <p> Barclays issues several other credit cards as well , but I 'd say the- Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard currently offers the most bang for the buck. - I should also mention that this card currently comes in 2 varieties . <h> Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard ( Without Annual Fee ) : <p> No annual fee <p> Double miles on travel and dining , plus 1 mile per cent spent on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The no-fee version of the Arrival is a good basic credit card , but we opt for the version below . <p> This is the card we use .

Barclays does a pretty good job in allowing you to book a variety of travel related services with the points . You can use the points for more than just a plane ticket or hotel . You can use Barclay Arrival points on any purchase coded as travel . <p> Here is a short list of approved travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Car Rentals <p> Trains <p> You can book through discount agencies or whoever you want , so long as it shows up on your credit card statement coded as a travel expense . <h> Barclaycard Arrival World MasterCard Review Summary <p> All in all , this is one of the best travel credit cards on the market. - If you have good credit and are looking for a great travel rewards card , we highly recommend this one . <p> I hope you enjoyed the Barclay Arrival World MasterCard- review . If you want to apply you can- compare the cards on the personal comparison page . <p> I have a Capital One Venture and already redeemed 140000 points on a trip to my home country with no hassle at all . Now , I want to try the BarclayCard Arrival and take advantage of the 40000 miles bonus . But I read in someplace that you cant use the card for wholesale or business purposes . I ve been used the Venture for my business with no problem . The companies I buy from , report as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furnishing " when I see my statement . Do you think itll be considering Business or Wholesale and then wont qualify for double miles ? Thanks ! ! <p> This is by far my favorite credit card at the moment . $3,000 is required to actually get the bonus , but I personally think its one of the best bonus offers . The only other one that really tops this is the Chase Sapphire Preferred card . Youll have to check that one out . <p> This is a great card ! My wife and I both got it and both got the 40,000 point bonus . We have truly enjoyed the travels that we 've paid for with this card . I love that it gives you 2x points on every purchase ! A minor drawback worth noting is that if you redeem your points for anything other than travel reimbursement , the points lose half their value , effectively making it a 1x points card . Granted , this is inherently a travel card and using it for travel gets the full value from your points , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash back card that you can use to get cash back statement credits at the full point value . <p> I got this card before attending FinCon13 , so it paid for my entire hotel bill ! Plus , when I redeemed the points , they gave me some of my points back . Cool ! That said , I 'll cancel it after my next trip , so I do n't  have to pay the annual fee . But I still have point left to redeem so I cant cancel yet ! <p> Have you considered asking them to waive the fee again or downgrade you to the no fee card ? This can be helpful since average age of credit ( and credit usage ) is considered in your FICO score . I have done this with several cards with different degress of success . I mean , it never hurts to ask just a thought <p> I was thinking the same thingI wish my wife and I had gotten into the travel rewards game sooner . You guys are younger so have more time to enjoy it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking on a mortgage so probably no credit cards in the near future . Hopefully , these travel reward bonuses will still be around when we have the chance to do some more traveling . <p> I just signed up for this and will be putting that $400 statement credit toward our flight to Ireland next spring . I 'm new to travel hacking too Brad at Richmond Savers helped me get started and I am so glad I entered the world of travel rewards ! It will really help our budget when it comes to traveling . <p> Up until this point I 've stuck with my chase freedoms 1% cash back on everything card . But obviously if you use a rewards card , they will give you more for your money . This is an intriguing option . I guess I need to figure out where I want to travel next year .

We wont spend $5,000 on clothing in ten years time . <p> While I 'm being honest , this whole clothing situation is somewhat embarrassing for me . I cant believe how many pieces of clothing that I have . Each morning , I struggle through a mind blowing selection process ( please note , I 'm trying to be funny , although I do own quite a few outfits ) . <p> I have to start off slow . First , what sort of pants will it be ? Full length or shorts ? Khaki , dress , or casual ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had those shorts in- 3- different- colors <p> And that 's just the pants !

You wo n't really need any new clothes for several years . <h> Make Your Clothes Last <p> First of all , you do n't  need to wash a piece of clothing after every use . Thats nonsense . Wear something until it is dirty or stinky . Literally , wear it , then hang it up . Repeat until the item actually needs washed . Sometimes I 'll wear pants 8-10 times before they need washed . <p> I cant believe how many people wear something once then throw it into the dirty clothes pile to be washed . Why ? You 're wasting electricity , water , detergent , and reducing the life span of the clothing . Washing/drying is hard on clothes and is what causes them to wear out . <p> And on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to use hot water all the time .

Some wont last that long but I never throw something away unless it looks absolutely terrible or can no longer be fixed . <p> Fixed ? Yes , how about patching a hole ? Or sewing up a rip ? I cant do it , but my family can . I continue wearing items until they can not be salvaged . There is no reason to toss something out because it has a little blemish . <p> Now for a little math .

And if they do n't  get too dirty , save them and use them again for the next dirty activity . <p> Sometime I like to remind myself , " A little dirt wont hurt .

Instead , you 'll look for chances to take advantage of the consumers who foolishly paid full price , wore the items 5 times , then decided they wanted something else . <p> For purchases , the cheapest option is definitely garage sales . A close second is thrift stores . The third option is huge sales on new clothing. - I would shoot for 75% off or more . That 's typically the only time well buy brand new . <p> I 'm impartial to store or seller , all that matters is the product . Look for massively discounted clothes that fit well .

" A tiangge sells new but unbranded clothes , usually from Bangkok , Hong Kong , or other big shopping hubs.The new dress earlier mentioned was bought from a tiangge owned by a friend , hitting two birds with one stone : showing support to that friends business venture , and replacing a damaged dress . <p> I also wear a lot of hand-me-downs .

Many of our friends have the same employer , so we have an idea of how much they make . It still floors us . <p> I used to shop at thrift stores in high school . For some reason , I got away from it . I think it is because I have to wear business casual to work and I always bought the weirdest clothing I cold find at the thrift store .

That said , I do n't  buy clothes a lot and totally agree that paying retail prices on high end brands is insane . <p> I think this really depends on what thrift stores you 're shopping at , too . In poor rural areas , I 've found that a lot of the business attire tends to be very well-worn and often lacks timeless style , primarily because most of the people who live in that area do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Sunday church or for special events like funerals and weddings . <p> On the other hand , a thrift store in an urban center with a thriving corporate district might carry a lot of great business attire that 's still in great condition and in modern clothing styles . <p> Great point ! I have noticed that wealthier areas tend to have a far larger selection of name brand clothes in almost new condition . I think it is worth the extra gas to drive to the thrift stores closest to the best neighborhoods . Find out if they have sales . My local Goodwill does a half price day twice a month . I have found $200 Oilily skirts for $2 . Looks the exact same as the one my sister paid $200 for . <p> This would embarrass bf if he knew I was saying it , but I literally have to throw away his undershirts and underpants with holes in them . He will wear them until the " die " literally and figuratively . I of course appreciate this frugal-ize , but at some point you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear , I wear my pants several times before washing . If they are n't  stained or dirty , why not . Saves water , detergent and energy ( mine walking up and down the stairs and literal electricity ) . <p> I 'm with you on not drying clothing and trying to not wash as frequently if possible . I have a habit of staining my shirts so I know the importance of NOT drying clothes so stains do n't  get set-in . <p> I do perspire in the heat however , so if I can smell the perspiration on a shirt , I will wash it . I 'm living in the midst of a 7 day heat wave here in NY and it is tortuous as where I work we only have a window unit in my direct office so I can perspire just walking around our building as there 's no central air ( and an interior hallway in a building can actually be hotter than the outside due to heat being expelled from window air conditioner use ) . I also perspire walking to/from my subway commute ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash my shirts more frequently . <p> But things like pants/shorts/skirts I generally wash only if they smell or appear stained and the same thing goes for my cardigan sweaters I wear in the winter . Obviously , things like underwear are worn only once in the household before washing but by cutting down on the frequent washing of a majority of our clothing , we save time and money which is a win-win . <p> Also , thift store shopping is higher on my list . I can get great office wear for cheap at thrift stores . There 's a great small chain of thrift stores in my area that actually organizes the clothing by size and type ( what a concept ! ) so I can easily find pants and tops in my size and even have fitting rooms . They are a bit pricier but have major 50% off sales around major Federal holidays . I got two cocktail dresses there for a more formal wedding and a work fundraiser for $10 each that fit me perfectly there . I generally go there for a big trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staples are too beat up to justify wearing to office ( my washer sometimes puts holes in favorite shirts boo ) . <p> Hey Tara , thanks again for commenting . We love your input ! I totally understand the heat thing . Sometimes I only get 1 days use out of a shirt because its so hot in Texas . But I try to keep them clean as long as possible ! Sounds like you do an outstanding job with increasing the life of your clothes and also utilizing thrift stores . You actually sound a lot like us ! You know your stuff when you find the half off thrift store deals ! Keep up the amazing work ! And find a cheap Craigslist washer ? = <p> I 'm kinda with EmilyI ca n't get myself to buy clothes from a thrift shop that has been worn . But I rarely buy clothes anyway . When I do get new clothes , my wife shops off-season and the clearance racks and gets great deals . I never pay full retail price . My wife does n't  even allow me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be cheaper and tells me to wait until then ! <p> I cant recall the last article of clothing I bought . Were on a really tight budget and clothing was a sacrifice I made so we could put that money towards other better things we wanted ( like vacation ) . Its been tough , I wo n't lie , and sometimes I try to convince myself that it would serve a meaningful purpose ( for example : ( last thursday ) like that dress over there that would be perfect wear to the Rennaissance Faire ! Its only 20 bucks ! ) , but then I walk on , painful step by step , and eventually forget about it . And a week later ( today ) I remember , and I tell myself that Ive been strong and to keep it up . So , were halfway through July and my clothing budget is below the $20 mark for the whole year . Hooray ! <p> Hmm agree to disagree here , with not purchasing clothes for 20 years . But then I do n't  struggle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours of shorts , surely you jest : p I will buy and wear second hand ( unlike Emily ) but the time and energy searching for it , well I 'd rather cook food , or read a book , than dive through piles of things for something that is my size , and is in good condition , that I 'd wear . I do n't  wear certain things for any number of reasons modesty , lifestyle fit , just general style ! ? Crazy I know . But , with most posts , where you mention alternatives to spend on ( retirement , kids college fund ) , I reassure myself that those are also tracking ahead of schedule . Uber frugal , I am not ! That being said , I 'm 100% behind the washing advice I do n't  OWN a dryer ! And I only ever wash when stinky or visibly soiled . <p> Of course , part of what I wrote is sarcastic , but it paints an accurate picture of the typical American situation on the whole . Tons of stuff and most of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping . We rarely shop . Its about being wise with the purchases and realizing that a little self control can go a long way . <p> Actually , you mention my other posts and continual advice on prioritizing spending . I guess that means I 'm doing my job . You are very blessed in your financial situation and are in a place most folks are not . I 'm targeting the people who have to decide between frugality or a lifetime of just getting by . P.S. that 's the majority of America . <p> When t-shirts get too holey/thin/worn out to even be worn to do yard work . I often cut them up to use as cleaning rags . If you 're crafty , you can also make rag rugs or quilts out of them , although I cant sew worth a lick except to repair buttonholes ! = <p> I work as a coupon blogger , so I 'm able to outfit my familys ( husband , 20-month old daughter , and myself ) wardrobes for cheap since I get advance notice of sales and coupons for stores like Gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store " clearance clothes in virtual shopping carts , then wait until I can use a coupon that provides both free shipping AND an extra discount on the clothes . If they sold out before I got a good enough coupon for them , well , then we did n't  really need them . I only do this at places that have decent quality clothes that will last us awhile though , as I do n't  see the point in paying for something that wont hold up through even two or three washes . That 's been my experience with clothes from places like Walmart or Forever21 . <p> Since we have a growing kid , I stock up at the end of season clearances for the size shell be in the next year at this time as well . I know shell use them , so its worth it to stick them in a box under the bed until then . <p> Janet , your comment reminded me of my mother . She is a huge fan of the conversion to rags ! You are a wise woman and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of similar things when we shop . Only buy on huge sales or end of season , use coupons , etc . The one thing I would disagree about is my experience with Walmart . I 've bought a number of clothing items and shoes there while on discount and I 've been impressed thus far . Time will tell Thank you for commenting ! <p> Very nice . We sometimes do this with Christmas/birthday gifts . I cant believe the prices when the items ring up ! If we take it back , sometimes well just exchange for the heavily discounted stuff and wind up getting 5 items for the price of one ! ( Yes , I try to tell the gift giver that we might take back/exchange ) <p> I 'm assuming you buy new underwear . Personally I do n't  care how much bleach someone uses I will NOT buy used underwear . Call me crazy but that is where I draw my line . <p> I will usually buy a suit brand new , but go to a local tailor to get it done . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store and looks much better . Of course I have only had to do this twice in my life so at my current rate I will probably buy maybe 6 suits my entire life , unless of course I end up being an executive , in which case I might take a trip to Vietnam and stock up on tailored suits . <p> This is good advice , Jacob . My wife and I barely ever buy clothes . We probably spend $500 total each year and I think were pretty well dressed . Where I run into trouble is work clothing . I try to buy as minimal as possible for as cheap as possible , but I need to look professional , so its important I find a happy medium . <p> That 's a pretty low budget , nice work Jake ! Yeah , I 've found some good used dress clothes , but they are more difficult to find . Sometimes new items can be found at a huge discount , but you 've got to really search . <p> I agree for the most part , but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will get re-soled but they are expensive at the time of purchase . I will not buy shoes from the thrift store . <p> My favorite thing to find at the thrift store are work pants . <p> I just transferred to our HQ office and now I have to dress in business clothes , all the time . No , not business casual or semi-casual . No open toed shoes . No khaki pants . Think suits and jackets . Also , I 'm drenched by the time I arrive at the office . I 'm trying to stretch the dry cleaning . I 'm actually tempted to wear a t-shirt and shorts to and from work , and change in to my suit attire once I get here . I just have to worry about who I might run in to in the elevator and start paying for a gym membership ( to access the showers ) . See , its complicated . And no , I am not being scrubby or I will never get promoted around this place . <p> Shoes can be tough , and truth be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just buy when they are massively discounted ( which seems to happen a lot ) . Also , check Walmart . I own 4-5 pairs of dress shoes that are NICE and they were about $15/pair . <p> The work situation sounds tough . Maybe the gym/changing would save money verse dry cleaning ? I do n't  know , I do n't  pay for either <p> I think clothing might be one of those too-close-to-the-heart areas to argue anyone into changing , like food choices ! I can tell you I will not wear thrift store clothes or anything that has been worn by anyone else . I do n't  borrow clothes and I never have . I just hate the idea of wearing something that 's been worn by someone else because clothes are so intimate and personal . <p> Even though we do n't  buy used clothes , we also do n't  spend much on clothes . We have a $60/month " Appearance " budget ( for two people ) , which includes clothes , shoes , haircuts , dry cleaning , etc . We probably shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ items that are rather inexpensive ( though not falling-apart cheap ) . So I 'm OK with our spending , even though it is on new clothes ! <p> I 'm not really familiar with the whole sentimental , intimate clothing idea . For me , clothes are just a tool . They serve a purpose , but I certainly do n't  get attached to my wardrobe . After all , they are easily washed and cleaned . To each his own , I suppose . <p> At least you are being thrifty and wise about purchasing new . Nice work ! <p> Oh , I 'm not sentimental at all about clothing . I just think that clothes are in such close contact with my body that I 'd rather they had not been in close contact with any other body previously . Does n't  matter how many washings in between ! <p> Oh Jacob ! ! ! This is so close to my Hoombah Heart ! T-shirts $10 or less , last from 3-5 years . Shorts $19 last from 5-10 years ( they are Magellans , man ) . And much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stains . Not a smidgen . <p> This makes up the bulk of my uniform that I use for play and work alike . What a terrible waste to spend on wardrobe . If one wants to look good , they ought to watch what they eat and exercise for at least 60 min a day . Its that simple . No article of clothing can beat a slim , fit bod . <p> Jacob , i 'm totally with you on this one . Though some friends judge me , ill wear my jeans until they 're dirty , you summed up the most important parts . <p> The issue I have is with work clothes . When I talk with customers I need to look nice , and I 've been unable to do that with thrift store clothes , so I do buy work clothes new . Though my annual clothing budget is certainly under $700 <p> I 've found some really nice used clothing that I wear frequently , although my suits were new ( and way discounted ) . There are deals to be had buying new , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Good advice Jacob . I do n't  know why but I just suck at thrift store shopping . I can never find good clothes ( maybe its just bad selection in my area ? ) . My focus is buying on sale . If I need something I usually make a mental note and wait 1-2 months for the sale . I 'm on the email list for the few stores I do shop , so I know exactly when my desired item is 50-70% off , then I buy ! ! ! 
@@44824193 @4824193/ <h> Honestly , Who Taught You to Drive ? <p> Each morning , we hop in our car to head off to the bus stop and work . After a few short turns in our mobile home park , we find ourselves at the fateful stoplight , getting ready to turn onto the high speed mini highway which connects us to our destinations . <p> Were never alone in this commute . Each morning , several of our fellow mobile home warriors join the entourage and head into the concrete jungle . But they do n't  drive like we do . <p> When we reach that stoplight each morning and turn right onto the main road , we notice our fellow mobile home neighbors doing a peculiar thing . They stomp down on the gas pedal and accelerate like NASCAR drivers . All the way to the next red light , which is about 200 yards ahead . <p> This happens without fail . Summer , winter , rain or shine . They always turn right , accelerate- really quickly , and then slam on the brakes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as the cops cooperate . I cant make them stop doing it , but I ca n't help but wonder where that habit came from . I just want to ask them why they feel the need to continuously accelerate , then brake , then accelerate . Isnt it obvious that they are n't  saving any time at all ? <p> I just ca n't understand the difficulty in driving sensibly . What is difficult about lifting your eyes to scan for the next stoplight , checking to see whether it is green , yellow , or red ? Tell me if this makes sense . <p> If you drive the same route each and every day , you should have a sense of the stoplight cycles . You should know roughly how long a light will stay green , and roughly when it will turn red . <p> If number one is true ( and it is ) , you should have a pretty solid idea of whether you will make or miss most stoplights . <p> If you know you cant make a stoplight , or can clearly observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then throw on your brakes ? <p> Combine this stoplight knowledge with a basic understanding of fuel consumption ( When you press the gas pedal , you are using more fuel . When you press the brakes , you 're stopping momentum , which will require more fuel to increase speed again. ) and youll quickly arrive at a very different set of driving habits . Right ? <p> Apparently not , because the streets are crowded with drivers who continue to waste gas . Never looking ahead , never taking their foot off the pedals to coast , and never even understanding how much fuel they are wasting each and every day . <p> Honestly , if you refuse to change any other driving habits , at least remember- to look ahead and take your foot off the gas pedal . There is absolutely no reason to accelerate up to the red lights , throw on your brakes , then repeat the whole process over and over and over again . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Your picture with the left foot on the brake makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both feet while driving an automatic so dangerous ! <p> I do not understand wild drivers , especially during this crazy weather much of the country has experienced . There was a huge car pileup in Wisconsin ( where people died unfortunately ) and a car pileup here in NYC on the Gowanus Expressway ( part of BQE ) here in NYC just a few days ago . Common sense dictates that unless you have some killer snow tires on your car , you should accelerate and decelerate slowly in freezing weather and leave plenty of space between you and the car in front of you but alas , people drive like its 80 degrees and not a drop of precipitation ! <p> I never understand why people speed off to the next red light . I try to drive using the eggshell method , where I just pretend there is an eggshell beneath the gas pedal , so if I slam on the gas pedal , it breaks . It keeps me safer , and it keeps my wallet fuller by saving on gas . <p> I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive like an old person your car will last forever . He still drives the same car to this day and it has made me really consider how I drive . I try to avoid any hard accelerations . I also noticed if I drive going 65mph all the way to work instead of the 85mph most other drivers go I end up getting 45 extra miles out of a tank of gas . <p> I 've experienced the same phenomenon . Speeding up to red lights , weaving in and out of traffic , accelerating like a drag race , etc . It has to get expensive , but I 'm guessing many simply do n't think about the dollars wasted . <p> Bobby , I 'd say that I usually use my signal , so wed be friends on the road : ) . I have people tailgate me all the freaking time , all the way to a red light . Its amazing . Its as if they ca n't look up , see the red light , and comprehend that they will have to stop no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to drive like idiots at all . I never even thought that maybe they were taught to drive that way . Even so , after a certain number of years driving , you should figure out how to drive like a functioning member of society . Not only is it a waste of money for them , its inconsiderate to those around them and definitely not safe for anyone involved . <p> I think my favorite is when I 'm going down the road at a reasonable speed and a car whips by me , only to get caught at a red light . I then catch up to said speeder having continued my normal , and less gas guzzling pace . I always wonder how they justify that considering it saved them no time at all ( evident by my normal speed catching up to them ) . <p> I 'll take you one further and tell you my favorite part of driving . When they speed to the red and have to stop , but I use hypermiling to brake early so that I 'll actually hit the intersection as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and make sure to smile and wave . Youve got to try it . <p> I see this all the time , too . It amuses me when people zoom around me only for us to land at the same red light . I hit both lights I pass on my way to work , so I 'm always prepared to stop . Regardless , I 'm always looking ahead to see what 's going on ! I do n't  rely on my brakes like that , and it makes me nervous when the people I 'm driving with do that . <p> We are enjoying the hypermiling which you introduced us to just this year . Another little incentive to breaking gradually is our Snap Shot a device we attached in our car that " reads " back to our insurance company . We could save 30% if everything goes right . For now , CJ and I are tied at two " beep beeps " each . = <p> I cant agree with you more Jacob . Great post . I see drivers constantly rushing toward the next red light when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . It never made any sense to me why drivers would stress their cars so much ( as well as their wallets ) with crazy driving techniques . I guess many drivers learned these bad habits somewhere and nobody ever taught them a better ( and more cost effective ) way to drive their vehicles . <p> I actually keep a note in my car as a daily reminder that reads " Arrive Alive Drive Safely " . <p> Its funny when I see other drivers slam on the gas to accelerate , or who weave in and out of traffic , and then slam on the brakes at a light or when traffic stallsI usually end up right next to them without that craziness . So all that crazy driving and fuel consumption has not sped up their trip . <p> I m with you Jacob I cant understand these people ! I think part of the fun of driving is knowing the road and the route so well that you can time the lights and such . I 'm always trying to brake as little as possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when necessary so I 'm not just sitting there at a light that everyone else raced to and then furiously braked to stop at . <p> I went to drivers ed and then my dad taught me to drive a standard transmission . From there I taught myself how to drive large box trucks and then tractor trailers ( got to move them around and dock them at a job ) and how to double-clutch when you need to . One of my friends taught me how to ride a motorcycle . So at this point , if it has wheels and an engine I can probably move it from point A to point B. <p> My grandpa ( who was a bit of a daredevil and I believed invincible for many years ) took the first stab at teaching me how to drive . I was 13 , it was the back roads of Georgia , and he taught me to use two feet . Needless to say , my mother was horrified when she later taught me how to drive properly . <p> I do n't  do much driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your annoyance with people on the road would shift to people who do n't  know how to properly pack into a subway car . Its amazing how much space is wasted in the morning . <p> Ahh ! Thank you for pointing out what no one else seems to notice if you drive the same route every single day at the same times coming and going , you should have an idea of how the traffic lights work ! This drives me crazy , both when I see people speeding off toward a light I know they wont make AND when someone is puttering along 15 MPH below the speed limit toward a green light that is clearly about the change . I think all the drivers I consider idiot drivers all have the same thing in common they do not pay attention ! <p> You forgot my favorite one Jacob . I really love the people who drive down the road with a foot on each pedal . Accelerating with your brake lights on takes a special skill . I have followed cars for miles before and never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those maintenance bills . -Bryan 
@@44824195 @4824195/ <h> You Can Still Get 5% Interest from Your Savings Account <p> Update : Starting July 1st , 2016 , all of these cards will offer 5% interest- on $1,000 . Previously , it was 5% interest- on $5,000 . Some people will still find it worthwhile to open multiple accounts with the $1,000 limit , while others will not. - <p> I was recently reading through a few online forums and stumbled across a thread discussing- available high-yield savings accounts . There were several users claiming to have found a true 5% savings account with FDIC insurance . <p> With interest rates so low , I was a bit skeptical . However , I decided to go ahead and try it out . I now can confirm that the 5% interest rate is real , and everything works as expected . Because of my success , I figured readers would be interested in opening their own account while this is available . <p> Multiple Names , Same Result <p> There are actually several different 5% accounts available . They all work the same way , and all pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , per account ) . <p> For each account , there is a prepaid card , and an attached savings account . Most of these products have a different name ( Netspend , Western Union , Brinks , etc. ) , but are backed by the same FDIC insured banks . For most readers , you wont be interested in using the prepaid card . Its just a requirement to access the 5% savings account . <p> I have experience with 4- of the accounts , so will recommend those to readers . If I try any- other 5% options , I will update this post accordingly to let everyone know . <p> I first opened an account with Brinks- for Vanessa and myself to get started . I later opened- accounts with Western Union , - Netspend , and Ace Elite . There are no credit pulls of any kind to open these accounts . <p> Opening Your Account <p> You are first signing up to receive the free prepaid card in the mail . You must do this to access the 5% savings account. - As an added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this article , and then fund your new account with $40 or more , we both receive an additional $20 bonus ( except Ace Elite , which gives $10 to each person instead of $20 ) . <p> To get started : <p> Select either Western Union , - Brinks , or Netspend . It does n't  matter which you pick , but you can only open one at a time ( Open the- others- later ) . <p> Fill out your name and address , then press " Get a Card " . <p> After it processes your submission and tells you that your card is on the way , create an online account . <p> Do nothing else until you receive the card in the mail . <p> When you receive the card , login to your account ( or create an account if you forgot in step 1 ) and activate the card . You will be required to provide your SSN at this time to verify your identity ( do n't  worry , no credit pull ) . <p> With the card active , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Account number are shown in your account . <p> You will only be able to order 1 card at a time , per address . It does n't  matter what name is used , it goes by address . In my example , I ordered a Netspend card , then ordered Vanessas Netspend card after I received and activated mine . After activating both of those , I repeated the process for- the other accounts . <p> How to Earn 5% APY <p> At this point , your account is activated and ready to use . You can transfer money to and from this account just like any other checking account using the given- Routing and Account number . I 've had no trouble linking my Netspend accounts to other online checking/savings accounts , and then transferring funds between them . <p> * Readers have noted that some bank accounts will not- allow ACH transfers to these cards . One free account that works perfectly is the Discover Savings Account , which we have used extensively . <p> Any funds that you transfer into the account will first flow into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds to the savings account . There is no way to fund the 5% savings account directly . All funds must first flow through the prepaid card . <p> You wont be able to access the 5% savings account immediately after signing up . They call this a " Premier " account feature . To upgrade to " Premier " status , you have to transfer at least $500 into the new account ( via ACH or direct deposit ) . It can be all at once , or in smaller chunks . I deposited the full $5,000 at once , and was immediately upgraded when the deposit hit my account . They actually send a new " Premier " prepaid card to replace the original , but I just threw it in a drawer . <p> Immediately after your $500+ is deposited , you can transfer funds between the prepaid card and the new savings account . Transfers are instant , since they are tied . In my case , I instantly transferred all $5,000 to the savings account and left $0 on the prepaid card . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> How to Withdraw Money from the Account <p> This might seem confusing at first , but its actually very simple . You can withdraw funds from this account just like any other online savings account . First move the money you want to withdraw from the 5% savings account back onto the prepaid card ( instant transfer ) . Then use your- given- Routing and Account number to transfer funds into your normal checking account . You can also pay bills directly from your online account , but again make sure to transfer the funds from the savings account into the prepaid account . <p> A Few Caveats <p> There is a 90-day inactivity fee of $5.95 . To avoid this fee , - make sure there is activity on the prepaid- card every 90 days . You can buy a $.50 Amazon gift card using the prepaid card , or you can set up an ACH- transfer from another bank account . My online Discover Savings Account has been working great for this because you can set up automatic deposits and withdrawals into this account which saves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earned once per person , per 180 days , for all of these accounts . For example , - if you open Western Union first , you will get- the $20 bonus . But apparently you wo n't get another bonus when opening Netspend or Brinks until 180 days have passed . <p> And worth noting , interest is issued quarterly for these accounts . Not a big deal if you are wanting to earn 5% over the long haul . <h> Discussion and Conclusions <p> These accounts beat anything else Ive found for FDIC insured investments , making them a great place to park your short term savings. - Its a bit of a hassle to get started , but once you have the accounts setup , it shouldnt require any additional work . Each $5,000 account will pay $250 of interest each year . If you set up 6- accounts , that 's $1,500 of interest income annually . Keep in mind , interest is taxed as ordinary income . <p> If you sign up using my Brinks , - - Western Union , - Netspend , - or Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with $40 or more , we both receive an additional $20 bonus ( except Ace Elite , which gives $10 to each person instead of $20 ) . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Frugalista <p> Jacob : Great article . Your links to the ACE Elite card take me to their sign up page but then gives me a message requesting that I manually enter your referral code : <p> " You need to provide a valid referral code to proceed with acquisition . If you do not have a referral code and would like to purchase All-Access Prepaid Debit Card please visit http : //www.netspend.com . " <p> Can you please share your referral code ? If not , can you confirm that the All-Access Prepaid Debit Card is the same ACE Elite Pay-As-You-Go that your article promotes ? Thanks ! <p> I appreciate the tip but highly recommend that anyone opening a NetSpend account immediately contact whatever flavor of card you opened and request that they not share you information with affiliates . I started receiving spammy phone calls of the lowest order within 24 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call NetSpend and request it , theyll stop sharing your information immediately . <p> I just learned that you ca n't transfer money OUT of your Netspend account to an external bank account ( as is mentioned above ) . The agent I spoke with said I had to move the money from my savings account to my prepaid card , and then go to the bank and either use the ATM or go inside and ask them to transfer the money to my account . He said using the card as a debit card has a $1 fee , and using it to transfer money ( via ATM or inside the bank ) has a $2.50 fee . I have NOT activated the Premier Card as suggested above . Some of you early-adopters may be grandfathered in but it looks like there are no more " free " transfers . <p> Anyone else just recieved this email ? For an Average Daily Balance of $1,000.00 or less , the interest rate paid on the entire balance will be 4.91% with an Annual Percentage Yield ( APY ) of 5.00% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $1,000.00 , the interest rate paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which exceeds $1,000.00 will be 0.49% with an APY of 0.50% , and the interest paid on the portion of the Average Daily Balance which is $1,000.00 or less will be 4.91% . The APY for this tier will range from 5.00% to 0.54% , depending on the balance in the Savings Account . <p> What happens on your second interest payment if you have not changed any balances ? <p> Example : You receive your quarterly payment of 62.50 and do not change any balances in the account . When the second interest payment rolls around , do you gain interest on the total balance now(5062.50) or just the original 5,000 ? <p> Put another way , do you lose out on compound interest when you are over the $5,000 ? <p> Thanks for the tip Jacob . Max deposit made to one card and opened another . $20 for you and $20 for me . Do you have to move funds back to the prepaid balance for the recurring transactions or does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with the part about avoiding the inactivity charge . You wrote " You can buy a $.50 Amazon gift card using the prepaid card , or you can set up an ACH transfer from another bank account " . <p> Does this mean that I can simply transfer the earnings that happen quarterly to another account and this counts as the activity ? Or is there a delay and that 's why you do the 50 cent Amazon gift card ? <p> I 'm not entirely sure about transferring the quarterly interest . I think I read that it needs to be an external transaction , so that would n't work . The easiest thing to do is set up an automatic push from an external checking/savings account , then a few days later an automatic pull for the same amount . You can schedule this to be recurring and it costs nothing . <p> So even though they use the same names , the card level and plan level are 2 different things ? You get a Pay-As-You-Go ( not NetSpend Premier- FeeAdvantage ) purchase plan WITH a NetSpend Premier- card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you load the card without a fee ? I asked my bank , PNC , and they told me I cant load a NetSpend card from my PNC account . They said I can load PNCs own prepaid card from my PNC account , but of course it would n't have a 5% APY savings . What bank did you use to transfer funds to your PNC , WU &amp; Brinks cards ? Thx ! <p> By Jacob <p> Glen , please read the article . Each Netspend card has a routing and account number that is used for transfers , like any other bank account . Discover Bank works well for all transfers to these accounts . <p> By Amanda <p> Glen , <p> PNC bank will not let you transfer money to all accounts , they limit you on where and how much you can transfer . I was n't able to use my PNC account to fund these cards . Try another bank , I used my credit union . <p> Maybe they do n't  make money with Vanessa and Jacob but they do make money with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending behavior . Also , often with only a few mistakes you can often owe more in fees then you 'll make in interest . A. <p> Thanks Jacob , We just funded 2 Brinks accounts with 5k and so $40 bonus bucks for us ! There were sort of a lot of steps to get the whole thing rolling , but completely worth the $500 of interest well make in a year . Way better than sitting in our checking account making nothing ! Elizabeth <p> Quick question , So because I got the $20 bonus from using this sight , I have an extra $20 over the 5k that do n't  need in there since it is n't making interest . When I try and send the $20 from my prepaid Brinks account back to my Great Western bank account it says there will be a $3.00 outbound transfer fee . Have you found this ? Do you pay $3 every time you transfer your interest to wherever you need it ? Thanks . <p> do n't  send from the Brinks account to your bank , instead ACH from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be free . But , the interest rate on the $20 is still higher than most regular bank savings accounts . hope this helps . <p> Jacob , Thank you so much for sharing these high interest earners . I was wondering if you know of any other high interest earning methods . The best I have found on my own is 3.0% checking account with Lake Michigan Credit Union . This credit union does not require a Michigan address , but for a donation to their ACLS foundation for non-residents . Anyway , any other tips you have for interest income would be most welcomed . Thanks again , Carrie <p> In order to be eligible for the Savings Account , you must first upgrade your prepaid account to a Premier account by making a $500 direct deposit . In the past , any ACH transfer worked , but as of 1/22/16 , a real payroll or government payment is required . This change does not affect those who were already upgraded under the old rules. <p> If this is the case that will keep me from opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payroll direct deposit to the account . <p> Just got my $20 , hope you did too . A bit of a pain to set it up because none of my banks would allow me to transfer to it . So I had to go from my bank , to paypal , to netspend . It looks like its working now and I received the signup . Definitely worth the little bit of work for $250 a year for money I just have in emergency savings anyways . <p> I applied for the Netspend account around the first of December . I set up an account and waited for my card to come to activate it . They would not accept a PO box for a mailing address , and that is where we receive most of our mail . However , we do have a physical mailbox for situations like these . Anyway , I did not receive my card so I called CS on December 21 . It was VERY DIFFICULT to get to a person . When I did , the fellow from India could find no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day I opened my account , ect. he was able to locate me . So he said they would " cancel " the card that was sent and send a new one . Now it is January 7 , 2016 and I have not received a new card . Thoughout this whole ordeal , I keep getting emails urging me to " activate " my card ! DUH ! <p> I have been watching this thread with great interest as the most I have been able to find for a savings account is 2% . I am switching over to Personal Capital and am wondering if you were able to link your Brinks or Western Union prepaid accounts into their interface ? <p> I emailed Personal Capital about getting these accounts to sync also had no luck adding them to USAA . Netspend was added without a hitch . They got back to me to clarify / provide links . Hoping they add soon . <p> Thanks for thorough description of these accounts ! I signed up using your links , but I think it only worked for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ineligible on the second account ) . Out of curiosity , did you actually activate the " upgraded " netspend card ? You said that you " threw it in a drawer " , but I 'm wondering if you actually activated that card first . Thanks ! <p> thanks jacob . ive signed up for a netspend account for me and my wife and in the process of opening one of the others . question about the inactivity fee . for netspend , if i flashpay $1 back and forth between mine and my wifes account , would that be considered activity ? thanks . <p> I am having trouble putting money into the Western Union card . The limit appears to be $500 per transaction . Each transaction costs $3.95 . Tried direct deposit but my back rejected the MetaBank external account . At this rate adding $5000 is going to eat up the sign up bonus . Did you run into the same problem ? <p> I do n't  know what type of purchases you are trying to make , but do n't  . I have paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online savings account . Discover is probably the best and easiest , and I have a review on the sidebar that you can utilize . <p> One more question , have you tested pulling all $5000 to Prepaid then transferring back to your normal bank ? I want to use this to make money off my Emergency Fund , but Ive read about troubles people have had . Do you trust you could get all funds relatively quickly ( i 'm thinking 3 days is my max i 'd want to wait ) . <p> Anne , There are n't  troubles . I 've already made numerous large transfers into and out of our accounts . It works just like any ACH , and is extremely easy to do using our Discover Savings Account . Netspend does n't  have control of your funds . They just provide the front end of the service . <p> Hey Jacob , thanks for this ! Just got my first in the mail and setting up the ACH link now , and ordered the second . Are you tracking these on Personal Capital ? I cant seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i am missing ? <p> You can add the ones that do n't  update automatically using the manual add option . If you give them the URL of the ones that do n't  , they will add them to a list to add when a sufficient number of people ask for it . I did that with wunetspendprepaid.com <p> FYI some institutions do n't  recognize the routing number provided by MetaBank . Like many banks , MetaBank appears to have a few routing numbers . <p> I have a few bank accounts ( checking ) . One would not recognize the routing number provided by NetSpend/MetaBank . It kept inserting a different routing number . I went with the routing # inserted because I could n't put in a different number . The test deposits failed because of I did n't  have a MetaBank account with that routing number . I ended up going with a different checking account which worked fine . <p> Hey Jacob , thanks for the time you put into ur blog ! I 've told my friends and family . <p> Is Metabank or Netspend the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money held in the Netspend card is not insured if lost , but once you transfer the money to the savings account ( presumably under Metabank ) , our deposit is FDIC insured . <p> Bottom line , do n't  make the mistake of leaving the money in the Netspend ? <p> Netspend administers the front end and web portals , but does not hold the money . Several big banks like MetaBank or BofI Federal hold the money and provide FDIC insurance . The savings account is definitely insured , and I think the money on the actual Netspend card is insured as well , but I need to double check . <p> FYI , another card like this is Mango . It has 6% APY , but I think there are some fees that drop the real return to 5% or so . I do n't  have experience with it myself . I 've read both success and horror stories about it in various forums . I 'm more motivated to try the ones you mentioned here first since you tested them out . <p> In your case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that mean any amount over $5000 is not paid interest or is it paid at a lower rate . In your case , after 3 months the interest would be credited so you would have a balance of $5,062.50 . Are you sweeping that interest out of the account on a quarterly basis ? <p> I have another question . You say you got a grand total of six cards and six savings accounts 3 for you &amp; 3 for your wife . The limiting factor was your home address . Why stop at your home ? Why not get six more cards using your parents address , another six more using your wifes parents address , another six more using your grandparents address , etc . Keep going at $5000 per account until you get to the target amount you have allocated for cash savings ? <p> Hey Jessica , glad you got the free bonus , and thanks ! First , log into your Netspend account and navigate to transfers , then click free bank transfers and it gives your account number and routing number . Open another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , then navigate to manage external accounts . Once there , you can add the Netspend account with the routing/account numbers in the other tab . Discover will send 2 small deposits within 2 business days to verify the account , then you can freely make transfers between each account . Hope this helps . <p> i too used referral to set netspend up . I now have two external accounts verfied and have sent money to netspend . Under " move money " free bank transfers though these external accounts do n't  show up , and only " add money " to netspend option is visible . Does a send money option activate once there 's money on card ? <p> By Dan <p> I received my quarterly statement . I was surprised to learn that Tier 1 interest rates which apply to balances between $0.00 $5,000.00 was 4.91% and Tier 2 interest rates which apply to balances greater than $5,000.01 was 0.49% . I was expecting Tier 1 to be 5% and Tier 2 to be less than 0.1% . Although 4.91% is only slightly less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> While looking around my new NetSpend account I noticed they have a " Virtual " account number option . That 's a great benefit for those that do n't  already have such an option available with their existing accounts . <p> Did anyone experience problem activating their card ? I tried activating online , then " something went wrong " and they asked me to call CSR . After spending 15 minutes answering all questions , the agent then said I need to send copy of I 'd , social security card , and utility bill . I told him I 'm not going to do that and hang up . <p> If you answer a verification question wrong online , they are going to ask for that information . That 's standard practice for any financial product these days . And that email may or may not be true . If you have opened any Netspend related product , it is . If you have n't , you can ignore it . A family member received that email despite never opening an account with them before , but the bonus posted fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great tip , Jacob ! I noticed the fee disclosure mentions charges for Signature and PIN charges but does n't  mention online purchasesso there is no fee for buying the $0.50 Amazon gift card . Is that right ? <p> Also , what did you mean about " if you open 4 accounts " Can you only open 4 accounts with these banks ? Why not more ? Did you open two for yourself and two for your wife ? <p> Thanks for sharing this . I read about a similar account to this ( but I forgot the name for it ) and the thing that kept me away was not being able to pull the money out easily . So you are saying that as long as I move it from the savings account to the prepaid account , I can just use routing/account number to transfer them to another bank ? <p> And then it seems like the easiest thing to do based on what you said is to earn the $200 interest a year on the $5000 balance , and just buy an Amazon Gift Card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a lot better than any traditional savings/checking accounts currently available ! <p> Ive been looking at high yield savings accounts for years ! I 've never considered them as an investment because the returns are so low . With this 5% , and the low set-up costs , this option is more viable and more lucrative than even getting a CD ! <p> Thank you . Ill be sure to use your referral code when I sign up . <p> I have one question , if I sign up with your referral code , can I also refer others and get money from them ? <p> thanks so much for this info . its great to know . you mentioned that these were just the two options you had tried of several more you learned about . for those of us who do n't  have a spouse but might like to open up as many of these accounts as possible , would you give us the names of the other options ( with the caveat , of course , that we understand that you yourself have not tried them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really appreciate that . thanks ! <p> Hmmmgood , but less than the theoretical 6% RoR on a 6 month KIVA loan using a particular credit card ( annualized theoretical RoR equals 12% ) as KIVA has default and currency risks . Just goes to show than Ben Franklin was wrong about the wisdom of saving pennies when you can make more tossing them to debit cards or small businesses in underdeveloped countries . <p> Hi Jacob , Thanks for the thorough review and clear instructions . Out of curiosity , why do you think this is being offered ? Are they hoping to collect the inactivation fees , or is it likely a temporary promotion ? Based on the information you received , do you think its possible that the terms of the account could change ( for example , drop from 5% to 1% ) unexpectedly ? <p> Well-educated individuals looking for a high-yielding emergency fund are probably not the target demographic for these products , but that describes many of my readers . I do n't  know the chances of seeing a change in rates versus seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the rate is very attractive so I would sign up . <p> kudos to your informative blog ! I have been following your blog for a while but this is my first time commenting . Keep up the good work . <p> I have some questions to you 1 . What is the minimum balance on the prepaid card and the savings account ? 2 . I read elsewhere that there is a annual fee for prepaid/savings acc . Is this true ? 3 . Are there any fees with closure of this savings/prepaid account ? <p> There are no fees unless you use the debit card for a pin transaction , so I think you are reading the wrong info . I have used the card for a couple of months and havent been charged any fees whatsoever . <p> Happy New Year !

@@44824196 @4824196/ <h> Plant These Money Seeds in Your 20s <p> Most personal finance will tell you that the seeds to plant are the dollars in your savings , pension and investment accounts . <p> I am not convinced . How do I know ? <p> I know because I have reached the age when : <p> people meet for coffee to discuss not their latest date but their latest malady ; <p> just keeping healthy and looking half decent is a costly struggle ; <p> flirting shamelessly is acceptable because people think you ca n't be serious . <p> Yep , I am in my early fifties and many of my conversations are about varicose veins , teeth whitening and anti-ageing products . I fully expect in 10 years to be discussing well , let 's not even go there . <p> This aside , I feel grateful and blessed every morning . I am grateful for my family , for my friends , for my job through which I touch the future , for my lifestyle and for- the future we are creating . <p> Every morning , I wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when creativity is valued , knowledge is a valuable and flexibility is possible . <p> Recently , I wondered about the things I wish I knew in my 20s and the money seeds I wish I 'd planted earlier . <p> I made a list . It was long and repetitive . When I looked again it boiled down to six money seeds . <p> None of these are about savings , pension and investments . These are my gift to you ! <p> Seed 1 : Capital comes in many forms <p> You know you need capital , right ? Ill never disagree with that : your 20s is the time when you are laying down the foundations of your life . <p> And these foundations are about accumulating capital . <p> Where I have a problem is that , as we humans often do , when thinking about capital you most likely think about money . <p> Capital comes in many forms ; three that matter most are : <p> financial capital ; <p> social capital ; and <p> cultural capital . <p> Now , here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial capital fast later in life , you better accumulate cultural capital which will enable you to build substantial social capital . <p> Put simply , this means that if I were in my 20s again I 'll spend more time at the theatre and art galleries than in the library . Thinking about it , I 'd spend more time learning all there is to know about cricket : after all I do live in Britain and most conversations at high management level are about the game . <p> I did n't  ! In my 20s I spend a lot of time in the library , hustled like a pro and kept little of the dough . Ive read War and Peace in Russian and am in love with the novels of Thomas Mann . My boss still wants to talk about cricket . <p> Seed 2 : You better increase the cloth <p> Cut your coat according to your cloth , the saying goes . <p> And I have grown to dislike it with passion I reserve for other areas of life . <p> You wo n't believe the energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life according to my means . I only ended up with a very tight , uncomfortable and , frankly , useless coat . <p> It took me some time to realise that this is all rubbish ; that to live an abundant life you should increase their cloth . <p> I know that money in your 20s is tight and simply surviving without getting in debt is a challenge . Keep your mind on increasing your income , or your cloth , and you 'd have planted a powerful money seed to serve your well later in life . <p> Seed 3 : It is about how much you keep not how much you earn <p> When you want to know where you stand in the game of wealth you are likely to compare earning . The more you earn , the better of you think you are . <p> This is what I thought . I always earned well ; for most of my life I 've earned more than most . Where did this get me ? Four years ago , we had about $160,000 consumer debt . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that how much I earn is irrelevant ; how much of that I keep is what really matters . <p> If I 'd planted this money seed in my 20s , I 'd be already be working for the pleasure of it rather than the pay . <p> Seed 4 : Life is not for money , money is for life <p> There is too much talk about money . Personal finance is a big business and we are bombarded by media messages about how to borrow more , what to spend it on and the threat of running out of it before we 've run out of life . <p> And here is the thing : the link between our money and our lives is usually a negative one . It is a bit like , money is the goal and our lives are the means through which we achieve it . <p> Every time someone tells you that they want to make millions and stops at that they live for money . <p> In fact it is quite the reverse : living a happy and fulfilled life is the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I have my money nourish my life . And I wish I had this one figured out when I was in my 20s . My life would have been more abundant , less stressful and , I believe , financially healthier . <p> Seed 5 : Dream big <p> Recently , at a conference in Africa , I heard a political leader warn the audience to temper their dreams , because dreams can become nightmares . <p> This was a transgression bigger , and more dangerous , than corruption and incompetence , I believe . Because our dreams are our future . Yes , sometimes they can turn bad and then we just have to dream another dream . <p> Dreaming is what gets knocked out of us from an early age ; it gets knocked out by our parents ( stop dreaming and get dressed ) , our education systems and our societies . <p> When I told our financial advisor that well pay off all our debt in three years he laughed ; we did it ! When I told a colleague that I 'll have a personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in two and a half . And when part of my dream becomes reality I celebrate because this is so much more than my present . <p> Seed 6 : Impossible is nothing ! <p> I know Im drifting into branding slogans . <p> I also believe this to be true : there are very few things that are truly impossible and this is likely temporary . <p> You can be anybody and you can get anywhere ; you just have to : <p> decide where ( and who ) you wish to be ; <p> work out the conditions to get there ; and <p> pursue these with the single-minded commitment of a drug addict . <p> Impossible is nothing and you 'll see that things will start happening <p> Finally <p> You know , I was n't completely honest at the beginning of this article .

@@44824199 @4824199/ <p> The Roth IRA is a type of investment account that is granted special tax privileges from our current tax laws . Investors who choose to place money inside of a Roth IRA can choose between a wide array of investments , including individual stocks , bonds , mutual funds , ETFs , etc . <p> The most attractive part about the Roth IRA is the unique tax treatment . Contributions to the Roth account are made with after-tax dollars . There are no current tax breaks for the contributions . However , all earnings inside the account grow completely tax free , and withdrawals are completely tax free- ( assuming you meet the requirement below ) . <p> This is different from the Traditional IRA , where contributions are tax deductible in the current year , but withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income in the year received . <h> Roth IRA or Traditional IRA ? <p> If you are eligible to contribute to either the Roth or Traditional IRA ( requirements are below ) , you must decide between the two because you can currently invest a maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in any IRA . <p> Joe is 59 years old , - working part time in consulting .

The next year , Joe picks up a few- new clients- and is in the 25% tax bracket . When Joe now withdraws the $1,100 , he is left with- $825- ( i.e. , $1,100 x 0.75 ) available to spend . <p> Alternatively , Joe could contribute to a Roth IRA in 2014 . In this scenario , Joe could afford to contribute $900 to the account , because his $1,000 would be taxed at 10%- before going into the Roth IRA . The $900- grows by 10% , to $990 .

When Joe withdraws the money , he keeps- all $935- because- the distribution is- tax free . <p> It does n't  matter which account you choose . The dollars are the same . <p> The difficult part in this whole exercise is predicting future tax rates . Its about as difficult as picking winning stocks or timing the stock market . There are two reasons for the difficulty : <p> No one- knows where Federal tax rates are headed in the next 10 , 20 , or 30 years . The whole tax code could be re-written . <p> Most people do n't  know how much income they will be receiving in retirement . Therefore they cant accurately predict their tax bracket even if tax rates remain constant for many years . <h> Will You Have a Lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter is that most people simply are n't  saving huge portions of their annual income with the desire to have a few million in the bank by age 40 . The average American enjoys spending money right now and will not have significant assets during retirement . That means that most Americans will have a lower marginal tax rate during retirement . <p> Based on research I 've read , roughly- 80% of people will have less than $500,000 in investable assets at retirement . Since that seems like a reasonable number to base calculations on , well keep it . Based on a 4% withdrawal rate , this $500,000 portfolio would kick out- $20,000 of income per year . <p> $20,000 is roughly the standard deduction and exemptions for a married couple filing their taxes jointly . As you can see , the- $20,000 per year would be received completely tax free ( assuming no additional income ) . There would n't be a benefit if the- $500,000 were invested in a Roth IRA , because this couple is in such a low tax bracket . <p> Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you believe that the current lower brackets- ( 0% , - 10% , 15% ) will both be done away with ? I do n't  . <h> But The Roth Has Other Benefits <p> Roth accounts have no required minimum distributions ( RMDs ) - Tax deferred accounts , including Traditional IRAs and 401k plans , are funded with pre-tax dollars . The government has never received tax payments on those funds . As such , they require that you take distributions from the accounts beginning at age 70- -+ . In doing so , they force you to pay income tax on that money . <p> Roth IRAs are different altogether . All contributions are made with after-tax dollars . Youve already paid income tax on the money inside the Roth . All growth is tax-free , and distributions are tax-free . Therefore , there are no required minimum distributions . The government wont force you to withdrawal the money to collect tax revenue . This can provide a very attractive method of passing wealth to heirs . <p> Roth accounts- allow individuals to shelter more money If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual can actually save more for retirement by maxing out the Roth each year instead of maxing out the Traditional IRA . <p> If Joe were in the 10% tax bracket during contributions and distributions , the tax advantages are the same for both accounts . However , the funding limits are still in place at $5,500 . If Joe puts $5,500 in the Traditional IRA , that money is only worth $4,950 after taxes are paid ( $5,500 x 0.9 = $4,950 ) . <p> If Joe instead pays the 10% in- taxes upfront , and still has enough cash flow to max out the Roth , he can effectively save more money . The after-tax $5,500 contributed to a- Roth is worth the same as $6,110 pre-tax dollars in the Traditional ( $6,110 x 0.9 = $5,500 ) . <p> Roth distributions are tax-free . They are not included in the MAGI calculation . Because of this , you can structure withdrawals from Traditional and Roth accounts to minimize Social Security taxation . <p> Roth accounts can- help you qualify for a healthcare subsidy The Obamacare subsidy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAGI and might shrink the level of subsidy that you are eligible to receive . By using Roth distributions instead , you can better control your MAGI and the subsidy amount . <p> Roth accounts are flexible- An investor can withdraw his or her contributions to a Roth IRA at any time without tax or penalty . This is why Roth accounts are sometimes used as an emergency fund . <p> Roth accounts allow contributions at any age Any person can open and fund a Roth IRA , regardless of age . <h> Tax Diversification <p> Is your head about to explode yet ? There are so many things to consider when trying to make the decision about Roth versus Traditional IRA , and its not a clear-cut decision for most individuals . If you 're really highly paid right now , Traditional usually makes sense . If you 're in the 10% or below , I think the Roth is a great decision . But everything in-between is a guess . <p> Instead of worrying about it , how about utilizing each ? You could do a mixture of the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full employer match <p> Max out your- Roth IRA <p> Contribute more to the 401k or similar options <p> Invest via taxable accounts <p> In the end , you 'd have money in tax-deferred accounts ( Traditional IRA , 401k , 403b , etc. ) , tax-free accounts ( Roth IRA , Roth 401k ) , and taxable accounts . you could structure distributions from each to minimize your tax liability in any given year . <h> Roth IRA Funding Requirements <p> There are a few requirements that must be met when- funding a Roth IRA . <p> 1 ) You must have earned income . <p> You can not contribute to any type of IRA unless you have earned income . The maximum annual contribution to an IRA is $5,500 in 2014 ( or $6,500 if you are 50 years of age+ ) . You can contribute the greater of your earned income or $5,500 . For example , if you earned $4,000 this year , you can not contribute more than $4,000 to a Roth IRA this year . <p> The one exception to this rule applies to spouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The IRS considers such a couple as one economic unit , and permits them to share the same earned income . This means that a non-working spouse with no earned income can still open an IRA and contribute the full possible amount each year . By taking advantage of this , a couple with only one source of income can still max out two IRA accounts each year . <p> 2 ) You must fall within the IRS income limits <p> Eligibility also requires that your modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) not exceed the IRS threshold . For most people MAGI will be similar to AGI , but you can read more about the calculation here . Per the IRS , the current limits are as follows : <p> The limit amount is the $5,500 ( $6,500 if age 50+ ) mentioned above . The reduced amount is another calculation that is explained here . <p> 3 ) You have 15 months to fund the account <p> If you meet both requirements above , you must- make contributions to a Roth IRA by April 15th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can make a contribution any time from January 1 , 2014 to April 15 , 2015 ( the tax filing deadline ) . This same rule applies each year . <h> Roth IRA Withdrawal Rules <p> Once you have created and funded a Roth IRA , there a few things that you must know . The funds inside of the Roth can- be categorized in two categories- the original contributions made with after-tax dollars , and the interest earned on those contributions . <p> An investor can withdraw his or her contributions to a Roth IRA at any time without tax or penalty . However , any interest or investment gains- that you have earned on your Roth IRA investments have more strict rules for withdrawal . In order to withdraw your earnings from a Roth IRA tax and penalty free , you must be over 59 -+ years old AND- your initial contribution must have been made to your Roth IRA five years before the date when you start making withdrawals . <p> If you are under the age of 59 -+ and decide to withdraw money ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually taxed as ordinary income and you must pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty . <p> Investors age- 59 -+ or older <p> Once an investor reaches age- 59 -+ , the 10% penalty goes away . The only requirement that remains is the five year rule . If the investor withdraws money after age- 59 -+ but has not satisfied the five year rule , the earnings withdrawn are always subject to ordinary income tax . <p> The Five Year Rule <p> The five year- rule- starts on January 1st of the year you make your first contribution- Its five years after that first contribution , regardless of future contributions . Realize that this is a one time rule . You do n't  reset the five year clock each year that you add money to an existing Roth IRA account . <p> Furthermore , all Roth IRA accounts are considered a single unit . If you hold Roth IRAs at- five different brokerages , they are all considered a single unit for the five year rule . The original date of your first contribution is what starts the five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRA contribution up to April 15th of the next year , your five years technically would not have to be five calendar years . For example , if you made a Roth IRA contribution in March of- 2014 and designated it for the 2013 tax year , you would have to wait until January 1st , 2018 in order to withdraw your Roth IRA earnings tax free ( if you 're 59 -+ years-old ) . <p> If you rollover a Traditional IRA or 401k type account into a Roth IRA , the five year clock begins on the date of transfer . Each rollover amount has a unique five year requirement . <h> Early Withdrawal- Exceptions <p> Roth accounts are typically not tapped until retirement because of the age restrictions and the five year rule requirements . However , there are a few exceptions that allow investors to make withdrawals before those requirements are met . <p> You take the distributions in substantially equal periodic payments ( SEPPs ) . <p> In this scenario , the investor has not satisfied the five year rule , and all earnings withdrawn are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you choose to withdraw any earnings from your Roth IRA before reaching age- - 59 -+ , holding the account for five years , or meeting one of the above exceptions , you will pay a 10% penalty on the full amount withdrawn , and pay ordinary income tax on the full amount withdrawn . This is almost never advisable . <p> If you must make a withdrawal and do n't  meet the stated requirements , keep the withdrawal amount less than your total contributions . You can withdrawal contributions at any time without penalty . <h> Opening a Roth IRA <p> Almost every modern investment firm now offers you the ability to- open a Roth IRA . The best options offer low cost investment- choices- and outstanding customer service . Depending on your experience and comfort level , I have a few recommendations : <p> Vanguard The first to create and offer- the low cost , passive investment options that investors love . Continue to lower expense ratios and offer a number of different passive investment options . I 'm partial to the growing list of low-cost ETFs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanguard IRA . <p> Fidelity partnered with iShares to offer a number of different passive ETFs at very low expense ratios . There are no commissions when buying and selling these investments inside of a Fidelity IRA . - Fidelity has continued to improve and has made it easy to build a great low-cost portfolio . <p> 2 ) For DIY investors- who want to buy individual stocks and- bonds , or ETFs from a number of different providers , you can open an IRA at a brokerage firm and receive access to thousands of different stocks , bonds , ETFs , and mutual funds . I have past experience with the following : <p> Optionshouse Still the lowest cost brokerage firm to place trades . You can buy stocks and ETFs for less than $5 per trade . I 've had nothing but positive experiences with this company . ( Read My Review Here ) <p> Scottrade A bit more expensive than Optionshouse , but with a reputation of outstanding customer service . Scottrade has opened numerous offices throughout the country where you can visit . I would n't hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> 3 ) For beginning investors who are n't  comfortable managing their own investments : <p> Betterment This online firm has continued rolling out innovative services without raising prices . They will manage your IRA ( and all other assets ) for as low as 0.15% in management fees . The company is based on sound financial research and builds efficient , low-cost portfolios through diversified ETFs . They have IRA account options available now as well . ( Read My Review Here ) <h> Closing Thoughts <p> Investors in low tax brackets will derive the most benefit from using the Roth IRA . Those in higher brackets might find the Roth an attractive option for the unique- features and the tax diversification benefits . <p> Are you currently contributing to a Roth IRA ? Traditional IRA ? Nothing at all ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Diane <p> My 16 y.o . child had a summer job . Did not earn enough to file taxes under $1,500 . Want to open a ROTH IRA for her for the amount she earned . If she invests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also file taxes just to let IRS know she 's investing in Roth ? <p> I have a question when deciding between Roth and Traditional . I 'm currently self-employed starting my own business and freelance consulting . I live in Washington , so no state income tax but I pay basically 25% of everything I earn in taxes for Fed &amp; Self-Employment tax . Does that skew me towards either one ?

I have read somewhere that there 's a new IRS rule this year , allow you to roll over a 401K to Roth IRA penalty/tax free when you retire or leave the job . Do you know whether the tax free rule will apply to a rollover traditional IRA ( originally a 401k ) if I would convert it to a Roth IRA ? <p> That is an impressive post Jacob . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Tough for people to really know what their tax rate may be 10 , 20 or 30 years into the future . A lot can change . I have both which helps to hedge my risk either way .

If you 're self-employed , you can put up to 25% of your income in a SEP . <p> I really like that you explained how sometimes a Traditional IRA is better . I think too often people get caught up on thinking a Roth is always the best way . For people who qualify for it , a Roth is usually better , but there are times when a Tradtional IRA makes more sense . <p> I contribute to a Roth 401k through work , which is amazing . I can not imagine not using some form of a Roth such a great retirement vehicle ( and this is a great resource for people learning the ins and outs ) ! <p> My firm does n't  match , so that was a huge downside of a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more money in the future ( and therefore be taxed at a higher rate ) , so I 'd rather pay taxes now because when I 'll withdraw in retirement , itll be tax free .

I 'm fortunate that my firm as the Roth 401k option . <p> Very nice comprehensive guide to IRAs , with early retirement our plan we will have less taxes to pay on any Traditional IRA withdrawals in the future . Also as we go along we will make the decision of laddering the traditional ira into a roth ira to avoid taxes on the early withdrawal of principal . We do not factor these funds into our early retirement plan but might be a long term play with some of the additional benefits you mention here . <p> Shouldnt the time value of money and inflation play a role in the Roth vs . Traditional decision ? For example , you suggest : If your marginal tax rate is higher in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wins . If your marginal tax rate is higher in the year of contribution , the Traditional IRA wins . <p> Maybe I think strangely , but I 'd prefer to save $1 in tax now , by contributing to a Traditional IRA and taking a current deduction , versus saving $1 in tax when I withdraw the same contribution from my Roth IRA , which might occur several decades in the future when $1 is worth about $0.42 in todays dollars . That means I 'd have to expect that my marginal tax rate when I plan to withdraw cash from my IRA will be significantly higher than my marginal tax rate today to favor a Roth over Traditional contribution today . This of course assumes my Traditional IRA contribution is fully tax deductibleits not , for lots of folks . <p> This is just the associative rule of multiplication at play . You are n't  gaining any additional time value of money either way . The principal and earnings in the Traditional IRA are taxed at withdrawal .

@@44824201 @4824201/ <h> Should You Invest or Pay Off Your Debt ? <p> A close friend of mine asked me the following question : " My wife and I both have some student loan debt and a mortgage , but we would like to begin investing . Should I prioritize paying down the debt , or investing ? " <p> This is a common question , and many blog readers struggle with making a similar decision . My answer was not straightforward , because there are several different possible solutions that depend on personal preference . <p> The rational answer is to choose the option with the highest expected payoff . More simply , - choose the option with the highest interest rate. - If your debt interest rate is higher than the expected return from investing , pay off the debt first . If the opposite is true , pay the minimum amount each month on the debt , and invest the rest . <p> The behavioral answer is more complicated , because debt carries an emotional cost . If you despise debt , you might prefer paying down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider a hybrid approach where you invest and pay off the debt simultaneously . <p> If you desire a more detailed approach , continue reading . <p> 1 ) Automate Minimum Payments <p> When dealing with any type of debt , the first step is automating minimum monthly payments . Doing this prevents late payment fees and other penalties . <p> Set these payments up through your bank account , or directly with each creditor . <p> You want to set aside cash in a liquid checking or savings account that is easily accessible. - The common- recommendation is to set aside enough money to cover 3-6 months of expenses , but choose an amount that makes you comfortable . <p> This money prevents you from accumulating more debt in an emergency situation . <p> 3 ) Take Your Employer Match <p> If you have a retirement plan- at work , does your employer offer to match your contributions ? - If so , then you should participate and take advantage of that free money . <p> An employer match typically looks like this : <p> Youre- earning $50,000 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the 401(k) at work , you will have set aside $2,500 for the year . <p> If your employer offers a 1:1 match , they also set aside $2,500 on your behalf . Your total account balance is now $5,000 . That 's a 100% return on your investment , with zero risk . <p> The one caveat here is your employers vesting schedule . Some employers require that you work a minimum number of years before the match money is legally yours . You need to check your plan to view the vesting schedule . <p> 4 ) Pay Off High Interest Debt <p> Some forms of high-interest debt- should be prioritized before investing . For most people , this includes consumer debt ( such as- credit card debt ) and- unsubsidized student loan debt . <p> If you are- wondering why- I recommend prioritizing the debt , consider- the following reasons : <p> Most experts are expecting- less favorable investment returns in upcoming years . Stock valuations have climbed much higher than the historical average , which is expected to- reduce future returns . Furthermore , bond yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slowly trend upward . This combination could result in a low-yield environment for many years . In such a scenario , expect a balanced portfolio to yield much less than the historical average ( 5-6% is a common long-term estimate ) . <p> Investing- in financial markets involves much uncertainty , and- there are no guaranteed returns. - Most financial assets are risky , and the stock market can be extremely volatile in the short term . <p> When deciding between debt repayment and investing , you should compare the expected return of each . Because debt repayment provides a guaranteed return , you should compare against a " guaranteed " investment , such as a short-term bond or savings account . <p> Treasury Bonds- are often considered the- " risk-free " asset because they are backed by the U.S. Government . Short-term bonds are much safer than long-term bonds because of interest rate risk . As interest rates rise , the present value of a bond falls . So a fair debt comparison might be a short-term Treasury Bond or savings account . <p> A high quality savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-year Treasury bond yields less than 1% . Even riskier bonds ( such as the- 10-Year Treasury ) are yielding less than 2.5% . That 's a scary low yield- for a 10-year investment . <p> As you can see with the numbers above , - no investment- in our current economic environment is going to offer you a guaranteed return in excess of 5% . As a result , I think 5% is a reasonable- estimate for " high interest debt . " - You might disagree slightly with the numbers , but you should view your debt as a guaranteed return- when making relevant comparisons . <p> For the more technical readers , you should be comparing the after-tax return of both options . Some forms of debt ( i.e. mortgage or student loans ) are tax-deductible , lowering the effective interest rate . Unless held in a tax-sheltered account , most investment income is also taxable , lowering the after-tax yield . <p> Above , I suggest 5% as a reasonable estimate for- high interest debt . If you disagree , you need to identify a reasonable estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spectrum , some debts carry very low interest rates . If the rate is below 2-3% , - you might consider retaining the debt and investing instead . This is especially true if you are able to make additional contributions to- tax-sheltered accounts . <p> Debts that carry an intermediate interest rate ( in my example , between 3-5% ) are a matter of preference. - In such a scenario , choose what makes you happy . If you like the idea of being debt-free , pay off the debt . If you- feel indifferent , split the difference . <h> Summary and Conclusions <p> The- steps outlined in this article can help you decide between investing and paying off your debt . You might disagree with my definition of " high interest " or " low interest " debt , but that 's a matter of personal preference . <p> In the end , the optimal decision is a function of- your- rational- and behavioral preferences . The rational decision- is the one- with- the- highest expected payoff . The behavioral decision- is the one that makes you happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a comment below . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I agree with your points . One area I struggle with is paying off the mortgage . Online opinions seem to widely vary on whether it makes the most financial sense or not . Seems to be more of a personal choice . But so far I prefer to keep a mortgage , maybe because I do n't  plan on staying in my current house forever . <p> I definitely agree with getting at least the match from your employer and then tackling high interest debts . <p> My auto loan is 2.24% , but I 'm going the emotional route with it and paying it off early . I 'm still investing a small amount . It was a hard choice to make because I know with that interest rate being so low , the math says invest for a greater return . Ill just be a lot happier once its completely gone and then I can focus solely on building a bigger nest egg . <p> Great article and breakdown ! Its been a question I 've struggled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nice article ! I paid off debt before I invested , and in hindsight , I should have invested as the market has done well while my refinanced student loans were at like 4% interest . But , you ca n't focus on hindsight I guess Also , there 's something very emotionally satisfying about paying off debt . I 've seen my investment portfolio grow to be way more than my debt ever was , but paying off the debt was a huge boost for my financial motivation and overall wellbeing in life . I 'm usually the one to chant the " rational investing " mantra , but depending on your personality , paying off the debt might be an overall better move . <p> Great article on a issue that many young / beginner investors struggle with . I agree that you should pay off high interest debt before you start investing . Even some of the more experienced investors would have a hard time generating a return that is greater than the average interest rate charged on credit cards . In addition to what you discussed above , I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my blog . These approaches are typically referred to as debt snowball vs debt avalanche . Both methods can be used to reduce debt either before you start investing or when you beginning investing . <p> Thanks again for a great article . Looking forward to reading future posts . <p> Great article , especially for beginners trying to figure out how to get started . I attacked #2 and #3 simultaneously , putting some money away in an emergency fund while ensuring I got the free match from my employer . And I agree that you have to try and put emotion aside I so wanted to pay off my car early , but knew that I was getting the better deal by investing the extra money instead . Thanks for the good thoughts ! <p> I have more of a behavioral approach and consider paying off debt before thinking of investing . I agree on taking the employers match , contribute as much as possible to it and take advantage of it . I think the decision usually depends on your financial situation . You need to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assessment of the two should be done because I think the answer to this question or dilemma is situation based . Both emotional and financial aspect should also be taken into consideration in making which one to prioritize . Personally , I 'd do investing while paying off debt at the same time . <p> I myself decided to do it in a hybrid manner because it is something that works for me . I think people need to assess their needs and capability of which one is more important to prioritize . In my case , its both as it balances everything especially my emotional attachment to both . <p> I go back and forth on this issue endlessly . There is room for disagreement even among the most informed and intelligent folks , which is why this is such a tough question ! <p> I 'm about to close on the sale of a condo and will net around $88K almost exactly the payoff balance of another rental property mortgage which is fixed at 5.00% with around 23 years remaining . We are already maxing out all retirement accounts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxable brokerage accounts , buy another rental property or some other investment , or pay off the other mortgage and boost our monthly cash flow as a result . <p> I 'm torn because stock valuations seem frothy , as do property prices in my area . But we are in the 33% tax bracket ( 28% some years but under Trumps plan well be firmly in the 33% indefinitely ) . So that 5% mortgage is more like 3.35% effectively . And with the Fed likely to raise rates in December and next year , its quite probable that muni bonds would return more than that in pretty short order . <p> Then again , wiping out a whole mortgage and having a paid off rental " feels " good , and its simpler than constructing a muni bond ladder and monitoring interest rate fluctuations . There 's no wrong answer , but I 'm sure I 'll go back and forth on this question for much of my investing life . <p> I subscribe to the pay yourself first way of thinking no matter what your debt situation . At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take advantage of any employer match you receive . After that , I agree with tackling your high interest rate debt first . If you have low interest rate debt such as a mortgage , I say let it ride and invest your money in low cost index funds instead of paying down low interest rate debt . <p> I like this . A very sensible discussion between investing and paying off debt . You have come up with a well considered comparison that I think uses realistic return/interest rates . Any further thoughts on bonds now that the price is starting to come down a bit ? I am 100% into stocks and have avoided bonds as they have n't seemed to make any sense to me ( i 'm only 34 anyway ) . Cheers , Paulie <p> Hi Paulie , There is one thing that looks highly probable : bond yields are going to remain low for several years . No one can predict the future interest rate policies set by the Federal Reserve , but they are going to continue holding rates low for a while . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt differently in emotional terms . Am of the pay-your-debts first and then consider investing camp , ( big Dave Ramsey fan too ) . But as you rightly point out , there are certain mitigating ( and logical ) factors that can make investing even with debt an option worth considering . <p> Excellent breakdown on this thorny issue . I agree contributing to tax advantaged accounts should take priority , especially if you get a match . I ave a similar threshold of 5% so that would include pretty much all types of credit card debt . Get rid of that stuff ASAP ! 
@@44824202 @4824202/ <h> 10 Wild Ways to Save for a Home <p> I was recently emailed by Movoto about an infographic they had put together on ways to save for a home purchase . I 'll give my thoughts on their 10 reasons below . <h> 1 . Do n't Have Kids <p> This is a legitimate option , as kids tend to cost a LOT of money to raise . We actually think that children are a real blessing ( just an unwelcome blessing at this stage in our lives ) , so this is one area where the Cash Cow Couple stays silent . To each their own <h> 2 . Freeze Your Credit Card <p> I just wrote about the many reasons to use credit cards , so I cant see any reason to freeze them if you are going to go through the trouble of applying ! Of course , my one disclaimer was that you should n't bother with credit cards at all if you cant pay the monthly balance in full . Carrying a balance on a credit card is financial suicide . <h> 3 . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recall my previous post on affording a dog . I will say that pets can be excellent companions and entirely lovable , but that does n't  mean that I personally think they are worth the cost or the trouble . Your mileage may vary . <h> 4 . Get Roommates <p> This is an excellent idea and one that we 've championed before . If you are single , its a no brainer . Even if you are married , it could still possibly work out . We considered the option but felt that our mobile home was just a bit too small for another person . <h> 5 . Move In With Your Parents <p> Depending on the situation , we like it . We 've already written about- living at home during college and still feel like that is a really intelligent decision . Avoiding debt or high payments that stretch your cash flow needs to be a priority . <h> 6 . Downsize Your Living Situation <p> Having a big home and a big mortgage can really ruin your ability to achieve financial freedom . Homes have historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't  really making an investment when you choose to buy a house that is far larger than your needs . <h> 7 . Brew Your Own Coffee <p> About 83 percent of American drink coffee , so the chances are high that most people reading this post love java . But how much is that worth to you ? People who like to frequent Starbucks and other overpriced havens spend more than $1,000 per year on coffee ! That 's insane . Why not just make it at home ? ? <h> 8 . Cut Your Cable <p> I personally think its insane to still own cable TV , but my parents and many other friends choose to keep the trend going . There are many good alternatives to a $75/month cable bill . I detailed many in my article on watching TV online for free . <h> 9 . Write It All Down <p> If you want to save money , you need to know where your money is going . Does that require a budget ? Maybe not , as I detailed in a previous post on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The next time your cubicle mate asks you to grab a bite to eat , say no . On average , Americans spend almost a grand per year eating out for lunch . Instead of getting an overpriced burger down the street , learn how to shop for groceries , cook your own food and bring it for lunch . Youll save a fortune in the long run . <p> Do you have any other ideas to save money when saving for a new home ? Leave a comment and share ! 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I could get behind some of these . I personally am not going to give up children to have a house ( if I had to pick between the two , I 'd go with kids ! ) But I 'm a big fan of downsized homes , brewing your own coffee , and cutting cable ! <p> Oh , this little infographic made me chuckle especially the part about saving over $24K annually I do n't  even make $24K annually ! <p> Anyhow , I think kids and pets probably belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment , expense and fur and once you 've got them , there 's pretty much no looking back . I 've definitely chosen the fur-bearing option on that one ! = <p> And as for moving in with your parents well , all I can say is that the authors must have parents who are significantly saner than mine ever were . I think when you figure in the years of psychotherapy that it would require to recover from the experience , that one is definitely a net loss ! = <p> My husband and I have chosen to live car-free . We rely on public transportation , bicycles , walking and the occasional car rental . We spend about $300.00/month on transportation in the winter , next to nothing in the summer when we cycle everywhere . Friends of ours in the suburbs spend about $1500/month owning and operating two cars . People think were crazy but we are healthier for it , and will probably have our mortgage paid off in less than 10 years . And the more people tell us " oh , you 'll get a car once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NOT buy a car if we have children . <p> Not a bad list . I think for a lot of consumers , avoiding credit card use is a no brainer if you are just getting started saving for a home . For someone who 's gaming the system and getting 1 or 2% on their spending , sure , go get those cash rewards . But you 'd have to spend $50 or $100 on the card to get a buck backyou could also just avoid spending a dollar . Many roads lead to Rome . <p> As for tips for saving , I am a fan of trying to live on one partners salary and saving the rest . Its mental accounting , sure , but it works . <p> Jacob ! ! ! ! Most of us are far too dogmatic to consider #1 OR #3 ( pun originally unintended then on second thought intended ) . It is refreshing to see these listed here . Alternatively , imagine what all that money could do in a retirement account or dividend bearing fund . Have a Jolly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but true . All of those things could save significant cash if you are just starting out . I think its probably not as relateable to those who may already have kids or pets or perhaps live on the other side of the country from their parents , but even so you could still consider the other ideas . 
@@44824204 @4824204/ <h> Applying Pokemon in Real Life <p> I 've admitted before that I 'm a huge nerd , but it gets worse Im actually still a Pokemon fan . I really miss playing the handheld Pokemon games . And because I no longer have time to conquer the Poke world , I 've decided to write about it . <p> Growing up , I watched Pokemon the show and Pokemon the movie(s) , I played the Pokemon trading card game , and I was addicted to the handheld Nintendo Pokemon games ! Yes , it probably sounds absurd , but I have a ton of fond memories related to such activities . My friends all played the games and we all traded cards . It was a grand- ole time and a wonderful season of life . <p> Unfortunately , I grew up- and things took a turn for the worst . Societal pressures required Pokemon abstinence . Public ridicule was too high a price to pay , so I was forced to hide my love for Pokemon . Every couple of years a new game was released and I would secretly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the captain of my soccer team , valedictorian of my high school class , and of course Poke MASTER ! <p> Eventually I found Vanessa and realized that she was worth keeping ! To showcase my growing affection , I put together this thoughtful little request ! ** <p> Responsibilities grew while Pokemon become a fond memory . These days , We have a lot going on , so I have n't played Pokemon in quite some time . But I still have the fond memories- and the lessons Ive learned along the way . Here are four life lessons that I 've pulled from Pokemon . <h> Lifes- a Journey ( Start While Youre Young ) <p> Pokemon follows the life of a young hero who goes from zero to hero . In the- videogame , your personal story begins at home with a mother begging you to be careful on the big journey . You have no gear , no contacts , no powerful allies . You 're just a teenager with big dreams and a lot of excitement . As you progress , you learn the ropes , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you meet a bunch of doubters , some haters , and a few friends . And in the long and tiresome journey , you help strangers , give to friends , conquer bad guys , and train hard to be the best . Sounds a lot like life , huh ? <h> Big Dreams Lead to Big Success <p> The main goal in the Pokemon game is to become the Pokemon League Champion ( and catch them all ) . That 's a big leap for a teenager without a single Pokemon battle under his belt . But that dream is what carries the hero through each challenge . There are plenty of obstacles and setbacks , but the dream never fades . Each battle and Pokemon evolution brings you one step closer to the ultimate goal . The key here is acting upon the dream going out and working towards it . <p> Many people I know have no goals beyond finding their next meal . In doing so , their lives become a continual string of mediocrity . I believe people- exist to do meaningful work . So many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't  think it has to be that way . Find what you love , figure out how to make money doing it , and pursue- it . You cant sit around twiddling your thumbs and expect- that your dreams will magically come true . <h> Failure Isnt an Option <p> In the Pokemon journey , a major objective is defeating the gym leaders at various- cities . In fact , you cant proceed in the game until you conquer each one . Winning requires strategy , determination and a bunch of practice to level up your Pokemon . I cant tell how many times I 've lost those big battles . Sometimes I deserved to lose , other times it felt like the opponent just got lucky . Sometimes the whole game just conspires against you . But the beautiful part is waking up in the Poke hospital all refreshed and healed , ready to battle again . There are n't  any absolute failures , just temporary setbacks that can be overcome by more work and a lot of determination . <h> Winning at Anything Requires Strategy <p> Pokemon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fire , water , ghost , dragon , etc . Each type is weak against a few types and strong against others . So fire is strong against grass , but weak against water . This unique setup is what made Pokemon the game so addictive . If you played your cards right , your attack would be " super effective " which meant doing double damage to the opponent and almost always winning the battle . The likelihood of success is directly correlated to strategy and proper planning . The same is true in life . Its impossible to succeed without a plan . Its the diligent planners who are super effective in life . <p> And one more nerdy Pokemon meme in honor of my favorite Crocodile Hunter . <p> ** I did n't  ask her to be my girlfriend like that . That 's a joke ! <p> That 's all I 've got . Do you play video games ? Have you learned any life lessons from- them ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> I 'm dying . I saw someone tweet this post and freaked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pokemon player , my mom would find me up in the middle of the night under the covers playing Pokemon Yellow when I was 12 . Applying it to life ? Nice . <p> I learned from Pokemon that no one I know is more like Pikachu than my wife . I never played because I am too old and missed the craze . This line really resonated with me " There are n't  any absolute failures , just temporary setbacks that can be overcome by more work and a lot of determination . " This attitude now prevents me from over-thinking and over-deliberating and takes me straight to action . I can always apologize or ot back and tweak things later . But I act NOW ! ! ! <p> The kids I used to baby-sit watched Pokemon , so now I feel old ! lol Those sound like great take-aways from your childhood passion . I admit , I was wondering for a split second if you really gave that to Vanessa ! Thanks for clearing the air haha <p> Haha ! I cant say that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure did play it a lot as a kid . I remember when the blue version first came out , I was so excited when my dad came home with it ! This brings back some crazy nostalgia . Remember when Picachu chose not to become Rychu , haha . <p> Hilarious cartoon . Great analogy between Pokemon and successsomething I would have never thought of . On a side note in college our game was Super Techmo Bowl . We drove across town to buy a console at ToysRUs specifically so we could play this game . Talk about a waste of time and moneyI think I used every dollar I had and so did my three roommates. 
@@44824209 @4824209/ <h> Why Frugal Freaks are the Ultimate Rebels <p> Did you ever see James Franco in Freaks and Geeks ? His character , Daniel , is the ultimate high school rebel . He 's cool , does n't care what anyone says , and he thinks outside the box in order to avoid what everyone else is doing . <p> My favorite scene is where he skips out on a boring school assembly to leave school , cause ruckus with his buddies , and he invites the goody- too- shoes , Lindsey , to escape the school assembly with him . He does n't worry about getting caught . All he knows is that he is n't going to sit around like everyone else . He 's doing things his way , and he invites the cute smart girl with the rebel streak to join him . <p> I think I like this scene the best because it 's a really cool analogy for my life story with Jacob . <p> You see , Jacob is James Franco in our story together . He is the rebel . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . No , the kind of rebel that goes against mainstream thinking and living life like a sheep . - He 's a frugal freak that questions every conventional idea about spend money , and then chooses the best path , regardless of whether other people agree or think he s nuts . <p> Then there 's me . The girl who did everything by the book to fit in with the crowd . I was the goody- too-shoes , but Jacob saw my rebellious potential ( and maybe a bit more ? ) , so one day he invited me to join him . <p> When I first started dating Jacob , I was unaware of his frugal habits . We had been hanging out quite a bit , so I practically demanded that he take me on a date . To my delight , he planned a picnic at the park followed by an adventure on a trail in the woods . <p> Was his priority on this first date to plan a romantic dinner and evening walk ? In retrospect , I think not ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special night together , but more than that he wanted to spend time with me without spending money ! What a rebel . <p> Ever since then , we 've been thinking through every money situation and making the decision that makes the most sense , not the decision we are pressured to make by societal norms . <h> Why frugal freaks are the ultimate rebels <p> When you say the word rebel most people associate it with a negative connotation . However , we 're here to encourage you to be a frugal rebel and here 's why : <p> 1 . Frugal freaks do n't have debt : Rebel against the mainstream ideas that you have to drive fancy cars , have a huge mortgage , buyexpensive clothes , and eat out all the time . If you learn to cut out all of these drivers of debt , you 'll be debt free in no time . <p> 2 . Frugal freaks are free : - Once you 're debt free , you regain control of your life . You will no longer be a slave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really love- whatever that may be . <p> 3. - Frugal freaks are creative : - Individuals like us do all kinds of crazy stuff to save a dime . Anywhere from joining clubs in college just for the - free food to buying 20 lbs of bacon because its only $1.69 per lb . And guess what , our frugal tendencies are what enable us to buy in bulk and save . The money keeps growing thanks to frugality . <p> 4 . Frugal freaks have massive nest eggs : - Once frugal freak rebels pay off their debt , they then start saving and investing a huge percentage of their earnings . This results in a sizable nest egg . Many frugal people are millionaires . Its not new knowledge , and its what made a buzz in The Millionaire Next Door . <p> 5. - Frugal freaks learn how to do the coolest stuff : They- learn how to save money by making their own food , cleaning products , and hygiene products . They also learn how to fix their own cars , cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure out how to travel for cheap , entertain themselves by reading and writing , and where to find the best deals on almost everything . Frugal freaks are also thrift store and garage sale junkies . Macklemore has nothin on us ! <p> 6. - Frugal freaks are smart : - Frugal freak rebels do n't  just go with the flow or mindlessly do what everyone else is doing . Instead , they take the time to analyze situations and decisions . They do this by researching a topic , learning from the experts , considering the options , and then implementing what they learn into their lives . <p> 7. - Frugal freaks win in the end. - In the end , we just do n't  get caught up in the spend- accumulate-die cycle like the rest of the world . Instead , they take control of - their spending , eliminate their debt , find their passion , and live full and rich lives free from the constraints of money problems . <p> So now that you know why frugal freaks are the ultimate rebels , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the rebels . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Definitely an interesting way to think about it and truth be told we always do think of a " rebel " in a negative connotation . It really amazes me how the general population is n't frugal , but then I guess if everyone was frugal then you would n't call it frugal right .. it would just be normal . But anywaysgreat post , really interesting way to look at it . <p> My wife just commented today how being frugal , even to the point of seeming poor , can be ridiculously cool . Today our roommate borrowed our old bicycle basket , attached it to the back of her scooter ( yes , we have three in our home now ) , so she could put groceries in there . She asked if she could borrow bungee cords , too , but we were using the only two we had on our basket . So the girl takes old bra straps , and uses them instead of bungee cords . Guess whose scooter looks way more badass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to think outside the box is such a useful habit to have in life as far as saving money . That goes hand in hand with #5 and DIY . My sense of creativity makes me determined to figure things out so that in the end I can save money .

But I agree that we have to try ! <p> " Live like no one else now , so that you can live like no one else later " is one of Dave Ramseys more famous quotes and applies perfectly here by going against the social norms and embracing frugality , it provides freedom later while everyone else is forced into frugality just to get by .

You also get access to the Discover Deals portal , but its for discounts only , not cash back from- shopping . <p> These two cards should be used for different purposes .

I have excellent credit and am trying to decide which card would be best . I think I 've narrowed it down to the Discover It Miles Credit Card or the Chase Preferred Sapphire ( primarily as my large purchase in the next few weeks would cover the $4,000 that has to be spent in the first 3 months ) . Not a fan of the $95 fee after the first year with the Sapphire card . What would you suggest would be the best card ? <p> Well , the Sapphire bonus is nice . Vanessa had that card for the bonus , but its definitely not worth the $95 annual fee so youd have to cancel at month 12 and apply for another . Its also not worth putting spend on past the $4000 required for the bonus , because its almost all just 1 point per dollar spent . The Discover Miles definitely wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you want the points for travel , I would probably get the Sapphire and spend the $4000 to get the bonus , then put it in the sock drawer , then cancel before the annual fee hits . As soon as you spend $4,000 , I would just apply for the Miles card and use it . Best of both worlds <p> Hi Jacob , I have one question regarding this Discover Miles card . Since Discover recently announced that new Discover Cashback holders will get the points doubled the first year which was something only for the Miles until recently . Do you still think that it is worth having the Miles card ? Seems like the Miles card has less advantage compared to the Cashback version when the regular cashback also gets double points at the end of one year . <p> The Miles card earns 3% on all purchases versus 2% on the other cash back card , so yes that clearly still makes sense as I indicated in the review . That 's an additional $500 cash back on $50k in spend . <p> Hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to share something with people who might be interested in this card ! <p> Okay so long story short , originally I wanted to get a secured credit card from Discover just because I had no credit history and I found out their security card was one of the best after doing some research . However , in order to get a secured card from Discover you have to apply for an unsecured card . If unfortunately you get rejected , they may offer you a secured card . So I applied for Discover Mile Card ( THE VERY FIRST CREDIT CARD IN MY LIFE ) and got approved within an hour ( I had to call customer service to provide more info tho ) . Anyway so I received the card in the mail last week and have been using this card to pay pretty much everything in the past week , but I also paid off my balances twice since I only have $1500 credit line and I do n't  wan na seem to have high utilization . What happened was in the past week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have gotten the Discover Cashback Card because that 's what they 're known for and they also told me that this mile card is pretty much useless after one year . I did n't  wan na listen to them but today my mama told me the same thing saying that I should n't have applied for the Mile card .. = ( Could you please tell me that I did n't  make the wrong decision ? I do love shopping but not do n't  really eat out or watch moviesIf I had the cashback card from Discover , I would n't be able to take fully advantage of it . On the other hand , I do travel a lot so I really like the $30 in flight wifi that Discover offers . It just seems like the cashback card is more popular and has higher rewards . In your opinion , do you just like those people around me that think the cashback card is better than the Mile card ? <p> Hi Jennifer , I do n't  think one offer is necessarily better than the other . Like I said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . The Miles card is fantastic for non-bonus spend . You cant find 3% on all purchases anywhere else . The original Discover It is also nice , but primarily for the bonus categories only . <p> Thanks for the review , Jacob ! Have you had challenges with getting Discover to honor the initial promotion . I have an issue with that several years ago and havent been too keen to go back to Discover cards since . <p> I have had my Discover it Miles credit card for 3 months and I can say that I am very satisfied with its services and perks . I am now saving points for the autumn getaway . What made choose this cc is that it has no annual fee ever . 
@@44824213 @4824213/ <h> Generous Giving Finding Joy in Frugality <p> Let 's take a break from the usual penny pinching , money grabbing Cash Cow madness . Today I want to talk about my personal story and the priceless concept of generous giving . <p> It would serve you well to first understand my background . I grew up in a lower middle class home . My parents struggled financially for many years and money was often a source of tension . They probably earned enough to live a comfortable , debt free lifestyle , but they were neither frugal ( by Cash Cow standards ) , nor meticulous in their financial choices . <p> My absolute devotion to frugality and money management grew out of that scenario . <p> I do n't  know why I have always been bent towards saving and being frugal , but that has been the case since I was a young child . My family can vouch for that fact . As as kid , I refused to purchase anything without first " running the numbers . " I could n't order fast food without figuring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , part nurture , without a doubt . I 'm a numbers oriented , analytical guy . At the same time , my families financial stress probably accelerated my tendencies . As a result , it has always been about saving and trying to avoid " being broke . " <p> With that in mind , I 'll bet you have no problem believing that I never enjoyed giving anything away . Somewhere along that path , giving up anything of my own became extremely difficult . I hated the idea of relinquishing control of anything related to money ( toys , video games , trading cards , allowance money , etc . ) . <p> That mindset has plagued me ever since . What I earn is mine , and I want to keep it . After all , if I give too much away , I 'll end up broke- and stressed like my parents were , right ? <p> Wrong , as I 'm learning . Generosity is liberating in many ways . <p> Giving up anything of monetary value is still difficult , but luckily I married a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a crazy amount in the short time that we 've been together . <p> Maybe the other factor in my growth is just continuing to improve and evolve as a man . Since we 've moved 1,200- miles from our families and loved ones , life has drastically changed . I 've realized that although amassing a huge amount of wealth is enticing , it really wo n't solve all of lifes struggles . It might actually create more . <p> Do n't  mistake this sentiment for frugal softness . I 'm every bit the anti-waste Nazi that I 've always been . And I darn well intend on making millions through honest work and great ideas . But if I do n't  , oh well . <p> On the other hand , relationships matter , and they last . They might even be eternal . Giving generously and doing good for someone else is meaningful , and has lasting consequences . Its a source of real joy . <h> From Grinch to Giver A Real Life Story in Generous Giving <p> This past week , we had some mobile home frustrations ( yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faucet issue since moving in , and it was not taken care of like the contract promised . I communicated with the plumber who was in charge and he informed me that the previous owners , who were contractually obligated to pay for the problem(s) , refused to pay him for previous work done on our house . As a result , he was n't sure if the work would be reimbursed unless he took them to court , which he felt might not be worth the effort , money , or time . <p> After a few friendly chats , he decided to do the work without knowing for sure if hed receive reimbursement for the work . Even though that was his job and he was required to do so , I was truly thankful . <p> He called afterwards and said that he thought it was taken care of , and that it was an easy fix with parts that he had laying around . I said thanks and went on with my work . <p> Later that night , my wife informed me that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keep in mind my normal thoughts would have been along the lines of : " He just did his job , and this little fix was in our contract . Why would I pay him anything other than a thank you ? " <p> Instead of that selfish nonsense , I agreed with her . So we put together a package that was probably worth more than his labor , and immediately hand delivered it . <p> The response was overwhelming . He called and texted me multiple times to say thank you . In addition , we made a friend who promised us help in case anything breaks in the future . How is that for an unexpected return on my investment ? <p> This story is n't about me , or my big ole generous giving heart . I 'm a failure when it comes to generosity . But I 'm learning every day . And the more I give , the more I want to give . <p> This past year has taught me much , but nothing more important than the joy of generosity . Heck , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . Ill be dropping gift baskets on every door step in this mobile home park before you finish reading this article . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> Awesome ! My two cents : the " grinch and the giver " are really not such a contradiction . I do n't  always like this phrase , but in a very real sense , " money is power . " Just like you , there is no way on earth I am going to give away my power to a cable or satellite company , a cell phone company , or a car dealer just because they 've developed some particularly clever ways of extracting it . ( NOR am I am going to blindly give it away to a questionably managed nonprofit or cause , just on the abstract notion that " giving is good " or the reverse , that " accumulating is bad/greedy . " Just as wrongheaded , imo . ) <p> But when I give to someone who truly needs it or who has made a gesture that calls for sincere acknowledgement that 's a different story ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that I 've used my " power " in a way that reflects my values . And here 's why its not a contradiction the better the right kind of giving makes me feel , the MORE of it I want to be able to do it in the future ! And how do I do that ? By being even MORE stingy about giving away my power to those who DO NT deserve it , that 's how ! <p> Chris ! I love the insight . I think its interesting that you and I have such similar thinking patterns . The only difference being that you 're far more successful at communicating those thoughts ! = I have nothing to add here . You nailed it as usual . <p> That Vanessa is surely a keeper , but I suspect you already know that . Giving is so important to me . When I talk to kids about save , spend and share sharing is the one that is the most difficult for them to accept ( in some cases ) but becomes their favorite after they experience it . Taylor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share goal but after seeing her sister share and have so much fun doing it , she started to share . Now its one of the first goals they set and the first goals they achieve and often exceed . I 'm glad Vanessa showed you how giving feels so amazing . And yes , I do love your new motto and have no doubt the Cash Cow Couple will live up to it . <p> That wife of yours is a true gem ! What a great impact you guys made on that plumbers day . Viewed from his perspective , you guys changed a really crummy situation into a one with a happy ending ! ! Isnt that what life is REALLY about ? Impacting others lives positively ? Way to go , keep up the generous attitude ! ! ! <p> I think its really important to be generous with others . When someone gives you good service or surprises you with their helpfulness thank them and wow them with your generosity ( monetary or otherwise ) in kind . My grandmother always says , " You cant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its true . So you may as while live a little and make someones day . <p> I was in the same exact situation as you were growing up . Seeing my parents live like they did made me so worried about being broke ! I mostly save out of fear , which is n't necessarily good . I am also not one to give easily , but I really liked your story ! Honestly , I think I would have thought along the same lines its his job , he s supposed to be doing this anyway , etc . So great that Vanessa encouraged you to give a gift basket . Its a nice reminder that genuine kindness can go a long way . <p> I knew others would related to my situation when I wrote this , and I hope it inspires some change . The real key for me in all of this is learning to give freely and with a joyful heart . There is n't really any truthfulness to giving it it ca n't be done freely . <p> Oh we disagree so often ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I remember you writing that if you do n't  get passionate responses , then what 's the point ) . But , this post , I am glad to see . I 'm glad you wife is helping you realise that there 's more to money than stashing it and being frugal . The last thing you want is no friends or family and millions in the bank . Money , even in small amounts ( or in kind ) can generate disproportionate good will , as you 've well seen ! I hope it was n't too painful and you 'll find the perfect frugal balance ! <p> I do n't  know if family or close friends were in jeopardy , but I 'm sure they too will benefit from a more giving Jacob . I think what we often disagree about is the frivolous spending of money , something that I 'll always feel strongly about because I understand the financial situation of most people who , self admittedly , are " struggling to get by . " In other words , your $300 shoe purchases make me nauseous . But hey , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you make a pretty penny . <p> I was actually going to email you two about writing a post on this very subject ! Frugality is all well and good , but it in and of itself can easily turn into another , more mean , form of greed . I have seen frugal folks with lots in the bank flat-out refuse to donate to charity , either with their time , goods , or money . That , to me , is wrong . Giving of what you have , even if you have no money , makes life so much richer in a way that no money or things can . <p> Plus , as you said , giving generously to others gives back to yourself as well . You make friends who are then there for you when you need help and someday , ALL of us will need some sort of help , whether that 's money or a friend babysitting your kids while you 're in the hospital or , well , whatever . <p> Hey Janet , thanks for a thoughtful comment . We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until now , its been more of a time commitment , but as the article says , we are starting to give more monetarily . Even giving our time has been very rewarding in the past . We do give to charity , and have some strong thoughts about it , but that should probably be the next post in the " giving series . " We feel very strongly about our resources actually going to help someone else ( not being wasted ) , so sometimes individuals and families are where we choose to focus . <p> That 's a fantastic story . My spouse sassed me something fierce for giving our massage therapist a bouquet of flowers , but the lasting impression it leaves , versus a tip , is worth so much more ! I am definitely the generous one in our relationship , it can be a point of disagreement for us . <p> Thanks Anne ! Giving can be a tough subject in a marriage . Vanessa and I have had some differing views on the subject . Its interesting to see how much childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been our resolution , and has paid big dividends . <p> Giving is our big challenge these days . Most of the other financial boxes are checked off ( making decent money , saving a lot , paid off debts ) but , like you said , we suck at giving . I feel like both my wife and I have similar frugal , but not quite giving pasts <p> I really like your story and how you took the extra step to say thank you . We especially have a hard time giving money so this may be a way for us to start giving more <p> It can definitely be a tough thing to give up what you 've worked so hard to obtain . Do you think there is a threshold dollar amount when you 'll feel comfortable giving instead of saving ? Just curious , as I think about these things often . <p> There is truth to the statement that it is better to give than to receive . I think often times when giving , the rewards to the giver is even greater than to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like good karma . You treat others well and they will return the favor . <p> Great post , Jacob , and thanks for sharing your experience . Giving truly is amazing . I remember one time I had a similar reaction from a neighbor when I brought her a simply meal of chicken noodle soup and some crackers and juice when she was sick . She was stunned . She said that was the nicest thing anyone had ever done for her . That just stunned me ! Sound like the recipient of your giving felt much the same way . It really is amazing what giving does , not only for the receiver but for the giver as well . <p> I am actually a little worried about what may happen come financial independence ( whenever that may be ) . After years and years of frugality , will I be able to give ? I currently do n't  give to charity , and have written about that . I have issues with charities ( not all , but in general ) . I would like to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life , as a way of being both an investor and a giver but perhaps that is a cop-out . <p> Snark , I can relate to your thoughts here . I too have some issues with ( some ) charities . But at the same time , I feel as if that has been a crutch to support being stingy . There are good charities and there are a ton of good people who would be more than thankful to receive goods , money , time , etc . Give it a try and see what you think . <p> I also like the idea of investing and giving someone else an opportunity , but that may be stretching beyond free and honest , selfless giving . I 'm not really sure because I 'm not yet there <p> I think we only tend to think about " giving " in the sense of charities . But there are people all around us who go out of their way to be generous , and giving a little back to them just makes the world a nicer place . <p> Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things really do matter . After my wife and I reach financial independence the plan is not to sit around with moldy piles of cash , the plan is to be out there with our family and friends . Glad you got your faucet fixed !

They also provide an unlimited amount of free travel for those willing to learn . <p> Can it be Fixed ? <p> Yes , by using credit responsibly . Buy only what you can pay for in full. - If you ca n't pay- the entire purchase amount in cash , you cant afford it . <p> For those with existing credit card debt , the message is simple : <p> Buy no more <p> Start cutting expenses and living a frugal lifestyle <p> Sell all the stuff you should n't have bought in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your existing debt <p> Buy only what you can afford <p> Invest or Payoff Debt ? <p> If you carry a credit card balance , the only investment you should consider is a reduction in debt .

Its simple maths . Doing it any other way makes no sense at all . <p> Myles , I respectfully disagree with your statement that " doing it any other way makes no sense at all " and that its " simple math " . Honestly if it were simple math people would not be in debt ! If you knew you were getting hit with a 17-23% interest rate to borrow money in lieu of paying cash for the item and you still choose to use the credit card then it is a behavior issue . The debt snowball offers a chance to change behavior since the simple math got you in the hole with debt in the first place . Loosing weight is also simple math but changing behavior is what causes you to win ( it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take for people to stop spending more than they make ? " This question scares me every day , especially with the recent revelation that people here are more in debt than ever before . I agree completely with this post , and its the driving force behind our continued commitment to be debt free forever . Great one , Jacob . <p> This story makes a good point overall , you should not be concerned with how much interest you are " earning " if you are still paying way more than that on your credit card debt . But I do disagree with you that paying off the high interest cards first is the only way to go . I know if I paid mine in order of interest rate , yes I 'd be saving a bit of interest money , but I 'd feel discouraged at the lack of progress . I 'm doing the snowball method ( for the most part ) and Ive already paid off 2 cards this year ( with another one due to be paid off in Oct or Nov ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off debt , that 's all that matters . <p> I am finally free of all credit card debt ( actually , I think I owe $3.00 for a Starbucks , but I will pay that off before the end of the month ) . Banks who have a 0.25% cost of money , that lend on credit cards at an average of 17% , are an abomination . They deserve whatever default rate they get . <p> Well , they are in the business of making money . I cant fault them for that even though I 'd like them to pay me a higher interest rate on deposits . The flip side is that individuals must accept responsibility for over-spending and being in debt . <p> Wake up people I am 77 years old never paid interest on the 2 cards i have . At age 19 i was paying cash 4 gas in my company truck , all ways broke . Then i started using the card I used the card to keep track of gas and other expenses paying it off every month. ( good book keeping records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little discipline are do n't  buy it if you ca n't pay for it ( IT WORKS FOR ME ) I hope this helps , Think is it worth it 18 % more <p> I read today recently that consumers are getting more confidence which is good and bad . Its def. not good for people to feel depressed and miserable about the economy because that creates panic and can stall growth . Too much can lead us right back in to ruin again . Hopefully , most have learned their lessons from the last big financial disaster . <p> What really irks me is that there 's TONS of information our there about being frugal and still being able to enjoy life . Were not keeping ourselves from the good life , but we understand that we can not afford everything all the time . So we chose what matters most and save on the things we do n't  really care about . <p> Great article . For me personally I was able to dig out of my pit of debt by using Daves snowball method as opposed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to knock a small loan early in the game really lit a fire under me to keep going towards knocking out the bigger debs and becoming completely debt free . Although mathematically I was in debt longer , emotionally I became fully vested in the debt payoff process quicker . I tried the traditionally method at first and become disheartened with massive total of my highest interest debt and ended up falling of the wagon a couple of times . I think the key thing for people to find a solid method that they can identify with and get to the business of paying off debt like your said . Forget investments focus on becoming debt free first . Great job . <p> Thanks Talaat , and a big congratulations on getting out of debt . I see the behavioral aspect of the so-called " snowball method " but I 'd still recommend the other route for those individuals who can remain motivated .

Is it just stashing as much cash as possible into investment accounts ? Or should we be thinking about alternatives that deliver more immediate satisfaction and lasting memories ? <p> Well , we 've been talking about it and have decided that we want to start traveling more . Vanessa- has traveled more than I have , but we would like to be able to travel together . We do n't  even know where we want to go , so how about a few suggestions from you ? Leave us a comment ! <p> Of course the problem with travel is the price tag . Its expensive to do anything travel related .

A world where the frugal man can win . <p> Why do banks offer these travel rewards ? - Heres the basic rundown : <p> The U.S. economy is largely driven by consumers . <p> Many consumers use credit cards to finance purchases . <p> Some consumers cant pay off the purchases in full each month and carry a debt balance . <p> Assuming you have read an article or two from this blog , you already understand that credit card- debt can be harmful to your financial health .

However , if you 'll pay off the balance each month , you can begin to accumulate travel rewards that will allow you to travel for pennies on the dollar . <p> Here is the basic steps for eligibility : <p> Build your credit score to an acceptable level ( typically around 700 or higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online ( compare cards on this page ) <p> Apply for card(s) <p> Meet the spending requirements for your new card(s) <p> Collect the bonus miles/points to be used for travel <p> Figure out how to use the miles/points to travel where you want <p> We live in a unique period of time where these rewards are widely available to help you reduce the cost of travel . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Larry <p> Hey Jacob . You mention keeping credit cards that do n't  have annual fees .

I have too many people in my life that end up having health problems because they worked themselves to death and now ca n't travel . <p> Travel is a great way to explore the world if you can use those credit cards responsibly . Weve done a bit of travel rewards and went to Ireland last year . If its your first time out of the country then Ireland is a nice place to travel to ( as long as you do n't  mind driving on the left ! ) <p> Hi Vanessa and Jacob , Thank you so much for introducing us to travel rewards .

I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great rundown on the basics of travel rewards . Its great I started a couple of years ago with some domestic trips easy as pie . It takes a little more planning for international trips , which we plan to go on later this year hopefully . Will be looking forward to your travel exploits ! <p> One of the way to save for travel we used to do is setting a budget for each month and track your expenses . If you spend less than the budget for the month , set that money aside as travel funds . Of course , that probably will not be enough for your travel . We try to travel twice a year about 3-4 days each within the country or one trip outside the country . There are so many cities and parks within the country that have so much to offer . You can try to avoid the peak seasons to save some money and always book ahead . But if your schedule is flexible , you can always find last minute travel deals online . <p> Go to Ireland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is haunted .

Actually there is now a better way to check your credit score . Discover and the Barclay card linked in the post provide your actual FICO score for free now if you are a card holder ! Couldnt agree more about those blogs . I read them often ! <p> I regret not taking advantage of travel rewards earlier . I did sign up for a few and received roundtrip tickets , a nice stay at a luxurious Hyatt hotel , and $400 credit . Pretty awesome since it did n't  take much work and it did n't  hurt my credit score . But now we are looking on taking on a mortgage and do n't  want any dings to the credit .

That 's the one thing I 'm trying to keep in mind when will we want a mortgage Does n't  look like it will be in the next 2 years right now . <p> My hubby and I also just applied for the Barclaycard and began collecting rewards . Its pretty awesome , but , as you say , you 've got to make sure that you pay your cards off every month . I 'm not sure yet if we are going to downgrade to the no-fee version of the card or close it at the end of the year . <p> Great intro article ! My husband and I are travelers and we LOVE it . Were currently helping our parents go to Kenya and Dubai all on points . Our philosophy has always been if you have been responsible enough to build a great credit score , you should put it to good use .

In the process , we decided to- reconsider our insurance coverage in an attempt to cut our monthly premium . <p> Most- individuals ( or couples ) - obtain auto insurance , and then forget about it . As a result , they often stay with the same insurance provider for many years . But shopping around can be extremely rewarding because auto insurance rates are known to- fluctuate over time . <p> The reason that most people do n't  bother shopping around is because of- the traditional ( and tedious ) insurance process : <p> Apply for one quote- at a time , filling in all of your personal information <p> Get aggravated because the pricing and policy features are hidden <p> Rinse and repeat for each additional insurance provider <p> Then , after you exit the quote process , - you are bombarded with calls and voicemails from Joe the insurance salesman . <h> A Better Way to Compare Car Insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to compare quotes from more than 200 auto insurers across all 50 states .

You can then click a little arrow beside each insurer to see available features and ratings from JD Power and the Better Business Bureau . For example , below is a screenshot showing Nationwide ( learn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the you can go directly to the insurer to finish the process online , or call one of The Zebra 's licensed agents and purchase coverage over the phone . <p> The Zebra , which launched at the end of 2013 , claims that the average user saves $614 a year through the service . In my experience , quotes are very competitive . <h> How to Choose the Correct Amount of Insurance Coverage <p> As I mentioned above , all insurance providers require that you select a certain amount of liability coverage . Liability coverage covers the other driver 's personal injury and property damage in a crash where you 're at fault . It does not cover your own injuries or property damage . You must at least purchase the minimum required by your state , but you can choose higher coverage limits if you desire . <p> For example , in Texas , 30k/60k/25k is the State minimum auto insurance coverage . That means : <p> $30,000- of bodily injury- ( BI ) - coverage per individual involved in an accident <p> $60,000 of- total bodily injury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident <p> $25,000 of coverage for property damage caused in an accident <p> You only need the state minimum to legally drive , but many people opt for additional coverage . The reason is that one bad accident can easily surpass the bodily injury or property damage minimums . If that happens , many states allow the injured individual to seek additional compensation through the legal system . <h> Do You Only Need Liability ? What About- Additional Coverage ? <p> Buying only liability insurance is always going to- result in the cheapest monthly premiums. - Beyond basic liability coverage , there are many additional coverage options : <p> Collision : Unlike liability insurance " which covers the other party 's damages " collision insurance covers your- damages should you be involved in an accident . <p> Uninsured and Underinsured Motorist ( UM/UIM ) : These types of coverages protect you should you be involved in an accident with a driver who does n't have enough " or any " car insurance . In that event , your own insurance will cover the accident . This is now required in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : PIP covers your medical expenses , lost wages , and funeral expenses if the other party 's liability coverage is n't enough , regardless of who was at fault for the accident . Some states now require PIP coverage by law . <p> Its typically wise- to choose uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage . The reason is simple Many drivers are uninsured or underinsured and many of them are accident prone . <p> Personal injury protection ( PIP ) is really- useful to cover lost wages and medical expenses for all passengers inside of your vehicle , and some- States require PIP by law . There are some who argue that PIP is unnecessary if each person- has medical insurance ( and an emergency fund ) . <p> Collision and/or Comprehensive coverage is much more expensive than liability only . The value of your car is an important consideration when determining whether you need collision and comprehensive coverage . If you car is older and/or low-value , it may not be worth purchasing these coverages , since the- insurance company- will only pay up to the estimated fair market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or high-value , having these coverages can save you from paying out significant costs to repair or replace your car . <p> Other , less common coverages are available as well . Some of these include : <p> Roadside Assistance <p> Towing Coverage <p> Rental Car Coverage <p> These can be convenient , but also costly . If you have family in the area , or access to another vehicle , you might not need to pay a monthly premium for these add-ons . <h> Choosing the Correct Deductible <p> A deductible is the amount towards a claim that you are responsible for out of pocket- before your insurance pays out . Collision and comprehensive insurance coverage require you to pay a deductible whenever you claim a loss , and the insurance company often allows you to set your own deductible ( typically up to $1,000 ) . - An important note about deductibles is that they occur on each claim made- for auto insurance , not on an annual basis like health insurance . <p> You should set the deductible as high as possible , given your situation. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher deductible in case of an accident , raising your deductible is n't the wisest move . If you have the funds available , raising your deductible will result in significantly lower premiums . Remember , insurance is a risk protection tool that is meant to protect against high severity , low probability events . If you rarely get into an accident , you want to minimize your monthly premium cost . <h> Conclusion <p> The Zebra is a great tool for comparing car and auto insurance . You can take it a bit further and compare Zebra quotes- to personalized quotes from individual insurers . With that information , you can choose a reliable , low-cost insurer that fits your needs . <p> After you 've made your choice , do n't let inertia take hold . Comparison shop for new rates every year because insurers constantly change their policies and rates . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Were always looking for ways to save on our auto insurance , and I think that being able to find the right deductible like you said would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deductible is n't annually like a health policy , but is rather a deductible for each claim .

I never knew you had to select an amount , but its nice to know that you only need the state minimum to legally drive . Ill probably go with this for now until I figure out if I need any more coverage . <p> I would love to find a way to save money on our auto insurance ! Between my husband and I we have a really good record , so I think that we could be saving a lot of money . I like your idea of comparing all of the prices in one place , so you can see ever all at once . That is so convenient , and I wont have to spend of time researching different companies . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stay with the same provider . We have always had the same insurance , and would just continue with our days . We will definitely have to shop around and see if we can save a little . Thanks . <p> I find I have to switch insurance carriers every year to two years in order to continue to get the best rates . They just tend to increase rates at a steep pace after you are a customer . Very frustrating . <p> I had no idea that there were so many different types of car insurance . Or at least levels of it . For most of my life Ive only been aware of liability insurance , but I 'm pretty sure that 's because my parents were paying for my insurance for a long time . It seems like comprehensive is probably the best coverage , but will probably cost the most as well . The more you know , the better off your decision is going to be though . Thanks for sharing ! <p> Thanks for the post , as I completely agree . Insurance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month after month without comparing to save rates . The companies are in it for the money , so regardless of how loyal you are to them , at the end of the day its about their bottom line . So , it should be the same way for you , you are paying for the service , so its only fair you should find the best and most affordable one out there . I typically try to change it around yearly to see what 's out there and who wants my money the most . <p> A couple of thoughts from a former insurance agent and agency claims specialist : <p> How much liability coverage should you buy ? Cover your assets . Some insurance companies will push 100/300 liability limits for everyone . If your fresh out of ( or still in ) college and/or do n't  have the assets to protect , why are you paying for excess coverage . ( An exception would be for those with high incomes and few assets . ) On the other hand , if you have a nice nest egg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability insurance . I once helped a seasoned doctor with a claim whod insisted on lower liability limits and then hit a bicyclist . He was at fault . He could have easily lost everything ( except for the relatively paltry amount that his liability insurance covered ) . <p> In many states , PIP is known as MedPay . This is one coverage I would encourage others NOT to waive . The biggest reason being , MedPay/PIP always pays first , regardless of who is at fault in an accident . In absence of this coverage , you could be stuck with medical bills piling up because insurance companies will not generally pay ANY bills until they have a settlement agreement . If you do n't  have medical insurance ( or a healthcare sharing ministry ) , then I recommend increasing this limit substantially as the cost to go from 10k PIP to 100K PIP ( for the companies that offer higher amounts ) , is often a pittance . <p> A lot of people have towing coverage on their phone plan or credit card . So you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prone to running out of gas , locking keys in your car , leaving your lights on , or drive a vehicle that is prone to breaking down and do n't  feel inclined to calling friends or family to help you out in those situations . <p> A note on comprehensive coverage . You do n't  have to have both comprehensive AND collision coverage . If you live in an area with a high chance of hitting animals , or if you are leaving town and your vehicle parked for a few weeks ( and want to insure against theft ) , you may want to add comprehensive coverage . It is ( generally ) much less expensive than collision coverage . ( You can also call and turn coverage on and off . I used to call and put comp/collision on my vehicles- just while on a road trip . ) <p> Last note ( with three lessons ) : Last year , we had a young driver run a red light and total our minivan . It was in the middle of the night and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the other partys insurance company got the drivers statement , he had changed his story and said we had run the red light ! ( Lesson 1 ) So while I could be the best driver in the world , and as such , only want to buy liability insurance , I still would have been on the hook . Coverage is not determined by who is at fault- but , rather , who is determined to be at fault BY THE INSURANCE COMPANY . Police reports are only one piece of the puzzle and are sometimes at odds with the insurance companies liability determination . ( Luckily , the passenger in his vehicle stated otherwise and the company did end up accepting liability . ) Lesson two : The value of our vehicle was apx . $8k . In California , the state minimum liability for property damage is only 5k ! ( This seemed so absurd to me that I thought the claims agent was lying . Wed traveled to California on vacation and all other states where I 'd lived it is much higher . ) Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been the max payout for our 8k vehicle . This is usually a non-issue , but is risky if you are driving a vehicle in a state with minimum liability limits lower than the value of your vehicle or in cases where you are hit by an uninsured driver . Lesson 3 : Our insurance company low-balled us on the appraisal ( $7000 ) . I gave them requested comparables , but they still did n't  adjust the offer . I know of others who simply take the companies to small claims court or get an attorney . Luckily , we were able to find a comparable vehicle for sale from a private party that was cheap enough to cover the cost with the settlement check . But that experience made me feel less good about the 15 minutes that had saved me 15% or more on my car insurance . So the savings on the front-end could be met with cost on the back end should there be a claim ! Here is a JD Power and associates study showing claims satisfaction across companies . Unfortunately , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cut-rate insurance . LONG ... <p> A follow up to my last comment which has not been posted yet . I tried Zebra and got two quotes only but someone just called to say they could put me in touch with insurers by phone . If I wanted to do that I am perfectly capable of getting a list of insurers in the area and calling them . I had expected this would be a shortcut with a list of companies/quotes like you get flights on Kayak but just got a couple . Not useful in my opinion but just for them to get your info and market . <p> I will try Zebra but having been with Geico for several years ( around 40 ! ) with few claims they are apt to display accident foregiveness and not take away the good driver discount for relatively minor accidents . That is one benefit we have found with staying with them and they were generous with their payout when our car was totalled by another Geico policy holder . <p> I read somewhere not too long ago that switching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no clue how true this is . Insurance always seems like one of those products that 's just shy of being scammy and like there 's some secret formula or database that only the insurance companies are clued into . So , I would n't be surprised if they were adjusting rates in this wayhowever ethical or legal it is . Any thoughts about this ? <p> Hi Kristen , Switching insurance should very rarely result in higher rates . The only time that would might apply is if you have a loyalty discount for maintaining the same insurer for several years . That said , there have been studies that prove insurance companies very rarely reward loyalty , and you can often get a bigger discount by shopping around , as discussed in my post . <p> Jacob , I have sticked to my auto insurance for three years , and I am planning to change as I do n't  maximize the use of it . Thanks for letting me know how to find a more reliable , low-cost , personalized insurance . Zebra sounds a cool app to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been $0.00 ! As a court interpreter , I lived downtown in San Antonio , Texas , right next door to my workplace &amp; when I went to UT-Austin for grad school , I had access to a free UT shuttle bus from the apartment building to classes &amp; also free bus rides on city buses . I made liberal use of The Dog at student rates for more long-distance travels , and later , I moved next door to UT and walking distance from my part-time job as an interpreter in the Municipal Court system . Here in Taipei , Taiwan , public transport abounds &amp; the price is always right ( I just rode a free hospital shuttle bus on the freeway from Point A to Point B ) ! Hooray for an automobile-free existence since the 90s ! = <p> I just tried this and figured I 'd report in . Unfortunately , all the options it came up with are more expensive than what I 'm currently paying Geico , which did n't  even make the list for some reason . Bummer .

It is the most clear and comprehensive guide on personal finance for young adults that Ive come across . If you 're in the 16-30 age range , its a must read . If you are older than that , I still recommend you check it out . <h> The Book Review <p> From the very beginning , Chris Smiths writing style is clear and concise . Its like a conversation , except all you 'll want to do is listen . He sets up his commitment to analogies from the very beginning , which is something that makes the book so easy to read . The book is full of excellent stories that boldly teach personal finance lessons . Chris finds a way to make personal finance appealing and entertaining , which is an accomplishment in itself . <p> Chris gives a clear description of the employment landscape facing young adults today . Gone are the days of lifetime pensions and free healthcare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Youve got to pave your own path and figure out how to achieve financial security ( dare I say freedom ) on your own terms . <p> Securing Your Financial Future- is broken up into 4 easy reading parts . Each part is designed to build on the earlier parts , like a pyramid . You wont be successful in part IV until you master the earlier sections . <p> Part I introduces the essential concepts . Part II deals with building a foundation . Part III talks about big ticket items . Part IV is a great look at long term investing . Each part is 5 chapters . That makes for 20 enjoyable chapters and right around 300 pages . <h> Part I The Essential Concepts <p> As stated above , Securing Your Financial Future targets young adults who are described as just starting their " financial life . " These individuals are often in their younger 20s and have just begun working full time or earning a livable wage . Chris and I both agree that these early years are without a doubt the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits are formed at an early age , and very commonly at the onset of a career . Once those habits form , they are tough to break . That 's why forming good habits early on is of the utmost importance . In addition , the effects of compound interest are almost unreal . Starting at 20 is infinitely better than starting at 30 . Those years ca n't be made up and the difference in overall return on investment at age 65 will floor you . <p> Chris does a phenomenal job in Part 1 explaining how to build wealth . Its not about big salaries or winning the lottery , its about proper planning and delayed gratification . Chris says that the easiest way to build wealth is by carefully controlling spending , and I could n't agree more . <p> There is an emphasis on saving and paying yourself first . In fact , that 's the first rule of the book always pay yourself AT LEAST 10% of your gross ( before tax income ) . And do n't  even think about debt or loans except for a mortgage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on the ability of compounding to make or break your financial life . <p> Chapter 2 looks at overall financial health and financial net worth . <p> Chapter 3 emphasizes the big picture and long term thinking . <p> Chapter 4 touches on the personal side of personal finance .

As you can imagine , its focus is on quickly increasing total net worth . <h> Part II Building Your Foundation <p> Part II of Securing Your Financial Future- moves from concept to action and explains how to build a solid financial foundation . From budgeting to risk management , Chris has you covered . <p> I love the advice on avoiding cash in favor of credit/debit . Cash is not king .

Well it still applies . Chris says a car is meant to be purchased with cash . And to that , I stand and applaud . <p> New or used ? That 's not a question , its always used . In the words of Chris , " Think of that new car smell as the smell of your net worth shrinking . " Beyond that brilliant quote , Chris provides solid buying advice and information on pricing used cars . <p> The chapters on housing are also great .

Chris does an excellent job explaining all of the investing information necessary to get started . <p> As a champion of index investing , I once again stand and applaud the efforts of Chris . He managed to put together a complete primer on index investing . Take his buy and hold advice . Trying to pick winners in the stock market is a fools game . <p> Risk and reward , diversification , allocation , its all there. - There is even an excellent overview of retirement account tax benefits and proper strategies to minimize taxable investment gains . <p> One final shout out .

He absolutely requires 27% down and a 5 year location commitment before purchasing . His advice is sound , but most people wont appreciate or follow it . <p> Chris is bold , and somewhat opinionated . His personal finance methods are n't  the easiest or the quickest . What he recommends takes persistence , patience , and sacrifice . If you want to live a lavish lifestyle and/or spend every penny that you earn , you 'll hate this book .

As you progress through life , you may find that your previous ways of handling money are n't working well for you anymore . <p> Buying and selling homes , paying for education or starting a business , and retiring are all major milestones that can drain your finances , or , ultimately , pay handsome dividends . Knowing how to manage your money so that it grows , while still obeying the letter of the law , can be tricky , to say the least . If you find yourself with more questions than answers regarding money , it may be time to find a professional to help you sort everything out . <p> So , how do you find the best financial advisor for your particular needs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you started . Keep in mind , however , that knowing your financial goals before you schedule a consultation will save you and the professional you are talking to a considerable amount of time . As with most everything , time equals money , so do your homework before you go . <h> 1 . Ask for Referrals From Friends and Family <p> People you know who are in a similar station in life as yourself may be using an advisor who would meet your needs . Ask around your workplace , your social group , and your relatives for names of agencies or individual planners who charge a fair rate and make financial planning simple . Depending on your goals , you may want to check out investment brokerages , day-traders , analysts , or insurance agents . <h> 2 .

The more money you are making on your investments , the more your advisor will earn . This can be very fair for both parties- because the advisor has an incentive to work hard for you . <h> 3 . Go For a Personal Touch <p> The firm or individual that you hire to help you with your money will have a very intimate knowledge of your personal finances .

Verify Credentials <p> Just as you would want to be certain that the person setting your broken bone is a certified medical professional , you need to confirm that your new financial advisor meets certain criteria . The Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) has a page on their site where you can type in a company 's name and do some fact checking . <p> Whatever your financial needs and goals are , be sure to hire a professional who is qualified .

We looked into the Prius and the Honda Insight at the time ( because I love those cars ! ) , but we could n't justify double the price with just 10-15 mpg better than what I would get with the Yaris . Let me tell you , my Yaris has been awesome !

They say that the market is overvalued and cant go much higher . Some people go so far as to predict downturns within a day . <p> Other " experts " are predicting a meteoric rise in equities. - Larry Fink , chairman and CEO of investment firm- BlackRock , recently received headline exposure for his predictions that the market will hit- 28,000 in 2019 . <p> Bold statement , Larry ! With prediction skills like that , I 'd like to know where he bought his magic ball . <p> Fink has been wrong before . Most notable were his predictions on the direction of interest rates in 1986 that resulted in a $100 million loss for his employer . Oops ! <p> Its unbelievable really . Both the fact that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major media coverage for spewing the nonsense . <p> Do n't  you realize ? If it were so easy to predict the future direction of the market , should n't more people be extremely wealthy ? It should be easy to buy low , sell high , right ? <h> Reality <p> Start reading a bit more on this topic and what you 'll find is that market predictions have become the norm . Theyve existed for decades and individuals never get tired of a good story , but they are nothing more than a coin flip . Wrong predictions are as common , if not more common , than those that come true . <p> The truth of the matter is this . The stock market , and any other investment can do one of two things each day : <p> Go Up in Value <p> Go Down in Value <p> Which will it be ? I do n't  know , and neither do you . And neither do professional mutual fund managers . <p> Vanguard published a great paper that examined the scientific evidence related to market timing and market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even professionals can not time the market . They consistently fail . Or in the words of Vanguard : <p> " The average professional investor has- persistently demonstrated an inability to time the- market . The timing patterns that are obvious in the- historical data provide no help in developing future- timing strategies . <p> The failure of market-timing- strategies has not been limited to mutual funds. - Investment newsletters , pension funds , investment- clubs , and professional market-timers have also- failed to demonstrate consistent success with- market-timing strategies . " <p> All of the evidence suggests that short term market predictions are nearly impossible . And because of sharp movements , attempting to time the market can be disastrous for the individual investor . Why ? <p> Because to be a successful market timer , you need magical prediction powers not once , but twice . You have to properly predict when the market will fall , so you can sell , then time it again and reinvest when you think it will recover . Good luck . <h> The Take-Away <p> What should you do when confronted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Instead of worrying about things you ca n't control , and which can not be reliably predicted , such as the direction of the stock markets , focus on those variables that you can control , such as fees and investment costs . <p> Pay no attention to " experts " who claim to have a predictive ability that does n't  exist . Instead , follow the evidence which clearly indicates that market timing is not possible . <p> Invest in a globally diversified portfolio of low-fee index funds or ETFs in an asset allocation suitable for you . Then stay the course . 50388 @qwx460388 <h> Comments <p> If only there was a magic ball to gaze into and see what the markets will do !

I have been on this planet now for 54 years and I have seen the ups and downs of the market during some big swings and all the little ones in between . <p> During the last bad period , I left my 401k in the same mutual funds that they were in the entire time and I continued to add the maximum allowed . While it was scary because the value kept declining as I added funds , I knew in my head that it was the right thing to do . I did n't  let fear drive my decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the best decision . I left that company recently and was able to roll my funds over to Vanguard at the peak . Nice ! <p> I was shocked when someone high up in the finance department told me that they moved all their 401k funds to cash at the beginning of the crisisreally ? ? ? ? Yep , it just goes to show that fear has a very strong effect on our decision-making . I love this line in you post : " focus on those variables that you can control , such as fees and investment costs . " Wise advice my friend ! <p> A friend asked me the other day if I was pulling all my money out of stocks because of the looming government default . I giggled until I realized he was serious . I told him that neither of us had any means of predicting where the market will be In a week to which he was incredulous . Its articles like these that remind me that I 'm actually the one whos listening to the data and doing the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me the same thing and he was definitely serious . I know many people who think they can time the market or think the pros can do it . So I 'm glad to see this post . A couple of years back during the financial crisis , I did indeed pull some money out of the market . It was a financial crisis right ? It was economic doom ! Everybody said it . It ended up being a bad financial mistake . I 'm just going to leave it alone and stay the course now . <p> Remind these people that theyll lose more money being out during a rally than they will being in during a crash ( assuming the market keeps trending up over the long-term ) . Getting out means you also have to correctly time getting back in . Unlikely .

Read the first part here Part 1 ( The Borrows ) . <p> On Wednesday , we looked at Bob and Bianca Borrows story . You may recall how the Borrows treated credit cards like free money , charging everything to the max . You may have thought to yourself " I 'm not like them ! I live within my means and only buy what I can afford ! " <p> Fair enough , - let 's consider an alternative <p> " We spend less than we earn ! " <p> Carl Consumer <p> It is true that most folks are more responsible than the Borrows . Perhaps your lifestyle more closely parallels that of Carl and Connie Consumer . While the Borrows clung to their credit cards , the Consumers cant get a big enough paycheck . Instead of borrowing to the max , Carl and Connie- spend almost every penny of their combined net incomes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to memory , and make sure not to spend more than what they earn ! The Consumers think they are doing quite well , " living within their means .

I mean , theyve worked hard and saved up a down payment . What else can be expected ? <p> When discussing these major purchases , the buying decision usually boils down to the magic question : " Can we safely afford the monthly payment ? " As long as money earned exceeds money spent , why worry about the details ? <p> They never stop to consider how much theyll pay in interest on top of the purchase price or worry about how quickly they can pay off the loan in full . Such details are boring and best left to nerds and financial professionals . If they can comfortably swing the payments , they 're buying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment plan for necessities like food or clothing . They pay for those in cash !

" <p> Both of their employers have 401(k) plans in which the employer provides a 5% company match on any money that they are willing to - invest on a tax-deferred basis . Carl and Connie- have also thought about contributing to a Roth IRA , which allow after-tax earnings to compound tax-free for retirement. - But the timing is n't quite right so they pass up the free company match and the opportunity to build wealth and minimize taxes . <p> Of course , they would like to save and invest , but there are far too many things they need right now : <p> A newer car ( because that 2007 model has too many miles at 60k and is likely to break down soon plus it looks ugly ! ) , <p> That new LED TV ( The 3-year old LCD does n't  have wifi to stream Netflix and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new iPad ( That retina display just tickles the eyes , do n't  it ? ) <p> The latest iPhone ( How can I use that old 3GS,4 , 4S model ?

Although Carl and Connie- believe they own their finances , the truth is that they are slaves . Like the Borrows , a job loss , accident , or illness could lead to a complete financial meltdown . Without a cash cushion and a long-term plan for achieving financial freedom , they will be unable to successfully retire until a very late age .

Love this life that you have together . = <p> Hey Joni ! Thank you for commenting and following the site ! Youve left a thoughtful comment and I 'll try to address it all ! <p> First off , congratulations on all the success . Early retirement , newer Prius , nice vacations , LED TV , and new electronics means you 've obviously done quite well ! I think you 'll relate to a later post in the series which views a financially responsible family who maximizes retirement contributions and lives within their means . On the other hand , based on the information you provided , I 'll have to assume that you are n't  the average American who does n't  have $1,000 in an emergency fund . Most people cant afford to do/own what you 've done . <p> Its not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its just that most people shouldnt go buy one . The older LCD seems to work just fine . As does no TV at all . And I cant relate size/quality of TV to theater attendance as we ourselves ( who own old TVs ) do n't  attend theaters yet enjoy plenty of television broadcasting . <p> Just the same , most people shouldnt ( cant ) spend thousands on family vacations . How do I know ? Because it interferes with saving for retirement or getting out of debt . Both of which are serious problems . Yes , we both recognize the memories and wonderful experiences that can be created . But we also recognize the fact that we 've continued to build unforgettable experiences right here at home . Every moment , every situation is what you make of it . <p> I wo n't address your Hyundai statement , because the Prius amount is all I need for sake of calculation . Your Prius should get around 50 MPG ? Many mid-2000 gas powered cars can achieve 35 MPG ( much higher with hypermiling ) . The Scion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1996 Saturn gets close to that . So you 'll get roughly 30% MPG better , which means the gas car would have used $6873 during that time . Or roughly $2000 more . Depreciation differences will MORE than cover that amount , I assure you . The point being , most people shouldnt go buy a new car . Ill have to break that down in a later post . <p> The last part of your comment is spot on . You never know how much time you 'll have in life . So spend life pursuing things that matter ( not material goods ) and socking away money to retire really early ( or pursuing a career you actually love ) . Most folks slave away at a job they ca n't stand for 40 years just trying to pay bills and hoping for a good government sponsored " retirement " at age 65 . No thanks , I 'll skip the frivolous expenses now and still enjoy every minute ! <p> Great post !

The important thing is not to lie to yourself as you make your life choices . <p> Yeah I think you make a couple great points . First of all , many people just have their priorities completely confused . Secondly , if individuals like yourself get more utility out of consuming today instead of saving for tomorrow , CONSUME ! Sounds odd coming from us , because we save 75%+ of our income , but I believe personal utility curve is so important to understand . <p> For a family earning less than $30k , my advice is to focus on increasing income rather than trying to live like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're rock stars like you guys , trying to spend something in the teens ) . People making that kind of money would be better served by increasing income rather than trying to scrimp their way to wealth . Controlling costs are always a good idea , of course . But with more than half the respondents who are focused on paying bills making less than $30k , I 'd say the root cause is an income problem , especially when one considers the variance in the cost of living from one place to another . <p> Certainly more income helps , but if they do n't  learn how to manage the money , theyll just be paying more bills with a higher income . And increasing income significantly is n't easy in our economy today . I 'm not sure a huge percentage of low income earners have what it takes to just switch gears and double their income . <p> As usual , when we discuss two sides of a dichotomy , the answer of which approach to take is " both " .

For a family earning less than $30k ( which includes some poverty level incomes , below $20k ) , the reason I stress earning income is that cutting costs can only be so effective in their situation . Unless they live in an extremely low cost area , how much could they possibly save per year ? $15k , total ? Its a good number , and nothing to sneeze at , but its not going to ever get much better than that . Additional income ( yes , coupled with cost management ) has the potential to give them much , much better results , though its certainly the harder row to ho . Cutting costs is easy ; increasing income is hard , but can have a much bigger impact ( assuming the new wages are n't  wasted ) . <p> I do n't  disagree at all , and I think we are making similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your end point that its much harder for the average low wage earner to magically double their income than it is to be frugal . My main point remains the same frugality is necessary whether your make 30k , 60k , or 360k . Many professionals making six figures are still struggling to " pay the bills . " <p> I am at a loss as to why many of my peers are struggling with paying credit card debt . I can not understand why they would charge something that they can not afford to pay back immediately . Unless its for food or to pay rent , I see very little other things that should be charged without having the ability to pay for it entirely . Many say they " cant " make ends meet when they really mean they " wo n't " <p> To answer your question about the 1/3 and paying bills , the answer is 1 , but it is not that they are lying to the surveyors , they are lying to themselves . Many people convince themselves that they cant get ahead or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is possible , it is just difficult and it requires a series of difficult choices that many people do n't  want to make .

They ca n't pay bills , but its not an income issue , its a priorities issue . They want to eat out every night , drive a new car , and still have money in the bank . The difficult choices are already made . They chose a life of slavery to their bills <p> Completely agree . I feel like I struggle monthly to meet my savings goals , but my savings goals are significantly more aggressive than 99% of peoples . I live like a hobo considering my income . In all honesty , my wife and I probably need around $20K/year to live and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where nothing is cheap . <p> Ditto . Its all about priorities . But the past few decades consumerism has risen which has led to the decline in financial security and common sense , and its not just in America , but around the world . I know I 've been guilty of it . But is it our fault that the average is irresponsible with cash and lives beyond their means ? Yes , we are responsible for our own actions and decisions , especially when we become adults , but the foundation for responsible financial decisions is missing . Financial education needs to begin at school and at home , then there might be hope for the average to become a more financially savvy average . In an ideal world we would all be smart with money , live below our means , save , invest and ensure we had enough for a rainy day . But then financial planners might be out of work and financial bloggers might not have as wide an audience = <p> Hi Kasia , thank you for a thoughtful reply ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own actions and choices . Most people , probably following popular media sources , love to throw around blame for financial statistics like this and many others . They say , " Its the school systems fault , the governments fault , parents fault , dogs fault , someones fault . " Somehow , we as a culture never want to accept responsibility for things . I taught myself about frugality , investing , hustling , etc . Only after that fact did I decide I wanted a graduate degree in the same area . I wish everyone else would do the same , as they would have a much better outlook on life , work , and the stress in between .

@@44824246 @4824246/ <h> Index Funds vs Actively Managed Funds Who outperforms ? <p> Ive been doing a lot of reading on the topic of modern portfolio theory and its relation to the argument on index funds vs actively managed funds . <p> Its pretty fascinating stuff actually . Almost all of the research and evidence points in one direction , but the financial services industry has been headed in the opposite direction for quite some time . <p> At the heart of the subject is the question about efficient markets . Are securities priced fairly at all times ? Do they reflect the true value of a company while accounting for all of the current information available to investors ? <p> In reality , its a spectrum . There are arguments for both sides and I believe the true answer falls somewhere inside of both extremes . But I 'm interested in the practical outcome of theoretical debates . <p> If markets are efficient and pricing is reflective of the true value of stocks , broad index funds should outperform actively managed funds , right ? <p> If you 're new to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't  have a fund manager sitting at the helm trying to buy underpriced stocks and sell overpriced ones . They just track an index , sometimes even the whole stock market , while keeping fees extremely low . <p> Active management on the other hand , believes in inefficient markets . In fact , there would be no reason to consider active management if all markets were perfectly efficient and stocks were priced correctly . You have to believe that some stocks are priced too low , and others too high , if you want to try to outperform the market or a related index . <h> Why It Matters <p> Your eyes might be glazing over from the finance lingo . Not to worry , I 'll bring it home . The reason it matters , is money . That 's the only reason anything in finance is worth debating . <p> Actively managed funds charge high fees . They must pay all of the management team and the worker bees making the trades . They have higher overhead , and the CFAs- running the statistics also seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of all the trading the continual buying and selling , they generate more taxable events . Those taxes are paid by you , the investor . <p> Passive management on the other hand , including index funds and ETFs , usually have very low fees . Not much is needed to track an index , and trades are usually not very frequent , usually resulting in tax efficiency . <p> So what 's left is a decision . Does market inefficiency warrant actively managed funds ? In other words , are the high fees warranted ? Can active managers exploit the market inefficiencies enough to overcome the added fees and still make you money ? <p> In a word , no . There is very little evidence to support that notion . Here is a little infographic provided by Businessprofiles that shows a few shocking stats . <h> Index Funds vs Actively Managed Funds Summary <p> Right now , active management is having a difficult time showing any added value when compared to low cost index investing . In fact , most actively managed funds under-perform their passive benchmarks by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For example , Vanguard index funds often have a 0.05-0.35% Expense ratio . Actively managed funds will typically be anywhere from 1-3% in ongoing expenses . If the index returns 10% this year , the actively managed fund will likely underperform by roughly the fees charged , or 1-3% . <p> This leaves your with a smaller retirement account , or a big delay during your journey toward financial freedom . <p> Unless you think you can outperform the professionals , who clearly underperform the broader market after considering fees , stick to index funds and passive ETFs . <p> What 's your take on index funds vs actively managed funds ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> Nothing beats a good well-balanced index fund portfolio except the paint peeling off of my wall . I love index funds , but they can be really boring which is why a lot of people buy into the notion that they can do better either by DIY or with a financial advisor . Granted , most people do n't  even know what they 're doing with their money half the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term . <p> Excellent post Jacob , just like your other interesting posts . I am glad that your academic research as well as personal experience helps readers like us get a conclusion on the debate over Index Funds vs Actively Managed Funds . Some of us found this conclusion the hard way after losing money or not reaching too far . Some others like me lost some money but kept reading endlessly costing time and money about what the right strategy could be . While it is understood that it is impossible to predict the perfect entry or exit timing applicable to day-traders , what I also found that all those people who talk about " value " investing are either industry experts themselves or big shots who have teams working on every deal not a luxury commoners like us have . With that said , it is very hard for us to calculate the " valuation " of a company and determine if the stock market price is over or undervalued . Also , we get only that data that is published by media and can not guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision making . With all this said , the ETF seems to be the best strategy with relatively less headaches . What is your opinion on the " timing " of buying ETF stocks ? While I know the ideal would be when the market has crashed but other than that as a regular systematic investor with periodic investments , is it ok to buy ETF stocks periodically and grow the nest egg without waiting for that perfect moment ? <p> Hey MD , thanks for the kind words . You are certainly right that individual investors are better off sticking to index tracking ETFs . I think it could be argued that institutions are better that way as well , if were looking at their investment returns after factoring in fees . <p> Timing is nearly impossible in the short to intermediate term . Of course , a crash will likely happen in a 10 year span , but who knows when . Because of this , its best to either dollar cost average or value average . There is debate between which is better and you can Google @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity , I 'd just buy the same amount each month and forget about the rest . If a crash comes , you can try to buy more . <p> Great article ! I recently read The Little Book of Common Sense Investing by John Bogle ( Vanguard founder ) and I consider it required reading for anyone looking to educate themselves on investing . Over a long enough time period its almost impossible to find anyone who can beat the stock market . That as a given , why wouldnt you take the less labor intensive route with index funds ( total market preferably ) that also have dramatically lower fees ? The compounding over a 40+ year time period just related to the 1-2% fees amounts to a staggering loss of wealth . Most people say , " oh , its only 1% " , but if you run the numbers its amazing . I have an article coming up on my site related to this <p> Count me among the fans of index funds . As you note , a significant factor in building wealth over the long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for actively managed funds is not worth it in most cases . <p> Since transaction costs are low at $7.95 through Fidelity they 're not a major factor . Over 12 years Ive gotten 12% annual returns which in theory beat the market , however since my beta was higher I probably underperformed based on risk . <p> When it comes to my retirement investments I always go with index funds . I like low fees and my long term goals match well . When it comes to active trading I do the trades myself with my small amount of " playing " money . Sure a professional may be able to dedicate more time to research and all that , but the results just are n't  there . The graph on the infographic above is just more proof that those actively managed funds do n't  produce stellar results over the longer term ( even though you are paying stellar fees ) . <p> Doing the investing myself is more fun for me and gives me bragging rights if I happen to get lucky . <p> I think it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they act in a herd mentality that is governed by fear and greed . Once you punch a whole in the central tenant of efficient markets , the rational actor , then the debate of the strong , semi-strong or weak version of efficient market hypothesis gets thrown out . None of them apply . That being said , I am not a huge fan of investors in actively managed funds for the reasons laid out here . The graphics are definitely interesting . The one caveat with active investors is that they can be " wrong " for a while before they are right . Case in point : John Paulson <p> I agree Chad , really interesting stuff . The verdict is still out on much of the theory behind efficiency and asset pricing , but I think the research is clear on a few things . 1 ) Active managers cant show persistence in providing alpha . 2 ) If big funds with tons of resources and bright minds cant pick winners , I doubt that the individual can . 3 ) Even if inefficiency provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would likely require much work and time on the part of the individual investor something which lowers actual real world returns , and makes the whole thing unattractive to most everyone . <p> This subject is not talked about enough . That is quite a good info graphic . I just posted about index funds today regarding my daughters 529 plan . Had to go with index funds due to lack of selection . But I think its better anyways . Glad I came across your blog on Twitter . <p> I total agree with the investment strategy with the index funds rather than actively trading . = The only way to make money actively trading is through market inefficiency . Most of the funds have PhDs and quant armies to build complex models running on supercomputers using real time market data . We know there is no way to win this war for us small investors . <p> But the thing to remember is that even with an army of PhDs , they are n't  able to consistently outperform the market ( and related index ) . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior strategy , even if you had those resources available .

@@44824250 @4824250/ <h> How to Start a Successful Blog and Make Money <p> Vanessa and I started this blog more than 2 years ago. - Since that time , we have learned a lot about the process of writing , growing an audience , and internet marketing. - This post will attempt to convey some of the lessons learned and hopefully will help someone else get started in the process . <p> This post will be a long guide filled with information . Ill try to outline sections so you can skip around . <h> What Is A Blog ? <p> A blog is- a website that allows you to write content- and publish it- for the world to see. - Most blogs display the most recently published content first . <p> Today , a blog is almost synonymous with a website . Most websites that you visit are setup using WordPress as a simple blog , and then customized to provide a better user experience . You can customize almost every- detail- to make it look professional . <p> It has all become ridiculously easy to get started. - Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website designers . Its just a simple point and click exercise to get everything started . <h> Who Should be Blogging ? <p> I think most people should at least consider the idea , but a- few categories- of people absolutely need to have a web presence : <p> Hands down , every single business owner should have a website/blog combination . More and more people continue to utilize search engines when evaluating products and services . Most internet users look for reviews and will evaluate a business based on their online presence . Despite these facts , there are still thousands of small businesses that can not be found online . <p> Business owners should take this one step further by using their website to define their ideal customer and their unique selling proposition . They should then write blog posts that answer the questions being asked by potential customers . As you answer questions and provide value through your website for free , you are building trust with your audience . That will result in paying customers- and eventual profit . That whole process is called inbound marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes <p> I recently helped a family member create a website for his local business , and helped him build backlinks to get the site ranked for local search terms . The results have been phenomenal for him . He receives a continual stream- of free , targeted traffic that- is- converted into paying clients . <p> 2 ) Anyone Desiring a Personal Brand <p> Students , Professionals , and anyone else- who desires to promote and control- their personal brand- should consider creating a simple WordPress website ( a.k.a. blog ) . You have complete control over the content displayed and the information provided. - Furthermore , when people use a search engine to look you up , your website will often be near the top of search results . This allows you to control your public image . <p> If you have something to say , you can build recognition and begin selling yourself as an expert in your field through the process of blogging . This can lead to great opportunities and potential income streams . <p> I 'm sure you 've been told , " Do n't  start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that advice comes from , because most bloggers do n't  make squat . <p> But there are numerous ways to make money blogging online . Do n't  let anyone else tell you otherwise . I know people who are making a killing online and they are n't  any more talented than you or I. They just put in the time to learn- about making money online through blogging , niche sites , paid advertising , SEO , etc . <p> Blogging- has definitely become more crowded in the last few years , but there are still many opportunities , and the overhead is non-existent . Very few other business avenues exist where you can start-up for next to nothing and make good money in a relatively short period of time . <h> Your First Decision Paid or Free ? <p> You can blog for free on a number of different platforms . The two most- commonly used are : <p> When I first started , I actually used the free WordPress.com . I made a little site and wrote about politics ( Yes , it was terrible ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to- WordPress.org ( not free ) when I started Cash Cow Couple . <p> Why did I choose to- pay for the blog if a free option is- available ? Well , you cant have a legitimate- blog on any of the free platforms . And you cant make money because advertising options- are quite restrictive . <p> If you intend on making money , offering a product or service , or growing your audience , you do n't  really have a choice . If you want to have complete control of the appearance , functionality , and advertising on your site , its only possibly through a self hosted ( paid ) WordPress.org site . <p> If you are- serious about- blogging and ready to get started , continue on . <h> How to Start Your- Blog- Today <p> Find a Great Domain Name <p> The domain name is your title on the internet and you do n't  want to be stuck with a terrible name . We spent a few weeks brainstorming and came up with Cash Cow Couple ( Were brilliant , I know ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to your niche that you 're going to write about . <p> The easiest way I have found is to visit Instant Domain Search and start typing . It will tell you what is available and even give related suggestions if your domain name is already taken . <p> Once you find an available domain that you like , you have to purchase the domain and you will then own that domain for as long as you decide to keep the domain active . <p> Your chosen domain name will be free if you go with- Bluehost- for your hosting . You can also choose to purchase a domain separately from your hosting package . This is sometimes recommended if you decide to switch hosting providers at a later date . We have been with Bluehost from the start , so I do n't  think its necessary , but you have the option. - We have used Google Domains to buy other domains in the past for $12/year . <p> Get Hosting <p> Hosting will be your biggest ( and pretty much only ) expense when starting a blog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your blog files and content . You are paying for them to host your site , make sure it runs fast , and stays protected . <p> It is important to pick a well known host because it will affect the speed of your site and how you rank for Google search results . In addition , some host providers have down time where your site will not be viewable by anyone . <p> There are n't  many options in the quality , low budget hosting scene . We went with Bluehost- for hosting and we recommend their services . I did a lot of research before starting the site and kept getting recommendations for- Bluehost . They have worked really well for us ( We are still using them after 2.5 years of blogging ) and the price was the lowest that we found . In addition , there are a couple of other benefits . <p> Weve seen almost no down time since creating- the site . That is huge . <p> You can get a free- domain name at the same time as your hosting package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be installed in one click after you sign up . <p> They feature automatic backups for your blog . We found this out a couple weeks ago after the site was acting funny . You never know when something will go haywire , but Bluehost will already have a backup so that you can restore the site . <p> You can select one of three plans and you can lock in the rate by purchasing up to 3 years in advance . You can also upgrade the plan at any time to a better plan . <p> We went with the plus plan at the time , but I 'm not sure it adds a ton more value than the starter plan if you are just wanting to give blogging a test run . <p> If you have not already registered a domain , enter your desired domain on the left . You will be registering your domain for free while signing up for hosting . If the domain is unavailable , you will have to choose another one . <p> I 'd recommend using a domain with a . com extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick others , and its not a huge deal either way . Also try to avoid using lots of punctuation or obscure words . People will type this domain into their search bar to browse your website , so make it as simple as possible . <p> If you already have a domain purchased elsewhere ( such as Google Domains ) , enter it on the right . Click Next . <p> Input your Account Information on the next page . <p> Make sure your email is correct because that is where they will send your login- information . <p> Youve now completed your domain name and hosting . The hard part is done . <p> Next , complete you billing information and pay for the services . <h> Install WordPress <p> You 'll want WordPress as your blogging platform . Its free , highly customizable , and well supported- which- makes it easy to use and user friendly . <p> To quickly install WordPress , navigate back to the Bluehost dashboard and login with the credentials provided via email . <p> Once you login to the Bluehost dashboard , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Click the icon and you will be prompted to start a new WordPress install . <p> Select the domain you want to install . You will probably want to use the default location and click check domain . If you have special circumstances you can create a subfolder instead . <p> Check the box next to Show advanced options . Enter your Site Name or Title . Choose an Admin Username- and password . These will be what you use to login to WordPress once it 's installed . Enter your email address ( All WordPress information will be sent here ) . check- the last box . Click the Install Now button . <p> It should say installing for a few moments , and then success ! <p> You can now type in your domain name and your new website should pop up . <p> You can also use the login credentials to now access the admin part of your blog and begin making changes . <p> Optional Final Step <p> If you purchased a domain name outside of Bluehost instead of registering a new domain in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few settings . <p> Your existing domain will not display your new site until you change your name servers wherever your domain is currently registered . Changing your name servers points your existing domain to the Bluehost servers . <p> As soon as you change your name servers , your domain will bring visitors to this new site . Therefore , if you are currently using your domain on another site , - do not- change your name servers until your new site is set up and ready to go . In the meantime , you can still access your new WordPress blog via the credentials provided in your welcome email from Bluehost . If you did n't receive the login information , simply call them . <p> To change the name servers where your domain is currently registered , - go to the registrar where your existing domain is currently registered ( Namecheap , GoDaddy , etc. ) and change the name servers to those provided below . This process varies among registrars , and Bluehost has a help section that outlines the exact procedure for each . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin writing . I would n't start just yet though .

They plug into your new blog and make your life a lot easier . Some are free , some cost money .

You can write a couple of posts and save them as drafts , or you can just write and publish . Its all up to you . <p> You should definitely set up a Twitter- account , Google Plus page , and a Facebook page for your blog at some point , but I do n't  think its necessary to begin . <p> You should also set up an about page , a contact page , and possibly a few other pages that help readers connect to you . <p> Do n't  get overwhelmed with all the tiny details- in the beginning. - So many possibilities can cause paralysis . Youve got to get started and just continue learning as you go ! <h> Some Blogging Advice <p> I 've learned more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And to be fair , I still know very little . But I think I 've learned enough to offer a little advice to all you aspiring bloggers . <p> 1 ) Become an Expert in- Your Niche Your niche is the topic area that you will write about , and you should choose something that you find interesting and meaningful . When you actually care- about a topic , you will spend time reading about it and absorbing it , which will give you something of value to write about . Over time , you 'll become extremely knowledgeable about a specific topic area , and the articles and videos will follow your knowledge and passion . <p> There are thousands of blogs- covering the same underlying topic . The only way your- blog will grow is unique , valuable- content . Content is still king in the digital world . Youve got to have something of value to say or people just wo n't listen . The most successful bloggers are considered experts in a given field , and they are paid well to share that expertise with their audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less This may sound crazy , but you shouldnt be writing 5 posts per week after creating- your blog . You do n't  have an audience . No one is reading what you write . <p> Spend enough time to create 5-10 pieces of awesome content , and spend the rest of your time networking . Leave thoughtful comments on authoritative blogs that you enjoy reading . Reach out and email influential bloggers without asking anything in return . After a month of being selfless , try to secure a guest post on those authoritative blogs and capture some of their audience ( your guest post should be amazing ) . <p> 3 ) - Focus on What Matters- When I started blogging , I was terrible at it . I spent hours upon hours obsessing over stupid little details that never mattered . Over time , I changed my focus , but it took a long time for me to understand the 80/20 rule as it related to blogging . <p> Spend- the majority of your time reading , learning , thinking , writing great content , and networking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscription service like MailPoet ASAP . <p> Spend very little time tweaking plugins to perfection , worrying about finding the perfect blog theme , filling out every detail of your Facebook fan page , Tweeting a bunch of nonsense , and publishing content that people wont read . <p> 4 ) - Do n't  Worry About Making Money - You should not expect to make money for at least a year after starting a blog ( unless you are a business capturing customers ) . <p> Making money with a blog is a slow process . You want to establish yourself as a thought leader first , then get savvy with marketing . That means you should n't focus on search engine optimization ( SEO ) or linkbuilding schemes , or plastering 20 ads on your newly founded blog . You should focus on the things I mentioned above in point ( 3 ) . If you have excellent content that readers love , you will eventually find ways to make money . <p> Do n't  get me wrong , you will have to eventually learn about internet marketing if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included ) focus on these things way too early in the blogging process . <p> 5 ) Be Real Put a picture up on your website . People want to connect with a real person , not a bunch of words on a screen . <p> Content is important , but so is your voice . Im convinced that people want to laugh , cry , and get angry when they read a blog post . People also- love- honesty . There is n't any replacement for brutal , open honesty. - Write- about yourself . Relate to your readers . Tell what you do , how you do it , why it matters , or what it will cost . <p> 6 ) - Consider the Commitment Starting a blog will take more time than you probably imagine . If you plan on doing everything yourself , realize- that it- takes- time- to learn each little skill . You can spend forever trying to design the site and find the right plugins . Researching an article idea and typing it all up also takes time . Expect things to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! <h> Make Money Blogging <p> When I first started this blog , I had no idea about online marketing or how to make money . That was n't my intention when I first started to write. - Over time , I began reading about monetizing a blog , and as traffic started to grow , so did the opportunities to make money . <p> In the first year , we made basically nothing . In the second year , income gradually began increasing . Today , we make more money through our blogs than we do at our day jobs . <p> Here are a few- ideas to help you begin making money online : <p> Niche or Authority Blog ? <p> This may seem a little bit confusing if you are brand new to internet marketing , but you need to understand the various websites that can be created . Think of blogging as a spectrum of possibilities . At- one extreme , you have massively popular authority websites . At the other extreme , you have very simple niche websites . Everything in between is possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thousands of followers , and thousands of links from other websites . This does n't  all happen overnight , so many of these successful sites have aged for several years . An example : <p> A simple niche site is about one specific topic . The entire website might only have 10-15 posts , and they will cover a specific niche topic . These sites are meant to passively make money with little upkeep . An example : <p> Do you notice the difference between those sites ? - The shaving site is very narrowly focused . Almost every post is designed to make money through affiliate marketing ( see below ) . The Social Media Examiner is a thought leader in all things social media . Great content , thousands of links , aged domain , etc . <p> For most bloggers , there seems to be a typical progression as they learn more and more about internet marketing . Many who started an authority site have dabbled with niche sites . That 's how I would approach things as well . <p> In todays crowded online world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing related. - Niche sites are becoming increasingly unprofitable because manipulating search engine rankings has become more difficult . Many niche sites have terrible content because the writers sole goal is income . <p> It does n't  matter what you want to write about , you have to write to inform . Ask yourself if you would choose to read the content being published on your blog . Is it informative ? Valuable ? If not , you 'll never make a dime . That 's true for any site . <h> Different Ways to Make Money on Your Blog <p> Google Adsense <p> My first dollar made online came from Google Adsense . I was in awe at the time . <p> To get started , you open a free Adsense account and link your website . After approval , you just decide on the size of ad you want to display , then copy and paste the code into your blogs html text box for display . For example , - I had Adsense- show image and text based ads and found that 250+300 pixel ads work best . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matches the post to the readers browsing patterns to display relevant ads that readers are likely to click on . Each click results in payment to the website owner . <p> The thing about Adsense is that you need a lot of traffic to make any real money . Furthermore , the payout per click is quite low , which is why many bloggers eventually decide leave Adsense to embrace affiliate marketing ( myself included ) and other revenue streams . <p> Affiliate Marketing <p> Affiliate marketing- involves recommending a product or service to readers . If the- reader purchases- what you recommend , the affiliate company pays your a fixed amount or a percentage of the conversion . <p> There are thousands and thousands of available affiliate marketing opportunities . You can find and promote almost any product or service imaginable . Some people get carried away and end up promoting garbage , which ruins their reputation . <p> But if you decide to- only promote the services that you actually use and genuinely recommend , you can make money and help readers . Examples on this site include- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seen in this guide . <p> Another outstanding way to make money online is to create a valuable product or service , and sell it yourself . Think E-books , online courses , paid advice , etc . <p> If you are successful , you can then reach out to other bloggers and have them promote your product as an affiliate ( #2 above ) . <p> This is an excellent way to make money , but it takes serious time and effort to produce something that will continue to sell over time . It has to be top-notch . <p> And you should be careful with this . You can throw- hundreds or thousands of hours into a $1.99 e-book that will sell 250 copies in 3 years . Unless you just love that idea , its a terrible return on your time investment . <p> Direct Advertising . <p> Once your site has serious traffic , a high domain authority , and numerous sites linking in , you will likely start receiving a ridiculous number of emails looking to advertise directly . <p> This can include sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsoring company writes to get a link back to their site or product . I would also include sponsored reviews in this category , where the site owner is paid to review a product or service . <p> There are also direct ad opportunities , where companies will pay you to display a text or visual ad on your site for a fixed dollar amount . <p> The problem with- direct advertising is that it often looks spammy . There are people who do it well and manage to stay classy , but its more difficult than other methods . <p> Other Marketing Resources- <p> If you have created a blog and want to learn more about internet marketing or making money , here are some sites that I have found very helpful : <h> Benefits to Blogging ( Outside of Making Money ) ? <p> There are numerous reasons to start a blog . I could n't possibly list them all and I wo n't try . What I 'll do is share my thoughts on what Ive learned thus far on the blogging journey and hope that inspires you to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest thing about blogging . Nothing compares to the tweet or email saying thank you for writing an article that inspired change and progress in the life of a reader . <p> You 'll Become a Better Thinker blogging forces you to think , research , and then type your thoughts into the computer . Its much more involved than I just made it sound . Try writing for 5 minutes without stopping if you do n't  believe me . It takes critical- thinking and concentration . You will think deeply and with more clarity as you practice writing . <p> You 'll Develop New Skills If you commit to starting a blog , you will become a better writer . Writing is a life skill and a key form of communication . My writing has improved tenfold since I began blogging . In addition , you might decide to learn about web design , search engine optimization , marketing , and much more . Those are skills that employers find valuable . <p> You 'll Become Intentional Blogging is a reflective process . If you choose to reveal your identity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accountability partner . There is no fooling around with that . Blogging forces you to think about your actions , your words , your thoughts , and your goals . <p> You 'll Meet Great People- I 've had conversations with brilliant people through my blog . I love getting emails from strangers . Sometimes its just a hello , sometimes its a request that I- review a product or a new book , sometimes its an opinion that encourages ongoing dialogue . Seriously , the internet is full of awesome , talented , passionate people . <p> You 'll Evolve Blogging does n't  just change the reader , it changes the author . Comments left by readers force you to consider their position and opinion . You 'll develop a well rounded mindset if you 'll learn from the feedback of others . <p> You 'll Become More Confident Or at least I did . Blogging as myself has forced me to become comfortable in front of an audience . I lay my opinions on the table for the whole world to see . Sometimes readers agree , sometimes they disagree . Either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Blogging can seem- complicated , but getting started is simple if you follow my guide . <p> Its extremely easy to create a new blog via Bluehost in less than 45 minutes . After you begin writing , then take some time and read about internet marketing . <p> Ive been where you are , and my best advice is to get started . Much of the learning comes through the blogging process , which evolves over time . <p> Let me know if- you have any questions about starting a blog and making money. - <p> This really was comprehensive ! In-depth and inspiring . I like wht you and you and your wife are doing here at the site . Great post Jacob . I recently started my blog and your words of not focusing on SEO and all that other stuff spoke loudly to me . I got overwhelmed shortly thereafter because its quite a bit to learn . So now I 'll just continue to focus on my content and its quality . Thanks for that . Keep up the good work Jacob . <p> Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I came across your article . Its very exhaustive and I cant even take them all at once . Did n't  quite get the niche and authority blog . What 's the difference . Though I want to blog about a particular area . The need for me to blog arose for a better service offering in a particular areabut am not a good writer . I know what to write but putting it down in a compelling and articulate way is a challenge . What do I do ? <p> Wow Jacob ! You threw everything into that post ! That 's what it takes these days to stand out as an authority , but its so worth it . My blog is starting to see some good traffic and its been long awaited . Thanks again . Keep rockin <p> Hi Jacob ! Thank for this pretty useful info ! A good friend of mine has his own blog and makes good money on it . I 'm going to launch my beauty&amp;fashion blog too . What do you think about blog hosting provided by Virtual Systems ? My friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for such a detailed ; yet , simple to follow post . I love the link suggestions , and the great plug in tips ! I am just transitioning from Blogger to WordPress.org ; and , have wondered which of these would optimize my site . Social Media , as a whole can become overwhelming , given all the information to absorbits almost as if , the more you learnthe less you knowlol ! Yet , I continue . I 'm a freelance writer , educator and Realtor.and , Im excited about having some of these great money making ideas on my new site . Thanks againand may you have continued success with your business ! <p> 1 ) Thanks for this article . I 'm setting up my blog , &amp; this article was here when I needed it . 2 ) My only critique is about the $1.99 eBook . First , such a low-priced product should n't have hundreds of hours spent on it . Second , all eBooks should be part of a bigger strategy that I 've heard called " the profit pyramid " . * A free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers ( &amp; each new one thereafter ) , offer them a cheap eBook ( $5-25 ) to distinguish buyers from lookers. * At 1,000 buyers , offer a more expensive ( $200-500 ) &amp; more time consuming product . * At 1,000 of those buyers , offer a yet more expensive ( $1,000 5,000 ) product . * And so on . Each level ( $10,000 -&gt; $100,000 -&gt; ? ) increases the amount of your time &amp; energy given to the buyer &amp; a corresponding reduction in access ( increased exclusivity ) to you . * At the highest level , it could be $1,000,000 for someone to spend a week shadowing you &amp; " picking your brain " . My figures may be off , but I think you get the concept . That 's how various online marketers have been able to have a $50,000 day : increase hype &amp; tension for product for a burst of sales . The only downside is they live for those bursts , &amp; they cant seem to make any money without the BIG day . <p> Great news ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely a steep learning curve , I 'm not tech savvy . WordPress which you start out , INS and outs of the study ? Ive been trying to understand how to improve the appearance of all operating . Keep contributing this valuable information . <p> Thanks so much for posting all of this information . I recently started a blog , and I have a lot to figure out ( ! ) , so these kinds of tips are incredibly valuable to me . I especially love the WordPress plugin recommendations , as plugins can be pretty overwhelming to sift through . <p> I was torn between using Bluehost and Arvixe , but eventually ended up going with Arvixe . Its slightly more expensive per month , but they let me pay for just the first 6 months up front , and they seem to have mixed but overall decent reviews ( as does Bluehost ) . <p> Anyway , thanks again ! Im having a lot of fun with my blog , and you 've given me a lot of new ideas for how to improve and expand it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can say , that was the biggest turning point of my life , as I started with the best platform on the planet . <p> Starting a blog might be an easy task but managing it and continuing it seriously a daunting task . I have seen many bloggers starting with enthusiasm , writing for few months , and then stopped blogging because they were not making any money . <p> Your guide can show them right path who are still struggling to find the right recipes to make a perfect blog . <p> Hi , another option to make money at home that you did n't  include in your list would be to use paid surveys . I spend about an hour each day completing surveys online and I make between $350-$500 a month . Not bad when you consider this is just meant to be some additional income on the side . Here is the site i use for those of you that are interested **30;250;TOOLONG <p> Great article , thanks for the primer , and thanks for the review of Republic Wireless that 's how I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving eyeballs to an established blog ? Just cant seem to get my views over the 30-50 visits per day hump . I 'd really like to take it to the next level and start monetizing it , but without readers it seems a little pointless . Ive tried cross-posting on similar blogs and forums , which helps , but I 'm not putting up huge numbers after more than two years of effort . Any tips ? <p> Thanks for putting this together . I started my second blog a few months ago , and its been a slower process than I expected after ending my first one a few years ago . So much has changed on the technology side , and rebuilding a network along with links and readers is surprisingly tedious . Great tip on not over-posting in the beginning when you have no readers . One way I 'm dealing with that is to share older posts on Facebook periodically to get them seen by more people . <p> Hey Jacob , Really enjoyed reading through this late tonight . Vickie and I are looking at several online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing well . If you have a moment , the website cityofnovinger.com is the first website I have designed from start to finish . Although not fully completed ! See what ya think . look forward to reading more ! <p> I started off with tumblr . During the initial stage , it was like a trial and error . I used lots of domain names before I reached to the one I needed to stick to . My first blog was like a personal blog and a form of entertainment which enabled me to have some fun . More importantly , I did n't  know that it would bring me some passive income . <p> Thanks for the thoughtful and honest post about blogging . I 'm just starting out myself , and fortunately I 've pretty much been following your advice as it is . Like you , I 've started out by putting a few Adsense placements , but I do n't  expect much from those until I get some significant traffic ( maybe in a few months ) . I 'd like to get on with affiliate marketing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require you to already have a large amount of traffic . Have you come across any affiliate marketing sites that will work with low volume bloggers , or is it standard practice to require high volume ? <p> I 'm not sure about Canadian opportunities , but the affiliate networks I list are what we use . I think its becoming normal to require traffic before affiliate approval . There has definitely been a progression towards that since we began . <p> I use to blog a long time ago and wish I would have never stopped . I really enjoy blogging and writing . I appreciate your tips and advice . I came across your blog through another blog and feel that this could really do me and others a lot of good to continue to read it . I know that this comment sounds more like a menu review but , I really like what I have read so far . <p> Jacob , Thanks for the recommendations for Bluehost and MyThemeShop I literally reworked my entire website last night and this morning and moved hosts and put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work but I 'm finally happy with the look of my site ( excluding the lack of header of course ) I was struggling with my site speed through HostGator and they essentially told me I was crazy , but this Bluehost hosted site is flying now ! Out of curiosity , how do you activate the Facebook , Twitter , etc. buttons in the top right of your header ? Thanks ! <p> Very comprehensive for sure . I wish I had of originally found this when I started writing .. for some reason I thought blogger was the way to go . Glad I made the move over to wordpress and a hosted blog just took way too long . <p> Great post . Love all the resources , very helpful . Becoming a blogger has been a great experience for me . Meeting other bloggers and networking , developing a writing style , and becoming more dedicated at my craft have all been incredibly useful benefits . <p> I had Akismet for a while , but never got around to activating it . The amount of spam has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nudge ! And CommentLuv is one Ive really enjoyed on other sites , so I just installed that one as well . Thanks for the great suggestions ! <p> Hello Jacob ! We are rather new to this whole thing too , and we 've learned so much . Your post is so comprehensive that anyone who reads it who is not a blogger will soon be one ! <p> I love the part about being accountable , open , honest , etc . You have to be real or people will quickly figure you out . It is like when your mom says , Are you telling me the truth ? when she knows damn well you 're lying . Add value and be yourself , and you will find your niche . I do n't  think we should try to be anyone were not ! <p> I see you mentioned writing an e-book . We would love to read it when you do ! <p> I struggle with the " niche " idea Ive even drafted a post on it . I think its easier to monetize your blog if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish as regularly if I put myself in a box . And the two blogs I like the most , do share more than themed content , and I appreciate that . Perhaps I wont make millions ( hahaha given I earn a tidy salary as it is ) , but I only blog for the enjoyment , so I 'm ok with that ! <p> These are awesome tips ! I blog for part of my day job and have also had a personal blog for five years , and I wish I had known much of this when I started . When I started , I really just wanted to document our home renovation never knowing that it would become such a cool part of my life and introduce me in person and digitally to such awesome people . <p> Anyhoo , I was actually hired to teach a class recently on blogging , and I 'm thinking I missed some important points that you opened my eyes to . <p> Wow ! This may be the best post Ive seen on the topic , so comprehensive and exhaustive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure and has brought us closer together because we blog together and have learned things about each other that we did not know even after 15 years of marriage . Weve been forced to think deeper and talk more and more openly . <p> Writing a book together even exploded our marriage further ! ! ! But book writing is only for the clinically insane . <p> I second the thought on blogging making one a better thinker . I know it has broadened my horizons because it exposes me to both sides of an argument . Its comfortable to surround myself with people who think the same way I do , but that can be dangerous as one can become complacent . Blogging challenges me to consider different perspectives . <p> Nice breakdown Jacob ! These are all great tips and I could not agree more with the passion &amp; content . I think that is really what helps you as a blogger stand out from the crowd . People do not want to read dull and boring content , but they want something engaging . Its that passion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading it what they really care about . <p> Excellent post ! Very timely for me as a newbie . It is definitely a steep learning curve and I am not that tech savvy . How did you learn the ins and outs of WordPress when you started out ? Ive been trying to improve the appearance and figure out how it all works . <p> Awesome post . I started my blog because of many of the reasons you stated above . Its such a great learning experience and its a fun hobby . It can take up quite a bit of time , but as long as you enjoy it that time is not going to waste . I used very similar steps to the ones above when I began my blog , its very simple . <p> Another fabulous post Jacob , I appreciate your writing this . I totally agree with you with so many of these reasons that you mentioned . I am kinda at a cross-roads with my site , I wan na grow it because I thoroughly enjoy it , however finding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this that act as a reminder that what I writing is hopefully providing value to someone and for that , I am inspired . So thanks for writing and inspiring me ! <p> I really like how you 've laid out the how tos of getting started . I have had similar experience in the amount of time and what I find rewarding . <p> I especially agree about finding your voice . I know in my short amount of time , I started off trying to be a bit too nice , but the more I have let my personality come through , the more interaction and positive response I have received . I guess the lesson there is no one responds to generic . <p> For me blogging has been a rewarding experience as well as a huge learning curve . If I 'd have read this post 12 months ago I 'm sure things would have been a lot more straight forward . Great info Jacob . 
@@44824251 @4824251/ <h> What do you Mean " Why are Gas Prices so High ? " <p> People love to complain about the price of gasoline in America . Gas prices are the new weather , and what better way to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger than to begin talking about- something we can all agree to hate ? <p> " Why are gas prices so high ? " , " Those Middle Eastern countries are just gouging us these days ! " , - and- " I cant afford to drive anywhere with these gas prices . " are a few of the common complaints youve probably heard this week . <p> I 'm completely dumbfounded , shocked , and in pain when- I hear these types of statements . here 's why . <p> First of all , The U.S has some of the cheapest gas in the world . Many other developed countries pay far more than we do per gallon . Still somehow , Americans expect $0.99/gallon gasoline to make its return . <p> But of course , trying to explain to someone that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . Especially when Mr. President gets on the boob tube and complains right along with them . Because of course , he relates with the " struggling middle class . " <p> What 's even more difficult is trying to stomach those silly complaints while staring at their vehicle . Its usually a 4,000+ pound mammoth that gets 12 MPG . <p> Surely you know what I 'm referring to here , its always the giant elephant in the room during those cheesy CNBC interviews . The reporter , who obviously either cant find a real story or is n't allowed , interviews an individual ( well call him Joe ) who screams about the cost to fill up with gas . Something like " Its costing me $65 per week to fill up these days ! Who can afford that ? ! Im having to choose between gas and food on the table ! Somethings got to be done to remedy these high prices ! ! " <p> At that point , I 'm always like " Cmon- Joe , you drive an SUV to work every day that seats 8- people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're complaining because it eats gasoline ? " <p> Do you see the problem here ? If not , I 'll tell you . The problem is that- gas prices are n't  high enough . <h> Why Are Gas Prices So High ? <p> Let 's first talk about why gas prices have gone up quite a bit- in the last 10 years . <p> Ultra cheap oil and energy subsidies caused much of this problem . While oil prices were so low , for so many years , the U.S. consumed , and in massive amounts . Entire cities , perhaps an entire economy , was built on cheap oil . We consumed as if oil reserves were infinite , and pricing was fixed . <p> Many of our American cities are extremely spread out , and gasoline waste is UNBELIEVABLY high . People refuse to think about their driving habits and the associated price tag . For example , some common American behaviors : <p> Want a snack ? Just jump in the car and drive 5- miles each way . <p> Need groceries ? Just get them ! Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and time ? <p> Want to shop ? Go now . Its only 10 miles . Who cares if you will be on that side of town tomorrow or not . <p> Ca n't stand driving a little car ? Buy an SUV or truck you will absolutely never need . Who cares about the MPG ? <p> Consumption and demand began rising quickly , and that trend spread across the globe . The world was hungry for oil , and willing to pay . Worldwide demand has continued to rise quickly . <p> Gasoline pricing is often whack . Hedge funds , futures , and market speculation has caused price increases. - Also important to note , is the fact that a few key players control much of the production and pricing of oil and gasoline . Price manipulation is part of the game . <p> Stepping back a little , we can also see that gasoline is a finite resource . Its going to run out . That 's inevitable . I do n't  know when , and I do n't  care , but realize that it wont last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that world consumption continues to rise , while global production has its limits . That means increased demand will continue pushing prices higher in the long run . <p> The United States does produce some oil , and that production has actually been increasing . But prices will remain high . We have infrastructure issues in dealing with refining shale oil , and I really do n't  see increased domestic supply having much impact on the price at the pump. - For now , you 're going to pay the price that is produced by worldwide demands . <p> Even if we drill and produce more domestic oil , or if Congress found a new way to suppress prices at the pump , its a temporary band-aid . Oil is still being depleted , and lower prices just encourage more consumption , which fuels the whole cycle . Cheaper prices and more consumption wont solve anything in the long term . <h> Why I Want Gas Prices to go Higher <p> Shocking , right ? I think higher prices can result in positive changes . <p> If prices continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentional and rational decisions that limit their gasoline consumption . <p> The ridiculous gas guzzling automobile market would shrink , while demand for smaller , more efficient automobiles would boom . I like efficient , and I like more used car options . <p> People would walk and bike more , resulting in pleasant interactions and better overall health . They would have less stress , less traffic , less road rage . <p> Cities would become more efficiently designed , and probably less spread out . They would also be forced to produce roads that are actually bike friendly due to increased demand . ( Our city does n't  even have sidewalks available on some main roads . What a joke . ) Public transportation use would increase , resulting in more options , more routes , and cheaper pricing . <p> Let 's take it a little further still . <p> How about higher gasoline taxes to further decrease consumption further and boost tax revenues ? Instead of road repairs , what about putting the newly found money in education or healthcare ? <h> Stop Complaining <p> Its important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . You control how much you spend . <p> Going back to the Joes beginning question , " Why are gas prices so high ? " The problem is n't the pricing , the problem is Joe . <p> Regarding the latter , I 've already posted a detailed guide on Hypermiling , - so you may want to refer to that article- for a multitude of ideas- that will improve your gas mileage . <p> After changing your driving habits , change your vehicle . 5 People or less can easily fit into a car that gets 35 MPG or better on the highway . Get rid of your truck , SUV , van , or whatever you own that is sucking gas . ( unless you actually need a truck to haul stuff multiple times per week ) <p> I have no respect for complaining individuals who drive massive , wasteful vehicles . I see it every single day . Two small people driving one enormous vehicle that could house a small army of passengers . <p> Why on earth would a couple ever cruise around town in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsepower engine to transport 300 pounds of flesh . Oh wait , I forgot to mention the 5,000 pound steel box they are also lugging around . These same people even have the audacity to complain about gas prices ! Can you imagine ? <p> Speaking of waste , stop driving around town to entertain yourself and kill time . Its costing you a fortune . Get a hobby , like reading , and do all your errands in one night . <p> We own one car , and we fill it up once every couple of weeks . I ride the bus every day for free to school and work . Which reminds me of an amazing story . Our college automatically pays for all students to ride the bus through a small fee charged each semester . So you have to pay it , and all bus fare is FREE . I 'm the only student I know who consistently rides . And most days the bus is empty . <p> That 's how I know gas prices are not high enough . <p> Please , stop this madness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high ? " tell them that they are n't  high enough ! 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Amy <p> I think that gas prices are crazy cheap , I have for years . I did n't  see how they could possibly be as cheap , but with the explanation above with the subsidies it makes sense . I spent most of my life in a place where there was no public transportation and there werent places to walk safely . I commuted far distances for college because it was cheaper for me as a single Mom to commute 75.3 miles each way than to move to school . I tried living near campus . With the higher rent and daycare near the school was 3 times what I was paying previously we moved back home and I commuted . <p> When I moved for graduate school part of choosing a grad school was a place that had public transportation , I could bike and I could walk . When I met my husband 6 years ago we started sharing my car . We tried the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had been talking about selling our van to save more money . During that 2 year span of 2 vehicles with gas , insurance and two payments we were spending $1100 a month , that was more than our rent , utilities , internet and cell phones combined . When our van was totaled in a head on collision at the end of Nov 2011 thanks to the crappy driving of an unlicensed uninsured driver we decided not to replace it . We did n't  want the extra cost . My husband uses the car to get to/from work which is 6 miles round trip . Most of the other things we need to do we walk or bike to . <p> Wow , that is such a long drive ! You obviously thought it through , but wow ! And equally stunning is the $1100/month on vehicles , although I know many who spend much more . Your current situation reminds me a lot of our own . Shared vehicle and the wife takes it to work and back as I ride the bus . Sorry about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely infuriates me ! We visited Belize one time on vacation and we had this amazing tour guide and he asked the group of us to just pepper him with questions about his country . Literally the very first question someone asked was " how much does gas cost ? " Absolutely ridiculous ! ! <p> I know people who will wait on line for 20 minutes at a gas station on the New Jersey Turnpike to save 10 cents a gallon over New York prices . Is your time worth that little that you want to save $2 so desperately ? Just do n't  order a soda the next time you gorge yourself at a restaurant and there 's your $2 . <p> And you 're absolutely right that higher gas prices would lead to better behavior and maybe some positive results for the world . I surely would like to be less reliant on foreign oil <p> " But prices will remain high . We have infrastructure issues in dealing with refining shale oil , and I really do n't see increased domestic supply having much impact on the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the price that is produced by worldwide demands . " 3 <p> Exactly . Our oil is sold on the worldwide market . If we pumped 150% of the oil we needed , it would n't change the price much . Other nations/OPEC would just pump less to keep prices low . <p> The only countries with low gas prices are socialist places like Venezuela who do n't  play by our rules . <p> I cant stand it when people complain about this . I see kids driving to high school in V-8 , full size pick up trucks . Grrrrrr ! ! ! <p> Yes ! Canadian gas prices are substantially higher than the US , however pretty much free compared to many developed countries . I also hate it when people complain about them here and then drive F-350s and such , because they " need " them to pull their 25 ' trailers and wakeboard boats . I could also rant on this topic for quite awhile . <p> Couldnt agree with you more either ! I totally think prices need to be WAY higher an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV series called $10 a litre for petrol . He thinks that 's a truer cost , and currently drives an electric vehicle , which is NOT carbon neutral ( he acknowledge this ) as it needs power , and the power in Australia is n't close to 100% renewable ( and realistically , no wheres is ! ) <p> The SUV market is huge particularly in the US , but its growing here in Australia , as its easier to get kids in and out of what I call pretend 4WDs . I just cant work out why you 'd pay so much for the car , and then so much to run it ! Its obscene . As to what I do well I drive to and from work , thanks to the work car ( I 'm sure you recall ) . They are threatening to take them away , and I 'm at peace with it itll force me onto the train . I 'd train now , but no cost car vs paying for train , well its hard to compare . But in my personal life , I walk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( but I could ) . I do n't  think oh , I 'll jump in the car . And when I do have a car ( like borrowed from my brother ) , I really plan my trips to be efficient and things near each other go together . Thanks for a great post <p> I 'd love to check out that show ! Its amazing that the SUV market is growing elsewhere . I think it should just DIE . You have a sweet situation , but it sounds like you are really wise about your transportation choices . Cheers to that ! <p> Our gas prices are nothing really compared to European prices . Its nearly $10 a gallon in UK , close to $9 in Italy and $8 in Switzerland ! And its been like that for many years . No wonder everyone likes walking and biking over there . Its free and you wo n't see any overweight people . We should follow their example . Even better , switch to smaller hybrid cars to protect our environment as well . <p> Ahh I 'm afraid to burst your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UK , and plenty who like their gas guzzlers . Its just not quite on the same scale as in the US ( I think ! ) . <p> Walking to the train station every morning I see hundreds of cars with just one person in them . I bet a large proportion are commuting less than a couple of miles to work . Its anecdotal of course but I would say that SUV type vehicles are getting more common as well . <p> I think you are right that other European countries are much more walking and bike orientated , Denmark and the Netherlands for example . But UK is on a mission to copy our American cousins as best as possible it seems , all the while complaining about high gas prices ! <p> I still think they are not high enough here , because people still drive inefficient and far too large cars for their needs , and I refuse to believe that if the price was n't actually " too high " that people are really that dumb enough to not think seriously how to get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle ) <p> The good news is of course that cars are getting more efficient on the whole due to legislation , and there are more and more folk like those who read these blogs who actually give a shit about this stuff , and I think that movement/sentiment is growing . It just takes some people longer to get with the programme I guess ( and I think there will always be a smaller number of people who are hard wired to be wasteful/idiots ) <p> And brilliant post Jacob , I could n't have written this better myself . Thanks ! <p> CatMan ( my better half ) did a study of gas prices several years ago . His conclusion was that when you figure in things like subsidies to oil companies , environmental clean up costs , costs of protecting oil infrastructure etc , were already paying close to $18/gallon for gas we just do n't  see it because the vast majority of the cost is paid for with our tax dollars . here 's his breakdown : <p> Do n't  want to get too political here , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the things were willing to subsidize with our tax dollars . Somehow making sure that poor children can eat and that insurance companies cant withhold treatment to their customers is " socialism " but its perfectly OK to subsidize some dudes monster truck ! <p> Wow , thanks for such a great first comment ! We are super glad you found us ! Those numbers are crazy , huh ! Subsidies are incredibly inconsistent , and that 's the problem . Maybe they ought to disappear entirely ? <p> I drive to workand it is a bit of a long commute , but other than that , I generally walk or take public transportation . They need better public transportation in some neighborhoods though to reduce the demand for driving . I agree that we have cheap gas prices compared to other countries so there really is nothing to complain about . <p> The wierd thing is that I live closer to the city where there is good public transportation but I work in the suburbs . I 'd take the train to work but the schedule is kinda crazy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer to work , I 'd drive less for work but then more to visit family and to run errands . <p> Right on , brother ! We can certainly afford to see prices rise as we use little gas and drive a Fit . Let those who deserve it suffer the natural consequences . And love how you offer suggestions for saving on gas after chiding ridiculous gas consumption ; ) A robust post to say the least . <p> A friend once told me that I 'm an impatient driver because I switch lanes to go around a turning vehicle . They did n't  understand that I do it to avoid braking because stop and go driving wastes more gas than maintaining your speed . <p> I 'm in an area heavily populated by military people from all over the world . Aside from Maryland drivers , it seems military people have the worst driving habitsalways in a hurry to get to that next red light , weaving in and out of traffic trying to find the fast lane . I often say this in my car when I see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red light . " I need a bumper sticker ! <p> Ive experience that same thing . Its even worse when you slowly coast to red lights and the passenger does n't  know how to handle slow speeds and impatient drivers riding my bumper ! I see a lot of that here as well . Often those people also drive huge vehicles , which is just way too funny . <p> I suspect that Americans are really asking " why are gas prices so high , when we are now a major exporter of product drilled from our land and refined here and when we now have a glut . " And the answer is simply oil company profits . Normally , in periods of excess , the product drops .. Simple Econ 101 . That does n't  happen for US oil/gasoline though . The ore obvious proof of this was when an oil exec was asked why gasoline refined in Richmond , CA was considerably more expensive than the same gasoline that had to be trucked several hours to Modesto and Merced ( both of which had no refineries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond , but not in the poorer farm areas . In other words , the oil companies determine who much gas goes forand they make greater and greater profits each year doing so . <p> A further couple of commentsYes , Europe charges more for gas , mainly as a factor of higher taxes .. but there are many countries that do not have refineries , where gas can be had for under a dollar per gallon : Bahrain , Kuwait , Qataretc .. etc .. <p> And yes , I agree that gas should be higher to curtail driving , but not until we have a functional mass transit system like Europe so people can make it to work . The main reason we have a car culture , is that we need cars to get around . Blithely saying people should bike more works only if you live in metropolitan areas .. and that 's really a small part of the US . For example , where I live ( Grass valley ) , it takes about 5 hours and $60 one way to get downtown Sacramento , CA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gas each way . I do n't  do the drive often , but many have to for various reasons . And this is the main reason why I 'm against spending $68 Billion on a high speed train from San Francisco to Anaheim . It would be considerably better for our working citizens to expand BART throughout the State , so we could release our dependence on cars . <p> Hey John , thank you for taking the time to submit such a thoughtful response . First of all , I stand by the fact that the U.S. has cheap gas prices . Sure , you can name a few with cheaper prices , but I can name far more countries that are more expensive . I wo n't dispute price manipulation if the oil market , and I agree that a few huge players have far too much influence , but there are many problems in the U.S. oil game that you left out . It s not as simple as increased supply = lower pricing . Much of our oil is better refined elsewhere , and our infrastructure sucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdated and its expensive to get the finished product . In addition , the renewable fuels standards are affecting pricing levels . <p> More importantly , I think you missed the real thrust of my argument . Its not that everyone can eliminate oil consumption right now , on a whim ( Although most could cut consumption drastically ) . Its that people are WASTEFUL beyond belief . The want to complain about pricing when they willingly spend a fortune on gasoline , driving a 2.5 ton box of steel in an irresponsible manor . <p> LOVE this post . I have heard , but do n't  fully understand it , that gas is expensive because its price is not reflected in use , but by the buying and selling of oil futures/speculation . I read about it first in a Delta Sky Magazine editorial written by the owner of Delta . He mentioned something about how the market for futures is so unregulated that folks who have no business in the fuel business are making profits off the back of businesses where fuel costs are a significant portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better across the US so more people could ride a bus on their work commutes . I grew up in Dallas , Tx which had a pretty decent public transit system for a town west of the Missippi . Yet suburbs could VOTE OUT of paying into the system and NEVER get any public transit ! So how are those towns supposed to get workers for their service industry ? ( one in particular is a well-to-do suburb ) . Are all their teenagers supposed to do all the work ? Because no adult should not have a car in their eyes ! <p> Its unfortunate that we live in such a car-heavy culture that anyone who chooses to be economical with their driving , ride a bike , or ride public transit is less than a person who gets a gas guzzling hummer . <p> Thanks for reading and commenting Tara ! Hedge fund money and futures are impacting pricing . Its a complex situation , but maybe I 'll be able to write about it in the future . Public transportation is terrible in so many places ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its impossible to ride a bike on our roads . Its really sad that our local infrastructure supports irresponsible consumption in the manor that it does . Thanks for sharing your thoughts ! <p> Great post Jacob . I 'm absolutely with you , gas prices should be higher . It would drive efficiency and decrease waste . The other thing that people do n't  seem to understand is that oil is a global commodity . Even if we produce more oil than we can use here in the US , Iran shutting down a refinery is still going to have the same effect to oil prices . There 's no such thing as " energy independent " . Unless of course you 're on solar and batteries <p> Completely agree as well ! My old car got 21.3 MPG , which was not enough . I sold it when I moved to DC . Now , I do miss having a car and expect to own one within the next year or two , but it will have excellent fuel economy , will be purchased in cash , and will only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have the option of parking in the building or getting transit subsidy . On the Metro I go ! <p> TOTALLY agree ! We have the cheapest gas in the world and whine about it the most . I will cut a tiny bit of slack to very low income people who grew up inheriting 50 years of car-oriented infrastructure in this country so we need cars much more than people elsewhere . And , unfortunately , the cheaper housing is usually farther from work centers . But generally that 's not an excuse . Move , find the bus lines , carpool , whatever , but all the whining is silly . <p> I completely agree , Jacob . Higher prices are a great motivator . The government has noticed this and attached a sin tax to cigarettes as a way to kill two birds with one stone : generate revenue , and discourage bad behavior ( smoking ) . The same could be accomplished with gasoline , as long as our representatives did n't  mind losing badly in their next election . <p> We purchased our scooter back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4.00 a gallon . That was the most obvious impact that gas prices had on our behavior , though we still have a little Matrix that we try to use as infrequently &amp; efficiently as we can . <p> We have two Vino 125cc scooters , and would highly recommend them . They are reliable and perfect if your area is mostly flat . However , if its particularly hilly , you may want to consider a 150cc scooter . <p> The second scooter was a bit of an impulse purchase , as someone listed it on Craigslist in near new condition , with less than 1000 miles , for $850 . We snapped it up that day but obviously do n't  need a second scooter . We figure we pre-emptively purchased the replacement scooter for when our original one dies . Or so we tell ourselves <p> Very cool , and that sounds like a steal ? I really want a smaller 50cc model to avoid taxes , registration , insurance , etc . I 've owned 3 motorcycles and I miss riding . The last model was a newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thing ! I may email you asking about your take on brands , pricing , etc . Thanks for the help ! <p> Yeah a 49cc scooter kind of fits into a weird loophole where you can ride it on the street without any license , but can park it on some sidewalks like a bike ( depending on local laws ) . They 're pretty sweet if your neighborhood is flat and you can get around on streets w/a 30 mph limit .

Let 's start with the dorm list . Oh boy . What do you need when you go to college ? What should you leave at home to get later ? What will even fit inside a tiny dorm room ? Will your roommate think your **30;282;TOOLONG collection is dorky ? A million questions are racing through your head as you prepare to move out of your home and into the dorms for your first year of college . <p> And let me guess , you and your parents have been to Bed , Bath , and Beyond about 20 times since you graduated high school . I mean , you need a whole new bedroom set to be successful in college , right ? You NEED and new bedspread , new sheets , new mini fridge , - a new alarm clock , and a new rug for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new tv for the dorm room . You 'll need a new calendar , folders , pens , pencils , erasers , and notebook paper . And last , but not least of all , you 'll need a shower caddy , towels , washcloths , flip flops , and new shampoo/conditioner/body wash for your daily trip to the communal bathroom . <p> Never mind that you own most of this stuff already . Its old and ugly . You need something new and shiny , right ? <p> WRONG . <p> I know it is tempting to look at the advertisements geared toward college students and think that you NEED all of that junk to move in . It looks so nice and the advertisements do a pretty good job of convincing you that in order to have the real college experience , you need to go all out . This , however , is a fallacy . Your old stuff will do just fine . <p> What you actually need for college is pretty simple . Ill break it down for you into categories and hopefully guide you toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . <h> Bathroom : <p> What you already have : <p> A couple shower towels and washcloths <p> Shampoo , conditioner , soap ( if you do n't  have this already , check out the dollar store . ) <p> Flip flops <p> - What you may need : <p> Shower caddy : - only if you have a communal bathroom , and you do n't  already have a small bag that will work . I 'd also suggest going to your local thrift store to see if you can find a washable bag for less . Also , recyclable grocery bags work as well for a bathroom tote . These range from $1-$3 . I would n't pay more than that . <h> Bedroom : <p> What you already have : <p> Pillow/pillowcases <p> Bedspread ( use a blanket ) <p> Sheets ( even if they are for - a bigger bed , you can tuck them in around the corners . Not a big deal ) <p> Pictures/posters <p> Lamp <p> Alarm clock <p> What you may need : <p> Mattress topper : Dorm beds can be uncomfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you sleep better at night . However , I would wait until you got there and tried the bed out before you spend the money . <h> Kitchen : <p> What you already have : <p> Plates : You will only need one or two . Just keep washing it after you use it to avoid buildup of dirty dishes. - If you do n't  have any already , and mom wont give you some old ones , try the dollar store or a local thrift shop . <p> Forks/spoons : Same advice as with the plates . Either borrow or buy super cheap . <p> Napkins : If you do n't  have these , then stock up next time you 're at a fast food joint . <p> Microwave : might be available to you in your dorm <p> What you may need : <p> Mini fridge : - This may come with your dorm room , but it may not . Decide if you can live without it or not . If you do buy one , try Craigslist for the best buy . <h> - School Supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pencils : Come on . They pass those things out for free EVERYWHERE on campus . Just keep an eye out for them . <p> Erasers : Again , keep an eye out for abandoned erasers . Or ask the janitor if they have any extras . Youd be surprised by all the treasures the janitors have . <p> Backpack : Just use your old one . You do n't  need a new backpack for college . <p> What you may need : <p> Notebook paper : This is only if you do n't  like to take notes on your computer . Some teachers still do n't  allow laptops in their classrooms , so make sure you always have some notebook paper . Check your local dollar store or Walmart for the cheapest prices . <p> So , if you buy all the things you do n't  have , including the items that you may not even need , like a mattress topper or mini fridge , you would pay less than $100 for the whole shebang . So be wise when moving into the dorms . Use your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really NEED an item before you pay for a new one . All your " new " college stuff will be old and heavily used after you graduate anyway , so do n't  spend too much time or money stocking your dorm room . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Mr. Bonner <p> If only we could get this message out to all those soon-to-be college students ! Just kidding , great post ! I think most of us would be in a better place today if we were reading info like this at 18 = <p> I like the list . I never hung out with people that bought the best and most expensive , so that helped me keep my costs down . I agree with you that if you can avoid the dorm altogether , do it . I went to a small school that made it mandatory to live on campus the first year and have the 3 meal a day meal plan . What college student do you know that is up for breakfast ? ! <p> I was an RA my junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living off-campus and getting a part time job to cover the rent with roommates . <p> I 've still got my college ( we call it Uni in Australia ) doona cover which I use for the guest mattress , along with the sheet set ( seeing nothing since then has been twin bed sized ) . Luckily , the appliance like things I did n't  need til last year when I bought my own place rentals and downs had them . <p> My eraser pen , I 've had since 2003 ! True story I used to lose the little cube like ones , but this one has never strayed from me = And I 'm constantly widdling down my pen collection ( two pen jars and a mini drawer of them at home , two jars at work ) . One day I dream of only one type of pen in the jar like at stationary stores . Sigh . <p> Great tips , Vanessa . Advertisers do an excellent job of making us want to fill our dorm room with all new stuff . But as you point out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great day to help furnish some of the necessities that you do n't  have or are frankly cheaper to buy new than ship . We did end up with new bedding , mostly because Mom would n't let us take our nice bedding to college . Probably a smart move on her part . = <p> Great tips Vanessa ! I tried to cut corners as much as I could when living in my dorm as the cost was way too high as it was . I lived in a suite style dorm where I had a roommate and we shared a bathroom with another 2 person room as well as a few other things . We shared a lot of things and I bought a used mini fridge which I was able to turn around and sell when I moved out . <p> These are great tips . Its amazing how much money is spent in getting things for a dorm room when you already have the majority of the things you need . I agree that you may not need a lot of things , but its fun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorm room . <p> Well done , Vanessa ! ! ! Wish I had this post when I was going off to college . I am sure I brought too much crap with me . Clutter at college is a huge no-no . The focus absolutely must be on getting really good at what you are there to study and not on stuff . My room was a lot like a hotel when we go on a hiking vacation , as it our wont . It was used to sleep and get dressed because I was out practicing guitar , going to class and socializing all day . No need to make a dorm room into an arcade full of useless and very distracting junk ! ! ! <p> A nice piece of plywood can help alot . The dorm I stayed in at school was used by the football team in the summer . They can destroy the crappy springs that hold the matress . Putting a piece of plywood down helps firm up the bed a little bit ( I like a nice firm matress ) . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorm room and they kept me from moving in early ( which I was n't going to do anyways ) I got free season tickets so it was totally worth it . It also helped we made it to the Rose Bowl while I was there . <p> ITA that college students tend to overbuy items for their dorm rooms , and the BBB lists do n't  help at all ! But again , for the sake of diversity , I want to point out here that not everyone attends college within driving distance of their parents house . For many cheap items , its more expensive to fly or ship them than to buy them ( new or used ) after arriving at college . Having to fit everything into 2 suitcases to take with me to school and then not having access to a car while there started me down a minimalist path , which was awesome ! I really had to prioritize , which meant that I brought **30;314;TOOLONG items with me and bought stuff like sheets and plates when I arrived . <p> Another tip is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted a minifridge and microwave ( not available to us otherwise ) so one of us bought one and one bought the other .

Power and Associates Online Investor Satisfaction Study. - Scottrade has also been ranked in Fortunes annual " 100 Best Companies to Work For " each of the last 6 years . <h> Scottrade Pricing <p> Scottrade is primarily an online brokerage firm , and the pricing is middle of the road . There are lower cost brokerages offering similar services , but there are also more expensive options . Here is the schedule of fees from the Scottrade site : <p> Stocks and ETFs : flat $7.00 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract <p> Trading Platforms : Free <p> Research : Free <p> Data : Free <h> Scottrade Features <p> Multiple Account Options : You can easily open single or joint accounts online in minutes .

As I said , most trades are a flat $7 and the minimum to open an account is $500 , which is quite low . There are no inactivity fees or other ridiculous charges that I have found . <p> Easy Trading Platform : Scottrade offers a relatively simple trading platform that allows simplified trading of securities . They offer a more advanced Scottrade Elite platform for members who have $25,000 or more in their account . <p> Mobile Support : Scottrade has a great platform for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets . If you have internet access you can trade , check updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device .

@@44824261 @4824261/ <h> Were Done Christmas Shopping in July . <p> And not to rub it in or anything , but our holiday season is going to be , like , so stress free . <p> Wan na know how we did it ? <p> Of course you do . <p> So we 'll give you an early Christmas present ; our top secret strategy to being done Christmas shopping by July . <p> 1 . Shop the day after Christmas . <p> While you just started thinking about Christmas shopping when you saw the title of this article , we 've been thinking about Christmas constantly . Not that we are Christmas fanatics or anything . We just love a good deal . <p> And when is the best time of the year to get a deal ? Nope , not Black Friday . <p> The day after Christmas of course . We were halfway done shopping for Christmas 2014 on December 26 , 2013 . <p> We take advantage of the fact that stores are trying to get rid of their holiday inventory . This results in radical markdowns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year we had the best luck at Bed Bath and Beyond and Walmart . <p> BONUS : - When you go to Walmart right after Christmas , buy items when the sales are 50-60% off . Then , when sale prices go to 70-80% off , return the item and buy it back immediately with the new sale price . This ensures that you 'll get the items you want , and at the price that 's super- low . <p> 2 . Only shop the clearance rack . <p> Whenever you 're out and about , always check the clearance rack . By constantly looking for a deal , you 'll run across gifts for the loved ones in your life . <p> We go shopping on Sundays because we like to get some exercise and scour for deals . Every store we go into , we head straight for the clearance rack . If we see something that 's a good deal , and we do n't need it for ourselves , we try to think of someone else that would be excited about the gift . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gummy candies on sale for $1 for each bag . We do n't eat too much candy , but we do have to buy a gift for my brother . So guess who is getting a box full of gummies for Christmas ? He 'll be pumped , and the candy will be gone within the week . I guarantee it . <p> 3 . Do n't be selfish. - <p> I eluded to this in #2 , but I guess I 'll just come right out and say it . <p> Stop being selfish . <p> When you 're looking at sales racks , do n't just look for yourself . <p> I have a tendency to only look for things I want , and definitely do n't need . But Jacob has me trained to look at a clearance rack as an opportunity to mark some names off our Christmas list . I 'm kidding myself if I think I need anything else , but what we do need is a nice gift at a rock bottom price . <p> 4 . Garage sale it . <p> We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales . We get some super nice stuff , too . In fact , the last garage sale gift we gave was met with overwhelming enthusiasm . <p> Refer to #3 , and do n't be selfish when you 're at a garage sale- too . Keep an eye out for the stragglers on your list that might be hard to buy for . <p> We never know what to get Jacob 's brothers for Christmas , but if we keep our eyes peeled at garage sales , we sometimes come across a gift that is- unexpectedly perfect . <p> 5 . Stalk dealnews , Slickdeals , and Kmart/Sears . <p> Jacob is a daily dealnews- stalker . You have to check it in the morning , otherwise the really good deals are gone , but we have gotten some great deals by keeping up with this site . They do all the hard work , which is actually finding the deals , and their readers capitalize . <p> Slickdeals is an online forum for frugal people . You can find trending deals from all over the net , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kmart and Sears will give you Shop Your Way points like crazy for 3 months if you sign up for the VIP membership . You will usually only accumulate under $6 in free points at one time , but if you use those points to shop the clearance section online or in store , you can get items completely for free . <p> In fact , this past Sunday , Jacob got 2 pairs of jeans for free . They were marked down to $20 , were over 90% off clearance price , and he had $6 in free points to cover the $3 that he needed for the jeans . This time we werent shopping for someone else because , well were done Christmas shopping ! ( Sorry . I just had to say it one more time . ) However , you can use Shop Your Way points to buy for someone else , no problem . <p> How close are you to being done Christmas shopping ? Do you have any top secret techniques for Christmas shopping on the cheap ? 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are going to need or want for the next Christmas ? <p> I always tell myself Ill shop for Christmas early to avoid the late-season chaos , but it never seems to happen ! Recently , Ive become incredibly disenfranchised with how consumer-oriented Christmas has become . Its not fun anymore as grown-ups , its hard to spend money on a gift just because that 's what 's expected to happen during the holidays . My husband and I are gifting ourselves with zero car payments this year our car will be paid off in November . As for everyone else , they 're likely getting gift cards ( which I buy at a discount ) . The rest of my budget is going toward food bags for the food bank and other causes that actually need things ! <p> Christmas in July .. what a great idea ! I usually do last-minute Christmas shopping and it is so stressful but of course a bit fun . However , I do agree that the earlier you shop the more time you can compare prizes , the higher the available discounts are and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoy Christmas more . <p> If you like the rush of waiting til the last minute , you can still have it . Just buy stuff ahead of time to save money , and then try to remember where you put it the hour before it needs to be wrapped and under the tree . Same rush , just cheaper . = <p> Congrats on already being done ! You can get such awesome deals the day after Christmas . If you can get out there and start making those choices , then you can do quite well . I try to exercise the bargain and discount rack as much as I can . Nothing like getting the perfect item at the perfect price ! <p> I hate waiting till the last minute to buy things . I like to shop ahead of time as well . That way you are not paying these crazy prizes simply because you have to . Everyone knows that stores like to jack up their prizes around christmas time because they know a lot of people are going to be scrounging . Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sorry , but I just cant think about Christmas shopping until much later in the year . Say around December 15th . I grant you that you get much better deals doing it your way , but my list is short and I can just never really get my act together . More power to you for having it so together so early in the year . <p> Its funny ; not too many years ago I used to work for a company that specially opened gift shops all round the country in October and ran them through till early January to capitalize on the Christmas shopping rush . It never ceased to amaze me how many people left their shopping till the very last minute ! More than once at 5pm on Christmas Eve as I was shutting up I 'd have some crazed individual ( who am I kidding ; it was always a guy = literally yelling that I HAD to let him in ! <p> Really ? Christmas is the same day every year why has it caught you by surprise so much ? ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start my Xmas shopping , though I like to get it all done by November . You 're so right it makes Christmas so much more enjoyable and relaxing . When those parcels go off ( in plenty of time ) its such a nice feeling to know that the worst of it is over ! <p> That said , I do continually keep my eyes open for " bargains " that would be suitable right throughout the year . I also maintain a list on Amazon of ideas as I come up with them ( or people inadvertently drop a hint ! ) . <p> Not only does it make it easier to find a deal because there 's so much time between now and Christmas for prices to change or things to go on sale , but it always seems to impress people that I got the " just what they wanted " because it was so long ago they mentioned it , they forgot they even wanted it ! <p> I use a lot of these strategies too , and am currently about 90% done with all Christmas shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the year ) . I usually wait until around September to do the final 10% 0f my shopping , as I like to supplement some of my gifts with consumables such as chocolates etc , which have expiry dates . Finishing up in September still enables me to shop the sales to get really good prices . <p> As I 'm a happy budgeting nerd , I love to maintain a spreadsheet with all of the gifts recorded , so I can record what I buy for each person each year , and also so I can work out the budget that I want to have for each person , to help keep cost under control . <p> We are starting to get better at this . Last year the kids wanted these great patriotic flip flops for the 4th of July . I did n't  buy them , but later on I saw them on clearance for $2 a pair and got them for Christmas . I 'm learning . = <p> We used to shop early for Christmas . Then for a few years I made all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , 5 and 3 ) money , my Dad does the same for them . Altogether they end up with around $200 each and they get to pick their own presents . Last year our then 4 year old and 2 year old combined their money to buy a Wii U that they both wanted . <p> The only thing on this list I would n't do is the Walmart tip I do n't  enjoy going there once ( especially the day after Christmas ) , let alone twice which is what your tip would make me do . It is a great tip , it just is n't for me . <p> This sounds great in theory but my experience is that most of the wish list items that end up turning into gifts are not reasonably identified until closer to the holidays . Buying so early in the year would either mean Im making assumptions on what everybody might want , or I 'm working off information that will likely change in the coming months . <p> I 'm fine with shopping toward the holidays , but we do save for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded in terms of paying for gifts . Thats stress free enough for me ! <p> In our family , no one really says they want anything , so it does n't  matter what time of the year we buy it for them . We just know general things that our family members like and buy for them in that category . We do n't  stress over whether or not its the perfect gift . Most of the time , you cant remember what you got for Christmas last year , let alone who gave it to you . <p> Well , I 've at least started shopping . Have one gift for daughter-in-law . I keep my eyes peeled for deals throughout the year but ca n't face going out the day after Christmas due to all the crazy return crowd . You guys are brave . <p> Good for you guys ! We tend not to shop until oct/nov when our Christmas fund is fully stocked . We do n't  have a ton of people to buy for so its not usually a big deal and of course we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are Christmas rock stars .

@@44824263 @4824263/ <h> Understanding Bonds All the Essentials <p> Today we discuss one of my favorite topics debt ! You know how much we believe in leveraging debt , right ? Clothes , gadgets , new cars , its all affordable with debt ! <p> Just kidding . You 're a nut if you finance any of the previously mentioned items with debt . Sell them and try again when you can afford to pay with cash . <p> If you insist on holding debt , hold someone elses ! Welcome to the world of bonds ! <p> Bonds are debt investments in which you loan an organization money with the agreement that they must pay you back the original amount in full , along with an agreed amount of interest Just like a formal IOU . Bonds are also known as fixed income and fixed interest investments , and that 's because they pay out a fixed amount at a fixed date . You 'll here some common terms surrounding bonds . So here is a reference if you get lost . <p> The- issuer- is the entity ( company or government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The- principal- of a bond " also known as maturity value , face value , par value " is the amount that the issuer borrows which must be repaid to the lender . <p> The- coupon- ( of a bond ) is the annual interest that the issuer must pay , expressed as a percentage of the principal . <p> The- maturity date- is the end of the bond , the date that the issuer must return the principal . <p> The- indenture- is the contract that states all of the terms of the bond . <p> Bonds are issued by companies and governments to raise money . - While issuing bonds , the issuing business- doesnt- have to relinquish ownership to raise new capital ( as is the case when issuing stock ) , but they do have to repay this borrowed money with interest . When a bond is issued , it includes a specified maturity date at which time the principal will be repaid . These maturity dates are often broken up into short , intermediate , and long term bonds . You will see some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the numbers are close . So generally : <p> Short-term bonds- mature in 1-3 years . <p> Medium or intermediate-term bonds- mature in 4-10 years <p> Long-term bonds- are those with maturities greater than 10 years . <h> Coupon ( Interest ) <p> Bonds are issued at a particular interest rate ( what 's known as a- coupon ) . This rate is fixed on most bonds , but not all . <p> For example , a $1000 par value bond issued with a 5% annual coupon rate will pay the investor $50 per year in interest . <p> As the maturity date of a bond increases , so does the coupon rate . This higher yield can be attributed to many factors which increase investor risk , such as increased chance of bankruptcy for the issuing company , increased chance of interest rate fluctuations , questionable inflation levels , and even the behavioral aspect of an increased commitment for a longer period of time . <p> So bond interest rates rise as the maturity date gets pushed further out . This is a result of increased risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater reward . <h> Understanding Bond Yield and Pricing <p> As a reminder going forward , remember that the face value and coupon of a bond never change . Never . <p> So if you buy a bond new and hold it until maturity , you 'll get exactly what was promised - A series of fixed payments plus the return of your original investment ( the face value ) . <p> But what happens if you buy someone elses bond or if they buy yours ? - Well it gets more complicated and it depends on the current market value of the individual bond . <p> You might be wondering why the current market value of a bond is different that the original face value . Most commonly , its due to changes in interest rates . Since some bonds are very long term investments , it is common to see changing interest rates throughout the period when the bond is outstanding . <p> If a bond is issued , then interest rates rise , the bond will be worth less . This is because new bonds are being issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors . Why would anyone buy your old bond paying 4% if new bonds are paying 6% ? <p> The reverse is also true . If rates drop , your bond is worth more . People are far more interest in a 4% coupon when new bonds are being issued at 3% . <p> When these interest rate fluctuations take place , an individual bond will be priced accordingly . The face value and coupon do not change , but the market value does . <p> For example- You bought a $1,000 face value bond with a 4% annual coupon rate . Rates rise and bonds are issued at 6% . If you keep your bond , you 'll make $40/year until maturity . If you try to sell , no investor is going to pay your $1000 . They are going to pay you less to reflect your lower coupon . In this case , they might pay $667 . That price would mean that your original bond now pays roughly 6% just like the other bonds on the market- ( $40/$667 = roughly 6% yield ) <p> As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more dramatic the effect of interest rates . Long term bonds are far more sensitive to interest rate changes than short term bonds and pricing differences are far more dramatic . <p> It is for this reason that many investors wo n't touch long term bonds right now . Interest rates are being held very low , resulting in a high likelihood of higher rates in the future , which means bonds being issued right now would be worth less . Possibly much less . <p> Understanding bonds and pricing can be difficult at first glance , so let me know if you have questions with a comment . <p> The yield takes into account the coupon and the current market value of the bond . So the yield is a way to evaluate bonds based on the pricing information I just detailed above . Remember , coupon and face value never change , but yield does . <p> Understanding bond yields is essential for investors because the yield is the description of the current value of any given bond investment . There are two commonly used yield descriptions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considers the current market price of the bond , which , as I mentioned above , may be different from the par value . For example , if you bought a $1,000 par value bond with an annual coupon rate of 6% ( $1,000 x 0.06 = $60 ) on the open market for $800 , your current yield would be 7.5% because you would still be earning the $60 , but on $800 ( $60 / $800 = 7.5% ) instead of $1,000 . <p> Yield to Maturity- Yield to Maturity is the most complicated , but the most useful calculation . It considers the current market price , the coupon rate , the time to maturity and assumes that interest payments are reinvested at the bonds coupon rate . When you hear the media talking about a bonds " yield " it is usually this number they are talking about . <h> Why Investors Own Bonds <p> Bonds offer higher returns than cash equivalents like savings accounts and money market funds , but lower returns than ownership vehicles like stocks ( and perhaps real estate ) . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each investment . The greater the risk , they greater the reward . <p> The most compelling reason to own bonds is their lack of correlation to stock market returns . Bonds tend to zig when stocks zag . This provides a huge benefit to the investor who owns both . It increases diversification and results in a much more stable portfolio . <p> The fixed interest payments can be a draw to investors as well , although I 'd argue against selecting bonds for that reason . Income can be easily generated by stocks by selling - shares that have been owned for more than 1 year ( or of course owning dividend paying stocks ) . <p> Bottom line , most people should own at least a small percentage of bonds in a portfolio . Young investors can make the case for 100% stocks , but many people advocate owning your age in bonds . <p> As always , investing in a good bond index fund or ETF is a much better solution that trying to pick individual bonds . Diversification and simplicity win . <p> I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you think . 50388 @qwx460388 <p> Email <h> Comments <p> By Chris <p> Ive been looking for some information on using savings bonds for college savings for my kids . We live in a state with no state income tax , and I 'm not in favor of hoping my childrens college timing corresponds with a good stock market ( a 529 in 2007 could have taken a serious blow ) . I have a treasury direct account , and from what I can tell , I can buy savings bonds in my name to be used for the kids educations income tax free . Do you think this is a decent strategy ? Why or why not ? Thanks ! <p> Chris , you could use them . Are you talking about EE bonds ? The real problem is that they have very low rates of return . Far lower than a 529 plan or similar options . What are your goals with it ? The money wont really grow in savings bonds . <p> Thanks for the good primer on Bonds , Jacob . here 's a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I am : why not just buy ( &amp; hold ) individual bonds instead of bond funds ? There seems to be huge interest rate risk ( especially now ) would just understanding the actual debt payment you will get if you simply hold a bond through maturity avoid this risk ? Youd still have credit risk to deal with but that seems like less of a factor with the bonds we consider . <p> You are certainly welcome ! The primary reason ( and probably the most important ) is diversification . Since bonds are often issued in the amount of $1000 or more , how many can you or I ( or the average investor ) own ? I 'll speak for myself , not many . As you well know , diversification is key in all areas of investing , not just stock ownership . Some may object and say that owning a few bonds issued by large and well established companies provides enough stability and diversification , but I would argue against that . Especially in intermediate and long term bonds . I do n't  know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I certainly would n't bet on a corporation being prosperous for that long . Maybe you could get away with buying just a few short term bonds and holding for their entire duration , but there is still risk present . <p> Understood . So credit risk would be present . But just to be clear , buying an individual bond &amp; holding it eliminates interest rate risk , right ? ( As you 're not actually trying to sell it to anyone on the market later on ? ) <p> I 'm mainly thinking of a government issued bond , and then banking on the fact that the US federal government would remain solvent , say , 10 years or 20 years or even 30 years into the future . There 's a risk that its not , but if that scenario comes to pass , I will have bigger problems than my $1000 bond being forfeited . <p> Well , whether or not it eliminates interest rate risk is a matter of opinion . Yes , you 'll avoid the loss potential on the value of the bond itself by holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rate risk is still present entirely . If you buy a 10 year bond yielding 4% bond right now , its going to yield 4% until maturity . Well if 10-year bonds are being issued at 7% in three years , you 're still missing out on all that additional yield ( income ) , meaning your bond is worth less in terms of present valuation . The pricing on the secondary market is just a reflection of this reality . <p> This is probably my ignorance showing , but I find the price drop of the bond fund &amp; the opportunity cost of a single bond to be different things . For one , they have a very different impact on my bottom line , correct ? <p> By Jacob <p> I was under the impression that you were talking about individual bonds , not funds ? The principle is the same either way as can easily be seen by an index ETF since you can choose when to sell and realize a gain/loss in the ETF . The change in value is still the same . A bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . It is up to you whether or not you choose to sell and realize those losses . You could just hold the ETF and draw the periodic interest payments , right ? What I 'm trying to explain is that the decrease in the price of the ETF is in direct accordance to the increase in interest payments ( directly tied to interest rates ) . That exact idea is the same for individual bonds . You can hold a 10-year bond that pays 4% until maturity . In doing so , you 'll receive payments of $40 . But if new bonds are being issued at 7% , you 'll forego $30 at every payments period ( $70 for new bonds the $40 you get ) . If you do the Time Value of Money calculations , that decrease in income is directly reflected by the decrease in pricing on the secondary market ( where you 'd sell the bond to another investor ) . So you are getting the same decreased return on investment either way , which means interest rate risk is still present . <p> Yep , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bond fund . I follow your line of reasoning : I can simply hold a bond fund and decide not to sell . However , is the price not affected by other peoples decisions to sell ? That is , with a single bond , I can simply hold itwith a bond fund , people are going to sell every day . Does that have an impact on the bottom line ( and does that make the costs different between holding a single bond vs. a bond fund ? ) Sorry for the endless line of questions <p> That is a nice post with some good bond basics . The diversification aspect can be a little tricky . In the last few years we have seen both stock prices and bond prices go up as the Fed has instituted QE . The funny thing is when interest rates correct , we will see prices for both instruments fall at the same time too . Is that mattress looking good yet ? ? <p> Thanks Chad . You are definitely right . We are in a unique situation and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely take a good hit as the Fed stops buying treasuries and interest rates rise . <p> We have a few short term bond funds in our portfolio . Even though were relatively young and technically able to handle more risk we feel that our goal of becoming FI in a few years means that we should hold more bonds/CDs than normal . That being said we recognize that bonds have little room for future gains . <p> That 's a tough call ! There is research suggesting that stocks are even less volatile in the intermediate , but selling when the market is down is brutal . I just have a hard time stomaching the returns on short term bonds , and I wo n't touch long term <p> Nice overview , Jacob . I have never been a huge fan of bonds , but I realize its a nice diversification tool . I 'd rather keep my money in stocks which is a bit riskier , but they also have higher returns on average .

@@44824266 @4824266/ <h> Should You Consolidate Your Student Loans ? <p> With regard to student loans , many people use the terms refinance and consolidate interchangeably . They are not the same thing . <p> Refinancing involves taking out a new private- loan to replace one or more existing student loans ( federal or private ) . Most individuals refinance to obtain a lower interest rate loan . <p> Consolidating a student loan is a process through the- Federal Direct- Loan- Consolidation Program . This- program allows you to combine multiple federal education loans into a single loan , at no cost to you. - Once your loans are combined into a Direct Consolidation Loan , the action can not be undone . The loans that were consolidated are paid off and no longer exist . <p> Consolidating can be beneficial for some , but its not an appropriate solution for every borrower . In this article , I 'll discuss- several important factors to- consider before consolidating your loans . <h> Reasons to Consolidate Your Student Loans <p> There are three primary reasons to consider consolidation , with number one being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repayment plans <p> I recently wrote a post about Federal Loan Repayment Plans . These repayment plans can be incredibly helpful for people who have a lot of student loan debt and modest- income . These plans can- decrease your required monthly payment , and many offer loan- forgiveness after making payments for 20-25 years . <p> To access these plans , borrowers must hold eligible federal student loans . Not all loans are eligible . <p> Before 2010 , federal student loans were disbursed- in two different ways . You- could obtain a loan directly from the federal government , or obtain a FFEL loan from a private company . <p> Only direct federal loans qualify for the best income-driven repayment plans , while FFEL loans are not eligible . <p> The good news is that you can turn one or more FFEL loans into a direct loan through consolidation . <p> 2 ) - Lock your- interest rate <p> Many older federal loans have a variable interest rate . Since 2006 , all loans have been fixed rate . <p> If you have a variable rate loan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed rate . <p> This is advantageous if you can lock in a- low-interest rate . It is also nice to know your exact monthly payment for the life of the loan ( the monthly payment on a variable interest loan fluctuates with interest rate changes ) . <p> 3 ) Escape default status- <p> If you are currently in default on your loan payments , consolidation is one way out . <p> You can only do this once in your lifetime , so make sure you are ready to begin making payments on the new consolidation loan . <h> Important Notes about Consolidating <p> Before you consolidate your loans , keep the following in mind : <p> The interest rate on your loans <p> Consolidating your loan(s) will not impact the effective interest rate on your debt . <p> The interest rate on a- consolidation loan is the weighted average of all the loans you choose to consolidate . The interest rate is exactly the same before and after consolidation , - period . <p> Let 's say that you have two federal student loans , each with- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other carries a- 6% interest rate. - If you consolidate them , you will end up with one $30,000 loan at- a 7% interest rate . <p> Because of this , consolidation can be- a bad idea for many borrowers . <p> As I showed previously , the most efficient way to eliminate debt is by paying the highest interest rate debt first . In this example , it would be more efficient to keep these loans separate while throwing all of your available cash flow- at- the 8% loan . <p> If you consolidate , you lose the ability to- prioritize the higher interest debt . Unless you are receiving other important benefits ( like those described above ) , it might be better to avoid consolidation in situations like this . <p> Loan forgiveness can be lost <p> If you have already made progress toward any loan forgiveness , you should think twice about consolidating . Progress toward loan forgiveness is typically forfeited during consolidation . <p> Extending the length of your loans <p> When you consolidate , you are resetting the clock on your repayment schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be making payments for 30 more years . <p> Be careful with- Parent PLUS loans <p> Parent PLUS loans do not qualify for most income-driven repayment plans , even after consolidation . <p> Do not mix- Parent PLUS loans with other federal loans in the consolidation process . Doing so will make the entire consolidated loan ineligible for income-driven repayment plans . <h> How to Consolidate Your Loans <p> The consolidation process is- relatively straightforward , and you are able to select your chosen- repayment plan in the same application :
