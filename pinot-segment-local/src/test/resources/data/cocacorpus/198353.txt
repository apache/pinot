If Edward Cheserek wins the mile at next week 's NCAA meet , he 'll be the first man since Tony Waldrop in 1974 to win the NCAA indoor mile the same year that he broke the collegiate record . The original article begins below the video of Cheserek 's 3:52.01 . <p> If you answered , " They were all NCAA record holders at the indoor mile , " then yes , you 're correct . <p> If you also answered , " They all lost the NCAA mile the year after they broke the record , " then you get a big gold star . <p> We got the tip from former Columbia standout and now a member of adidas Rogue Athletic Club , Mark Feigen . If you 're into that whole causation equals correlation thing , then taking the field over Lalang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was also that whole " it was his third race of the meet " and " he never looked dominant " sort of stuff , but let 's just ignore the on-site logic here and look at the pattern . <p> Let 's start this series of events off with another Austin , TX resident , Miles Batty . At the 2012 Millrose Games Wanamaker Mile , Batty , then running for BYU , finished second in 3:54.54 . <p> Batty 's run broke the previous record , which was set by Oklahoma State 's German Fernandez from 2009 . As a freshman , Fernandez proved that there 's no logic in track and field , and blitzed a 3:55.02 solo mile at the Big 12 Championships . <p> Fernandez ' ridiculous effort broke the previous record of 3:55.0 , held by UNC 's Tony Waldrop . <p> This part is a little confusing . Since Waldrop 's record was set in 1974 and their superior timing systems consisted of five guys hand timing everything , the mark does n't include hundredths of seconds . Nonetheless , Waldrop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mile " curse " does n't really begin with Fernandez either , because he did not compete at the NCAA Indoor Championship that year . <p> According to okstate.com , " Fernandez would have been the prohibitive favorite to win the NCAA title in the mile but he elected instead to train for the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in Amman , Jordan , which took place just 14 days after the NCAA Championships . " <p> We 'll never know , huh . New Mexico 's Lee Emanuel would win the 2009 and 2010 titles , but would never join this conversation because he never held the record . Somehow , someway , I do n't think he 's too upset over that one . <p> Back to our unfortunate trio . You would think that Batty , the 2011 NCAA Mile Champion and then NCAA Mile record holder , would defend his title , right ? That makes some sort of sense ? <p> But just short of one month after his record run , Batty would finish third at the 2012 NCAA Indoor Championship mile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but the poisoned chalice would be taken by the winner , Tulsa 's O'Hare ( 4:01.66 ) . <p> Poor O'Hare did n't even know his fate was sealed . Like Macbeth , he thought he 'd be king , but instead , was set up to lose . <p> Nearly 365 days after Batty 's run at the Millrose Games , O'Hare made the trip to the Armory in NYC and took part in the 2013 running of the Wanamaker Mile . O'Hare would finish fourth in 3:52.98 and obliterate Batty from the record books . <p> But later that season , at the 2013 NCAA Indoor Championships , O'Hare would be bested by Arizona 's Lalang ( 3:54.74 ) . O'Hare would finish seventh , and was basically bested by everyone else , but maybe that 's just the curse compounding on itself . <p> So Lalang , unbeknownst to him , was now carrying a torch that would soon set him ablaze . Again , at the Wanamaker Mile , Lalang would be the one to set the NCAA record . His second place finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAA title , but , if you 've been reading this all along , you know the answer . Or did you just scroll to the bottom ? For shame . <p> At the 2014 NCAA Indoor Championships , Lalang , coming off a mile semifinal ( 4:04.27 at altitude ) and a 5k final ( 13:52.83 at altitude , and second to Oregon 's Edward Cheserek ) , would try and lead the mile wire-to-wire , but would falter in the final meters . UTEP 's Anthony Rotich ( 4:02.54 ) , who sat calmly in third for the entire race , pounded on the final straightaway to take the win . Lalang would finish in second in 4:02.81. 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

@@23249675 @3249675/ <h> CrossFit 's New Masters Division Sees The ( Brief ) Return of Mikko Salo <p> Heading into the final stretch of the seven-kilometer hill run that kicked off the men 's individual division of the 2009 CrossFit Games , Mikko Salo and Chris Spealler were neck and neck . <p> Spealler , a 143-pound spark plug from Park City , Utah , beat the relatively unknown Finn in that workout by less than two seconds , but was given little time to celebrate . Almost immediately after , the competitors were expected to complete an ascending deadlift ladder followed by a 170-meter sprint up a hill while carrying two 35-pound sandbags . But that weekend , nothing could temper Salo 's engine--he emerged victorious , and in doing so , cemented himself as a fixture in CrossFit lore . <p> With eight events packed into two days--five the first day ! --the 2009 CrossFit Games was in many ways the most grueling in the competition 's history . It was also the most pivotal . <h> From a national craze to a global phenomenon <p> Previously , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weekend getaway with buddies than the international phenomenon it was about to become . In 2007 , its first year , the Games was comprised of only three events . Anyone who wanted to could compete , but fewer than 70 competitors actually did . It took place on a hilly ranch in Aromas , California , owned by the parents of the event 's director , Dave Castro . When the Games returned to the ranch the following year and added one more event to the schedule , it enjoyed a surge of interest--the number of entrants was capped at 300--but the registration process still followed a first-come , first-served model . That changed in 2009 , when competitors were required to qualify regionally before advancing to the Games . Suddenly , what had been a national craze turned into a global one as athletes worldwide vied to compete for the title of " Fittest Man on Earth . " <p> One of that season 's international qualifiers was Salo , a third-generation firefighter from Pori , Finland , who awed his rivals with a triumvirate of strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by how balanced he was , " said Matt Chan , a Colorado firefighter who finished 18th in 2009 and went on to make four top-10 finishes , including second place in 2012 . " Most people performed well in one event , whereas Mikko did very well in all the events in 2009 . I think he showed what true balance across skills and drills looked like and really stepped up the game for everybody else . " <p> Another competitor who left the 2009 Games impressed by Salo 's performance was Tommy Hackenbruck , a former linebacker at the University of Utah who finished second in 2009 and went on to make two more top-10 finishes . " I had the lead going into the last workout , and he just freaking destroyed it , " he said . " I was extremely impressed by his raw fitness . No one else there blew me away , but he did . He could run . He could lift . He was three years ahead of everybody else . " <p> Finishing five points ahead of Hackenbruck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason Khalipa , Salo won the title in 2009 while Spealler and Chan failed to complete all the workouts that year . After Salo 's spectacular performance , the entire CrossFit community wanted to know the secret to his success . Much of it had to do with something more intangible : his attitude , a mix of fierce determination and northern European stoicism known as sisu in his homeland . <p> A documentary of the same name filmed later that year captured the essence of Salo 's character . " During the run in 2009 , did you ever want to quit ? " filmmaker Sevan Matossian asked him . " No , that 's not an option for me , " Salo said . " I 'll never quit when I 'm doing a workout . My pace might get slower , but I never quit . I 'll do it anyway . I 'm always giving all-out effort when I am doing metcons or in a competition . It 's not an option for me to quit . " <p> Later , when Salo was asked why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fran , he lent a little more insight into his unique perspective . " When animals surrender , they go lying on their back . From then on , I decided I would never go lying on my back . It 's a sign of weakness and surrender . I 'm never lying on my back . " <p> The film also documented Salo 's grueling training regimen , which created a seismic shift in the CrossFit world . Prior to 2009 , one workout a day was the norm . But Sisu showed Salo rowing intervals in the morning , completing a lifting session in the middle of day , and knocking out two or three metcons in the evening . That was a typical day for him . No one else was doing volume like that at the time , and when other CrossFit athletes saw that , it changed the way they trained . Doing multiple workouts a day soon became a common practice . <p> " All his performance measures made a lot of sense once I heard that , " said Hackenbruck . " Honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I watch CrossFit documentaries about him , you see that and it 's a little unbelievable , like this guy 's just playing it up for the cameras . But it was a testament to the fact that he really did put in that much work . I was very impressed . I was nowhere near it and did n't have any intention of being near it . I already had two kids at the time . Nothing was going to make me change the way I trained . But it did make me realize I was n't going to win the CrossFit Games unless I upped my level of commitment . " <p> The 2009 CrossFit Games were momentous in other ways as well . It was the last year that athletes competed for peanuts--Salo only earned $5,000 for his victory--and the last year it took place on a dusty ranch in the boonies . The following year , the Games moved to the Home Depot Center in Carson , California , and the winner was awarded $25,000. 2011 brought even more dramatic changes as Reebok came onboard as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ESPN3 live-streamed three hours of the event each day . <h> The rise of a legend <p> As the sport 's early stars kept dutifully returning each year , it helped the CrossFit Games transition from regional to global phenomenon . Spealler , Chan , and Hackenbruck became perennial fixtures on the leaderboard , but none of these names generated the buzz that Salo 's did . He and some of his workouts have taken on an almost mythic status , like King Arthur pulling the sword from the stone . When a video of him doing a 20-minute AMRAP of King Kong--he did 12 rounds when most people would have stopped at three--made it online in 2011 , the CrossFit community nearly lost its collective mind . <p> Unfortunately , Salo 's performances at the CrossFit Games could n't keep pace with his legend . After finishing fifth in 2010 , he went on to suffer a cruel rash of injuries . In the first workout of the 2011 CrossFit Games , he ruptured an eardrum while swimming in the ocean and was forced to withdraw . Six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the 2012 Games . In 2013 , he finished second in his region during qualifying , but suffered an abdominal injury a week before the Games , compelling him to withdraw yet again . And in 2014 , he came down with pneumonia during the Open , causing him to miss a workout and disqualifying him from the competition . <p> The man known for his engine was breaking down . <p> When Salo won the Crossfit Games in 2009 , he was on the verge of turning 30--hardly ancient , but not young by elite fitness standards . While most of his injuries were chance occurrences , the volume he was putting in while training could n't have helped . <p> " I think as you age , pushing that higher volume , especially with weight training , can lead to injury , " said Chan . " I 've learned this the hard way . As you age , recovery time becomes a priority . You train when you can , not when you should . " <p> Hackenbruck was less certain about the correlation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered . " I 'm sure the training volume contributed to the injuries , but for the most part they were flukes . He 's definitely put a lot of wear and tear on his body , but I think the timing of his injuries was worse than the injuries themselves . I imagine six months out of the year he stays pretty healthy . " <p> More confident that Salo 's age was a factor , Hackenbruck said , " I 'm curious to see if Ben Smith , Rich Froning , and Mat Fraser can stay healthy year-round when they 're 32 , 33 , or 34 , if they do the same volume they 're doing today . I think that would be telling . I 'm 35 now , and for the last two years I do n't feel like I recovered quite as well . When I was 33 and 34 , I started to feel a little bit of a shift . " <p> Spealler has also noticed the drop-off in performance CrossFit athletes experience in their mid-30s . " I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " There are a few guys , depending on the position , who are older , but for the most part the players are in their mid- to late-20s . That 's the lifespan there . " <h> A second wind <p> In 2010 , Castro addressed the issue of older athletes who could no longer keep up with their younger counterparts by creating a Masters division for those aged 50 and above . The following year , it was divided into four separate divisions and expanded to include 45- to 49-year-olds . The expansion continued in 2013 when a fifth Masters division for 40- to 44-year-olds was added . <p> As well-received by the CrossFit community as these moves were , it soon became apparent that an additional Masters division was needed for those in their mid- to late-30s , as only a small fraction of them could still realistically compete against 20-year-olds . Adding more urgency was the fact that some of CrossFit 's biggest male stars--Hackenbruck , Spealler , Chan , and Salo , to name a few--were being forced into retirement by age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sixth Masters division for those 35- to 39-years-old was going be added to this year 's schedule . Debates immediately arose in online forums . <p> " Is this new division really necessary ? " <p> " Who will compete in it ? " <p> None other than Mikko Salo , who entered- the- new division after a four-year hiatus from Open competition and- finished strong in ninth place for 17.1 . <p> One person who supported the creation of the new division was Chan . " I think it 's really cool . It gives the older guys an opportunity to compete at the highest level without having to compete against kids who are pumping testosterone and growth hormone ( at a natural level ) that obviously ca n't be matched because of age , and gives them an opportunity to compete on the big stage amongst their peers . I think 35 is the right age to start a Masters division with . I do think that 33- and 34-year-olds can compete on the Open level and should not be considered Masters . " <p> Hackenbruck was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there are guys who are 35- to 39-years-old who can and will qualify for the Open , but it 's going to be pretty rare . I think this new division will be a fun competition to watch , so why not do it ? " <p> Calling the creation of the new Masters division " a natural progression , " Spealler accepted it , but was n't as enthusiastic . " I do n't think it has quite as much draw as the Open . I think people like to see the pinnacle of a sport , and that tends to be the Open division and not athletes in their late-30s , mid-40s , early-50s . I do n't train to be the best 35- to 39-year-old athlete in the world . Not that what the athletes in the Masters age groups are doing is n't incredible . I do n't mean to undermine the work and the energy they put into it . It 's just different . " <p> When Spealler , Hackenbruck , and Chan were asked who they expected to win the new division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be one of them . <p> " I 'm not training for it , " Hackenbruck said . " There will be a lot of guys in it who you 've seen at the Games before , but I do n't think that gives them an upper hand . I think there 's probably 5,200 guys who 've never been there or who 've only been there on a team who are hungrier . They 're probably training a lot harder than a lot of the veterans that you 've heard about . I think it 'll be very heavily populated with newcomers . " <p> When asked how he thought some of his old rivals would perform , Hackenbruck said , " I do n't expect to see Chris Spealler standing on the podium just for the simple fact that I think he has prioritized his family and business over training . He 's been working out , but not that hard . " <p> Spealler agreed . " The athletes that we 're talking about , Tommy , Matt , Mikko , and myself , guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as we could , and now most of us have things we have to take care of because of what we 've done in the past . The new Masters division is a great opportunity for athletes who have n't been there and have the time , dedication , and drive , so I think you 'll see more athletes in that age group who have n't been to the Crossfit Games before than have . For guys like Matt , Tommy , and myself , it does n't have as much appeal . I think it 's really hard to replicate the experiences we had , and I do n't have any desire to try to replace them with any new memories this year . I 'm just not willing to sacrifice my well-being and my quality of life anymore for one more rep or one more trip back to the Games . " <p> Chan 's take was nearly identical . " I think a lot of the guys who have been to the Crossfit Games before are considering the 35- to 39-years-old category as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inferior category and are doing it for fun . But for many of the athletes who entered the Games a bit later and never really had the opportunity to compete at that level , this is their opportunity to be on the grand stage and have an opportunity to compete at Madison this year . This is their Crossfit Games . " <p> Chan is currently taking a year off from the CrossFit Games to recover from knee surgery with the goal of returning in 2018 to compete in the Masters ( 40-44 ) division . At the time of this writing , Hackenbruck was in 295th place and Spealler was in 33rd place in the Masters ( 35-39 ) division for the Open . Salo was in ninth place after the first workout of the Open , but did n't complete the second workout , forcing him withdraw from the competition once again . <p> But if we know anything about Salo , it 's that he wo n't be lying on his back until next season . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

While this is a nearly impossible question to answer , we runners understand that both physiological and psychological skills impact performance . From a physiological standpoint , we runners know what needs to be done to achieve excellence . We log our miles , sleep well , eat right , ice down after workouts , do core work , and on and on . When runners underachieve , coaches often discuss physical components of training ( log more miles , improve leg speed , avoid overtraining , etc. ) as a means to improvement . In other words , most athletes do the important physical things that are necessary to be successful . And if athletes fail to reach their goals , their coaches or other advisors almost always discuss changing physical training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest levels in the sport of distance running takes more than excellent physical training . <p> The mental side of running may be equally important , but it is rarely discussed .

Kara Goucher , for example , partly attributes the revitalization of her career to work with a sports psychologist who specifically helped Goucher foster a belief in herself ( Powers , 2009 ) . Alan Webb also reportedly made the training move from Reston , Virginia to Portland to be closer to the sports psychologist he works with ( Binder , 2009 ) . Webb , Goucher , and other elite athletes most certainly do the optimum physical training , but they also realize that more than this is required for peak performance . <p> What do I mean by " the mental side of running " ?

Topics that I will cover during this bi-monthly series include the flow state , association versus dissociation , goal setting , and optimal arousal for peak performance . I certainly hope that many of the Flotrack users understand the impact of psychology on performance . Yet sports psychology involves more than just positive thinking . If you are like many runners , your coaches and advisors do not openly discuss the impact of the mental game on performance . Over the next several months , I hope to she 'd more light on these topics so that you may improve your own mental games . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

You know all about Froning : Runner up in 2010 , Individual Champ 2011-2014 , Team Champ 2015 and 2016 . <p> It 's only natural to compare Champions , and it 's especially fitting to compare Mat Fraser 's absolutely dominant win in 2016 to Rich Froning 's career . To that end , a lot of people have been either calling for Froning to come out of " retirement " or to stay retired , - and Froning is over it . <p> " We 're around 2 weeks out from the CrossFit Games and I 'm already tired of the Fraser/Froning comparisons . To do that I think is incredibly disrespectful to what Mat worked for this year , and in all honesty you 're comparing apples to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is hard to compare to the year before . What Mat did this year was nothing short of amazing and impressive to watch . For those calling for my return to individual I 'm going to go ahead and tell you that wo n't happen . Mat and many other athletes woke up everyday for a year with their sole purpose for that day to become the fittest man on earth , I know this because it was my sole purpose for 4 years and that 's what it takes to win the CrossFit Games . That is no longer my sole purpose for my day , I now have something better ... To be the best father and husband I can be , which is a constant battle , that I am trying to get better at everyday . <p> I feel that if I returned to individual I would not be able to have my full attention of training , which is what it takes to win , nor would I want to .

" <p> I 've got a lot of respect for Rich Froning , and I understand what he 's saying , but he needs to realize the role he plays in CrossFit . Froning created a name for himself through his commanding wins and every Champion from here on out will be compared to the bar he set . <p> Mat and many other athletes woke up everyday for a year with their sole purpose for that day to become the fittest man on earth , I know this because it was my sole purpose for 4 years . <p> Mat Fraser destroyed the competition at the 2016 Games and proved he 's the real deal . The next step for him is to break Froning 's streak , and I guarantee you the Fraser is thinking the same thing . Sports , and CrossFit , are about competition and comparison . People want to see dynasties , to have superheroes to look up to , and to see superheroes compete against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's performance is n't a way of detracting from Fraser . It 's a way of saying that Froning set the bar for all Games Champions and Fraser has got his eyes squarely on that bar .

Branch details a workout where Rupp does 8x1 mile , with the first four in 4:25 in flats and the next four in 4:21 in spikes , followed by 2x300 in 42 seconds . That particular workout was in the middle of a 145 mile week . <p> Salazar explains that last summer , after Rupp 's disappointing performance at the IAAF World Championships in Beijing , Salazar determined that the runner was carrying too much bulk and muscle in his upper body . " It was restricting his stride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extension . So we basically stopped doing upper-body strength work . Galen has gotten much more fluid , much more flexible . " <p> -Rupp is more introspective than we normally see him , telling Branch " Alberto will joke sometimes , ' I liked it better when you were a kid and you never questioned me . ' " Salazar also says that Rupp 's wife is pregnant with her third child and due in October . <p> -Branch also gets the man who was the cross country coach at Rupp 's high school to deliver a colorful simile that seems like an accurate description of Salazar : <p> " Indeed , such was the articulate force of his rebuttal that I almost thought that Salazar , a competitor with a cellular aversion to losing , had been waiting for years for such charges to be filed , so that he could slam them back in his accusers ' faces . " Alberto is like the pit boss in an Indy 500 crew , " says Dave Frank , cross-country coach of Central Catholic High School in Portland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules say that a tire ca n't exceed a certain width , that pit boss is going to have tires that are built to that limit , and not a millimeter less .

It 's a time when the world stops , and all eyes are on the athletes . It should be a celebration of athleticism and human achievement . <p> But these Summer Games have been marred by controversy , and in turn , have opened the International Olympic Committee 's ( IOC ) practices up to public scrutiny . In the most recent episode of HBO 's " Real Sports , " Bryant Gumbel and his team of journalists delivered a 90-minute expose on the IOC 's long history of corruption , greed and human rights violations . <p> The Olympic Games are marketed as more than just a way to showcase the best athletes in the world . The Games , according to the IOC , are the only way of bringing the world together in peace . <p> But a deeper investigation reveals something else : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing pitch . <p> In reality , the IOC is driven solely by a lust for money , and have repeatedly exhibited a total lack of compassion for the athletes and ruined cities they often leave in their wake . <p> To support a country 's bid , individual IOC members have requested everything from cash to paying for plastic surgery for their spouses . While considering Norway 's bid for the 2018 Olympic Games , the IOC asked for 24-hour butler service and separate entrances at the Oslo Airport . <p> Additionally , the IOC made the absurd request that the King of Norway host a cocktail party--at his expense--for members . <p> The IOC sells countries on the idea of hosting the Games with promises of social and financial benefits . But a country 's financial cut is solely determined by the IOC . There is no guaranteed return , and the IOC uses the revenue on itself . They are currently building a state-of-the-art facility in Switzerland , where they are exempt from paying taxes due to the non-profit status they have somehow been granted . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated $4 billion revenue this summer has non-profit status . <h> A $15 billion commitment <p> When Rio was announced as the host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics , Brazil was on the brink of becoming an economic powerhouse . Industry was at an all-time high . For the first time in a very long time , the country was politically stable . <p> " The Games are very important to Brazil because they will leave a great , great legacy . There will be a Rio de Janeiro before the Olympic Games , and there will be a better one after , " IOC head Thomas Bach told reporters when the Olympics were announced . <p> Nine years after that initial announcement , it 's a different story . <p> The economy has collapsed , and it is largely blamed on the money spent to build stadiums and infrastructure needed for the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Tens of thousands of Brazilians were displaced as their homes were destroyed for redevelopment . <p> This resulted in political unrest . President Dilma Rousseff was the target of protests . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed that Brazil 's Worker 's Party had accepted bribes while Rousseff was a member of the company 's board of directors . In May , impeachment proceedings began against the now-suspended president . <p> Protests continued as even more families saw their homes destroyed to build luxury apartments and nine stadiums for the Olympic park . If they refused to leave , they were driven out by a police force that often resorted to bloody violence . After they were removed from their homes , entire communities were razed to the ground and replaced by shiny new buildings that quickly became the symbol of unrest in the country . <p> Brazil 's commitment to the IOC meant funding had to be cut from more important programs such as healthcare , education , and sanitation . Olympic marathon swimmers will be competing in Guanabara Bay , which receives untreated sewage runoff from the Rocinha Favela . Despite promises that 90% of the water would be clean by the time the games opened , experts now estimate that just 10% is free from sewage , bacteria and other contaminants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris or London in the 14th or 15th centuries . Still , athletes competing in aquatic events will find themselves sailing and swimming through filthy waters next month . <p> ' The Olympic Flame and the Olympic Games are sending the message that our shared humanity is greater than the forces that divide us . ' <p> Sadly , Brazil is not an outlier . The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi were meant to show the world that Russia was a preeminent , cutting-edge nation . On the surface , Vladimir Putin 's government appeared successful ; they seemingly created a snow-covered wonderland in a city known as a beach resort . <p> On TV , Sochi sparkled . The city was a testament to Russian will and might . But below the surface , the ugly truth simmered : Russia broke laws and showed a callous disregard for human lives , all for the purpose of creating a facade to impress the world . <p> Construction was handled almost entirely by migrant workers brought in illegally to handle the difficult parts of the job . Most had their passports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were injured by extremely relaxed safety regulations . Allegations have surfaced that workers were only provided safety equipment after they had fallen to horrible injury or death . <p> The IOC has a history of willingly dealing with human rights violators and tyrannical dictators . <p> Long before the 2008 Games in Beijing and the 2014 Games in Sochi , there were the 1936 Games in Berlin . The IOC has defended the decision to host the games in a Nazi-ruled Germany by saying , " it was Germany before Hitler was Hitler . " <p> Yet the IOC has memorialized specific elements of those Games into rituals . The torch relay ? That was created by Hitler to show the world the impressive and expansive German countryside while promoting the Third Reich as an advanced world power . <p> For Hitler , Putin , and Chinese President Hu Jintao , the Olympics served as a way of promoting the government 's strength in their oppressed nations . In the case of Germany and Russia , the dictators ruling the country used the games and the exposure they provided as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Hitler used the games as a demonstration of the Third Reich 's might , Germany invaded Poland . And after the Sochi games , Putin began expanding Russian territory in a display of Russian aggression not seen since the Cold War . <h> Real Change is Needed <p> The IOC expects the Games to be a spectacle . But they refuse to accept responsibility for the people who were displaced or died for those Games to occur . They allow unchecked corruption at the highest levels of the organization . <p> The IOC is not solely to blame . The host cities who willingly agree to do whatever it takes in order to be selected play a large role as well . For these cities , it 's not about the spirit of competition . These cities are driven by greed , both by money and by the chance to give the whole world a glimpse of the paradise they are missing , even if that paradise is often a complete fabrication . <p> The IOC 's unsaid direction that each Olympics must be bigger than the last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human rights organization they claim to be . <p> The reality is the IOC does n't care about the athletes . <p> They do not care about the people who live in host cities . <p> They do n't care that tens of thousands of people were displaced so venues could be built . <p> They do n't care that those same venues often fall into disrepair , going unused while costing taxpayers millions in maintenance alone . <p> They do n't care that thousands of people were enslaved to help create the facilities that host the events . <p> The Olympics are n't about bringing the world together . They are n't a showcase of athletic achievement . <p> They are a shell game--a way for the IOC to distract the world while taking in hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The advantage of experiencing flow is sheer enjoyment , which may also result in increased confidence and love for running . If a runner has the ability to achieve objectives in practice and experience flow , that runner will likely have increased confidence come race day . <p> Flow can be a difficult state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created the Flow State Scale ( FSS ) in an attempt to measure the existence of flow during an activity . Examining the sub-scales of the FSS , as listed below , allows for a better understanding of what flow really is and how it achieve it in an activity . A runner need not meet all the below criterion to experience a flow state , but the sense of flow will be greatest when all the sub-scales are met to the highest degree. - <p> Action-Awareness Merging : The individual is so deeply involved in the task that action is automatic . The performer does not think about running , but just does it . The runner may even feel machine-like because running feels so smooth and automatic . <p> Clear Goals : Unambiguous objectives give the runner a clear idea of what needs to be accomplished . For example , a clear workout objective may be to run 10 by a quarter in 65 seconds with 2 minutes rest . <p> Unambiguous Feedback : The runner receives clear and immediate feedback , which could include a time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Task at Hand : The runner is completely focused on the task . While running , the performer thinks only about running and not about other aspects of life , or even how much running may hurt at the time . During a state of flow , running does not hurt no matter how great the demands . <p> Sense of Control : The runner has a clear feeling of control , but does not have to focus on gaining control . It is easy for the runner to power up hills or surge on a competitor without experiencing a feeling of great effort . <p> Loss of Self-Consciousness : The runner does not think about how they may appear , but is rather focused only on doing the activity . This could also include losing consciousness of the crowd , other competitors , or the scenery . <p> Transformation of Time : The perception of time may be altered , whereby time either feels as if it slows down or speeds up . The former is more likely to occur in ball sports , while the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Autotelic Experience : The activity is intrinsically rewarding and is done for its own sake . An individual is likely to find utter joy with the act of running itself , and not have a preoccupation with time or performance against others . <p> Challenge-Skill Balance : The runner experiences equality between situational challenges and personal skills , especially when challenges and skills are at a high level . Runners are certainly more likely to meet demands with required skills when demands are exceptionally low . For example , Dathan Ritzenhein certainly has the skill to jog at 7:30 pace to recover from a workout if Alberto Salazar asks him to do this . Yet that does n't mean Dathan will experience the flow state since his skills meet the demands of the workout . The flow state is far more enjoyable when the demands are high . So if Salazar asks Ritz to run an 18 mile tempo run at 5:00 pace and Ritz nails the pace , running more effortlessly than he expects , he will most certainly experience flow. - <p> Flow can be mysterious and difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do to increase the likelihood that they will experience the flow state . The easy way to experience flow is to feel good on every run and to hit each workout , even the most challenging ones , with relative ease . This would be the way to match skill with demands . Yet this is easier said than done . Those that run regularly and train heavily realize that effortless feelings while running at challenging paces are difficult to come by , and even more difficult to explain . It is far easier to change mental focus before and during running to increase the likelihood that you will experience flow . Before you run , drop any preconceived expectations that you will have some phenomenal performance . This lessens the level of challenge and makes it more likely that your physical skills on that day will be able to match the challenge , even if you feel suboptimal . By lessening your focus on performance you will allow yourself to enjoy running for its own sake , thereby increasing the likelihood that you will have an autotelic experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than dissociate ( as discussed in a prior column ) . This will increase the level of action-awareness merging , concentration on the task at hand , and will promote a loss of self-consciousness . It is difficult to do anything that increases the likelihood that you will experience a transformation of time and this is in fact the most illusive component of flow . Yet if you focus on altering the other components , transformation of time may come . You certainly can not expect to experience flow on a daily basis if you do these things , but you may increase your chances of achieving the state . But a flow experience may provide a great boost of confidence and may be the most positive emotional state in all of running ( Csikszentmihalyi , 1990 ) , so it is certainly an experience to strive for. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

@@23249761 @3249761/ <h> What Does Water Do For The Body ? <p> By now , you 've probably heard that our bodies are- primarily made up of water , and you might have even- made a New Year 's Resolution or two to drink more every day . <p> But even with that common knowledge , as many as 75 percent of Americans are still not getting enough water . In this daily- battle against a chronic state of dehydration , it 's important to understand water 's impact on the body . <p> In all , water has seven main functions : transporting , dissolving , cleaning , reacting , padding , and regulating temperature . <p> Let 's break each of those down and see how water keeps our bodies operating smoothly . <h> Transporting <p> An adult human body is composed of over 60 percent water , which would account for- 90lbs in a 150lb person. - A- lot of that water is- attached to molecules , such as proteins and carbohydrates , or- inside of- cells . <p> Much like ships carrying cargo up and down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for- growth and repair- in these cells- throughout our bodies . It also relays important chemical messages from hormones and clears out cell waste products , such as carbon dioxide . <h> Dissolving <p> If you 've ever washed the dishes ( I really hope you 've done this at least once ! ) , you 've discovered that water is a powerful solvent that can dissolve most substances . The one thing that water ca n't dissolve is- lipids , which are- a- group- of molecules such as fats , oils , and waxes . Luckily , our bodies are super clever and have worked out a way to surround water-insoluble molecules with proteins so they can be transported with water . <h> Cleaning <p> When water passes through the body , it flushes through the five main organs involved in the elimination process that help clean out harmful organisms , chemicals , and substances . These organs are the liver , kidneys , intestines , lungs , and skin . Each of the organs is dependent on the availability of water to run its processes , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying and filtering products through the intestines , removing toxic gases , and eliminating toxins through our sweat . <h> Reacting <p> The body is big bag of chemical reactions , and water is big part of making them happen . In some cases water has to be broken down , or hydrolyzed , to help these chemical reactions take place . For example , when sugar ( sucrose ) is digested into fructose and glucose , water is hydrolyzed as a part of this reaction . <h> Lubricating <p> Without water , we 'd sound like the wooden floorboards in an old Victorian house . We would also be in a lot of pain ! Water-based lubrication is used throughout our body to moisten and lubricate joints , the digestive tract , and- even our lungs . When we breathe , our lungs are using a water-based lubricant called surfactant that aids in their opening and closing movements . <h> Padding <p> Water acts as a padding or shock absorber for our joints , keeping the two ends of the joint from smashing into one another as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our vertebrae in the spine , the vertebral discs are mostly filled with water , allowing us to bend and twist without the pain of the bones grinding together . <h> Regulating <p> In a study done on Ironman athletes competing in Kona , Hawaii , it was found that athletes sweat an average of 1.1 to 2.2 liters per hour ! Water acts as a temperature regulator by releasing heat from the body through the blood vessels at the surface of the skin and then being dissipated through the skin- as sweat . The water evaporating from the body as sweat also helps cool it . <p> So , how much water are you drinking per day ? Hopefully , we 've shed some light on why you are constantly hearing that you should drink more water . If not , I 'll leave you with this last little tidbit -- the smallest amount of water required to excrete bodily waste products is 500 mL or about two cups of water per day . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

@@23249764 @3249764/ <p> It should be pointed out that when people address this kind of question , they usually go to the extreme . When you 're reading studies or articles , make sure that you are digging into the details to see if they are working with a realistic amount of the product . For example , how many people eat a dozen whole eggs a day ? The answer : not many . Also , realize that there are " good " and " bad " aspects to almost everything , and moderation is usually key . <p> So , let 's take a look at just the facts about the incredible , edible egg . <p> One whole egg offers 78 calories , 5 grams of fat , less than 1 gram of carbohydrate , and 6 grams of protein . One egg also offers varying amounts of 13 essential vitamins and minerals , such as vitamins D and B12 , phosphorus , and riboflavin . <p> If putting on muscle is what you 're aiming for then eggs should definitely have a place at the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the few protein sources that have all nine essential amino acids , including leucine ( 1.075 grams per egg ) .

I 've done Murph at least 10 times with various approaches- from the hardest version possible ( weight vest + chest to bar pull ups + straight through ) to different strategies in partitioning the middle portion of the workout. - <p> With all that experience , there is one strategy which stands out as the best way to do Murph the quickest and with the easiest recovery : 50 rounds of 2/4/6 . <p> There are two problems most people have with this strategy is the transition time and keeping track of their rounds . If you can solve these two problems , this version of Murph is my pick for the best way to attack the workout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2/4/6 strategy , you avoid the biggest speed bump- in Murph : muscle endurance . Pull ups , push ups , and squats are all taxing from a muscle endurance stand point and that burn can slow you down or even stop you in your tracks on something like push ups . With small sets like 2/4/6 , you 're never even approaching your burnout on any of those movements and can therefore push the pace if you can handle it . <h> Keeping transitions quick <p> Keeping your transitions quick is key since you have a ton of chances to dilly dally and lose time . You need to set yourself up directly under a pull up bar and not move from that area at all . You jump up to do your two- pull ups , drop down into your push ups , and stand up into your six squats . Once you 're done with the squats , you jump right back up onto the bar and repeat. - <h> Knowing which round you 're on <p> This is a simple problem with a simple solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your splits and laps for you and this is where those functions come in handy . Set your smart phone on a box next to you and hit the lap or split button on the stop watch during your squats or use a training watch with a lap function to tell you how many splits you 've completed . <p> Simply put , this strategy- led to the fastest and easiest Murphs I 've ever done . As long as you stay focused , - keep track of your rounds , and push a manageable pace the entire time , you 'll crush it with this strategy . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704 
@@23249775 @3249775/ <p> Picture yourself under the weight of a heavy barbell for a moment . You 're going for a PR today , and you 'll need to do everything right to tip the odds in your favor . After walking the weight out , you take your stance , adjusting your feet to the proper width and angle . You squeeze the muscles of your back and trunk to brace for the descent , and finally you take a big , deep , breath . <p> While this can be a natural instinct for anyone lifting a heavy object , you may know it by another name -- a Valsalva maneuver . <p> Named after Dr. Antonio Valsalva in the 1700s , the Valsalva maneuver occurs when you try to exhale against a closed glottis , which is the opening between your vocal chords that is sealed off by a flap covering the airway so food does n't end up in there . <p> After you breathe in , little to no air escapes the closed glottis , and the pressure in the abdominal cavity is increased . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony vertebral column of your spine more resistant to shear forces . In short , your back is likely to wiggle under a challenging load and this is not disputed at all . <p> Unfortunately , many pros and bros alike have advised folks to not invoke the Italian doctor 's namesake for fear that the risk of stroke , aneurysm , or blood pressure is " too high . " If you do a Valsalva you 'll surely have a stroke or blow a blood vessel and die , right ? Wrong . <p> You see , like most things in the human body , the response to the Valsalva maneuver is nuanced and extraordinarily complex . ( Editor 's note : while all the details behind the Valsalva 's physiology and related epidemiology is beyond the scope of this article , we are fortunate enough to be able to link you to a 17-page article written by Jonathon Sullivan , MD , PhD , who also happens to be a Starting Strength Coach . ) That said , here 's the quick and dirty on why both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sorely mistaken . <p> Yes , blood pressure increases during a Valsalva with values greater than 300mmHg ( the top number ) . If that seems high to you , then you 've been paying attention because the current recommendation is for most folks ' systolic blood pressure to be less than 140 and closer to 120mmHg . Again , there is no contention that performing a Valsalva increases blood pressure during exercise to a greater degree than without it . <p> That said , do we really see increased incidences of strokes , aneurysms or a greater risk of high-blood pressure secondary to doing the Valsalva ? The short answer is no , no , and absolutely not . <p> You see , there are two types of strokes , hemorrhagic ( bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel ) or strokes from ischemia , which is when there is a lack of blood flow to an area of the brain due to a clot or an embolism . <p> For hemorrhagic strokes in the context of resistance training , we 're really talking about subarachnoid hemorrhages ( SAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types are due to trauma like getting hit in the head with a baseball bat , a car accident , or falling -- stuff that does n't usually happen in a gym -- the biggest risk of SAH is having a large pre-existing aneurysm . Interestingly , the medical literature does not suggest that doing a Valsalva increases the size of one of these aneurysms , nor does it suggest that holding your breath actually makes them rupture .

In fact , resistance training actually lowers blood pressure consistently .

To start any project you need some sort of capital . As an independent filmmaker you must play the role of producer and market your film not only to an audience , but to financiers . There are several art grants in existence for filmmakers , but many of them are closed to students . The case these grant boards make is that a student has open resources provided by their academic institution ( cameras , studio space , editing lab , computer software etc ... ) and an independent filmmaker is independent in the truest sense of the word . It was great having the safety net of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell that our department chair was going to let a twenty-one year old take a few thousand dollars worth of camera gear into the wilderness for six weeks , six hundred miles away from school . I was back to square one , broke , without a camera , and my move to Maine rapidly approaching . After hours of brainstorming I decided to go with corporate sponsorship . In exchange for screen time companies would exchange money to finance the film . I was pumped , I put a proposal together and sent it out to everyone that I could . I 'm sure my proposal ended up in many spam folders , but I was able to get a few bites . Eventually I was able to raise enough money between outside financiers and a yard sale when I moved out of my apartment ( so long Xbox ) . <p> - <p> The summer goes by , we laugh , we film , we get fit , and high-5 's are at an all time high .

I spoke with our compliance officer and he revealed to me that I was soliciting funds as a student-athlete . He said it was simply because of my name . I played by the rules , my proposal promoted me as a filmmaker , made no mention of my running credentials , and even included a cinematography reel demonstrating my ability to execute various camera maneuvers . I felt robbed . Robbed of a year that I had been working for my entire college career and for what ? Working on a senior thesis project that 's not required for graduation . Taking on a project where I 'm compensated four credits for 20 hours of work a week for a calendar year . Going above and beyond what I 'm supposed to ?

But , to have the opportunity to compete for my University stripped from me because I went a different route , that did n't settle with me. - <p> - <p> We came to the conclusion that if I paid back all the financiers that my eligibility would be reinstated . Fortunately my parents were willing to help out ( I did n't raise that much money to begin with ) . I was happy , I could run , I could make my movie . The only thing that bothered me is that I was seeing no compensation for all the work I was putting in . Binghamton University was great , but I have school loans , masseuse bills , and Brooks Radius receipts littering my bedroom floor .

What kickstarter does is they raise money for artists trying to fund a project . Kickstarter takes a 5% cut and that 's it ( they got ta eat too ! ) .

Kickstarter 's reasoning is that they do n't want to be responsible for a poor investment . If people are n't willing to invest in your project , its probably not very good anyway , right ?

The final two sessions of Nationals are devoted to the men 's Pan Ams trials and the women 's Olympic trials . Since the men have n't earned any spots to Rio yet , their trials will be aimed at selecting a team for Pan Ams in June . <p> The U.S men 's team ranking just was n't high enough in the past 2 years of World Championships to earn any . There was an unprecedented amount of positive doping results through the testing of the World Anti-Doping Agency at the 2015 World Championships in Houston , and if sanctions are upheld , it is theoretically possible that the U.S. might earn spots if they are taken from other countries , but as of now , we do n't have any . <p> We still do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continental Qualification Event ( Pan Am Championships ) this June in Cartagena , Colombia . USAW has specified 3 paths to determine who gets to go to the Olympics . Paths 1 &amp; 2 have to do with assigning Olympic team slots earned through placement at the last two World Championships ( of which we have none ) . Path 3 specifies that in this situation , should we earn a spot at the 2016 Pan Am Championships , it will be given to the athlete that places highest at that event , and therefore earns us the most team points . So as of now , any male athlete with visions of competing in the 2016 Olympic Games needs to be on the Pan Am team . Even if we end up getting more Olympic spots due to doping sanctions , the athlete that gains the spot through Pan Ams is likely to keep it . <p> This means getting onto the Pan Am team has taken on a great deal of importance . USAW has projected each athletes placement at Pan Ams within their own weight class by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the top 25 athletes in their weight class at the last 2 World Championships . The team will be 8 athletes and 2 alternates . <h> The Current Pan Am Team <p> Without any Olympic spots as of yet , the trials session at Senior Nationals has become a Pan Ams Qualification trial . Any athlete that wishes to be on the Pan Am team must score a total high enough to bump an athlete off of this list . Rules stipulate that the U.S. can not bring more than 2 athletes in any particular weight class . <h> The Contenders <p> All 10 athletes currently ranked on the team will be attending trials- in an effort to respond to any total achieved by one of the other lifters who could threaten their placement on the Pan Am team . Here are the 6 other contenders : <h> Angelo Bianco ( 77 ) <p> - Angelo wins my tough spot award . His current total of 323kg@77kg actually ranks higher than C.J. Cummings , however the presence of Leo Hernandez and Travis Cooper in his weight class makes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third 77 . Angelo 's 327 total as a slightly heavy 85kg lifter at the IWF Grand Prix in Kazan this past March is n't high enough to bump either 85 off the list either . So he has two athletes in each weight class he has competed in above him . His best chance of making the team would be for him to beat Leo Hernandez 's 327 at the trials . <h> D'Angelo Osorio ( 105 ) <p> D'Angelo is just on the outside looking in . D'Angelo is projected to place in the same position at Pan Ams as C.J. Cummings ( 24th ) , but loses the tiebreak ( % of the next higher total on the list ) . The good news is that Wes Kitts is the only 105 ranked on the team , so D'Angelo needs to put 4kg onto his total and make a 363 to bump C.J. off of the team . <h> Norik Vardanian ( 94 ) <p> On paper Norik looks to have a steep hill to climb Both the 2nd and 3rd ranked athletes on the list are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . In December he put up a 373 total at the President 's Cup in Grozny setting American record in the snatch ( 171 ) and total along the way , which would place him above both Farris and Burns , bumping Burns off the team . He recently posted an incredible looking 173kg snatch on social media as well . <h> Donovan Ford ( 105 ) <p> The wildcard 105 , Donovan put up a 370 total at the 2015 Senior Nationals in Dallas , and a 363 weighing 108kg at the IWF Grand Prix in Kazan . Either of which would place him on the team with the current rankings . <h> Spencer Moorman ( 105 ) <p> The fourth 105 at the Pan Am trials , is also just on the outside with a 366 total from 2015 Senior Nationals . The 105s are absolutely going to be putting it all out there at trials with Kitts , Osorio , Ford and Moorman all with a legitimate chance at making the Pan Am team . It looks fairly clear that of the 4 , the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the team . <h> Cameron Swart ( 105+ ) <p> Out of Houston , Cameron Swart has a posted 385 entry total going into trials . Swart is only the second superheavy that will be attending trials , and as one of the last athletes that will hit the platform he will know exactly what numbers he would need to hit in order to take one of the 10 spots . Cameron has an excellent chance of making the team . A 374 total projects to place 23rd in the projections , which would be enough to bump C.J. Cummings off of the team . <p> The action is sure to be amazing . The 94s and 105s are sure to be the classes to watch , and I would n't be surprised to see the American record snatch in either class fall at trials in May . <p> Reporting contributed by Neil Kanterman. - Neil is a masters athlete that found weightlifting through CrossFit on the far side of 40 years old. - He coaches with Danny Camargo of Team Oly Concepts in South Florida when he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2016 National Masters Champion in the 45-49 year old 105kg class . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

His 7th place finish at Big 12s was impressive . The only concern for Iowa State is that things might get harder for guys like Edward Kemboi , Alex Dillenbeck , and Brian Llamas over 10k . But no matter , I am on the Martin Smith bandwagon and these guys will be ready to roll when it matters this weekend at the Midwest Regional . <p> 29 - Florida 565 The Gators might have one of the most underrated 1-2 punches up front in the country . Jimmy Clark and Mark Parrish are both very capable athletes that proved it this weekend at SECs helping lead Florida to a 2nd place team finish behind Arkansas ( Clark was 5th and Parrish 8th ) . Clark has PRs of 13:58 and 29:08 and Parrish has run 14:02 and 8:42 in the 3kST . Those two low sticks should carry them a long way heading into the championship portion of the season , including the South Regional . <p> Eddie Garcia makes for a nice no. 3 and Carlos Miranda and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see Clark take home the South Region individual title in nine days . <p> 28 - Arizona State 557 A surprise team that has been really close to making their way onto the national scene and rankings is Arizona State . The Sun Devils have a nice set of interchangeable parts that after no. 1 runner Garrett Seawell , seemingly move around quite a bit from race to race . <p> Ryan Herson , Garrett Baker-Slama , Steven Schneiders , and former prep phenom Bernie Montoya are all solid runners . Plus , Montoya has improved in every race this season . If the Sun Devils have another good day at the West Region , they look like a nice surprise team to make it to Terre Haute coming out of a tough region . <p> 27 - Washington 552 After losing by only two points to Arizona State at Pac-12s ( with regular no. 2-3 man Meron Simon passing out on the course ) , the Huskies are actually finding more depth as the season progresses . <p> Portland transfer Jacob Smith had his first good outing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron Nelson had a pretty good , but not great day finishing 8th . With Simon inserted into the mix and Izaic Yorks and Andrew Gardner getting better along with steady Tyler King , the Huskies should be able to roll at the West Regional in less than two weeks and get themselves to the Big Dance . <p> 26 - Air Force 530 Another surprise showing this conference weekend was out of Colorado Springs where Air Force looked very good running on their home course at the Mountain West Conference meet . Placing 3rd behind New Mexico and Colorado State and beating a good and formerly ranked Boise State team , the Falcons ran their best race of the year at home . <p> Isaiah Bragg was outstanding , beating out Luke Caldwell of New Mexico for the individual title . The Falcons have found some depth as 1500m standout from this past spring Zach Perkins is figuring out how to manage 8k and hopefully 10k . Patrick Corona has also been a very good no. 2 behind Bragg for most of the year . Air Force has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team qualifying region out of the Mountain. - <p> 25 - Notre Dame 528 A big time run from normal no. 2 man Martin Grady ( 5th individually ) , who stepped up to be the the lowest stick for the Irish and helped Notre Dame edge out Virginia for 3rd at the ACC Conference meet . The good news for the Irish is that even though- Jeremy Rae had a sub-par race , they were still able to put together a decent team performance . Rae is pretty solid over 10k ( especially for a miler ) and with him and Grady up front , the Irish are solid . If the team can get their 1-5 spread a bit closer together , they will improve the larger the race gets . Next up : Great Lakes Regional <p> 24 - Wisconsin 526Malachy Schrobilgen 's Big 10 individual title was the one major highlights from the conference weekend for the Badgers as they had to watch a different team take the Big 10 team title home for the first time in fourteen years . Wisconsin was able to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three spots out in 23rd . <p> I still really think that Rob Finnerty is such a huge wildcard for the Badgers . If he can place 49th at NCAAs in 2012 , he should be able to do something similar if not better this year ( if healthy ) . Wisconsin will have a chance for payback at the Great Lakes Regional ( although both Wisco and Indiana should cruise--they have plenty of points ) and should make Nats for the 40th straight time. - <p> 23 - Providence 515 The Friars kept things close this past weekend at the Big East Champs , finishing second by only 13 points to Villanova . Maybe the biggest surprise for Providence is that Shane Quinn was not their lowest stick like he has been all season long . Northeastern transfer Brian Doyle was the top Friar finishing 3rd individually and Ben Connor was their no. 2 finisher placing 5th . If Quinn could return to form , then Providence has three very solid possible low-sticks at Regionals and Nationals . The Northeast Region is a pig this year and will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their spot at the Big Dance in Terre Haute. - <p> 22 - Villanova 513 Freshman phenom Pat Tiernan continues his outstanding season for ' Nova as he was able to take home the individual title honors from the Big East Conference meet this weekend . He was also able to assist in winning the team title as well . Villanova has four very talented athletes in Tiernan , Sam McEntee , Jordy Williamsz , and Robert Denault , who are all capable of quality performances at Regionals and Nationals . <p> In fact , Villanova is the reigning Mid-Atlantic Regional Champs from last year where McEntee and Williamsz both ran outstanding races . Hopefully the Wildcats can help themselves by not crushing the regional meet like they did last year and save themselves for a much stronger finish in Terre Haute. - <p> 21 - Colorado State 494 Colorado State is the highest ranked team in the country that still no one knows about . Many believed that the early success of the Rams was a fluke and that it would n't happen again ( I was skeptical myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no low sticks . Either way , anyone who believed they were a fluke are definitely wrong . <p> Although Colorado State did not take home the Mountain West Conference team title , they were only 19 points back from a quality New Mexico team . The most jarring statistic of the weekend for the Rams was their ridiculous : 7 second spread from 1-5 . There may be no other team in the country who can get all five of their scorers to finish within that tight of a window . This will serve them well as the meets get bigger , as long as they can get out well and keep themselves in the top one-third of the race throughout .

Kebede was kicking the heels of the rabbits as he hung tightly to the pace early one . Once the pacemakers dropped out at mile 16 , Kebede went to the front and pushed on towards the finish . He was challenged by fellow Ethiopians Feyisa Lilesa , Tilahun Regassa , and Sammy Kitwara of Kenya towards the end of the race . <p> In the final miles , only Lilesa and Kebede remained , but Kebede pulled ahead at mile 25 and convincingly turned for home to take the victory at the 2012 Bank of America Chicago Marathon . <p> Kebede 's winning time of 2:04:38 is the 10th fastest marathon of all-time . <p> Dathan Ritzenhein carefully executed his race plan by staying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritz finished in 2:07:50 , which is a two minute personal best for him in the marathon .

Dathan Ritzenhein ( 2:09:55 ) - He 's healthy and ready to roll . His plan is go out conservatively in 63 or 64 through 13.1 miles , but Ritz has the ability to pop a big race when everything goes right . <p> 2 . Jimmy Grabow ( 2:12:35 ) - Ran his debut marathon at the U.S. Olympic Trials , where he finished 10th in 2:12.29 . That time was the 12th fastest American debut of all-time . <p> 4 .

The field went through a bit slow in 5:05 . Ritz is right up front . I guess it 's better to go out in 5:05 than 4:30 . <p> Mile 2 Split - 9:48 ( 4:43 ) Pace - 2:08 Big second mile . They pack as picked it up and ran a 4:42 for the second mile . Good to see that they want to go for it today . Everyone is still up there .

He 's always run well when he 's conservative early on . As long as he has Hartmann to pace and break the win , he 'll be alright for now ... He 'll have to make a big race decision in a few miles . <p> Mile 6 Split - 28:54 ( 29:55 for 10k ) Pace - 2:06:11 <p> Yami , Korir , and Kitwara are in the front pack . Hartmann and Ritz are beginning to make up some ground , but not too much .

Everything still the same as the men 's leaders zigzag through the streets of Chicago .

The last two 10k splits were 29:55 and 29:45 . It 's been a very subtle increase in the pace and if this continues , the course record will be in jeopardy . <p> ( Photo : Eric Finan ) <p> Mile 14 Split - 1:07:11 Pace - 2:05:43 <p> It looks like Hartmann is gone and Ritz is with a chase pack of four other men . If any of these guys starts to drop off the pace ( 2:07 right now ) , Ritz will be alone . When we talked to the elite field , we feared that Ritz would be stuck in " no man 's land " between the other Americans the lead group .

Crazy . <p> Mile 16 Split - 1:16:47 Pace - 2:05:44 <p> The pacemakers have dropped out . It 's Ndungu and Kebede leading the front pack . The last 5k split was 14:54 . Everyone in the media room feels that a big surge should happen in the next few miles . <p> Mile 17 Split - 1:21:25 Pace - 2:05:28 <p> Aaaaannnnddd here we go . Kebede and Ndungu both love to run from the front and they 've injected some pace at mile 17 . Kebede has so much experience and always seems to be competitive in all of his races .

Regassa is on his shoulder , but he looks like he 's in a bit of pain . A 4:37 mile at the end of a marathon will do that to a man . <p> The cracks in the armor are starting to show for some of the men . Kebede has been relentless from the front in the last few miles and the leaders are starting to dwindle down . <p> Mile 20 <p> Split - 1:35:15 Pace - 2:04:47 <p> Normally I 'm annoyed with weather updates , but I 'm okay with it in Chicago . The men 's race is absolutely incredible . The ten mile splits have been- 48:06 and 47:09 . We 're flirting with a sub-2:05 marathon in Chicago this morning . Dare I say it ... close to world record pace ? Let 's not get ahead of ourselves yet . The last six miles are the hardest . <p> Mile 21 <p> ( Photo : Eric Finan ) <p> Split - 1:39:48 Pace - 2:04:30 <p> " Regassa looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has botox injections with that stoic face .

They just showed Ritz running past someone who dropped off the lead pack . Regassa throws in a HUGE surge and even though his face says that he 's hurting , his legs say that he 's ready to roll . <p> Mile 23Split - 1:49:08 ( 4:36 last mile ) Pace - 2:04:19 <p> It 's down to the medal men . Kebede , Regassa , and Lilesa . All three Ethiopians are up front . It looked as Regassa was going to pay for his big move , but he latched onto his countrymen and it hanging tough . Kebede and Lilesa look so smooth . <p> Update : Regassa is starting to get dropped by Kebede and Lilesa . It 's going to be down two the two . <p> We 're watching history in Chicago right now . The second half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1:53:51 ( 4:43 last mile ) Pace - 2:04:17 <p> The Ethiopian Federation must be questioning their Olympic Marathon team decisions right now . Kebede is just started to break away from Lilesa . He 's looked incredible from the gun . We 're on pace for the sixth fastest marathon of all-time . <p> Mile 25 <p> ( Photo : Eric Finan ) <p> Split - 1:58:41 ( 1:57:59 for 40k ) Pace - 2:04:22 <p> Lilesa looked like he was ready to go , but Kebede anticipated his move and now has opened a small gap . Two years ago , Wanjiru broke Kebede on the hill and it looks like he 's learned his lesson . Kebede was- 1:59:41 with one mile to go . <p> Kebede earned this victory today . He 's lead , thrown in surges , and has n't backed down to any challenges . Lilesa fought the good fight , but Kebede was just too much . <p> Finish - 2:04:382:03:36 for 6 miles Kebede is the first Ethiopian male to win .

The day we both went there to check it out though and talk with the park manager , the manager suggested , ' Why not hold an event , like a competition , here ? ' We had n't thought about it at all--after all most competitions I had been to as an athlete seemed pretty disorganized and like a big undertaking--something I did n't really want to be a part of . As I thought about it a bit more though , I thought , ' Why not ?

You 'll tear calluses , your biceps , or maybe your labrum . You 'll pop blisters or perhaps an Achilles . You 'll slip and fall off a pull up rig or you 'll slip a disc . Hell , you might even die . But is n't that an integral part of what we 're looking for ? <p> CrossFit grew dramatically in the early 2010s largely because of its bad boy image . It 's " extreme " and " hardcore " . In some ways it was the Dave 's Insanity Hot Sauce of fitness ; it dared you to try it and immediately set you apart when you did . Even today when we tell people we CrossFit they 're quick to tell us all the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gyms sell sterile , " safe " , and isolated exercise . You wait for an available machine , you read and execute the conveniently placed instructions , and you definitely do n't make any noise or talk to anyone . When you 're done with your 3 sets of 12 reps and 20 minutes cardio you buy some chemical concoction from the front desk before going home to eat pizza and sit on the couch knowing you 've completed your civic duty of physical activity for the day . <p> The commercial gym model apparently comes with lots of safety ( which is arguable considering the tens of thousands of emergency room visits linked to treadmills every year ) , but with very little in the way of effectiveness . CrossFit focuses on how effective it is at building better humans . Move better , eat better , be better . Married to that effectiveness is the feeling of being on the edge and from a marketing standpoint selling excitement through risk is incredibly effective . <p> Getting hurt while doing something does n't automatically mean that activity is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more a badge of honor than an indictment of CrossFit . Suffering from a heavy case of delayed onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) gives you a reason to tell your coworkers why you 're limping so hard ( " No seriously , it 's a mile run then 100 pull-ups , 200 push-ups , and 300 squats , and then another mile run " ) . This is the type of social currency CrossFit embodies : being a badass without actually having to prove it in a dangerous environment. - <p> CrossFit does not include the actual presence of danger , but instead the experience of fight or flight , of pumping adrenaline . It does n't put its participants in any more danger than other fitness activities ( in fact , it 's most likely significantly safer than other forms of exercise ) , but it carries and markets its hardcore nature very well . CrossFitters get their asses kicked every day , embracing the feeling of crawling out of the gym having given every ounce of themselves to their workout , and they proudly wear t-shirts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday " ) showing off how badass they are . All this " danger " is present without the actual deaths that exist other " extreme " activities like skydiving or base jumping ( think of how common it is to hear about high level skydivers and base jumpers to die while doing their thing , then try to think of the last high level CrossFitter who died while competing ) . <p> The faux danger leads to a specific attitude and expression of cool . CrossFitters strut their CrossFitness kinda how smokers strut smoking . Where smokers posture up and tell everyone around them they 're " trying to quit " , CrossFitters put on a show about being sore and eating Paleo . Much like the " cool " of smoking in the 90s ( even Romeo smoked in the 90s ) , CrossFit has become the bleeding edge of cool meeting dangerous ( even Wolverine CrossFits in the 21st century ) . - <p> The mindset involved in CrossFit is n't unique , but it 's now more widespread than it 's ever been before . Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforcement can all tell you what it 's like to push the edge of performance with real possibilities of danger lurking around the corner . CrossFit has managed to capture an incredible experience : the vicarious exposure to fight or flight . Much like CrossFit boxes are affiliates to CrossFit HQ , offering marginally individualized interpretations of a philosophical approach to fitness , CrossFit is an offshoot of primal experiences like hunting and fighting except without the possibility of getting kicked by a wooly mammoth or punched in the face . <p> In itself there 's nothing really dangerous about high rep weightlifting , executing complex movements under fatigue , or handstand push ups . But CrossFit is n't just high rep snatches , tired muscle ups , or handstand push ups . It 's living at the end of your capabilities , constantly toeing the edge of the cliff , and competing against yourself and others all of which is done in the context of fitness , health , and self improvement . CrossFit is not dangerous , but it is at least in part the excitement of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course people do actually get hurt while CrossFitting , and you will to . Yes , shoulders dislocate and ACLs tear . Yes , some people get extreme cases of rhabdomyolysis and are hospitalized . In practice , these are exceedingly rare instances . The vast majority of us simply tear a callus , have some muscle or joint soreness , and occasionally underrecover to the point of fatigue , loss of sleep and appetite . In reality , most " injuries " that happen while CrossFitting are merely surrogates for more serious injuries ; they hurt enough to remind someone they 're skirting the danger zone while giving people the cool factor associated with sacrificing body and soul for fitness , and even providing a war story to tell their gym buddies over a NorCal margarita. - <p> By packaging fitness as an experience one survives and endures rather than an activity one merely participates in , CrossFit has created a movement that lends itself very easily to chatter . Everyone wants to tell you how safe or dangerous CrossFit is , everyone wants you to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savior sent to revolutionize the human race . CrossFitters by extension get to be part of this movement . They get- the exposure , the status , and- the attention , both positive and negative . They get to sacrifice for and endure their workouts and experience a modicum of danger . Best of all , it comes with all the sexiness and nearly none of the risk. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

With regard to his shorter distance PRs , we must remember that these days , many athletes like Nick are going to the marathon quickly after college and not worrying about their shorter distance times . The old concept of run as fast as you can at 5K and 10K then move up is n't financially possible for athletes like Nick . They have to go to the distance where they can survive financially and that 's certainly not the track . I 'm sure Nick could run much faster than his current 10K and half-marathon PRs , but he 's focused on the marathon and running faster at shorter distances is n't his priority . He 'll likely lower those times when he gets a chance to race a fast 10K and half-marathon .

The first 11 miles are run at marathon effort ( not pace since we are at altitude ) with the last 4 miles nearly all out . If an athlete is able to perform well in this workout while tolerating the mileage and other workouts in our marathon training plan , then there 's good chance of success in the marathon . Over the years , I 've gathered enough data from all the athletes in our program that I get an idea of what to expect on race day . What 's interesting , of course , is the individual variation . I know how Nick needs to perform to predict his time which is a bit different than how Brett Gotcher needs to perform to predict his time .

This review is written by Cliff Bogart , a CrossFitter and one of FloSports ' film editors who has put together some of FloElite 's best documentaries including Going Team : Inside CrossFit Games Training Camp . Here are his thoughts : - <p> The 2007 CrossFit Games are still shrouded in myth and legend because they are the only Games thus far not covered by CrossFit , Inc. with beginning-to-end , decent-quality , documentary-style media . And , with the exception of the 2008 Games ( Every Second Counts ) , all of said media thus far has been free . So the big question going into Fittest on Earth is , " will HQ step up their game a whole ' nother level with this whole ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing ? " And the answer to that question is : " not quite , but you should still buy it anyway because you are spoiled , and it was pretty darn good . " <p> We live in a Golden Age of documentary filmmaking , and the standards audiences have become accustomed to are high and getting higher . Great sports documentaries are starting to be created by actual filmmakers who are already successful making actual films out there in the wild . They are proven quantities . Heber Cannon , director of Froning ( 2015 ) and co-director/co-editor of Fittest on Earth , is , unfortunately , not quite there yet . He 's a nice a guy , no doubt friends with the folks at HQ , who does an alright job , but he 's a guy who needs a couple lessons in Documentary Filmmaking 101 , lessons you do n't learn in film school ( trust me , I know from experience ) , but that you do learn from getting a ton of reps in making documentary films for a living , hired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the folks at FloSports are great , but I 'm never more than one bad documentary away from getting my ass canned ) . Thus begins the lesson ... <p> Lesson One : black . It 's totally okay to cut-to-black , fade-to-black , **33;93;TOOLONG throughout your documentary . It allows the audience to catch their breath , put the previous section behind them , and get themselves mentally and emotionally prepared for the section that is to follow . It creates a sense of development , which is crucial if the audience is to feel they have been on a journey , one with a beginning , middle , and end ; a journey where the audience ends up in a fundamentally different place , narratively and emotionally , from where they began . There are other ways to do this than by the use of black , but it sure is the simplest . And it 's not like it adds a ton of runtime : a couple seconds will do . <p> Now , on first viewing , I do not think I can recall a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fittest on Earth : it 's just one section smashed into the next , smashed into the next , with nary a transition or reset . And , paradoxically , even though it adds a couple seconds of runtime here and there , the use of black actually creates the sense in the audience 's mind that the movie is shorter , not longer ; less boring , not more boring : like pacing yourself through a long , grueling hero WOD , even though it intuitively seems like it 'll take longer , for most folks it speeds them up and leaves them feeling fresher throughout the whole experience rather than having been through an endless slog . By providing the sense every few minutes that one is beginning something anew , the use of black ( or some other , more sophisticated method of transition ) gives the audience the illusion that they are not watching the same movie for two hours straight , but rather a series of short films , each distinct and refreshing . <p> Lesson Two : be ruthless . Documentary-film editing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the endless number of possibilities offered by endless hours of footage and no pre-written story to adhere to . Fittest on Earth appears to be operating under the impossible burden of comprehensiveness , covering every single one of the 13 events in great detail ( including the events where nothing dramatic or interesting happens ) , and relating tons of moments and anecdotes that have no relation to the major characters or larger developments . Which brings us to our next lesson , wherein we explore the selective mechanism by which one can be ruthless ... <p> Lesson Three : dramatic throughlines . They should be simple , and bold , and limited in number . They should be the basis upon which one takes a scalpel ( screw that , a hatchet ) to the endless hours of footage one has to deal with , selecting only those moments which relate to one 's larger goals . Some examples : Mat Fraser is the guy driven to be better than second best and who frustratingly ( and sometimes comically ) falls short of his goals despite his best efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " super genius " traps . Sara Sigmundsdottir is the bubbly and naive rookie , looking wide-eyed at all the bright lights around her , but who tastes crushing defeat for the first time in her life , thereby acquiring character and a chip on her shoulder that she will carry with her into the next year of competition . Annie Thorisdottir is the **25;128;TOOLONG former champ who 's body and soul are crushed by Murph , thereby causing her to sink into the Swamps of Sadness like Artax in The Neverending Story . <p> All of the above throughlines are awesome , and all of them are present in Fittest on Earth to some extent , but they are somewhat lost in an endless sea of LONG ... For example , EZ Muhammed is brought up exactly twice : one anecdote about him being " lost at sea " on the paddle-board , and one anecdote about him knocking himself out on the Snatch Ladder . - EZ Muhammed , love him though we do , is not a character in Fittest on Earth , does not have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments do not in any way relate to any of the actual characters or actual throughlines of Fittest on Earth : they just happen to happen . These are the kind of moments you cut in order to focus on the things that actually matter . How do we decide if something actually matters ? Something matters if-and-only-if it pertains ( directly or indirectly ) to the dramatic throughlines of the main characters . <p> By now what you 're probably all thinking is , " yadda , yadda , yadda with all this ' drama ' nonsense : what I want to know is should I spend my hard-earned money on iTunes in order to watch this thing ? " And the answer is , " fuck yes ! " The good people at HQ spent a ton of money on this thing , flew all over the world , recorded a mostly-original score with all sorts of wacky instruments , and the movie is full of tons of great moments and insights into the struggles of the athletes we all know and love . Despite its shortcomings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( maybe being a close second behind Froning ) , and for folks who spend $120-plus for each of their five pairs of exercise shoes ( you know you do ) , it 's well worth the money . <p> My complaints are only about what it could have been , not what it is . It could have been the kind of movie that plays at legit film festivals ; the kind that people not already part of the CrossFit Cult ( it 's a good cult , and I 'm a member ) might be interested in seeing ; the kind that spreads its reach beyond the limits of hardcore exercisers and into the wider culture . - Alas , that is not this movie . This is a challenge we run into here at FloSports as well : that balancing act between making content for hardcore fans while still appealing to a wider audience . Over time and with experience the quality of these documentaries will improve , even more , making entertainment not just for the CrossFit community but for the rest of the world too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edited for FloElite , our peak into the CrossFit Games Training for Invictus : 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Everywhere you turn , you hear " The programming sucks ! " or " Are you trying to kill these athletes ? " or " I liked Dave 's hair better with highlights " ( okay , you probably wo n't hear that last one from anyone ) . - <p> HQ does a good job of ignoring a lot of the noise out there because most of those complaints just are n't legitimate . Not a lot of people even understand what goes into making the Games happen and their complaints only highlight their ignorance to not only how the whole thing comes together but also how CrossFit HQ works . <p> ... But Sometimes They 're Right <p> That said , HQ needs to be able to separate the wheat from the chafe ( or whatever the gluten free version of that metaphor is ) . <p> While complaints of absolutely poor programming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are issues with how it all turned out . For example , every Games athlete was given a custom Assault Bike as a hint to what was to come ... and the bike was used for a total of 2 minutes in the whole weekend by maybe half the field. - <p> Instead of sending the athletes Assault Bikes , HQ should have sent every athlete a pair of pegs . This would have accomplished a few things including appropriately hinting at what was to come , giving the smarter Games athletes a small chance to practice something most of them had never touched before , and also limited an embarrassing moment for CrossFit when almost no women were able to finish even a single ascent of the pegboard . <p> The pegboard is a great tool for upper body development and a cool test for CrossFitters , but it 's not fun or interesting to watch 90% of the field fail to complete something . If they had sent the athletes a pair of pegs before the Games or hinted at the pegboard instead of playing up the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zig zag and few hurdles , hardly an obstacle at all ) , they would have accomplished a few things for HQ , but mainly- Pedal to the Medal 1 would have been more exciting to watch . <p> The Games are a sports entertainment event and they 're broadcast both online and on ESPN . Making the event fun and interesting to watch should be a huge priority . HQ has learned a lot about this since the Games first started and improved greatly in this matter , but apparently still needs help . Running and yoke carries are boring and people standing around staring at something is boring too . <p> ( As an addendum to this , it would have been more interesting to see the Games athletes struggling with something that 's actually novel and unique instead of something that is relatively common in a lot of training facilities . You just do n't want to have " the fittest men and women on the planet " to fail at something that a huge number of people could call easy . ) <p> Respect The Athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , HQ needs to be more respectful to the athletes and their time . The Games are an insanely difficult sporting event where almost every single competitor is an amateur . Most CrossFitters make CrossFit their career but do n't really make a whole ton of money through the competitions involved . In many ways these athletes are the best advertisement for CrossFit . They live and breathe CrossFit , they own , run , or coach at CrossFit affiliates , they teach the Level 1 Seminars , and the thanks they get from HQ is being used as an example of failure on national television . <p> The expectation should n't be to go easy on the athletes because the Games are about survival as much as they are about fitness , but HQ should be prepared to make the Games not only interesting to watch but also designed to make the competitors look good , within reason. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Women make up at least half of our weightlifting community , yet nearly all of the resources available are designed for male weightlifters . This forces most women to rely on training plans that simply are n't designed for their physiology . <p> I asked one of the best female weightlifters in the world , multiple-time world champion Nadezhda ( Nadia ) Evstyukhina , about topics she thinks women in weightlifting ( and their coaches ) should know to get the most out of their training . <p> Together , Nadia and I set out to cover each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design training plans for women <p> The differences in technique between men and women <p> How sex affects men vs. women before training or a competition- <p> This article is specifically about the first topic . <h> How to design training plans for women <p> The entire body must be strong for weightlifting . The maximum amount of weight that a lifter can snatch or clean and jerk is limited not by their strongest muscle groups , but by their weakest . If their legs are strong enough to pull 100kg , but their upper body is n't strong enough to support 100kg overhead , the lifter wo n't complete the lift . <p> Women typically have a harder time developing speed in their lower bodies and muscle mass in their upper bodies than men . The following points should be considered when designing training plans for female weightlifters : <h> Lower-body speed in female weightlifters <p> Jumping exercises , such as box jumps , are a great exercise for developing lower-body speed and explosiveness . Female weightlifters should use jumping exercises more frequently than men of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of training , female weightlifters should consider doing them during their warm up . <h> Upper-body muscle mass in female weightlifters <p> Building upper-body muscle mass is more difficult for women than for men . In addition , women are typically more flexible , which increases the likelihood of injury when working with heavy weights during certain exercises . It 's advised that during the base phase , women should perform full-body exercises that require a lot of upper-body strength with less weight ( as a percent of max ) but for more reps . This increases hypertrophy , strengthens joints , and reduces the risk of injury . <p> It is also advised that women perform several General Physical Preparation exercises per training session that specifically target the upper-body muscles used in weightlifting . These include the trapezius and tricep muscles , and the muscles of the shoulder joint , lumbar , and thoracic spine . <p> Nadia recommends the following GPP exercises to be performed frequently : <h> Designing a training plan <p> Below is a training plan designed for two lifters of the same level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 77kg male lifter , Adult Level-1 rank . The program on the right is written for a 58kg female lifter , also Adult Level-1 rank . <p> The two training plans for the male and female lifters are very similar . Both start with hyperextentions to warm up the back , have the same lower-body exercises ( at the same rep and weight ) , and finish the workout with ab exercises and stretching . <p> However , note that : <p> The box jumps are performed earlier in the workout for the female lifter because they are a higher-priority exercise for women , and deserve to be done when the body is not yet fatigued. - <p> Exercises that depend heavily on upper-body strength are performed at lower weights ( as a percentage of maximum ) for women than for men , but at higher volume ( more reps ) . - <p> GPP exercises that target the muscles that are harder for women to develop are performed instead of the more general-strength exercises performed by the male lifter . <p> As seen in these two plans , female @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower average intensity ) , but perform more reps than the men . The higher volume ( Intensity x- reps ) aids in hypertrophy and reduces the risk of injury ; - however , it also requires women to focus on recovery activities more than men . <p> Female weightlifters should visit the sauna and receive massages more often than men- to loosen tight muscles , increase blood flow to wash away free radicals , and increase the amount of nutrients passing through the recovering muscles . <h> Programming for female weightlifters during menstruation <p> - Female weightlifters and their coaches should know how a training plan should be adjusted during menstruation . Women generally fall into one of two categories : <p> Women who have fewer symptoms and do n't experience much discomfort .

In this week 's technique focus , Everett discusses the importance of strategizing a training plan designed for the specific individual athlete. - <p> I would n't say that weightlifting requires high-volume and frequency training , but certainly it 's a common approach . It 's also important to acknowledge that volume and frequency are relative , and what 's high to one athlete may be moderate or even low for another . Within my own gym I have some lifters who thrive on 400-500 reps per week , while others can handle only 200 or fewer , and this does n't always align with age. - <p> - <p> The snatch , clean and jerk are more complex than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the degrees of technical skill involved in the two pursuits are not even comparable . I do n't say this to disparage powerlifting or powerlifters in any way , but it 's an unavoidable truth , and it plays a role in training differences . This being the case , it 's obvious that in order to master the competitive lifts , far more time and far more quality reps in the competition lifts must be performed by the weightlifter than the powerlifter . Weightlifting is a unique sport in that the lifts inextricably link the motor qualities of precise movement and timing with strength and speed . Powerlifting has a huge strength component , but minimal skill ; something like pitching a baseball has a huge skill component , but minimal strength . People are not usually resistant to the idea of a baseball pitcher throwing a lot of balls in a day , week , month or year , because the need to practice the skill is obvious . The skill of weightlifting is not as obvious because most people are viewing it from a perspective largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> Next , there is an issue of adaptation . Anything you do that is a sudden and significant increase in volume , intensity or frequency is going to hurt . The key is that elite weightlifters did n't begin training 6 days a week with 600 reps ; the best of the best spend years developing in well-designed programs that allowed them to build the conditioning for this volume of work . Do drugs play a role in many cases ? It 's inarguable that drug use will allow you to train heavier with more volume and frequency , but being drug free does not mean you ca n't adapt to high volume and frequency ( just not as high and not as quickly ) . You 're able to walk every day without a problem . That 's leg training seven days a week ; but you 're adapted to that particular intensity and volume level . The same thing can be accomplished with lifting to a great extent. - <p> - <p> The snatch and clean &amp; jerk are less systemically taxing than squats and deadlifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximal effort , although in many cases , not that much smaller . This alone means they can be done more frequently by anyone . The classic lifts also overwhelmingly train neurological adaptations rather than morphological ones , which also means you 're not waiting around for tissue remodeling between workouts like a bodybuilder . Also , complete recovery between training sessions is not something that the weightlifter is necessary striving for ; instead , you 're looking at blocks of training sessions to create a cumulative effect. - <p> - <p> Training multiple consecutive days also does n't mean that every day is maximal intensity and volume . Day to day volume and intensity should fluctuate to allow some degree of restoration . Even Bulgarian-style purists--including the originator of the system Ivan Abadjiev--use such modulation day to day . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

@@23249842 @3249842/ <h> Europe 's Strongest Man 2017 Recap <p> As 10,000 fans flooded into the First Direct Arena on Saturday , the air was heavy with speculation at who would be leaving Leeds , England , with the crown of Europe 's Strongest Man . <p> Following a few last-minute replacements in the lineup -- a reminder to all of the brutal toll that competing at this level puts on the body -- all 11 athletes in attendance looked in phenomenal shape and hungry for the title . <p> However , none looked as supremely confident throughout the competition as Hafthor Bjornsson , who battled through a form of temporary facial paralysis called Bell 's palsy to capture his third Europe 's Strongest Man title . <p> Bjornsson , who announced on Friday he had been recently diagnosed with the virus but would still compete , reclaimed the ESM title a year after losing the crown to Laurence Shahlaei by winning three individual events and finishing no lower than second in each discipline . Bjornsson totaled 63 points in his virtuoso performance to edge England 's Eddie Hall by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tie with Poland with seven all-time wins . <h> Event 1 - Bus Pull <h> Winner : Hafthor Bjornsson <p> This brutal first event had been kept a closely guarded secret by the athletes and Giants staff , and it did not disappoint . The athletes were faced with the arduous task of pulling a huge double-decker bus up a 20m incline . With a time cap of only 60 seconds , they were always going to be up against it . In fact , only one man was able to finish the course inside that time limit -- the monstrous Hafthor Bjornsson . <p> As he leveraged every ounce of his enormous body weight against the harness , Bjornsson looked unstoppable , completing all 20m in 32.52 . The veteran and truck-pull legend Terry Hollands was close behind , finishing less than a meter short , as did the beast Eddie Hall . After that , though , the only competitors to even come close were youngsters Matjaz Belsak and Konstantine Janashia , who managed 18.65m and 18.47 , respectively . <h> Event 2 - Max Axle <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot to live up to , having replaced the World Deadlift Championships , which was arguably one of the most anticipated events in the strength calendar . It was a bold move by Giants Live but one that paid off tenfold with Hall once again defying everyone 's expectations by taking a new world record . <p> For those not familiar with the Apollon 's Axle , it was one of the most challenging overhead events in the sport . The two-inch-thick bar , which is unknurled and non-rotating , requires the mightiest of grip just to part from the floor , not to mention the shoulder strength needed to press 160-plus kilos . It was a fact that the crowd was reminded of when Dainis Zageris was unable to even get the opening weight of 160kg overhead , followed Adam Bishop suffering a torn bicep in the process of hitting 160kg . <p> Terry Hollands did n't fair much better much to the dismay of the crowd , which cheered the Englishman on madly . Unfortunately , he was unable to go heavier than the opening 160kg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost ground from the bus pull pushed on , securing 180kg . Even the reigning champion 's best efforts , though , could n't match Thor and Hall . Bjornsson finished in second with an Icelandic record of 206kg , and Hall strict-pressed a 216kg for a new world record . <h> Event 3 - Tire and Drag <h> Winner : Hafthor Bjornsson <p> The tire flip is one of the most feared events in strongman . Not only is it an exhausting movement that taxes every single muscle in the body and scorches the lungs , but it also can put the athlete at risk of a bicep tear . Partner this brutal movement with a killer anchor drag and you are in for an exercise in pain management . Sadly , it was enough to finish off Shahlaei , who had been suffering badly from a virus before the event and wisely withdrew from the contest . - <p> Luke Stoltman , keen to show that he still could be a serious contender after struggling on the first two events , went out like a madman , completing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotsman showing how it 's done , the others had to step up their games , and they did just that . Most notably , Bjornsson stormed through the course in 29.06 seconds , his gigantic 200kg frame making the tire almost look like a toy . <h> Event 4 - Deadlift Reps <h> Winner : Eddie Hall <p> While there may not have been a max deadlift this year , it would n't be a strongman competition without at least a deadlift event of some form or another . With Hall having raised the deadlift standard several levels last year by pulling 500kg , it was no surprise that the promoters this year put up a heavy weight for reps . At this standard , though , even 362.5kg is n't that imposing of a weight . An early standout was the Georgian Bull , Konstantine Janashia , who gave the fans a glimpse of what he is capable of by pulling six comfortable reps , narrowly losing out to the former deadlift king Mark Felix 's seven . <p> No one , though , could beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gym warming up than on one of the biggest stages in the world , repping out 10 deadlifts to take the win . Thor , however , put in a valiant effort and pulled eight reps to keep himself in the lead , proving that height is no disadvantage in the deadlift . <h> Deadlifts for Reps- Results <h> Event 5 - Car Walk <h> Winner : Hafthor Bjornsson <p> With the world record-holder on the event and reigning champion Shahlaei forced to retire from the competition with an injury , the car walk was anyone 's to take . Hollands gave it a great shot early on sprinting down the 20m course with the Volkswagen Beetle in an impressive 14.08 seconds . <p> Holland 's mark stood for a long time , even against some impressive efforts from the likes of Mark Felix and Matjaz Belsak . It could n't , however , hold up against Thor and Hall , who at this point seemed to just be competing against themselves . They both were within a fraction of a second of each other , with Hall just crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds . <h> Event 6 - Atlas Stones <h> Winner : Hafthor Bjornsson <p> Hall and Thor had been close throughout the entire competition , and Hall 's speed on the car walk meant that their battle for the title would go right to the wire . With the Icelander ahead now by only a single point , the slightest of faults on the stones by either of the front-runners would be disastrous . The first to really stand out on the stones , though , was Stoltman , who completed all five in 42.7 seconds . As impressive as that time was , though , it was nothing compared to Felix 's performance . The 51-year-old -- keen to show he still deserves a place on the world stage -- flew through the stones in just over 30 seconds . However , not everyone made the stones look so easy . Janashia 's inability to load that fifth stone cost him any chance at finishing on the podium . <p> After already witnessing some incredibly fast times , all that was left was to see was who would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Hall or Bjornsson ? Out of the blocks they were both almost neck and neck , but a slight slip from Hall on the final stone was the mistake that Thor needed . " The Mountain " made no such error and put on a dominating display to complete the course in 17.54 seconds to Hall 's 23.81 seconds . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The farmer 's walk is both beautiful and brutal in it 's simplicity : pick something heavy up and run with it . <p> On the surface this may appear just a test of grip , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamina as the competitors race to finish the 40-meter course as quickly as possible . <p> As if running with two 150kg handles was n't challenging enough , the competitors will have to turn around after 20m and take the implements back . With time being of the essence , the best athletes will have to do all this without putting the handles down . <p> Johannes Arsjo was blisteringly fast on this event last year and if anything he 's looking faster this time around . He 'll be wanting to take the win and start the competition right . <h> Safe lift <p> With both Eddie and Big Z having a lockdown on the the records of the deadlift and log , respectively , strongman is in need of some new , exciting events to push competitions to their limits . One that seems to have really caught lately is the the safe press ( aka the yoke press ) . <p> If you have been following the top strongmen on social media , you have no doubt seen countless numbers of athletes practicing this movement with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light at only 150kg , it is incredibly unstable , especially as the shoulders get tired and wobbly . <p> Expect plenty of reps from the top athletes in a closely contested event , but Terry Hollands has being looking phenomenal in training and will be feeling supremely confident . <h> Car Deadlift <p> A Volkswagen pickup truck that weighs an incredible 400kg is a tough ask to deadlift even for the super athletes flying out to Sweden . A few years ago , it would have been foolish to bet against the mighty Mark Felix , who enjoyed a lengthy undefeated streak on deadlift for reps events . But time eventually gets to all of us , including the seemingly evergreen Englishman . <p> This lineup has no shortage of world-class deadlifters , including the deadlift wunderkind Benni Magnusson , who is without a doubt the strongest of the competitors . However , this event is for reps and will play more into the hands of dark horses Jimmy Paquette and Johannes Arsjo . <h> Loading Race <p> This past year 's loading event was a real crowd-pleaser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It saw athletes loading wheelie bins and sandbags into giant skips that had been turned into wheel barrows . <p> This year , the organizers have been cagey with the event 's detail , which means we may be treated to another spectacle . The athletes , however , have left us a few clues in their training videos -- expect heavy sandbags and tires being loaded onto a platform of some kind . <p> On an event that relies so much on speed , the smaller athletes will have a slight edge over the larger , more cumbersome athletes . Even so , spectators can expect the final standings to be between Arsjo and Felix . <h> Keg Toss <p> A year ago , a Redditor posted a study on which event was the best indicator of an athlete going on to an overall victory . The result shocked many who were expecting atlas stones to come out on top , but instead the keg toss showed its worth . This crowd favourite requires raw power , endurance , and speed to get it done . The athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) over a 4.5m high bar and are unable to move on to the next keg until all the previous ones have gone over . <p> This is an event that obviously suits the taller competitors as Thor Bjornsson showed last year , sending the Norrkoping arena into a frenzy and shattering the keg toss world record before picking up commentator Colin Bryce for a victory lap . Hollands has been looking comfortable on this in training , and as the tallest competitor , it 's his for the taking . <h> Stones <p> The final event is the quintessential strongman event -- atlas stones loaded to platforms . The stones start off light and get heavy very quickly : 120 , 140 , 160 , 180 , and finally 200kg . Aside from the obvious strength required to pick up the stones , fitness will be a key factor , especially after the grueling five events that have preceded it . <p> Felix might not be able to deadlift with the best of them anymore , but there are few on Earth who can hold a candle to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event at World 's Strongest Masters , where he not only won the event but also slam-dunked the final stone through the platform . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

One theory is that athletes are competing at a higher intensity than their training and therefore putting their bodies in compromised positions during Regionals . Another idea is that the deep range of motion combined with some male athlete 's quick and intense contractions produces too much force in a short period of vulnerability . <p> Hopefully the injured athletes recover quickly and those that are continuing to compete can do so while staying healthy and competitive . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

With such high stakes , there 's bound to be drama . And this year was no different : the 2012 Olympic champion , Behdad Salimikordasiabi of Iran , went from the highest high of setting a new world-record snatch , to the lowest low of being removed from competition by bombing out on the clean-and-jerk . <p> Since then , Salimi 's disappointing finish has become a controversial issue in the world of weightlifting . His first attempt was a no-lift by majority decision due a press-out ( the rules require the bar to go overhead in one motion , and caught with the arms locked ; catching the bar with bent elbows , then pressing to lock out is against the rules ) . <p> His second attempt was given three white lights by the referees only to be overturned by the jury . It happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of having not having enough time to recover between attempts . <p> By bombing out and failing to make a successful clean-and-jerk , Salimi lost out on a podium spot . While it 's the jury 's job to intervene and overturn lifts , the Iranian lifter , coaches , and fans felt the decision was political . <p> All of this boiled over into some loud online protests . <p> The IWF 's Instagram photo of the M015+ podium has well over 1,100,000 comments on it as of this article 's publish time . Nearly all include #BehdadSalimi , emojis of Iran 's flag or claims that this was a political decision instead of a weightlifting call . And this " internet outrage " is n't just on the most recent posts by IWF ; even posts from late 2015 have now been overrun with hundreds of #BehdadSalimi comments . <p> While we do n't have the rights to the competition footage from Rio , I can tell you that--based on what I saw--the jury 's decision was 100 percent accurate . But that does n't change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the IWF 's website even seems to be under stress--it stopped working after Tuesday night 's session and only recently came back online . <p> But what 's been lost in all this uproar is how Lasha Talakhadze of Georgia not only won the Olympics , but he did so in dominant fashion with a ( brief ) world record in the snatch and an astounding world record in the total . <p> Talakhadze 's performance was astonishing , and Salimi just did n't have what it took to challenge him . It 's unfortunate to see a defending Olympic champion lose by bombing out--especially after such an epic snatch world record--but that 's just what happens in competitions like this . Salimi knows that " coulds , " " woulds " , and " shoulds " do n't count in weightlifting , so when he and his coaches made a huge scene by confronting the jury table , and when Salimi sat on the ground and cried after things did n't go his way , they 're not really making a good case for " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's should instead read #LashaTalakhadze . Talakhadze showed up big , hit all six of his lifts , and set a new world-record total . Salimi lost , threw a fit , is now the focus of this massive internet movement--and to what end ? The IWF is n't going to take back the jury 's decision and suddenly award Salimi a silver medal . We ca n't just ignore the rules of the sport because some fans do n't agree with how a competition turned out . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

@@23249866 @3249866/ <h> How Much Protein Do I Need ? <p> The ubiquitous question people ask when they start working out or following a nutrition program is " How much protein do I need ? " <p> First , let 's talk about why we need protein . Proteins are organic molecules made up of amino acids -- the building blocks of life . There are two main categories of amino acids in the body : essential ( those that the body ca n't manufacture ) and nonessential amino acids ( those that the body can usually make for itself ) . <p> When we ingest protein , such as meat , our body breaks down this protein source into individual amino acids , and they are added to the pool of available amino acids . This pool provides a supply of amino acids as needed to help produce important molecules in the body , replace worn out cells , transport substances , and aid in growth and repair -- for example , rebuilding after a workout . <p> Without getting protein through a dietary source , your body will start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed amino acids , leading to muscle wasting and weakness . <h> So , how much protein do you really need ? <p> It depends on a few factors , but the most important is your activity level . <p> The RDA ( Recommended Daily Allowance ) is 0.8 grams per kilogram ( around 0.36 grams per pound ) of body mass in untrained , generally healthy adults , so about 54 grams per day for a 150-pound person . However , this recommended amount is only enough to prevent deficiency ; it 's not necessarily optimal for people such as athletes or those who train regularly and hard . <p> For those who train at high intensity , protein needs to be increased to replenish the proteins that are being broken down and used up by the body . Protein needs might go up to 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg ( or around 0.64-0.9 g/lb of body mass ) . So our 150-lb person would need about 95-135 grams of protein per day . These suggested protein intakes are what 's necessary for preventing deficiency and basic protein synthesis aka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much we need to prevent a negative amino acid pool , we may need even more protein added to our diet for optimal functioning , body composition , healthy immune function , metabolism , satiety , and good athletic performance . Another way to look at it is that we need a certain amount of protein to maintain , but we need a lot more to really thrive . Physique athletes and bodybuilders have long relied on the rule of one gram of protein per pound of body weight , which is about 150 grams for our 150-lb person . Studies have shown that even a fairly high protein intake -- up to 2.8 g/kg ( 1.2 g/lb ) -- does not to impair or harm the kidneys in healthy individuals . <p> To sum it all up , we 're looking at minimum of 0.8 g/kg ( 0.36 g/lb ) up to 2.8 g/kg ( 1.2 g/lb ) depending on your individual activity level . <p> All that a little too confusing ?

Smith has been to the Games more times than any male athlete in history ( eight ) and will likely be the first man to have a decade of consecutive appearances . Simply put , Smith may have the second greatest career in the first decade of the CrossFit Games with more individual medals ( two bronze , a- silver , and a- gold ) than anyone in the sport not named Froning . Smith is incredibly well-rounded and remains so calm during events that at times you think someone needs to check him for a pulse . The combination of him and Froning will be inarguably the most dangerous male pairing on the floor , and the amount of talent and experience they bring will be a massive advantage for Team USA . <h> BROOKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15 Games appearances , seven championships , and 11 podium finishes in individual and team competition . The women on Team USA have four combined appearances and roughly five years of experience in CrossFit . The two sides are vastly different in terms of experience , but this is just the beginning for both of the women on Team USA , including one of the brightest young stars in the sport , Brooke Wells . The ultra-strong former sprinter transitioned full-time to CrossFit about three years ago . Finishing sixth in the 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games , Wells grabbed an impressive 10 top-10- finishes ( including being the only woman to clear the deadlift ladder for her first career event victory ) but was plagued by three finishes outside of the top 35 to keep her- from the crown of " Fittest Woman in America . " - The 21-year-old will be the strongest woman in the field , and her most noticeable weakness of long endurance events will likely not be a factor given the format . The University of Missouri student could be a major factor for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , one of the more talked about stories on broadcasts- ( I was guilty of talking about this one a lot myself ) was how Kari Pearce went from beginning CrossFit- to making the Games- in the span of a few months . This year , you could argue she may be the most overlooked athlete coming out of the CrossFit Games despite a fifth-place finish , two event wins ( " Murph " and " The Separator " ) , and being the highest finishing female athlete from America this season . The former University of Michigan gymnast is ( shocker ) incredible at gymnastic movements- but also backs it up with a superb- work capacity and has been building an impressive repertoire to support her strengths . The combination of talent and confidence is a dangerous one , both of Team USA 's women are building these- attributes in quick fashion . In similar fashion to the women of Team Europe , the men of Team USA will own the spotlight , but the women of Team USA are more than worthy of paying attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be closing out the season with a bang- and- what should be the closest Invitational competition yet . Team USA will enter as the favorite , but Teams- Europe and Pacific are fielding their strongest squads to date . And- Canada has a stout lineup combined with a home crowd behind it .

He still has a lot to prove , but back-to-back Foot Locker titles ai n't no joke in high school and 13:57.04 for 5k ai n't no joke in the NCAA . <p> It 's inane to think that an incoming freshman with a 14:11.61 5k PR to his name is second on the incoming depth chart . Oregon just gets the studs , man . <p> While Cheserek certainly has the pedigree , we think Leingang has the most potential for Oregon . Full disclosure : we really enjoy watching him run . Whether it 's during the fall ( except on the anti-nimble ' 12 NXN course ) or on the track , he 's as smooth as a new pair of socks on a freshly buffed wood floor . <p> There 's a lot on Leingang 's resume , so we 'll just list some of the nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state champion , double NBON 5k champion , and was the Gatorade ND Cross Country Runner of the Year for three straight years . <p> The last time we saw him , he decimated the field at the Portland Track Festival mile . <p> This fall , Fernandez made a bit of history . Let 's start from the beginning . We first saw him when he won the Mt . SAC Invitational in 14:34 . He went on to win the CIF California State Cross Country Championships ( 15:09 ) and was the state 's Gatorade Cross Country Runner of the Year . <p> But the record books were rewritten at the Seaside Invitational where Fernandez ran 14:05 for the three mile course . That broke the old record of 14:21 held by some guys by the name of Meb Keffleghzi and Louie Quintana . <p> A solid instate addition .

Last spring , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in both events . <p> Oregon is one of the few states that runs metric-based races ( 1500m and 3000m instead of 1600m and 3200m ) , so he 's not ranked in the ASICS Fast 100 . Still , he 's run 3:55.36 for 1500m ( 4:12.66 for 1600m ) and 8:28.04 3k ( 9:05.38 for 3200m ) , which puts him on the national radar , statistically speaking . <p> The back-to-back Oregon 5A state cross country champion was also the ' 12 Gatorade Oregon XC Runner of the Year . He does n't have the same credentials as some of the other guys , but Neuman is tough . He scored as a freshman at the state outdoor meet in both the 1500m and 3000m and was runner-up in cross country as a sophomore . <p> Here come the milers . Prakel has some dirty 800/1500 speed , but he 's not just a quick two trick pony .

Everett suggests variations and strength improvements to ensure an athlete practices the best technique possible. - <p> I ca n't think of a time I 've ever seen a relatively new lifter unable to elevate the bar adequately with the exception of occasional errors .

They 're intended to do things like train proper bar/body proximity and strengthen the third pull .

You can also try a complex of a pull + lift , e.g. snatch pull + snatch to both strengthen the pull and also encourage a complete pull when actually lifting . Power snatches and cleans and work from the hang or blocks will also help you develop more force at the top of the pull and consequently more bar height . <p> - <p> If bar height is n't really the problem as I suspect , I would guess the issue is more related to your change of direction after the pull and your pull under the bar not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter if you ca n't get under it in time .

The two-time NCAA champion looked poised for a breakthrough after graduating from FSU , but she was n't able to replicate her success at the 1500m . Training and living in Australia , Kuijken looks to be on the road back after running her fastest 1500m since ' 10 . <p> So far this season , Kuijken has n't lost a race . Her debut was a 9:11.59 3k in Christchurch on Feb 2 ; then a 4:09.66 1500m in Hobart on Feb 23 ; 15:43.20 for 5k in Sydney on Mar 9 ; 4:18 in a road mile in Auckland on Apr 1 ; and 4:10.53 for 1500m in Melbourne on Apr 6 . Kuijken will return to the U.S. to run the RE:RUN San Diego Invitational Mile . We feel like your 2012 season ended prematurely . You ran at Payton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your season ended after July . What happened ? <p> The 2012 season was definitely a disappointment for me . After Payton Jordan I improved my season 's best to 4:10 in Shanghai , but from there things just went down hill and I never got close to the qualifying standard . I felt really tired by the end of June and I knew it would be stupid to try to keep racing , I just needed a break . <p> I also felt it was time for a change , so I got in touch with Nic Bideau to ask if he would coach me . I went over to London to train with his group ( Melbourne Track Club ) for a week and loved it straight away . It was great to be training in a group again , although it was pretty obvious there was a lot of work to be done when I did sessions with the other athletes . I basically started off from scratch so we decided not to rush it and therefore not do any more races until I was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Earlier this season , you won the Briggs Athletics Classic in 4:09.66 , which is your best seasonal time since ' 10 . What 's changed in your training ? <p> The biggest change is that I am consistently putting in the hard work . The sessions are longer than before , but also more in control . I run a lot on softer surfaces like a grass track and horse track , which makes the sessions harder , but at the same time easier on the body . Hills have also been a key element this year ; one hill session a week plus a hilly long run every Sunday . Overall I 'm just a lot stronger and I seem to handle the training much better than in the previous years . <p> Speaking of training , we were sent a " winter workout " video of you and Zoe Buckman down in Melbourne , Australia . How is training with Buckman ? More importantly , how is doing intervals on grass and horse tracks ? It 's great to be able to do my sessions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we try to help each other out wherever we can . Once a week I do a tempo on a horse track where the grass is quite long and not very smooth . It 's like doing a tempo and stability exercises simultaneously , which is helpful for me because of all the lower leg problems I 've had in the past . The grass track session is more like running on a manicured golf course . It probably still slows you down a little bit , but the biggest benefit is that you do n't have to deal with the impact of a real track throughout the ' winter ' training . <p> I 've come a long way in the past 9 months and each race I 'm gaining more confidence . <p> In the video , you said , " The goal is represent Holland at the World Championships in Moscow , but it 's not really something that 's on my mind the whole time . " With the way things have been going , do you think that you can wear the orange vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't on my mind all the time I was probably being cautious more than anything , after having to deal with so many disappointments over the past couple of years . Things have changed now though and I feel that with the progression I 've made in training qualifying for Moscow is something that will just naturally follow if I keep doing what I 'm doing . But simply making it there is not a big enough goal anymore . <p> What 's on the schedule for the rest of the season ? <p> At the moment I 'm on a 4-week training camp with MTC in Mount Laguna , California . After the meet in San Diego I will go back here for another training block until Oxy , where I 'll do the 1500m . <p> Then I fly back to Holland , base myself there for the European season and go over to London every now and then to spend a week with the rest of the group . I will focus on the 1500m , but I 'm also planning on racing a 5k on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see much more of me on the European circuit this year . Hopefully I get to finish off the season in New York at the 5th Avenue mile . <p> What brought you to RE:RUN San Diego ? <p> The race in San Diego is just around the corner from Mount Laguna and will be a welcome distraction to break up the training camp . I like the idea of combining a road race with a track meet and I 'm hoping to get a peek of the ElliptiGO mile before my race . The last time I did a mile ( except for 5th Ave Mile &amp; Auckland Queen Street Mile on the road ) would have been back in college , so it 's about time to seriously improve on that track PB . <p> What 's the single most interesting thing about training abroad ? <p> Finding good cheese and coffee . Or that might be more of a challenge rather than an interesting thing . I never feel like I 'm training ' abroad ' really because I feel at home in Australia , Holland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another the one thing I look forward to is training in a different environment , so I guess I could say change of scenery . I 'm really enjoying the trails in Mount Laguna at the moment , but also ca n't wait to run in the forest back in Holland . <p> Would you rather fight one duck-sized horse or one hundred horse-sized ducks . Why ? <p> I do n't think I would fight just one duck-sized horse , probably way too cute to keep as a pet , carry around in my running bag and perhaps even go for a run with . One hundred horse-sized ducks would be my worst nightmare ; I 'm scared of any kind of bird because they always seem to attack or swoop me while I 'm running . I 'm guessing you planned on asking the question the other way around though , in which case I would go with one hundred duck-sized horses . My elbows are quite sharp so I think 50 left and 49 right elbow throws should do the job and I 'll still keep the last one . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

When the Open launched in 2011 , the workouts were revealed in back-to-back years by explanation videos that included footage of badass athletes hitting each event and setting the score to beat . <p> The Live Open Announcements started in 2013 with 13.1 ( burpees + ascending weight snatches ) , which featured Dan Bailey versus Scott Panchik . So let 's take a look back at each Live Open Announcement by ranking it based on how exciting it is to watch ! <h> 25. 13.2 : Lindsey Valenzuela vs Annie Thorisdottir <p> The workout was short and aggressive , but it had three movements that were fast and wild to judge . Both Lindsey Valenzuela and Annie Thorisdottir started ridiculously quick , but Valenzuela eventually slowed down , giving Thorisdottir the gap she needed to take and hold the lead throughout . <p> The repetitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this a bit boring to watch . <h> 24. 13.3 : Kris Clever vs Talayna Fortunato <p> This was a repeat of 12.4 , a classic and common combo of wall ball , double-unders , and muscle-ups . Starting off a workout with more than six minutes of wall ball is n't interesting at all , but both women made it to the muscle-ups at the same time . <p> Highlight : Bill Grundler 's comment about Kris Clever after the workout , saying " the fact that she was able to string together two muscle-ups at a time is amazing . " <h> 23. 16.1 : Emily Abbott vs Chyna Cho <p> Twenty minutes of overhead walking lunges , burpees , and chest-to-bar pull-ups is n't interesting to watch at all . It was pretty aggressive to start the Open with a long AMRAP , and seeing Emily Abbott beat the engine of Chyna Cho was very impressive . <h> 22. 13.4 : Chris Spealler vs Graham Holmberg <p> This quick and dirty workout had an ascending ladder that featured an interesting matchup between 2010 Fittest Man On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama picked up quickly on this event , as they started around the same pace early on . <p> Spealler 's ninja skills paid off here as he was able to hang onto the toes-to-bar longer than Holmberg did , but that turn happened about midway through the workout . <p> Highlight : The first time we saw a live rep-counter , which is cool even though it did n't really work as intended . <h> 21. 14.1 : Garret Fisher vs Marcus Hendren <p> A repeat of 11.1 , 14.1 included double-unders and light power snatches . Again , these are repetitive , boring movements that saw the athletes stay tied for most of the event and only a small difference between then until the very end . <h> 20. 17.2 : Kari Pearce vs Kristi Eramo <p> In the first-ever inclusion of dumbbell front rack lunges , this workout put two great bodyweight athletes against each other in a bodyweight specialist event . <p> Kari Pearce took it in the end , and while it was relatively close and relatively short , the workout just is n't particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bazinet vs Talayna Fortunato <p> This was the first appearance of the overhead squat + chest-to-bar pull-up workout that used a similar time gate feature as 13.5 . The difference here was you had to wait until the next three-minute window before starting the next set of rounds , so there 's a lot of built-in rest . <p> The workout was boring to watch until the fifth three-minute round , when Talayna Fortunato advanced but Camille did n't . Not a ton of excitement from then on , as we just watched Fortunato workout alone for another three minutes . <h> 18. 15.3 : Julie Foucher vs Lauren Brooks <p> Again , a classic Open combo of wall ball , double-unders , and muscle-ups . This was the first time an Open workout started with muscle-ups . While Julie Foucher 's performance was exciting , Lauren Brooks was n't a gymnastics specialist . By the middle of the workout , Foucher had a massive lead that she never let up . <p> Highlight : Dave Castro 's confusing announcement of Open workouts continues , and he uses the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14.4 : Scott Panchik vs Josh Bridges <p> This was the first time we saw the rower show up in the Open . In this specific workout , it meant the athletes would finish their workout on the rower , which is miserable . <p> The event itself was generally exciting but just did n't have the tight finish you 'd like to see , especially with the last couple minutes of the workout taking place on a rower . <p> Highlight : Dave Castro begins introducing Open workouts in the most confusing way possible , working his way backward from the end of the workout. <h> 16. 16.3 : Nick Palladino vs Shawn Ramirez <p> Yet another long , drawn-out event announcement from Dave Castro . This time he was in Milan , Italy , and wearing Versace . He even demonstrated a full round of the workout and paid dearly for it , being absolutely unable to catch his breath to actually announce the damn thing . <p> While the announcement itself was exciting , the competition between Nick Palladino and Shawn Ramirez was pretty much over before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Ramirez ended up catching him a few minutes into the workout , smoking him the rest of the way . <p> Highlight : While it 's not the most exciting Open Announcement , the actual announcement of the workout is probably the best ever . <h> 15. 16.4 : Sara Sigmundsdottir vs Katrin Davidsdottir <p> The 55s Chipper is a tough workout and seeing the battle of the Dottirs was a great way to be introduced to it . While neither of their scores from this event were competitive on the leaderboard , the clash between Davidsdottir , who won the 2015 Games , and Sigmundsdottir , who had the lead in the 2015 Games until the very last event , made this an impressive and exciting event . <h> 14. 17.1 : Pat Vellner vs Brent Fikowski <p> The Fittest Canadians on Earth went head-to-head with some gnarly dumbbell snatches and burpee box jump-overs . Unfortunately , the writing was on the wall from the beginning here . Fikowski is about 11 inches taller than Vellner , and his dumbbell has to move an extra foot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That said , Vellner absolutely crushed the event and set an impressive tone for the 2017 Open . <h> 13. 15.5 : Annie Thorisdottir vs Sam Briggs vs Camille Leblanc-Bazinet <p> This was and still is one of the toughest Open workouts , and the announcement featured three women 's champions going head-to-head-to-head in a solid battle . <p> It was exciting early on with Annie Thorisdottir and Sam Briggs pushing each other , but Briggs took the lead and kept it through most of the workout. <h> 12. 15.2 : Emily Bridgers vs Michele Letendre <p> A repeat of 14.2 , this was a much more exciting announcement for a couple reasons . Both athletes finished in the same three-minute block , so it was super close the whole way through . On top of that , Michele Letendre and Emily Bridgers were evenly matched , and both crushed their scores from the previous year . <h> 11. 15.4 : Josh Bridges vs Scott Panchik <p> The start of the handstand push-up standard in the Open . While this was n't a hotly contested workout with Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event was exciting , because we got to see Bridges lose his shit as that new handstand push-up standard messed with his workout . <p> Highlight : Dave Castro writes a workout so confusing , even he messes it up as he 's describing it . <h> 10. 14.3 : Stacie Tovar vs Alessandra Pichelli <p> The first time we really learned that Castro was willing to not just add weight but also volume to a workout to make it harder . <p> The time domain and weights involved makes this workout much more exciting to watch , but right around the midway point Alessandra Pichelli misloads her bar and falls behind . The exciting part did n't happen until the very end of the workout , when Pichelli catches up and takes the lead with just 30 seconds left in the workout . <p> Highlight : Stacie Tovar rips her pants off just seconds before the workout kicks off . <h> 9. 17.3 : Mat Fraser vs Scott Panchik vs Cole Sager <p> Mat Fraser + heavy barbells = awesome to watch no matter what . Fraser 's pacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world-leading score , which is unheard of at an Open Announcement . <p> Not only did we get some exciting and quick exercise from Fraser , but we also saw Cole Sager work toward that 265lb bar up until the very end , only hitting one rep at the final bar with just a few seconds left in the workout . <p> Highlight : Mat Fraser predicting people will beat him by about 90 seconds . Only two people beat him and only by about 20-30 seconds . <h> 8. 17.4 : Brooke Wells vs Brenda Castro <p> Until this moment , just about no one knew who Brenda Castro was , and Brooke Wells had one of the best scores in the world in 16.4 , the workout 17.4 was repeating . <p> Enter the Open Announcement environment and the elevation in Mexico City and these women put on an amazing show . <p> Wells took the lead early , but Castro caught up through the handstand push-ups and finished the workout just one rep shy of Wells in an exciting finish . <h> 7. 16.5 : Mat Fraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here was Rich Froning versus Mat Fraser . The question was whether a year of competing on a team had slowed Froning down . <p> Fraser won pretty handily , in a bit of a preview of how the 2016 CrossFit Games would go . While Fraser was in the lead for pretty much the whole workout , Froning is known for his expert pacing , and everyone was on edge waiting for him to push and catch Fraser . <h> 6. 16.2 : Dan Bailey vs Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson <p> This was a classic confusing Dave Castro Open Announcement , but once we unpacked the workout we saw it for what it was : an elegant and brutal triplet that was all about being strong while being fit . <p> The performances out of both Bailey and BKG were impressive , with the " I need to work on my weaknesses " BKG making it to the 315lb bar and Bailey finishing the workout at the very last second ( even though his score was then invalidated and he had to repeat the event ) . <p> The combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steaming sweat in the cold made for a ton of excitement , and it definitely goes down as one of the most exciting Open Announcements ever . <h> 5. 15.1 and 15.1a : Mat Fraser vs Rich Froning <p> Froning versus Fraser was the exact matchup everyone wanted to see , and Dave Castro delivered . The winner and runner-up of the 2014 CrossFit Games , the GOAT versus the Future . <p> This workout was an even matchup throughout the entire nine minutes , with Froning taking the lead by just three reps with less than five seconds left . <p> Then the weights came out , and everything slowed down to a slow boil for some heavy lifting . Froning and Fraser played games against each other , adding some weight here and there to get ahead of each other . <p> In the last minute of the workout , Froning took 343lb to grab the lead . Fraser took an attempt at 345lb with less than 10 seconds left but just lost the jerk right at the time cap . <h> 4. 13.1 : Dan Bailey vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12.1 and 12.2 combo , we saw the start of the Live Announcements with this workout .

Reim is one of our main Flotrack contributors on the west coast who 's helped out at the Mt . SAC Invitational , Arcadia Invitational , the Oxy High Performance Invitational , and more . He drafted this article back back in early April so even though it has some March Madness references , we liked them so much , we kept them . If you 're interested in becoming a Flotrack contributor or just have a topic that you want to write about , email us ! Fundamentals of Running <p> We are past March Madness and one thing is quite clear : All of the final teams had excellent fundamentals . Perhaps that is too obvious , given how important dribbling , passing , shooting , and rebounding are to basketball , but the point should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes . Such is the same for running . <p> However , while poor rebounding and missed shots are clear failures to master the fundamentals of basketball- you can see the error right in front of you- the fundamentals of running are not obvious . These fundamentals are subtle because they are the principles of exercise physiology . These four main principles are overload , specificity , individuality and regression . <p> Overload <p> We all know exercising the body harder than normal will make it stronger . In exercise physiology terms this is called overload . <p> This happens in three parts : First exercise , next recovery and finally supercompensation . After recovering to a baseline of fitness , if allowed additional rest time , the body will go onto supercompensate- ( develop additional strength ) , which is the body 's natural way of being to prepare to function more efficiently next time . The below graph shows how the body is loaded with stress , recovers , then goes on to supercompensate : - <p> In theory , the most efficient way of building fitness relies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many of these cycles into a season as possible . However , in reality , finding that balance can be incredibly difficult . <p> The body does not give clear signs when it has fully recovered or reached peak supercompensation . Often times , we are left guessing . Combine that guessing with an athlete 's ambition to quickly improve and you have a recipe for disaster . <p> The problem is caused when an athlete trains again before recovery and supercompensation are complete . This interrupts the overload process , and stagnates their development . This is overtraining 101 : Stressing the body again before it has the chance to recover and supercompensate . <p> So what is the best way to maximize long-term training gains without the impediment of overtraining and injury ? It can be tricky to find that perfect point of training balance but some of the best coaches are honing it by taking a more conservative approach . Princeton Head Cross Country and Track Distance Coach Jason Vigilante explains this approach . " I 'd rather train everyday at 75% than 4 days in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doing just one more is n't always productive . " <p> Instead of risking overtraining and injury , these coaches deliberately undertrain knowing that they can get bigger returns over the long-term when their athlete 's development does not suffer interruptions from injury and overtraining . <p> Vigilante goes on to say , " You 're not going to take a 4:20 miler to 3:59 overnight You have to allow them to adapt . " <p> Some coaches insist on breaking down the athlete through exhausting training . Vigilante says , " I do n't like the tear down process . I just like to be really patient . After a couple of years , they become a successful athlete . " By taking a slightly more conservative approach Vigilante is giving up fast returns but increasing his chances of better long-term development . <p> Specificity means specific exercise will bring about specific results ( adaptations ) . Aerobic training will make you more aerobically fit and anaerobic training will make you more anaerobically fit . <p> This principle is obvious enough , but we often forget to what extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerobic benefits of slow jogging ; neglecting training at race pace and becoming an athlete that is really good at running a lot ( see : jogging ) . <p> What 's more , specificity also has strategic significance . Recently , - Flotrack- spoke with coach Alberto Salazar about his star athlete Galen Rupp . While Rupp is known for training 100+ miles per week , his coach Alberto Salazar makes sure some of his running is focused on sprinting . Rupp routinely includes 400m sprints in his training so that he has the anaerobic power to kick down the competition in the last lap of the 10,000m ( see : silver medal from the 2012 London Olympics ) . Galen Rupp Workout : All About the Last Lap <p> " If you 're never running faster than 52 in workouts , then how are you going to run 52 when you are dead tired and you 've already run 24 laps - it does n't make any sense . " -- Alberto Salazar <p> Lastly , specificity also refers to the mode of exercise - The mechanics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All three can be done aerobically but exercise physiology tells us practicing one mode of exercise has little transferable benefit for the others . Though certain muscles , for example the quadriceps muscles , are active in all three disciplines of swimming , biking and running . They are called upon to perform differently , thus the adaptations and fitness gains will be different . <p> Salazar keeps with the principle by emphasizing alternative aerobic exercise that closely mimics normal running , like running on the Alter-G and underwater treadmills . Both pieces of equipment lighten the impact of running on the body while still maintaining the biomechanical specificity of running . <p> Alter-G Treadmill - Alberto Salazar Testimonial <p> ( Full disclosure : This is an infomercial for the manufacturer , but it is still informative ) <p> Underwater Treadmill workout video <p> ( Full disclosure : This is also an infomercial for the manufacturer , but it is still informative ) <p> Athletes with fewer resources can diminish the impact of running by exercising on grass , dirt and woodchips , which are all surfaces that significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason enough to stay healthy and stay running because the best way to get better at running is running . <p> Individuality <p> Each athlete will adapt differently to the training or the principle of individuality . This is largely a genetic phenomenon , though some individual adaptations are subject to the fitness an athlete has already developed . Individuality states , " The training that returns the best result is training that is tailored to an athlete 's individual strengths . " <p> In a team environment , this is often difficult to achieve . Coach Vigilante elaborates on the difficulty of individual training plans by saying , " To some extent you can look at each undeveloped athlete ' as a seed . ' All seeds early on look similar and ' all want to grow and be great , ' but you ca n't always tell what their makeup is by just looking at them " Vigilante continues , " you do n't know what a kid 's upbringing was , what their foot speed is , their body composition , or personality ; there is such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular that stands out is Princeton middle-distance runner Peter Callahan . Anchor for the recent NCAA Indoor National Championship DMR team and 3:58.76 miler , coach Vigilante says Callahan has n't ran more than 25 miles/week- this season . Though his mileage might be considered low compared to other athletes , Vigilante goes on to emphasize , " I should n't expect there is consistency between athletes . Each kid has a different set of tools . " It is up to the coach and athlete to make the most of those individual differences . <p> Regression <p> The last principle of exercise physiology , regression , is the most depressing . <p> When an athlete ends regular exercise , fitness is rapidly lost . In one extreme example , a study showed when " subjects were confined to bed for 20 consecutive days their V02 max decreased by 25% . " Because of the regression principle , without regular exercise adaptions will quickly erode . <p> Maintenance -- The Sweet Spot <p> While the regression principle might leave you feeling discouraged , it does come with a caveat : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited training . As long as an athlete maintains the same intensity in their training , they can reduce the frequency and duration of training significantly . This is tapering . <p> In a taper period , runners are consolidating all potential adaptations and are conceding that they will- perform better by resting in the final days before a race than trying to create more adaptations . <p> The limits of maintenance below : <p> How often you run ( frequency ) can be reduced by 2/3 , so long as intensity is maintained . <p> How long you run ( duration ) can be reduced by 2/3 , so long as intensity is maintained . <p> How hard you run ( intensity ) must be maintained or fitness gains will reverse . <p> Honing- your ability to maintenance fitness during the taper period will leave you well rested and prepared to give your best possible effort at race day . <p> Where Exercise Physiology Wo n't Take You <p> For all the science that makes up the fundamentals of training , the sport is also part art . Coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exercise physiology . " He added , " The fundamentals are art and science . " <p> He goes on to say , " If I were a genius , if I was doing everything correct , and if everything was precise , you still have n't accounted for faith , will , desire ; the things that make a champion . There has to be a symbiotic relationship ... the art completes a combination of the two . " <p> Coach Vigilante elaborates , " Some people have been conditioned that winning is everything " and " some people are gentle , so they demur at crunch time . You have to put pressure on some people and take pressure off others . " It 's important to know " what 's going to motivate this kid . " <p> But at the end of the day , it 's not going to be your success . Sometimes we want success more than our athletes , but , I ca n't do it for you . " <p> Here 's where running becomes more of an art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kick in the ass , " says Vigilante . <p> Some athletes need to be given stern instruction and for others you need to let them learn on their own . Explaining how he provides direction to his most ambitious athletes Vigilante concedes , " You can talk to the super motivated Type A personality until you 're blue in the face . " However , " Often you can only communicate via failure . " When the athlete says " Gosh , I 'm not succeeding , " that is when a coach 's direction is most impactful . <p> The Appeal of the Fundamentals <p> This mixture of art and science is perhaps what attracts us to sports in general . Take for example , the NCAA basketball championship tournament . We ca n't ignore the statistics which tell us who his better at certain fundamentals yet , we- had little control over who became national champion . <p> Perhaps that is what attracts people to both sports : that sense of the unpredictability closely wound with the obvious , the pursuit of fundamental excellence and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentals will always be an indispensible foundation for excellence , it however will go nowhere without a fierce champion 's desire to win . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

One of the reasons that many of us go pound the pavement or hit the trails is that it running makes people feel happy and content . It 's unclear if this good feeling comes due to an increase in endorphins , from enjoying the environment , or from getting one step closer to reaching goals related to running . But what we do know is that , more often than not , people are in a better mood after their run than they were before . Extensive research has indicated that exercise leads to increases in positive affective states and decreases in negative affective states upon completion ( Reed &amp; Ones , 2001 ) . - <p> Even though the literature is conclusive , not every run feels good and leaves the athlete or exerciser in a better mood upon completion . Also , people are generally motivated to partake in activities that feel good and stay away from things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run regularly . Research now suggests that the intensity of running may influence the likelihood of experiencing a more positive mood after exercise. - Ekkekakis , Hall , and Petruzzello ( 2004 ) conducted assessments of perceived activation ( high or low arousal ) - and affective valence ( good or bad feelings ) every minute during a graded maximal exercise test on treadmill . Heart rate , perceived activation , and perceived exertion rose in a continuous linear fashion throughout the exercise bout . Affective valence , however , dropped suddenly after the ventilatory threshold was crossed . ( The ventilatory threshold is the point during exercise where ventilation increases disproportionately with the oxygen that is consumed . This excessive ventilation or breathing is often related to the buffering of lactic acid ( McArdle , Katch , &amp; Katch , 2006 ) ) . - In other words , people reported good feelings when running below and at ventilatory threshold . - But individuals started feeling bad when they were asked to run at speeds that caused them to exceed their ventilatory threshold . <p> Performing a tempo run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster allows runners to exercise close to the ventilatory threshold . - Training faster than this may cause runners to feel bad for several reasons from a psychological standpoint. - Negative affect may represent a conscious understanding that a certain state of exertion can not be maintained by the body ( Damasio , 1995 ) . Individuals can only operate via anaerobic pathways for a short amount of time before slowing down or damaging the body ( McArdle et al. , 2006 ) . In other words , the good feelings we have to running may be in response to what is good for our body . - But negative feelings or moods may occur in response to strenuous exercise so that humans protect themselves from injury or excessive fatigue ( Remember , the feelings we have now may be tied to our evolutionary history . At that time , excessive fatigue and depleted energy would not have allowed us to escape from predators and injury could render the developing human useless out in the wild ) . - Thus , negative affective states should be associated with prolonged anaerobic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body for the cessation of such exercise , as this promotes health and safety for the body. - <p> Unfortunately , the old adage " too much of a good thing " certainly applies here . Just as some running , particularly at threshold pace , can improve affect post-exercise , too much running can dampen affect . In fact , a change of mood is one of the psychological indicators of overtraining . You may be able to detect overtraining yourself if you notice dips in your level of happiness , even when other aspects of life are the same . You may also feel listless and lack libido , in addition to those feelings of apathy or mild depression . Leg soreness or fatigue is also a sign of overtraining , but it can be hard to distinguish when soreness or tightness changes from normalcy to a symptom of overreaching or overtraining . However , change in day-to-day mood is often the first sign of the overtraining syndrome and often occurs before unusual amounts of fatigue or diminished performance ( Raglin , Koceja , Stager , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always respond positively to running and could even worsen if you run too much . <p> We happy few runners are not alone in the realization that we feel better after a run than we did before . Science has suggested that everyone can consistently achieve these positive feelings if they exercise at or below the ventilatory threshold . Runners often perform their tempo runs at roughly this intensity . Of course it is also important to do intervals much quicker than threshold pace in oder to get faster . It is also key to include recovery runs to absorb the training . But if you are really looking to go run away from your problems and feel better when you untie your shoes , try a threshold run . - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704 
@@23249908 @3249908/ <h> NCAA Indoor Day 1 Recap and Words that Start with F <p> It was n't as much as an opening day as it was a grand finale . There 's day two , too . <p> The first day of the NCAA Indoor Track and Field Championships was thrilling from the start the men 's shot put final to the last 200m of the men 's distance medley relay . <p> A lot of favorites either advanced to the finals tomorrow or took home their national crowns tonight . But based on the wild and educational world of Sesame Street , we 'd also like to talk about other words that begin with " F " and no it 's not the word you emphasize when you pronounce Princeton 's Peter Callahan 's middle name . <p> It 's the tumbles out of the blocks and the tumbles to the track - false starts and falls . <p> If you want to relive all of the action from day one , check out our Quick Hits page , which includes some recap , pictures , splits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representation from Florida State in the men 's 60m final . None . <p> They were seeded first and second , they were both in lane two , they both wore arm warmers , and they both false started . <p> FSU 's Marvin Bracy and Dentarius Locke both moved before the gun , which opens the door for a big underdog to win the national crown . It 's an unfortunate turn of events , but that 's what happens when you live in Edge City , population 60m dash . <p> Falls <p> Some of the big favorites went down early and we mean that in all of the literal sense . It took a while for some results to come out due to appeals , but there was some bumpin ' and fallin ' in some events . <p> In the last semifinal of the women 's 400m , A&amp;M 's Ibukun Mayungbe and Texas ' Courtney Okolo collided on the backstretch turn and fell to the track . They both got up and finished , but they 're out of the finals . <p> Stiff arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the women 's and men 's 800m semifinals had their own drama as national finalists again picked up some gnarly track burns . <p> The first semifinal on the women 's side looked like there was accidental contact between BYU 's Kelsey Brown and ASU 's Shelby Houlihan . Houlihan could n't avoid the already grounded Brown and neither could Tennessee 's Nijgia Snapp . <p> Houlihan got up with a belly full of fire , but would finish in fifth and would be the first one out in her heat . We have to give her props because when she passed the 600m mark , she looked like she had to shot to come back on the field . Maybe next time . <p> Switching over to the men 's side , yet another number one seed went down early . <p> Very early . <p> We could n't tell from the replay , but Arkansas ' Leoman Momoh hit the track just past the 200m mark and laid motionless for quite a bit . Eventually , he got up , realized he was too far to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fayetteville faithful . <p> Now , if it counts , we 'll look at an almost " fall " that resulted in a win . <p> It seemed like it was going to be tough to squeeze in Dartmouth 's Abbey D'Agostino into one of these three categories as she was n't technically the favorite in the women 's 5000m , so it 's very kind of her to take a small tumble on her way to a 5000m national title . <p> D'Agostino sat on the big threat in the field , Iowa State 's Betsy Saina , until about 1000m to go and then showed everyone that she could not only win titles the " easy " kickers way , but the " hard " way from a long ways out . <p> We 're not sure where in the race she clipped the inside rail ( our best guess would be with 900m to go ) , but Abbey D gracefully recovered and then started to tighten the screws . <p> Successive 200m splits of 36.55 ( at 4000m ) , 36.53 , 35.74 , 35.07 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the big win . <p> How much does she have left in the tank for the 3000m ? Could Abbey D win two indoor titles ? <p> If you look at the start list , a lot of other girls are doubling back as well . Ryan also rhetorically just asked , " How many girls have run 15:19 or 4:30 ? " <p> Point taken . <p> There are some other favorites who did n't literally fall , but failed to make the final : Men 's 60mH Caleb Cross ( Arkansas ) <p> Men 's 400m Brycen Sprating ( Pitt ) David Verburg ( George Mason ) <p> That 's it for the falls , but what about the people who were supposed to win ? <p> Pre-Race Favorites Look Solid <p> The mile preliminaries went as planned as Colorado 's Emma Coburn ( 4:37.47 ) and Florida State 's Amanda Winslow ( 4:36.48 ) both cruised to victories in their respective heats . Coburn went a bit earlier ( her big move came around 1000m ) while Winslow closed hard ( 33.61 - 32.66 - 33.01 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men 's miles were excellent examples of the easiest way to run 3:58 and the hardest way to run 4:01 . In the first semifinal , Arizona 's Lawi Lalang ( 3:58.52 ) and NC State 's Ryan Hill ( 3:58.91 ) eased when coming to the line in what was the slowest looking 3:58.52 mile , ever . <p> We guarantee their finish wo n't look as comfortable tomorrow . <p> The second heat was a bit more rough as the leader at 809m and eventual winner , PSU 's Robby Creese ( 4:01.67 ) , brought the field through the halfway mark in 2:05.98 . <p> Creese then had to fend off surges from the defending champion , Tulsa 's Chris O'Hare ( 4:01.76 ) , and even throw in some moves as well . The two fought their own battle , which was convenient for them as they stayed from from the blanket finish for spots three to five . <p> In the women 's hurdles , Clemson 's Brianna Rollins ( 7.82 ) was simply the class of the field . When you 're the collegiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then that 's an understatement . <p> The leading 400m man for for Texas A&amp;M , Deon Leondore , did n't improve on his world leading time , but won his section of the men 's 400m in 45.36 . Again , some Aggies just ca n't have it all . <p> The heavy hitters in the women 's 60m dash , Oregon 's English Gardner ( 7.150 ) and UCF 's Aurieyall Scott ( 7.142 ) , had some breathing room in their respective heats . That wo n't be the case when the two meet tomorrow in the final . <p> The top two seeds in the women 's 800m , who also hail from the same school , both won their sections in similar fashion . LSU 's Natoya Goule ( 2:05.68 ) and Charlene Lipsey ( 2:05.02 ) both want an NCAA title , but they might have to watch out for more than each other come tomorrow ( I 'm looking at you , Laura Roesler ) . <p> On the men 's side , the " gamers " and our picks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Elijah Greer ( 1:48.13 ) manhandled the first section of the men 's 800m while PSU 's Cas Loxsom ( 1:49.13 ) eased to finish third in the second heat . <p> The men 's 5000m was , and was always going to be , the Kennedy Kithuka ( 13:25.38 ) show . The NCAA cross country champion lead from wire to wire , if you can call 3000m to 5000m " leading . " It 's like he does n't even realize that other people are in the same race . <p> Even as NAU 's Diego Estrada ( 13:30.24 ) started to close on him in the final stages of the race , Kithuka was n't worried . <p> Check out his post-race interview . If you want a preview for tomorrow , he has some information for you . <p> We saw some endurance , but we were still yearning for some speed . The women 's 200m saw one of the most dominate NCAA sprinters in recent times , LSU 's Kimberlyn Duncan , take a close win ( 22.58 ) over her main rival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott may have broken Duncan 's consecutive streak of 200m wins , but Duncan got some revenge and an NCAA title . We 'll venture to guess that she 'll be satisfied . <p> The men 's final showed that championship caliber racing does n't go away . Even though Texas A&amp;M 's Ameer Webb was only ranked fifth going into nationals , the reigning NCAA champion did n't come to play as won the men 's 200m by daylight . <p> His time in the final of 20.42 would have been a world leading time if he had n't run 20.37 in the prelims . Some guys just ca n't have it all . <p> Heading into last chance weekend , I thought that the University of Michigan girls would double back from individual events and squeak into nationals in the DMR . <p> They did n't double back and they did n't squeak in - they went from running 11:11.41 to 10:56 and in fell swoop , became the number one team in the country . <p> I underestimated and even doubted them a bit the week prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the best of me twice . I valiantly picked the number one seed to win nationals and Amanda Eccleston pulled away from Villanova 's Emily Lipari to take home the title for the Wolverines . <p> Though the penultimate event drew emotion from the press box , the last event of the night evoked some screams and jumping from a rather stoic crowd . <p> The accordion of the men 's DMR came down to the final leg and all eyes were on Princeton 's Peter Callahan . An early pace for the anchor legs played right into Callahan 's hand as he dropped a 26.5 last lap to blow away the Notre Dame Alex Wilson field , I mean NCAA Nationals , to win the title for the Princeton faithful . <p> The DMRs bring up an interesting question of trying to double at nationals . The two winners , Michigan and Princeton , put all of their eggs in one basket . With the exception of Shannon Osika in the mile , the rest of the Michigan middle-distance squad scratched out of their individual events . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to double back , but Princeton 's fresh legs kicked for home . <p> We 'd like to do a more in-depth recap , but it 's 1:50am and we are the last ones in the building except for the janitor who jokingly , but with a serious underlying tone of " please leave so I can go home , " offered us the keys to the Randal Tyson Track Center . <p> We 'll have more tomorrow .

Here are the best quotes : <h> " I always thought it would be cool to program an event that just uses dumbbells . " <p> After the 2016- CrossFit Games , Castro was sure that the time was ripe to introduce dumbbells in the Open and Regionals . In the process of programming Regionals , he brought CrossFit Games Head Judge Adrian Bozman and CrossFit Seminar Staff member Stephane Rochet to his private and secret Games programming and testing facility to work on the plan . In the process , they determined that every past Regional workout could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekend of repeat events substituting dumbbells for the barbells across the board . <h> " Next year , I do n't know what I 'm going to do , though , because I 'm not sure the Regionals format will look the same .

When asked about his travel plans in the future , he mentioned that the Regionals format will be different in 2018 . In 2015 we saw the creation of " Super Regionals , " going from 17 separate Regionals to the eight we have today . With Castro mentioning changes , it 's possible we see even more combination of Regions with a different type of qualifying process out of the Open . An example of this would be the Europe Region in the Open , which has two to five times the number of athletes as other Regions .

" <p> During the 2016 Regionals season , Dave Castro opened up to Julie Foucher on her podcast , giving some details on his thought process behind the programming as well as some insight into how and why things turn out the way we end up experiencing them . This marked a big turn for Castro , who has been incredibly secretive about his process in the past . It seems that he 's now going to be even more open about it , writing a book on what 's in his head when he 's programming the Games . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

In this week 's technique focus , Everett stresses the importance of varying exercises in your training program , in order to avoid the point in which athlete 's bodies grow too accustomed to the exercises , ceasing to build muscle , and thus , fail to improve. - <p> When we 're talking about training in more of an athletic vain , it 's rare to train to failure . This is generally considered ineffective and even counterproductive . Whereas with bodybuilding , the basic idea is to create significant damage to the muscle and then allow morphological supercompensation , athletes are interested primarily in qualities like strength , power and speed more than hypertrophy . When hypertrophy is a goal , more bodybuilding-esque training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to failure or nearly so with less frequency. - <p> - <p> The rest of the training will still remain focused on athletic qualities . You 're able to walk every day , which is a leg exercise , without detriment . Why ? Because it 's such a common , frequently performed " exercise " that your body is entirely accommodated to it and it has virtually no effect anymore . This same thing can and does happen with any other exercise to some extent . If an athlete squats the same weight with the same volume every day , eventually ( surprisingly quickly , in fact ) , it will cease to cause soreness or even much fatigue . When you 're training in a way that involves many similar movements frequently , you develop not only this foundation of accommodation , but the ability to recover more rapidly ( again , this is n't taking the same exercise to failure every day , and certainly not with heavy full-body lifts ) . - <p> - <p> So if you look at a week for a weightlifter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day in one way or another ; this may be actually doing front or back squats every day , or it will be a combination of exercises that involve a squat such as squats , cleans , snatches , etc . These are all " leg exercises " , but aside from the athlete having the ability to manage frequent training and recover more quickly than an untrained individual ( or one used to training by the protocol you describe ) , the exercises vary in a number of ways , from the actual movement to the loading to the reps to the total volume . It 's this modulation that helps makes it possible to train like this. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

North was inspired to create the AWF in order to offer athletes in America options in the world of barbells . <p> - <p> " Until now , there has only been one federation for the sport of weightlifting in the United States , which is rare for Olympic sports . Almost every Olympic sport in America has multiple federations , and with weightlifting being one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it is time for it to grow , " North said . <p> - <p> Get to know a little bit more about the man behind the AWF . <p> - <p> Name : Jon North <p> - <p> Age : 28 <p> - <p> Title : Co-Founder of The Attitude Nation , Inc . <p> Founder of American Weightlifting Federation <p> Professional Weightlifter <p> Weightlifting / Strength &amp; Conditioning Coach <p> - <p> Hometown : I currently live in Lake Shastina , CA with my wife , 3 dogs and unborn baby . However , I was born in Dallas , TX , and was raised the majority of my life in Eugene , OR. - <p> - <p> Q. How did you first get into weightlifting itself and how did you originally get into competing ? - <p> A. I competed in my first weightlifting meet in 2007 . Before that , I played football for College of the Siskiyous , where I am now currently the strength and conditioning coach . I always enjoyed the weight room more than I did the field . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only did I work out in the gym for football , but I focused a lot on bodybuilding during that time as well . For anyone that has taken an Attitude Nation Seminar , they know that bodybuilding saved me , and led me to my love for weightlifting . After ending my football career due to too many concussions , my strength and conditioning coach at the time , Tim Frisbee , encouraged me to focus on weightlifting as my sport . Coach Frisbee told me that Sacramento State University had a weightlifting team , and I enrolled in school at Sac State the following semester to be a part of that team . Sac State was my first introduction to weightlifting as a sport . The first day I joined practice , I saw a poster advertising Weightlifting Nationals . Immediately upon seeing that poster , qualifying for Nationals and becoming a National Champion became my number one goal , and the rest is history . <p> - <p> Q. You are the number one lifter in the U.S.--That 's some hard work ! Tell me about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your daily training look like ? <p> A. At many points in my career I have been number one , however , that is always changing . I have dedicated my life to weightlifting , my career and The Attitude Nation . Words can not quite express the work that it has taken . Being a weightlifter is truly a lifestyle . Being that I no longer compete in USA Weightlifting sanctioned meets , only American Weightlifting Federation meets , my new goal is to be number one in the AWF . My daily training fluctuates based on how far away I am from a meet . With the 2015 Grand Open approaching , I am currently focusing on a Bulgarian style training method from now until the competition . In short , I am focusing on Snatch , Clean &amp; Jerk , and Squat to maximum every training session . I have eliminated things like complexes and accessory work from my work outs for the time being . I complete many waves in my training sessions though , in which I work up to a max , drop down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in an effort to achieve the highest maximum I can for the day . This takes not only physical strength , but mental strength as well . The perfect combination for meet preparation . In addition to weightlifting , I am doing bodybuilding work outs a few days a week as well . I have always been torn between my two loves of weightlifting and bodybuilding . For a long time , I thought that I had to pick only one . However , I have been finding a lot of new success in doing both , and it is really benefiting my training . <p> - <p> Q. What are you looking most forward to for the 2015 AWF Grand Open ? <p> A. I am most looking forward to getting to know the Las Vegas community and building relationships . We ( the AWF ) want Las Vegas to be a main location for our biggest events of the Federation , and by traveling and lifting at local gyms here in Las Vegas as part of our expo , I was able to connect and get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about promotion for the 2015 Grand Open , it was impossible to not be excited about it . I want the 2015 Grand Open to be the best weightlifting event in America ! This past weekend was all about fine tuning the details to make that happen , from lifting at local gyms , to touring the Monte Carlo Hotel &amp; Casino , to mapping out the layout of the venue . It is all incredible ( that this is actually happening ) . <p> - <p> Q. What are your current personal career goals , physical goals and visions ? <p> A. At this point in my career , I just want to build the American Weightlifting Federation to be as incredible as I envision it to be , continue to grow The Attitude Nation philosophy , and lift has much weight as possible . I want to be free to express myself on and off the platform , and reach my true physical potential , while making those same things possible for every weightlifter in America. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

What was your athletic background and how did you originally even find the sport of fitness ? <p> A. High School - Football , Skiing and Basketball . - College - Rugby and Skiing . - After College - Ironman Triathlons. - <p> - <p> Q. How did you get you into coaching for the sport of fitness ? <p> A. I was a strength and conditioning coach at an elite New England Prep School when I found CrossFit. - At the time I had about a half dozen training Certifications from NASM to the CSCS. - I learned more about strength , conditioning , health and wellness in the first week of researching CrossFit than I had in the previous 3 years . - After seeing the results in my own fitness and my clients I left my previous position as a strength and conditioning coach to become a full time Affiliate owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Do you have any coaches , mentors or philosophies that have shaped you ? <p> A. I like to think my programming is simple , potent and authentic to the roots of CrossFit. - For the first three years of programming for my athletes every time I programmed a workout for my affiliate I would ask myself if Greg Glassman would approve . - I would imagine that Coach Glassman was reviewing my programming every week and would look for holes or areas of improvement . - I like elegance in my programming ; couplets and triplets with simple rep schemes and similar demand on every movement and every round . <p> - <p> Q. Over the past several years , what have you learned about yourself as a coach ? <p> A. Over the past 10 years of coaching I have learned that I do n't know much . <p> - <p> Q. What have been some of your most memorable moments as a coach ? <p> A. I really enjoy the day before the Games starts . - I always sit with my athletes in the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This talk is about mental toughness and focus strategies , but it is more than that . - The athletes and I have been through so much by this point . - So much emotion , so much determination , so much sacrifice to get to that point . - It is a special moment that I always look forward to , and always remember. - <p> - <p> - <p> Q. Many athletes--and coaches-- are on the lookout for ' the best programming ' --you 've been in the fitness community for a little while--what , in your opinion , should an athlete or coach look for in a good training program ? <p> A. It sounds obvious , but athletes should be looking for a program that is targeted on helping them reach their goals . - Many Games athletes follow programs that are too biased . - Many people looking for better health and fitness are following a program with too much weight or volume . - The best program is well rounded , but geared to bring the athlete to a certain end point . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hosting the ECC ? <p> A. I did n't set out to create the KCECC to be what it is today . - When I started the ECC I simply enjoyed running competitive events and took pride in running them as professionally as possible . - The event started in my affiliate for competitors in the North East and has since snowballed into an elite competition with over 60 Games athlete and 6,000+ spectators . <p> - <p> - <p> Q. What separates a ' good event ' from a great ' event ' when it comes to the vast amounts of fitness competitions held annually nowadays ? <p> A. The first thing I look at is their time line . - If they are running on time , not rushed , and not keeping athletes late into the evening , they probably have a lot of the other processes in place for a well run event . - Second would be the layout of the competition floor . - Have they set up the venue and events so that it is easy for spectators to see the race and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . - Third is the little things - the warm up area , the athlete wranglers , how organized the volunteers are . - And fourth would be the programming . - Is it a balanced test of fitness without smashing the athletes ? - Is it simple and elegant ? - Is it entertaining ? <p> - <p> - <p> Q.

@@23249934 @3249934/ <h> Collegiate Highlights from the weekend : Wisco and Pre-Nats <p> College is a time of transition for many students . It 's the first period in one 's life where he or she has total independence and self-sufficiency . Although initially terrifying for some , college is one of the best , if not the best , four ( plus or minus ) years of your life . <p> Through experience and maturation , there are some rules that every student comes to accept . Actually , these " rules " are more " universal laws , " like Newton 's Law of Universal Gravitation or the moment you need something extremely important , it 'll go missing ( Murphy 's Law . Not to be confused with Muphry 's Law ) . <p> Excluding championship season , this Friday and Saturday was the most exciting and captivating cross country racing weekend of the year . Teams had one of two choices to make this weekend ( well , three if you count the Chile Pepper Invitational ) : race at the Wisconsin adidas Invitational in Madison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's simply a matter of what each team needed to accomplish before entering conference weekend . Do they need points for the Kolas Calculator ? Have they raced on the course for Nationals ? Do they want to skip the suspense and race their competition now ? Since the teams attending each meet were comparable ( Wisconsin had the better field ) , the decision was simple ( Occam 's Razor is a stretch ) . <p> Although there were only two races , the results were unbelievable . I 'm not talking the literal race results , but the implications that arose from what had transpired in less than an hour at each location . Almost everything we knew about cross country is a lie and it 's going to make for one crazy finish in November . <p> There are Four Laws of College that were cited this weekend . Certainly , there were more than four that were quoted ( I 'm looking at you , guy who just said " I 'm Never Drinking Again ) , but these are the four that pertain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Embrace Freshman Year <p> When mom and dad drive away , everything changes . You 're now in charge of your own studies , habits , and life . Make the most of it .

Though it is usually warranted , sometimes freshmen can produce things so beyond their limited experience , one has to wonder if they 're even freshmen at all . <p> It 's unusual for freshmen to be an integral component of any cross country team . Their expectations are to usually finish the season , gain valuable experience , and try to not embarrass themselves . <p> This freshman class is the exact opposite .

If you were thinking that Oregon may not be as strong in the next few years because they 're graduating an incredible senior class , look again . Allie Woodward , Annie Leblanc , and Abby Leonardi were in the top seven for a team that nearly dethroned the #1 team in the nation . Laura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin adidas Invitational has needed no introduction . That accolade has consisted of perennial powerhouses , national champions , and the who 's who of what 's what in cross country . But in a matter of 19 minutes and 33 seconds , everything we know about cross country changed . NCAA , meet Laura Hollander . <p> Hollander ran for Marina High School in Huntington Beach , CA . She placed 27th at Nike Cross Nationals and took second at the Arcadia Invitational in 10:10.51 . She now attends California Polytechnic State University ( Cal Poly ) . <p> When you first watch the race video , the storyline is one that we 've seen time and time again . An unexperienced or overly confident athlete takes the lead early on in a race only to fade later in the race and stagger across the line . <p> That 's not what happened in Wisconsin . There are uncanny similarities between this race and the 1981 Oslo Dream 1500m . If you 've never seen this race , I urge you to spend four minutes watching something that rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to not watch the race , the pacemaker won one of the most prestigious middle-distance races in track and field . Tom Byers beat a field that included world record holders , Olympic Champions , and the best milers in the world . <p> The difference between Byers and Hollander is that Hollander meant to win . The rest of the field in Oslo let 's Byers escape because they thought that he was going to drop out because he was n't supposed to finish . But they let him get away and Byers picked up the most historic win of his career . <p> It 's been said before , but athletes that run records have two mindsets during the race . They either set out to run the perfect pace to break a record because they are confident that they can do what no other athlete has done before , or they do n't care for the records and accidentally break the barrier . <p> Yelena Isinbayeva was known for her incremental world record vaults . When Kyle Merber ran a personal best of seven seconds and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know what happened ... I just did n't get tired . " <p> Hollander is in the latter category . In her interview , she talks about how she threw her prescribed race strategy to the wind when she felt good early on in the race . She not only lead from the start , but was clear from the field early on . <p> While her win is impressive in its own right , the manner in which she won is mind-boggling . The former course record was 19:59.4 , set by the two-time cross country national champion , Sheila Reid . Reid has run 15:23.64 for 5k , which is 4:57 mile pace . Again , Hollander 's two mile personal best is 10:10 . <p> When she set the course record , Reid ran 10:32 for the first 3k and closed in 9:27 . Hollander went out 32-seconds faster in 10:00 and closed in 9:33 . That 's about equivalent to her two mile personal best en route to 6k . <p> If you 're wondering how this happened , a quick glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's clearly found something that works ( from Letsrun.com ) : <p> Not to be lost in the mix is Anthony Rotich of UTEP . Rotich won Pre-Nats over a studded men 's field , which also included individuals who are expected to challenge for those top spots at Nationals . In our meet preview , we said that Paul Chelimo 's stock would only decrease at Pre-Nats- and Rotich 's win asserted that claim . <p> Rotich has run 8:41.14 for the 3k steeplchase , 13:57.09 for 5k , and 3:50.53 for 1500m . Last spring , he became the youngest winner of the Drake Relays Men 's 5000m . A lot has changed over the course of a few months . Here 's yet another freshman from Kenya who will challenge for an All-American spot . Sometimes You 'll Study for a Test and Fail <p> You knew this test was going to be tough , but you prepared for it . No cramming , daily study sessions , and you deleted your entire iTunes library to include the audio version of the textbook .

Maybe you overloaded on information , drank too much coffee , or just missed a scantron bubble and ruined the rest of your test . <p> Some teams this weekend unexpectedly did not run well this weekend . But when you look at the big picture , it 's only the Twelfth of October . Here are the teams that need to analyze what went wrong this weekend and adjust in the next few days .

One of the top women 's teams , Washington , did not run Megan Goethals ( Coach Metcalf cited recovery from a " stressy thing " ) . The big mystery that was half-answered is the Wisconsin men . As our intel predicted , Wisconsin did not run Mo Ahmed and Reed Connor ran unattached . The #1 ranked defending national champions finished a disappointing 17th . <p> If you 're saying , " Well they held out their two best runners . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run , " check the stats . If you score Reed , Wisco scores 333 points for seventh . If Mo Ahmed runs and finished third ( and do n't score Reed ) , the Badgers would again be seventh with 320 points . Throw both in the mix and the team drops the score considerably to 182 points , but still only finishes fourth . This result is concerning for the number one ranked team in the nation . <p> Will they find the puzzle pieces to be contenders at nationals or will they rest their top guys for next year ?

@@23249955 @3249955/ <h> Friday Focus : Shelby Houlihan <p> In our weekly Q&amp;A segment we asked Shelby Houlihan a few questions about life on and off the course . We caught up with her before she won Roy Griak . <p> Take us through last year 's Roy Griak and what we can expect during this year 's race and the rest of the XC season . <p> My race at Roy Griak last year was my first big XC win . Going into the race , it was really cold and raining but I absolutely loved it and was so excited to race . It felt a lot easier than I had expected it to and I was really happy and proud of myself . Going into this weekend , I am again , really excited to race . My training has been going very well and I am arguably in the best shape of my life right now so I 'm really excited to go and see what I can do . <p> Describe your childhood dream . <p> I really grew up around running and started running when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been to be the one of the best runners in the world and to win a gold medal at the Olympic Games . <p> Describe your fondest race memory . <p> I have a tie between my fondest race memories . Obviously one of them is winning the National Title in the 1500m . Crossing the finish line and realizing that I had just won was one of the best feelings . Even though I knew I could do it , I was shocked that it was actually happening and was very happy . The other race memory that I 've always loved was racing the 1500m at the Iowa State meet my senior year of high school . I was racing against the clock to try and get the Iowa All-time record and on my final lap , everyone in the stands stood up and cheered me on . I ended up being about a second off of the record but to see the support from everyone and feel the energy from the crowd was one of the coolest experiences I 've had . <p> If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> If I did n't have running , I would have probably tried to go to college on a music scholarship . I played the trumpet and French horn in middle school and also took piano lessons for about 5 years . I think I could have been pretty good but I thought it was nerdy when I got to high school so I stopped playing and focused on sports . <p> Describe your worst habit . <p> Impulse online shopping . Last week I bought a tent but I 've never been camping . <p> Describe the kind of kid you were in high school . <p> In high school , I was very shy and focused on running . Once you got to know me though , I was pretty loud and outgoing . <p> You had an amazing end to last years outdoor season , take us through how this past summer was for you in and out of training / races ? <p> This summer was the longest racing season I 've ever had but I had a lot of fun . I went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 800m . I ended up finishing 7thin a personal best of 2:01.12 . I really wanted to get that 2:00 but I know I 'll get there eventually . After that , I traveled to Canada , which was really cool , and raced in the 1500m and mile where I ran personal bests in both races of 4:10 and 4:33 . After that , I took a week off and started training for cross country by building up my mileage . In the beginning of August , I went back to Canada to race the 800m in the NACAC meet . I was a little nervous on how I would do since I had been doing only cross country training since July , but it went well and I won in 2:03 . <p> If you had a day off from your everyday responsibilities , describe how you would spend it . <p> I 'd like to say I would go on a road trip to somewhere I 've never been before and just be a tourist for a day but I may just end up sitting at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your most embarrassing moment as an athlete . <p> I actually have two but they 're kind of the same . It would have to be falling in the 800m my freshman year in the prelim at Regionals and falling again in the 800m my sophomore year in the prelims at Indoor Nationals . <p> Tell us about your favorite memory with one of your current or past training partners . <p> One of my favorite memories is doing a track workout last year with my teammate Adriana Olivas . We were doing mile repeats and were on the last mile . I went out and she was about 50m behind me 200m in . Thinking that she 'd fall off after a couple laps , I used her to visualize a race . With a lap to go , she was actually starting to catch me so I started picking up the pace . With 200m to go , she was still closing in on me and so I started sprinting towards the finish . Going down the homestretch , I could feel her getting closer to me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the line . We ended up running a 4:51 mile with it being her new personal best . I was so excited for her and could n't stop smiling . <p> Describe the perfect post-race meal in detail . <p> Is it bad if I say ice cream ? <p> Describe your favorite workout ? <p> I do n't have a favorite workout but I really enjoy doing repeat 400 's , 200 's or progression runs . <p> Dream place to run or train and why ? <p> I do n't have a specific dream place to run ; it really depends on what type of mood I 'm in . I love running on country roads with cornfields on both sides . I think it 's very peaceful and relaxing . I also love to run through neighborhoods I 've never seen and just looking at all of the houses . I love running on trails in wooded areas . I would just like to run somewhere that 's beautiful and secluded . <p> Who is your childhood hero and why ? <p> Batman because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Jelly beans and snow cones . <p> If you could give one piece of advice you think every runner should hear , what would it be and why ? <p> You 're body can always do more than what you 're mind thinks it can . Running is such a mental sport and people are always limiting themselves because of what they think they ca n't do . I 've always been the type of person to say , " I can do that " even if it 's something I 've never done before . <p> If you had to listen to 1 song in your head every time you ran for the rest of you life , what would it be ? <p> Gorilla by Bruno Mars <p> Dinner for 3 ( living or dead ) who and why ? <p> Bruno Mars , Phoebe Wright , Betty White . I love Bruno Mars so he 'd have to be there . I read all of Phoebe 's blogs and tweets and I think she 's hilarious and a great runner so she 'd keep the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dinner with Betty White ? - <p> Describe your pre-race ritual . <p> I do n't really have much of a pre-race ritual but I do like to ice bath 2 days before my race . <p> What does racing look like for you in the next 6 months ? <p> I 'm really looking forward to this cross-country season . I want to win every race that I run in and win the National title . After cross-country , I 'll take a week or two off and start training for indoor track . I have n't put a lot of thought into track yet since I 've just been focusing on cross-country but I know I want to win an Indoor National title and defend my title in the 1500m outdoors . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Check out the- recaps of each weight class below ! <h> Women 's 48kg A Session <p> The women 's first A session started off- in the snatches- with Kerri- Keegan , Shannon- McNames , Brooke- Tanacredi and Megan- Seegert gunning- for the lead . Tanacredi ended the snatches in third- with 69kg , as Seegert and Keegan set- a new university record with 71kg . Seegert barely missed her third attempt at the lead --- and a new junior American record --- at 74kg , and Keegan took- the lead based on bodyweight. - <p> The clean-and-jerk session was no disappointment. - Suzanna- Sanchez was the first to break her own university clean-and-jerk record at 83kg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record , but- McNames took- the record first at 85kg . It was all for naught , though --- Seegert followed- with an 86kg completion to claim the- university total record. - Keegan also lifted a university record after two- missed lifts to stay in the competition. - Seegert came out again with an 89kg to break her junior clean-and-jerk record and tie her junior total record , which would be short-lived as she- lifted- 92kg to break her university and junior records . Seeger- ended- in first , Keegan in second , and McNames in third . <h> Men 's 56kg/62kg Combined A Session <p> The combined 56/62kg A session did- not show the lighter class first , as many of the smaller lifters did n't appear until well into the snatch session . At the end of the session , - Trey- Kobashigawa posted- a 95kg opener and had- two attempts at a university-record snatch at 102kg , which he- made- on his third , to- take- the lead in the 56kg class . Ben- Prior- took- the lead in the snatch in the 62kg class , and- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second with a 100kg snatch . <p> The lifters began to show signs of a backroom chess game in the- clean-and-jerk -- they- made small jumps and tried- to offset their opponents ' rest times in both the 56kg and the 62kg classes . Along with some technical difficulties , many athletes had to change their warmups to compensate for the clocks running down. - Despite almost three- minutes without action , the 56kgs and 62kgs still put- up attempts. - Many of the 62kgs- opened- with successful- heavy- lifts in the clean-and-jerk- to close the gaps in the snatch . A battle- between Alan- Fang , Caleb- White , Justin- Browder , John- Ellison ensued- for third place in the- clean-and-jerks. - Each went- match-for-match on their openers , and then finished- all-out on their remaining attempts in the 62kg session . <p> Kobashigawa- again appeared at the end of the clean-and-jerk session and- made- a- 115kg opener . After that , he posted a- massive jump- to 121kg . Fang snuck up- from behind with a massive 126kg clean-and-jerk to grab the session by bodyweight from Koeller and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall- ended- with 218kg totals . - <h> Men 's 69kg A Session <p> This- session- was the- first- to show signs of competitors- gunning for placement right off the bat. - Many lifters struggled- with their openers and second attempts. - Echoes of the infamous 85kg A " Red Session " began to run- through the snatch session- as athletes struggled with standing weights up and locking- out . In the end , Aaron- Addison took first , followed by Jordan- Wissinger and Marcus- Carrasco , respectively . <p> The clean-and-jerk session was challenging , - as well . As the lifters tried to recover from a rough snatch session , they set their- weights- close to their best- competition lifts. - As a silver lining for the lifters who- succeeded in their attempts , they matched or made personal bests for competition clean-and-jerks. - Manzanilla , who was ninth after the snatches , made some major jumps to capture- second place- and barely missed- a 161kg clean-and-jerk for a university record. - Wissinger finished- third overall . <h> Women 's 53kg A Session <p> The 53kg session started- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 53kg class- from- 58kg . Marino's- 58kg- total would have- put her in fifth- based on the starting list . To contrast the men 's 69kg- A session before them , the women opened strong with consistent makes . The main highlight of the women 's 53kg snatch session , - Jourdan Delacruz , - broke- her junior American- record with a 79kg . She also had- a close miss at both the university and junior snatch records at 81kg. - But- Cortney- Batchelor- took the lead with a- 81kg at the end of the- session . <p> The clean-and-jerk session kicked off just as strong , with lots of good openers that led up to another record-breaking climax. - Delacruz broke her own junior American clean-and-jerk record with a 95kg lift , which also broke the junior American total record with a 174kg total . Batchelor- finished- the session with- a 99kg clean-and-jerk- and a miss at 102kg . But it was n't a bad- day for- Batchelor , whose- sights are set on the American Open . There , - she'll- look- to take the snatch record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with- Batchelor in first , Delacruz in second , and Andi- Cribari in third . <h> Women 's 58kg A Session <p> The last A session of the day- set the standard for how the rest of the competition , male or female , should be executed- with 15 consecutive made lifts. - The women 's 58kg class was- a tight competition --- one slip-up on a snatch could lead to disaster . Stephanie Lemmen , who- competed in the Rio Test Event for Team USA in the spring , led- the pack at the end of the snatch session with an 88kg lift , followed by Danielle- Roberts , and Leanna- White . <p> The clean-and-jerk session started off just as strong and was- one of the few 6/6 A session performances completed by Catherine- Hamilton , who- took- three- straight- attempts within a three-minute time frame .

Even more impressive , she moved through her burpees at an astounding clip to finish them in about four minutes .

@@23249970 @3249970/ <h> Kara Goucher to Skechers ? <p> This is a part of our new , most likely short-lived series Dispatches from No Man 's Land . Click here for an explanation to our madness . <p> The paradigm of sponsorship in track and field is changing . In terms of branding , the sport is slowly moving toward less monogamous , more polygamous relationships . Think NASCAR . In the last few months , athletes have declined umbrella apparel and shoe deals and instead , chose a title sponsor that would allow for an open relationship with a few other brands non-competitive brands . <p> Here we have Kara Goucher , who recently spurned Nike 's offer to instead join the feminine fierce apparel company Oiselle . Goucher joins a recently established and select club that includes , but is n't limited to , Leo Manzano , Nick Symmonds , and Meb Keflezighi . The recent Boston Marathon winner is a good example to highlight : he may wear the Sketchers kit and shoes , but he cross trains on the ElliptiGO , rocks CEP compression socks , wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drinks GenerationUCAN after a workout , and has a PowerBar before and after . <p> Other major companies- limit an athlete 's ability to market him or herself because of exclusive clauses . But this is n't the place to explain the intricacies of track and field contracts . This is Dispatches from No Man 's Land . <p> Goucher has an apparel sponsor , a hydration sponsor , but is lacking perhaps the most basic one ( unless Oiselle wants to join the footwear business ) : a shoe sponsor . <p> What brand will Goucher soon represent ? We 're under the impression that she 'll sign with Skechers . It 's not a huge leap of faith , but we 've heard enough unsubstantiated rumors to get this through the editing process. - <p> I 'll break each brand down into three tiers , from the least likely to the most probable . <p> The Oh Wait , You 're Serious . Let Me Laugh Even Harder Zone - Nike <p> Signing with the company she just left makes as much sense as a velociraptor driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - <p> adidas <p> Did you not read that whole thing about major companies wanting an exclusive sponsorship deal ? No ? Well ignorance is bliss , I suppose . <p> Under Armor <p> They just picked up Nick Arciniaga . Baby steps . <p> The Logical Choices That Are Lacking That- Je Ne Sais Quoi <p> Mizuno <p> An interesting choice that may go overlooked . Mizuno , who have a strong road already presence in Serena Burla , Renee Metivier Baillie , and Craig Leon , just to name a few , could be primed to add a huge star like Goucher to their roster . <p> The company is also fine with its runners represent more than just the brand . For example , on Craig Leon 's blog , he lists five sponsors in addition to his marquee one . <p> Saucony <p> If you have some attention to detail , you 'd notice that in Goucher 's Oiselle promotional- pictures , she 's rocking Saucony shoes . <p> It could be a subtle nod to her future shoe sponsor . Or it could just be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole multi-sponsor sort of life . <p> New Balance <p> One of us , one of us ... <p> Everyone here at the Flotrack HQ thought that Goucher would sign with New Balance . After all , Goucher was returning to Boulder , CO to once again train under coach Mark Wetmore , who coaches former CU standouts and New Balance sponsored athletes , Jenny Simpson and Emma Coburn . <p> The Boston-based company was also making yet another big push on the elite level as they picked up Mark Coogan from Dartmouth University to lead their Boston-based training group . <p> So what are they lacking ? Again , exclusivity . The reason they 're in this section is because someone in our office , who wishes to remain anonymous , thinks that New Balance would change their policy for Goucher . I 'm not in favor of the whole " slippery slope " argument , so I wo n't make it ; but I still disagree 100% . <p> They might not get Goucher , but they 'll have a good shot at landingAbbey D'Agostino . <p> Brooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Goucher 's big signing , a lot of you thought it 'd be Brooks . Why not ride the Nick Symmonds wave and branch out from men 's middle-distance to women 's marathoning ? <p> It 's still definitely a possibility . Do they have enough equity , though . Does equity even matter at this point ? Why are n't track and field contracts public knowledge ? <p> Of the three companies in this tier , this one seems to make the most sense . <p> The " You 've Got To Watch Out For The Quiet Ones " Zone <p> Hoka ONE ONE <p> Another brand that 's been making big splashes in the track and field world . Known only for its trail and ultramarathon shoes , Hoka ONE ONE has broken into the shorter distances with signings of Leo Manzano and Mike Rutt . <p> If I were to tell you that Manzano would win a road mile in Hoka ONE ONE , would you believe me ? <p> Newton <p> While we 're talking about big splashes that have already made their ripples in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit the water ? <p> Newton , which is based on Boulder , CO , has a growing group of elite athletes , but an elite like Goucher would really put it on the map . <p> What 's not to like ? Nothing , really . We know that one of their athletes , Stephen Pifer , promotes Power Bar in addition to Newton . Would they swing a shoe only deal ? <p> - <p> Skechers <p> If you Google " skechers stock boston marathon , " you 'll see at least 84,200 results . We know that Meb was the actual winner of the Boston Marathon , but my stock market friends , who I can only presume said this while cackling and burning $100 bills as they lit their cigars , claim that Skechers was the real winner . <p> Skechers is kind of like the nerdy guy in high school who graduates , goes to Silicon Valley , makes a ****load of money ( basic unit of measurement for wealth ) , comes back for his 10-year high school reunion , and , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his graduating class . <p> And now , here 's a list of the major burn centers in the United States . <p> Get it ? Nike got burned ? I 'm here all week . <p> Skechers , who signed a Nike outcast on the margin and saw him become a national icon ( again ) , is about to pull the same move twice , we think . <p> They not only have the available funds and provide the obvious multi-sponsor contract clause , but can offer incredible support and unparalleled reach for athlete(s) in their Skechers Performance Division . <p> I 'm talking national visibility here . Before Meb 's win , we saw him plastered over every Skechers ad we could find ( and surprisingly , there were a lot of them ) . <p> But here 's my favorite part . In February , before she signed with Oiselle , Goucher told Runner 's World , - " I 'll just wear whatever I want ! Maybe I 'll wear a Oiselle top and a Saucony short and a Skechers shoe and a Nike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-Oiselle , when Runner 's World asked- Skechers Director of Sports Marketing- George Van Cott- if- Skechers would consider providing just the footwear for Goucher : <p> " It 's something we have talked about , especially in the past week . We are developing our apparel line , but we look at every case as a unique situation . " <p> That was roughly one month ago . What about now ? Could Goucher be their next major addition ? <p> If she 's willing to turn down make it rain money from major companies , then she 's willing to take the emerging brand route . If you want to to make assumptions based on uncorroborated rumors , then sure , Goucher will soon be wearing Skechers . <p> --- <p> This is n't about No Man 's Land . No Man 's Land is a miserable place of indecision , littered with terrible memories of hate for everything that 's ever existed . <p> Whichever decision you make ( latch on for dear life with the leaders , slide back to the chase pack , drop out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's what you do in No Man 's Land that makes the difference . <p> Over the years , Flotrack has been sent plenty of information churned out by the rumor mill .

Well , if we want to be specific , it 's two women and one girl . That 's a technicality that 's overlooked every now and then . <p> Mile specialists Mary Cain and Treniere Moser , plus one mile prodigy who has found her calling at the 10k , Jordan Hasay , will try and break Mary Slaney 's record of 4:20.5 set all the way back in 1982 . The now 5k specialist , who 's still a miler at heart , Shannon Rowbury , is a late scratch . <p> If you 're looking for this record chase to have a little emotional narrative added to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salazar , who--and this part is for those who are totally unaware--is the head coach of the Oregon Project . <p> Last August , ABC Chicago caught up with Slaney and asked her her thoughts on the potential record chase by her former coach and his athletes . " I would love for it to be someone Alberto is coaching , " Slaney said in regards to her records , which have stood the test of time . <p> For a little perspective , this is the oldest women 's American indoor record . The next closest is Gwen Torrence 's 55m record of 6.56 , which was set in 1987 . They do n't really run that anymore so joke 's on you . <p> Will the record last another year ? <p> Short answer , yes . Last week , we thought that the women 's 1k record was a tall order . We 're under the assumption the mile is even tougher . <p> #1 : All hail the mighty conversion calculator <p> The equivalent performances for a 4:20.5 mile is 1:57.69 for 800m and 4:00.99 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4:00.33 , no one else in the group has ever run under those marks . <p> If this were maybe , August , and the entire group was at their outdoor peak , then the conversation for the record would be on the table . But since it 's late January and no one has run anything close , the conversion talk is still on the shelves at the supermarket . <p> #2 : The reason the record has stood the test of time is because it 's really , really good <p> Pop quiz hotshot : how many women have run faster at the indoor mile than Slaney ? <p> Answer : just two . <p> Below are the top ten indoor mile performances of all-time . It 's a fairly exclusive list . <p> Just for a point of reference , we did see a woman run an 4:20 mile equivalent on Flotrack last winter . <p> In mid-February overseas in Birmingham , Genzebe Dibabaran away from the women 's 1500m field to take an impressive win . The younger " Baby Face Destroyer " would run 4:00.83 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-time . Morocco 's Siham Hilali finished second 4:07.99 . <p> #3 : They have to go through 800m in 2:09.6 and 1000m in 2:42 , which might be tough <p> Unlike Rupp 's negative split 5000m race , Salazar and company will be looking to run even splits for the women 's mile . The plan , which looks great on paper ( when does it not ? ) , will be difficult based on last weekend . <p> Below are the splits from Cain and Moser 's 1k American record attempt : <p> 200m - 30.46 <p> 400m - 1:03.91 ( 33.45 ) <p> 600m - 1:36.20 ( 32.29 ) <p> 800m - 2:08.38 ( 32.18 ) <p> 1000m - 2:39.25 ( 30.47 ) <p> Even if you ignore the second 200m split , the pace still lagged as they needed to run 30.83 per lap to equal the American record of 2:34.19 . Say what you want about the rabbiting , but the two did n't pick it up when Fawn Dorr dropped out and they were more rested because of the slow early pace . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday night , the other two Oregon Project women traveled to Washington to run the 800m on Saturday. - <p> The result ? Hasay finished 5th in 2:08.85 , which is not necessarily the time you 'd want to have run going into this attempt . This Friday , she 'll just need to go a little slower through 800m ... and then run it again . <p> And now , because there 's always the chance that someone defies the aforementioned reasoning and pops a big one , here are a few more points for you Oregon Project faithful . <p> #4 : Post-race interviews were positive and post-race workouts were more impressive than the races <p> The first is a little sports psychology from someone who 's not a doctor ( ie : me ) and the second is from off-hand knowledge from the reliable Alex Lohr . <p> If you watched Mary Cain 's post-race interview from Boston , where she thinks she " could have run faster , " you 'll notice that she finds the positives from an unsuccessful attempt . The same could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she talks about running 62-second quarters for her post-2:08 workout . <p> I 'm no Freud , but that 's a good mentality to have going into a tough weekend . <p> While we do n't have the specifics on Hasay and Rowbury 's workout from Washington , we do have some information about the one in Boston . <p> Per Alex Lohr , Moser and Cain were slated to run 4x800 and 4x400 after their race . The two split between 2:20 - 2:25 for the 800s and between 60 - 57.5 for the quarters . <p> If you watched the Workout Wednesday , you 'll hear the coaching staff refer to this as one of Cain 's best pound for pound workouts . <p> Ed . Note : This was written Wednesday morning , so if there 's no link to the Workout Wednesday , that means it 's still being finished . <p> #5 : " If you do n't go after records , you have no chance of breaking records . " <p> The theme of the Oregon Project 's record chase is n't just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes , but is something that the Oregon Project holds true . <p> Let 's talk about the pace and rabbits . Stephanie Herrick of the Central Park Track Club , who boasts an 800m PR of 2:04.92 , will take the first 600m in 1:37 - 1:38 . Then Rose-Ann Galligan , who just ran 2:03.69 for 800m in Iceland last week , will try and get the field to 1200m in 3:16 . From there , it 's fair game . <p> Is the group going to make an attempt ? Yes . Do I think that the American record will go down ? No . <p> Still , I have n't said anything about the girl 's world junior 1500m mile record . If you want to see Cain can break Kalkaden Gezahegn 's 4:24.10 mark , hear what the Flotrack brain trust has to say . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

After graduating from high school , he joined the Marines , then went on to provide security for President Bill Clinton and his Secretary of State Warren Christopher . As a powerlifter , he won the World Powerlifting Organization World Championships at the Arnold Classic in 2006 . Three years later , he set the all-time world record in the 220-pound weight class , squatting 1,003 pounds , deadlifting 810 , and benching 738 for a three-lift total of 2,551 . He invented the " Kroc row , " a one-arm barbell row with ultra-heavy weight and as many as 20 repetitions . Transitioning almost seamlessly to bodybuilding , he was featured in numerous magazines and sponsored by the supplement company MuscleTech . But his hyper-masculine fa+ade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman than a man , Kroc attempted to transition in fits and starts over the course of the last decade , a process that was hastened on July 27 , 2015 , when a YouTube video outed him as the transgender woman Janae Marie Kroczaleski . Janae has since become an activist for transgender rights , is in the process of writing a book about her life , and is featured in the upcoming documentary Transformer , which will air this fall . The following is an update on the joys and difficulties of her transition , told in her words . <p> Like it or not , we have to use labels to describe ourselves . I identify as transgender , gender-fluid , and non-binary . If I was forced to pick a gender , I 'd say that I identify as female more than male , but I do n't fit neatly into any one box . I can be hyper-masculine and hyper-feminine . There 's a degree of fluidity to my gender . It changes over time depending on circumstance : the day , the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as you label yourself a certain way , people are going to ascribe whatever they know about that label to you , and it may or may not fit . When I say I 'm transgender , whoever I 'm talking to is going to immediately assign everything they know about being transgender to me , whether or not it actually applies . If your only exposure to transgender people is something you saw on The Jerry Springer Show , then everything you know about transgender people is not only completely inaccurate in regard to me , it 's also probably very negative . <p> My gender identity is very complicated and has created a lot of frustration and confusion for me . Over the course of the last ten years , I 've started and stopped transitioning eight times , and it was always for the same reason . As I 'd start to transition , I would make myself lose weight because society conditions us to believe that strength and muscles are for men and women are n't built that way . As independent as I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressures most women do , trying to achieve this unrealistic feminine ideal . <p> Whenever I wanted to start losing weight , I would cut back on my lifting , but I would always get frustrated because I missed training hard and did n't want to be weaker . I thought , " How can I be a woman if I 'm so passionate about strength training and wanting to be big and strong ? " There was this constant back and forth . I went through periods where my femininity weighed on me so heavily and I felt this need to transition , then I 'd start to do it and I 'd get frustrated because I missed heavy lifting . <p> Before I was outed and fully committed to transitioning , I 'd weighed more than 250 pounds for almost 20 years . At one point my weight climbed as high as 280 , but I dropped all the way down to 200 about a year and a half ago in an effort to look more " feminine . " I also did n't lift at all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken more than a week or two off from lifting since I was 12 years old . <p> To fill my competitive desires , I started training to do a triathlon , running , biking , and swimming . I enjoy all sports , but what I love more than anything is strength training , and I realized I would never be happy without having that in my life . Trying to walk away from it made me realize how much I loved it . <p> There were some things I enjoyed about being ( relatively ) small . It was much easier to find clothes that fit me , and I was more comfortable wearing certain outfits than I 'd been before . But at the same time losing so much of the strength and size I 'd worked so hard to attain frustrated me . <p> I also started to feel vulnerable . It reminded me of how I felt during my childhood when I was small and skinny . I only weighed 100 pounds in seventh grade and 118 during my freshman year of high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of times , and I remember being terrified . I forgot all about that feeling until I started losing weight and getting smaller during my transition . I hated that feeling . <p> When I 'd start to feel that way , I 'd think , " You know what ? Maybe I 'm not trans . Maybe transition is n't the right move . " Then I 'd go back to doing the guy thing 100 percent . It was this constant back and forth for a decade . <h> The Lightbulb Moment <p> A huge turning point for me came when I started getting closer to some of the top female power lifters . After coming out , I became really good friends with a lot of them , and I saw that they also struggled with trying to balance their passion for strength training with their femininity . In our society , there 's a lot of pressure on women to not be thick and muscular . They 're told , " You look like a man . " Discovering that these women struggled with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that it was n't just me who felt this way and that I could n't simply blame it on being trans . <p> Last April , I decided to just do what makes me happy and what feels right . I went back to training the way I 'd always trained . I hit the weights really hard and , after dieting for almost nine months , allowed myself to start eating more again . My weight shot up to 240 right away and got as high as 254 in October . Because I 'd gained a little body fat , I scaled back my diet , cutting some calories , but I did n't scale back my training . <p> Now my body weight fluctuates between 230 and 240 . I would n't mind being a little leaner , but I 'm not dieting like I would pre-contest . Having to follow a diet that you can only do for a short period of time would make me miserable . My goals at the gym are still to get stronger and be in the best possible shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle and strength I have right now . <p> If being big and strong makes me happy , then there 's no reason I should have to give it up . I do n't care what anyone else thinks . In our culture , being strong and being feminine are supposed to be contradictory , but they 're not . That 's just something we 've been conditioned to believe . The idea that strength and muscularity is only for men is not only outdated but completely absurd . Fortunately , our society 's attitude about what women are supposed to be and what men are supposed to be is beginning to shift . We 're moving in the right direction , but we still have a long way to go . <p> I 'm happy with where I 'm at now . I 'm okay with being someone who stands out in public . I know people are going to stare and that does n't bother me . I realize I 'm not a common sight . I 'm secure enough about who I am that I really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem with my transition , that 's their problem , not mine . I 'm comfortable in my own skin , and that 's what matters most . <p> I 'm sure I confuse some people . I had vocal feminization surgery in January and my voice has gotten higher . I had facial surgery in late April . And I went to work every single day from October until just a few weeks ago presenting as female . But then I showed up at work a few weeks ago in " boy mode " --my nails were painted and I carried a purse , but I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt and had no makeup on--and my coworkers looked like they 'd seen a ghost . They had almost forgotten what I look like when I 'm not presenting as female . <p> Like I said , I do n't fit neatly into one box . There 's a fluidity to my gender . Whereas before I thought , " If I 'm a woman , I have to do this and if I 'm a guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fit in , " now I really do n't care because I realize I would never find peace trying to conform to these gender roles . If I feel like being a little more masculine one day , I 'm more masculine , and if I feel like being more feminine the next , I 'm more feminine . <p> I 'm still decently strong in the gym , but now I 'm more focused on being a well-rounded athlete than the strongest person in the world . Your training has to be really focused if you 're striving to be number one in the world . You 've got to be willing to sacrifice everything . If I got injured during a competition , I did n't care . One year I experienced a partial tear of my triceps a week before the Arnold , and I went and lifted anyway . I did n't care if I tore it all the way off . I just hoped I 'd get enough lifts in to win before it occurred . <h> The Hormonal Advantage <p> The lifting community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get tons of messages from people who tell me , " Thank you so much for being open and honest about who you are . " As it turns out , there are a lot of male lifters who feel this pull toward a female gender identity . It 's far more common than anyone suspects , but , just as I was , these people are terrified to be their true selves and to share with their family and friends how they really feel . <p> A lot of female lifters have encouraged me to lift at their competitions as a " guest lifter . " ( I would n't be competing against anyone , and I would n't be eligible to break any records . ) They 've told me they would be honored to compete with me and have welcomed me with open arms , which I really appreciate . I was afraid it would be the opposite , that they would n't accept me and would feel resentment . <p> I miss competing , but for now that 's not something I 'm interested in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on transgender athletes and powerlifting . If I competed , there would be huge backlash . Anytime the idea of a male-to-female transgender athlete competing with women comes up , everybody freaks out . People say that it 's unfair , that it 's a man competing against women , and that they 're going to break all the records , even though that 's never actually happened . Male-to-female transgender athletes have competed against women in NCAA events and the Olympics , but none of them have done all that well . <p> To my knowledge , no trans woman has ever broken a world record or even medaled at the Olympics , although Laurel Hubbard , a weightlifter from New Zealand , may change that . She recently won the Australian International weightlifting competition , set a new national record for the women 's clean and jerk , and hopes to compete at the 2020 Summer Olympics . If she succeeds in breaking a world record and especially if she wins Olympic gold , I fear that the resulting backlash against transgender athletes will be severe . Trans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and many have done so , but you 've never heard about them because they were n't successful . Now that a transgender woman is having some success in weightlifting we 're already seeing a slew of articles about how unfair it is for her to be allowed to compete . <p> The primary athletic advantage that males enjoy over females can be traced to hormonal differences ; - i.e. , having more testosterone and less estrogen . Hormones make a bigger difference in athletic performance than any other single factor . But once you remove that advantage , once you take away the testosterone and add estrogen in the same levels that a genetic woman would produce , any advantage that a male-to-female transgender athlete initially had will disappear over time . <p> I experienced this firsthand . When I got testicular cancer in 2004 , the doctors removed one of my testicles . In November 2015 , I had the other one removed , this time voluntarily , so , other than the minuscule amount my adrenal glands generate , my body no longer produces testosterone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I did my strength plummeted . My lifts went down 20 , 30 , even 40 pounds in a week . I would go in one week and put on the weight I 'd used just a week prior , and I would n't be able to lift it . It finally leveled off , but the difference between what I could lift before and after I started taking estrogen was dramatic . <p> It 's fairly typical for transgender athletes to experience this sort of drop-off . I once read a story in a runner 's magazine about an elite runner who transitioned from male to female . She thought , " I 'm going to dominate the female runners . My times as a male were really fast , so now they should be among the very best . " That did n't happen . Instead , her times dropped off proportionately . If she 'd been in the top 10 percent of all male runners , she ended up being in the top 10 percent of all female runners , but she was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrogen , my strength has decreased dramatically from where it was before but only proportionately between the genders . After being one of the strongest men in the world , my strength is now on par with the some of the best heavyweight female lifters in the world . I do n't have any plans to compete against them , but if I did , I would be on the same level as them . <p> I recently met a woman who was in favor of doing away with gendered sports altogether . She felt that most women do n't perform on the same level as men because they 've been conditioned to believe that they ca n't , that the disparity between men and women in sports is as much psychological as it is physiological . Anytime you set the bar lower for certain people , you encourage them to lower their expectations , but I do n't agree with her 100 percent . While there is some truth in what she believes , it 's unrealistic to completely discount the effect that hormones have on our bodies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women 's performances close a bit . If you look at the women 's records over the last 50 years , they 've progressed a lot more than the men 's have . But the gaps are still huge . In many sports , the top male high school athletes in the world are often on par with the top female athletes in the world . There are some social factors that help explain the gap , such as the fact that women have n't been as active in sports for as long as men and the fact that more men compete in sports than women , but I do n't think the advantage provided by testosterone will ever be overcome . As much as I wish it were a completely level playing field , it simply is n't . <h> Normal Is An Illusion <p> I do think we 're moving toward a place where it 's more acceptable for people of both genders to live any way they see fit . In our society , women can pretty much wear any type of clothing they want . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wear makeup . They have a lot more freedom to be who they are without it being shocking or taboo . We 're seeing that more with men , too . Guys are growing their hair out and wearing skinny jeans and tights . A couple years ago , you could n't find tights that were specifically designed for men . Now all the major athletic retailers carry them . <p> It 's important to recognize that gender roles are almost entirely arbitrary . They 're determined by society , and they change over time . In the 1930s , women were n't allowed to wear pants in public . I remember my grandma telling me that , when she was younger , women would n't be allowed to enter a store if they were wearing pants . <p> Not only do gender roles change over time but from culture to culture . For example , Iceland is very progressive when it comes to gender and sexuality , while Saudi Arabia is on the opposite end of the spectrum . What is acceptable for a woman in Iceland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia . <p> The idea that gender roles should be set in stone and never change , that women should still be emulating the 1950s-housewife persona and men should be ultra-macho , not show any emotion , and only pursue careers deemed " masculine , " is extremely harmful . Anyone who does n't naturally fit into these categories will be frustrated as they try to live up to ideals they 're never going to be comfortable attaining . Anytime you force yourself to be someone you are n't , you 're never going to be happy . <p> We 're all different in our own ways . We all have characteristics we do n't feel confident about or we 're afraid to reveal . And we 're all struggling to feel comfortable with who we are , even if we do n't have any issues with our gender or our sexuality . Unfortunately , we 're stuck on this idea of being normal . But normal is only that side of ourselves we 're comfortable sharing because we think it will be accepted by the people around us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19704 @qwx219704

In this week 's technique focus , Everett breaks down the snatch , making sure to pinpoint specific factors that ultimately lead an athlete to success , or failure. - <p> Your movement under the bar in the snatch or clean can be slow for a few different reasons , and that will affect what exercises help . If it 's truly the pull under the bar that 's slow , it may be a strength issue , a technique issue , or a lack of aggressiveness . I 'm going to discuss everything using the snatch , but you 'll be able to apply it to the clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength first . You can think of the third pull in three basic parts : the initial pull of the body down toward the bar , the turnover of the bar , and the punch up under the bar . Each of these parts can be strengthened best individually because one usually limits the weights than can be used for others , but can also be trained together with certain exercises . <p> - <p> For the initial pull under , it 's an issue of arm , back and shoulder strength--the ability to forcefully pull the elbows up and out . The simplest exercise to strengthen this movement would be a tall snatch high-pull . You wo n't be able to use a lot of weight--it 's not a strong movement for anyone--but this is pure upper body strength in exactly the position and movement you want . You may not even be able to use an empty barbell--you may need to use a lighter technique bar or even dumbbells . Stick with 5-6 reps , 3-5 sets. - <p> - <p> You can also do snatch high-pulls from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accelerate the bar initially , then use the upper body to finalize the pull to the top position . This will allow you to use more weight as well as better simulate an actual lift . Stay flat-footed if you want to emphasize the upper body more , as this will force you to limit how much hip and leg speed you can put on the bar . To use even more weight , do snatch high-pulls from the floor with maximal speed. - <p> - <p> To strengthen the turnover of the bar , you 'll need to use a muscle snatch or long pull variation . You can use the same kind of principles described above for the high-pull . To completely isolate the upper body movement , perform a muscle snatch from the tall position , which means you get no leg or hip at all . These will be very light--do n't make the mistake of trying to load it up or you 'll end up changing the movement , which defeats the purpose . You can add more weight by doing the muscle snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another good exercise for turnover strength because they keep more tension on the upper body throughout the movement. - <p> - <p> Finally , to strengthen the punch up under the bar , use snatch balances or drop snatches . Drop snatches will not allow you to use as much weight , so if you want to load it up , do a snatch balance . These are also great exercises to improve your speed and timing in the very last portion of the third pull ( which is really a push ) . - <p> - <p> Strength may not be the problem ; it may be technique . If you 're not moving yourself and the bar optimally , your pull under will be slower than it should be . Be sure your elbows are rotated to point to the sides throughout the first and second pulls so they will remain properly oriented upon entrance into the third pull . Do n't worry about shrugging under the bar--pull with your arms and the shrug will come along at the right time and to the right degree . Pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar in immediate proximity--the bar should be close enough to smell on your way past it. - <p> - <p> Continue pulling the elbows up even as your turn the arms over--keep tension on throughout the movement . It 's common to see lifters suddenly get slack in the system at this point , and that only slows them down and increases the chance of an unstable receipt of the bar . As you finish the turnover , flip the hands back into the proper position and punch up under the bar with a relatively loose grip .

You have an extremely brief moment when the bar is weightless at the apex of its elevation , and if you 're not already moving under the bar , you 're losing the opportunity .

Consider the second and third pull together a single continuous action rather than two consecutive actions. - <p> - <p> To work on this , you can high-hang snatches or power snatches--this will allow you to better focus on the final extension and change of direction .

We already compared Regions to see how the qualifiers stacked up against each other by comparing their scores , so this time , we 're digging deeper . <p> First , we scored this year 's Regional results using 2014 's Regional scoring system to see what may have been different . Then , we examined the pros and cons of the two systems . <p> In 2014 , the scoring system was simple : Athletes were awarded the same amount of points as their placing , and at the end of the competition , the athlete with the lowest score won ( this is the same system used in the Open ) . <p> Implemented in 2015 , the new Regional scoring system awards set amounts of points for each place an athlete finishes , and the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 95 points , etc . Also , the- point differential gets smaller as the places get bigger--after sixth place , it changes to two-point increments , and after 30th , they switch to one-point differentials . <p> The new system rewards outstanding performances more and does n't punish poor performances as harshly as the old system . It 's also much easier on an athlete with weaknesses if he or she does well in other events . Since the point spread changes as you go down the rankings , it keeps an athlete with a bad finish closer in overall points since the punishment is not proportionate to the reward for a top finish . <p> Applying the 2014 Regional scoring system to this year 's results shed some light on the pros and cons of each system . Starting with the women , here are the changes we found . <h> Pacific and West : Nothing Changes <h> Pacific <h> West <p> In the Pacific and West Regions , the qualifiers and the qualifying order did not change . Undoubtedly , this year 's top five women are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Games . <h> Atlantic , Meridian , and Central : Similar But Different <p> In the Atlantic , Meridian , and Central Regions , the top five women were the same , but the finishing order changed . <h> Atlantic <p> In the Atlantic , Alea Helmick ( 57 total points ) jumped from fifth to third without any finishes below 14th . Meg Reardon ( 60 ) and Christy Adkins ( 61 ) each fell one place down the leaderboard , but kept qualifying spots . Reardon 's 25th on Regional Nate and Adkin 's 24th on the snatch ladder affected their scores most between the two scoring systems . <h> Meridian <p> In the Meridian , Sam Briggs ( 47 ) and Erla Helgadottir ( 44 ) flipped places with Briggs ' 25th on the snatch ladder , which pushed her to fifth place , while Helgadottir moved up to fourth--she did n't finish lower than 13th in any event . <h> Central <p> In the Central Region , the standings shook up quite a bit , but the same five women qualified for Carson . Stacie Tovar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower than ninth . This pushed Sheila Barden ( 46 ) to second ; Jennifer Smith ( 54 ) moved up to third ; Brooke Wells ( 55 ) took more of a hit from her 32nd on Regional Nate , which dropped her to fourth ; and Krist Aramo ( 61 ) stayed in fifth place . <h> South , East , and California : Whoa Nelly ! <p> The most dramatic shakeups came from the South , East , and California Regionals , where qualifiers changed . <h> South <p> In the South , third-place finisher Tennil Reed ( 76 ) dropped to sixth as her 34th in Regional Nate and 20th in the pistol/power clean event did more damage . Candice Wagner ( 67 ) moved up from fifth , and Michaela North ( 73 ) , controversy or no LONG ... took the No. 5 spot . <h> East <p> This year in the East , Dani Horan missed qualifying after finishing in sixth . But the old scoring system rewarded her consistency--without any finishes lower than 11th , she was given fourth place . Michele @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **25;333;TOOLONG her to fifth , which moved Kari Pearce ( 52 ) into third . Tasia Percevecz ( 66 ) would not make her rookie debut at the Games this year due to her 26th and 22nd place finishes on the wall ball/pull-up and pistol/power clean events . <h> California <p> The biggest difference showed in the California Regional , where we saw major drops and a couple of tie-breakers ! Alessandra Pichelli ( 67 ) , who took third this year , dropped to seventh after paying a big price for her 31st place on Regional Nate and 22nd on Event 4 's couplet of pistols and power cleans . Jamie Hagiya ( 58 ) moved from fifth to third ; Chyna Cho ( 60 ) stayed in fourth ; and we required a tie-breaker between Brooke Ence and Colleen Fotsch ( both with 63 points ) . Ultimately , Ence would qualify on the strength of her finish on the heavy deadlifts of Event 5 . The race for the top spot would have been exciting as well with Lauren Fisher and Rebecca Voigt tying at 44 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As you can see , the scoring system matters , and it 's interesting to see how the new system has impacted the outcome of each Regional .

Although Cheserek won the national title in 14:51.5 , his question for perfection in breaking eight out of eight course records came to an end in California . <p> How Cheserek is rated in 2012 compared to his 2011 campaign will depend whether he believes he can make the jump from King of Cross Country to Emperor of Distance Running . <p> There is a fundamental difference between a king and an emperor . A king rules over one country ( kingdom ) while the emperor rules over many ( empire ) . In a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Since we 're discussing history , we might as well stretch the imagination with a story from early 19th century . Edward Cheserek 's 2012 cross-country campaign is parallel to the Coronation of Napoleon I. <p> Napoleon explained , " To be a king is to inherit old ideas and genealogy . I do n't want to descend from anyone ... The title of Emperor is greater . " Napoleon did not want his rule to be based on tradition , but wanted to start a new empire . <p> There was no higher authority in 19th century France than the church . During the coronation ceremony , the Pope would typically crown the new leader . The act of placing the crown on the king meant that the Pope and the church was symbolically more powerful than the actual leader of the country . <p> But Napoleon did not want his rule to be overshadowed by the clergy . Before Pope Pius VII could place the crown on Napoleon 's head , Napoleon grabbed the crown and crowned himself . There was no higher authority in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to crown himself this upcoming season . His main concern should not be the other competitors or his margin of victory , but his legacy . <p> If Cheserek can break Reuben Reina 's Footlocker course record of 14:36 , then Cheserek will be considered the greatest cross-country runner of all time . Additionally , if Cheserek can complete the NXN and Footlocker double championship , there will be no doubt of his legitimacy . <p> If he can accomplish these goals , then Dathan Ritzenhein , arguably the greatest high school cross-country runner of all time , will not place the crown on Cheserek 's head , but he will take it and crown himself emperor of high school distance running . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The event- shifted to- a battle for- second place. - Team USA held the position for the first 81 reps , - but- a sluggish finish that relegated the Americans- to third as Team Europe held a steady pace throughout the event to sneak into the position by just under six seconds at a time of 5:18.44 to the USA 's 5:24.10. - The surprise was the non-factor status of Team Canada , which- brought up the rear of the field from the beginning and earned zero points in front of its- home audience at 5:58.69. - Sadly for the Canadians , this was a position they would see for most of the two-hour contest . <h> Women 's Team Max Snatch and- Clean and Jerk <p> The men got to rest in a doubleheader event , as events two- and three- let the ladies have the spotlight to themselves in a test of weightlifting followed by- gymnastics. - Event two was a combination of one-rep- max snatch plus a one-rep- max clean and jerk split between the two teammates. - They would work together in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webb , who hit a new personal best in warmups of 220 pounds , did n't see the same success when it counted . The 2016 " Spirit of the Games " honoree- missed both attempts in window one at 200- but- connected in round two to put Pacific provisionally in second. - That second-place position was two points ahead of Canada , with the retiring Michele Letendre hitting 198 to a massive ovation from the home fans . But the lead- belonged to Europe , as two-time " Fittest Woman on Earth , " - Katrin Davidsdottir , - hit a new personal best of 202 . Team USA was- in the back of the pack , with Kari Pearce hitting 180 . <p> The two-pound lead for Europe would n't be able to hold off the Aussie contingent in the clean-and-jerk portion as 2016 Olympian Tia-Clair Toomey was- successful at 247 , bringing the Pacific total to 447 . Two-time Games bronze medalist Sara Sigmundsdottir had a shot at the win- but was unable to hit the jerk at 250 pounds and- settled for her first-round success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went- to Canada , as Carol-Ann Reason-Thibault- backed up Letendre 's 198 snatch with a 232 clean-and-jerk . Brooke Wells , the strongest woman in the 2016 Games field , matched Toomey 's 247 for a total of 427 and a fourth-place finish . <p> Standings : - After two events , Team Pacific had a perfect score of nine points , Europe sat in second with six , USA stunningly held third with just two points , and the home- nation of Canada got- on the board with a single point . <h> Women 's Team Handstand-Walk Relay <p> The ladies stayed on the floor for event three --- the handstand walk relay. - The Americans entered the event in a surprising third , but this event boded extremely well for them with the second- and third-place finishers in the similar event at the 2016 Reebok CrossFit Games , - and it went exactly to plan for the United States . Wells and Davidsdottir opened the relay neck-and-neck , with the U.S. holding a lead of less than a second at the trade-off , but Pearce- opened up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. cruised to a victory at 1:03.44 , nearly 20 seconds ahead of Europe at 1:22.34. - Canada ( 1:32.68 ) would hold off Pacific ( 1:48.87 ) , keeping the points leaders from adding to their total . <p> Standings : - As the men came back out to join the women for event four , the point race was nearly as tight as it could be. - Through three of seven events : Pacific retained the lead at nine points ; Europe was just a point back in second ; - the U.S.- trailed- in third with five points and Canada with two . <h> Bars , Rowers , Bikes , and Pigs <p> The midway point of the competition brought the longest event of the day , a three-rounder with four movements ( bar muscle-ups , rowing , biking , and Pig flips ) . - While a- troubled back for 2015 champion Ben Smith was a- concern for the USA heading into- the Pig flips , - the movement- proved to be- no kryptonite for the CrossFit Krypton athlete . But while the USA would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds , Wells started to fail on bar muscle-ups , opening the window for both Pacific and Europe , which- pulled within two seconds of the lead moving onto the row/bike portion of the final round . Europe and USA were- level going to the final two Pig flips with the Pacific just one second behind , but Europe- had- a bit more in the tank and stole the event win in the final reps at 8:27.92 , with the U.S. in second at 8:29.48 and Pacific in third at 8:36.28 . Canada- once again failed to record a point , as Reason-Thibault struggled with the Pig flips throughout the event , and the team would fall behind by more than two minutes ( 11:04.36 ) . <p> Standings : - The late stumble by the United States was- welcomed news for the Europeans , as the event win moved them into the point lead after four events with 14 points- and- three ahead of Pacific at 11. - The U.S.- held third at nine , followed by Canada still in the back with two points . <h> Men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time in an hour , the ladies finally got a chance to rest as the men took the floor for their turns in events four and five , - The snatch portion belonged not to USA 's Smith- but Canada 's Brent Fikowski . " The Professor " hit a textbook lift in round two at 285 pounds to take the lead through the snatch portion , eight pounds ahead of Smith ( 277 ) . Bjorgvin Karl Gudmundsson was 4 for 4 , - ending at 270 pounds , and Rob Forte pulled a successful 260 in round one- but was unable to add to that in round two . <p> When the clean-and-jerk half of the event started , - all eyes turned to " The Fittest Man in History " Rich Froning- and- for good reason. - The four-time individual champion finished- with a competition personal best-tying 365 to give the USA the event win ( 642 combined ) , only two pounds clear of Canada 's Fikowski and Patrick Vellner . The third-place finisher from July won- an epic battle out of the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 640 . Europe received- 340 from Lukas Hogberg to combine at 610 for third . Meanwhile , - the early point leaders continued- to stumble with Forte and James Newbury finishing last at 595 following the 2016 Games rookie 's best lift of 335 . <p> The back- half of the men 's doubleheader saw a reemergence of Team Pacific 's success , as Newbury went the length of the floor in just 36 seconds and- Forte followed- just as quick , giving Pacific its third event win of the day at 1:06.49. - Smith put the U.S. in second at the turn and Froning was able to hold off a fast-closing Vellner and Hogberg for second at 1:08.99 , with Canada in third at 1:10.45 and the point leaders from Europe earning no points at 1:11.53 . <p> Standings : - One event remained and Europe continued to cling onto the lead at 15 points- but was only one clear of both the United States and Pacific teams at 14. - Canada was- already- mathematically eliminated from championship contention with just five points . With the final event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guaranteed winner-take-all battle for the top- three . <h> Men 's Team Handstand-Walk Relay <p> The finale started in mixed-gender pairs for three climbs each , followed by- 30 strict handstand push-ups each ( while their partner holds a handstand ) . - The pairs- came together for 30 reps each of Slug cleans , Pig jump overs , then finished with- a final set of Slug thrusters. - In the three-way battle for the title , it was an early race between Europe and Pacific through the rope climbs with the U.S.- ( and Canada ) a few seconds behind to the handstand portion . But Europe- made- quick work there to open up an eight-rep lead on the cleans. - Canada- moved into the picture as a spoiler team as it- crept ahead of the United States by a couple of reps , placing itself between the U.S. and the event leaders from Europe moving to the Pig jump overs . The Canadian push was exactly what Europe needed , as it- received a fight to pull away from its championship foes , opening a 15-rep lead over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the thrusters. - It was a lead the Europeans- would not surrender . <p> Europe ( 9:24.16 ) took the finale and the Invitational championship just seconds ahead of a solid high-note finish for Canada at 9:27.59. - In a fitting battle for two teams that entered tied in the standings , USA- edged out Pacific by a 10th- of a second ( 9:38.89 versus 9:38.99 ) to take third in the event and second in the final standings as neither team would play a factor in event seven . <p> The Invitational championship for Europe is a crowning achievement for a team that had expectations of being the champions a year ago before crashing to a surprising last-place finish . That was not a result forgotten by the team as it returned with three of the four members ( Hogberg being the lone new addition replacing Jonne Koski ) . - The added experience showed as Team Europe looked composed through the entire competition and can now prove that the European expectation is in fact reality . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

A program is usually written for a specific individual , for a specific time frame , aimed at a specific result ; it 's not just a collection of random workouts viewed over time . That said , most of us are just looking for a good workout most of the time . So how do you write a good workout ? <h> Understand what came before <p> If you do n't know what you just did , you may end up unnecessarily repeating yourself and putting more stress on one part of your body than you need to in order to get a good workout and improve your fitness . <p> Understanding the basics and having a method of analyzing and categorizing what kinds of workouts you 've done recently will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the following questions about your most recent workouts : <p> how long did that workout take ? <p> about how many reps were involved ? <p> was it heavy or light or somewhere in between ? <p> which body parts were mostly used ? <p> what types of movement patterns were involved ? <h> Understand what you want to get out of your workout <p> When you 're trying to put together a good workout for yourself , you should have an idea of what you want to get out of it . Are you trying to get stronger ? Are you looking to work on your cardio ? Maybe you want to develop or master a specific skill or practice a certain pacing . For the general fitness enthusiast , your " constantly varied " approach will encourage you to do things differently , so if you recently have done a bunch of strength stuff , maybe try something more on the cardio or muscle endurance side of things . <p> As far as skills development , practicing positioning , or just working small weaknesses or imbalances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues . For example , mobility , stability , fixing imbalances , and positioning can all be used as a general warm up or cool down all the time . You can work on your handstands , do light snatch balances , core work , or improve your mobility every day before or after your workout . <h> Pick appropriate movements , reps , and loads for your goal <p> So now you know what you 've done recently and what you want to do today . Here 's the fun part : plug in movements that work . <p> Let 's say you want to do something more along the lines of pacing a CrossFit Open workout . You may pick a couple of common movements from the Open : bar facing burpees and thrusters for example . You 'll pick a load similar to what you may see in the open , so maybe 95/65 . Working pacing is all about consistent , sustained , and conscious effort so you 'll want to do something like : <p> 5 rounds of:12 thrusters12 bar facing burpees*rest 1:1 ( so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting the next round ) <p> Your goal there would be to keep the pace equivalent across all 5 rounds and in that way develop a better understanding of what your pacing should actually feel like . <p> Maybe you want to go heavy , get some strength work in but keep the pacing high enough to get a good sweat . Pick something you can get heavy in that 'll benefit you a bunch , like a front squat . You can do something like : <p> Every 3 minutes for 6 rounds:3 front squats*work up to a heavy triple by the third round , and repeat that same weight across the last rounds <p> Or you want to go long and aerobic . Pick movements that are relatively easy to cycle , things that wo n't slow you down as you move from one movement to the next . How about rowing , Russian kettlebell swings , and light overhead squats ? <h> Succeed ! <p> These are all pretty different types of stimulus with different movements and different rep schemes and each one will be tough if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your session with muscle up posititoning practice , a double under tabata , or finish your session with some back extensions on the GHD and you 've got yourself a pretty rad workout that 'll leave you feeling good and was n't super tough to put together . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Instead , they seem to get stronger each year . If you do n't believe me , look no further than 2015 's World 's Strongest Man final . Of the 10 athletes who competed , three were in their 40s -- including the runner-up , ++ydr+nas Savickas ( " Big Z " ) . <h> Paul Carter , England <p> Standing at 6-4 and tipping the scales at more than 205kg , Paul " The Manbear " Carter lives up to his nickname . Unsurprisingly , Carter is the biggest athlete in the lineup and certainly has strength to match . Pulling 400kg and squatting 375kg , he will be one to watch on the static lifts -- especially the 350kg car deadlift , which could pose problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here , we 're transitioning from the biggest competitor to one of the smallest , but quite possibly the most jacked : former pro bodybuilder Eric Patterson . At only 117kg and 5-11 , it might be easy to dismiss Patterson as a lightweight , but I 'd advise against it . The 47-year-old grandfather holds American records in log , axle and deadlift -- all of which will serve him well on the notoriously tough Viking press . But from what I 've heard , I would n't bet against him on the moving events , either . <h> Dennis Van Beusekom , - The- Netherlands <p> Smaller than many of the competitors , Van Beuskekom makes up for his lack of height with plenty of fitness , and I imagine he will be looking at the frame and yoke carry events with glee , because that 's where his athleticism should really come into play . But with a 390kg deadlift and 170kg log press to his name , he wo n't be shying away from the static events , either . <h> Mark Felix , - England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction among strongman aficionados . Not only is 50-year-old Felix the oldest in the field , but he is also arguably the most accomplished with 11 World 's Strongest Man competitions under his belt . Known for his incredible back and grip strength , Felix has been undefeated for seven years in the deadlift at WSM . Even against the quality of athletes in the masters field , I doubt anyone will surpass him on the car deadlift or the frame carry . Felix will be tough to beat in every event , especially the stones . <h> Stefan Bergqvist , - Sweden <p> Specialising in one event has its perks -- just ask the deadlift monsters out there . But when it comes to walking away with hardware , nothing compares to consistency . Fortunately for Bergqvist , that 's something he has stockpiled over more than a decade of competition . He has placed in each of the last 12 Sweden 's Strongest Man competitions , and finished on the podium in four of them . With a 370kg deadlift and a 300kg squat , Bergqvist might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that does n't mean he wo n't be able to cause an upset . <h> Nick Best , - USA <p> With seven World 's Strongest Man competitions behind him , I doubt much rattles Nick Best these days , but he must be feeling particularly confident about coming to Doncaster this year . The last time the former powerlifter was in Yorkshire , he won the heart of everyone in the Giants Live crowd by regaling them with stories of wild nights and past competitions in between the events instead of resting behind the curtain . Athletically , Best is one of the strongest , and could secure a top-three finish in every event perhaps with the exception of the Viking press . <h> Mike Kromer , USA <p> The big American truly earned his invite when he completed inhuman feats of strength despite the blistering-hot temperatures at the North American Official Strongman Championships in Indianapolis earlier this year . Kromer is a fantastic all-arounder , as demonstrated at that competition , and this will be his first time performing on the world stage . <h> Rob Frampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arnold Classic Australia left Frampton 's strongman career hanging in the balance , many feared he would n't be able to compete this Saturday . Always happy to prove the haters wrong , the World 's Strongest Man competitor is looking to prove there 's still some fight in the old dog . With 14 years of high-level strongman competition to his name , Frampton is a true veteran of the sport who can always be counted on to keep the crowd entertained , as evidenced by his recent professional wrestling debut . As a strongman , Frampton is statistically right up there with the best -- he sports a 405kg deadlift and a 190kg overhead press , which should put him in the mix for the top spots in the static events this weekend . <h> Vidas Blekiatis , - Lithuania <p> If you are n't familiar with the name Vidas Blekiatis , you certainly will be after this weekend . The Lithuanian has been quietly building an impressive collection of accolades , including the 2015 and 2016 World Log Lift Championship titles . But he can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved at a masters world championship , where he dominated a field that included Mark Felix . Although Blekiatis is not one of the biggest competitors , he is one of the strongest . He boasts the best log press and squat PRs out of any of the competitors : 205kg and 440kg , respectively . Looking through his recent social media posts , it 's clear he is n't resting on his laurels , either -- he made a 420kg yoke look like speedwork . Take my word for it : Vidas wo n't be happy leaving Doncaster with anything short of absolute victory . <h> John ' The Machine ' Pollock , - Scotland <p> The Scotsman brings an unusual package to the competition . A veteran powerlifter , the static lifts are his bread and butter , and I suspect he 'll relish the opportunity to turn some heads on the car deadlift . Strength aside , he 's one of the more athletic guys in the competition . At only 40 years old and weighing in at a lean 120kgs , Pollock is n't afraid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Machine " is still new to the sport of strongman , and will be looking to gain as much experience as he can this year before going for the win in the near future . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Tonja Buford-Bailey was also announced as the new associate head coach for the Longhorns . <p> After ten years of coaching at the University of Illinois , Buford-Bailey will oversee the sprints , hurdles and relays to go along with administrative duties . Her expertise extends as far back as her days as an Illini athlete , when she made the 1996 Olympic team and won a bronze medal . " My first objective was to get the ball rolling on who finding an associate head coach , " Sategna said .

" Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men 's and women 's distance runners . Coach Sategna said staff members from the Bubba Thornton era will be considered for the job . John Hayes was the men 's distance coach in 2012-2013 , while Stephen Sisson oversaw the women. - Sategna cited the success of Leo Manzano as one of the most positive signs of the Texas distance program . The men 's program has seen a resurgence since Jason Vigilante arrived as the head coach from 2000 to 2008 . Hayes also made the move from the women 's team to the men 's team after 2004 . <p> " We do n't want to get away from the things that have made us great .

Shalane ( left ) finished 16 seconds in front of teammate Kara Goucher ( right , back ) . For Goucher , the time was only 14 seconds off of her best marathon ( 2:25:53 ) time which she ran in NYC back in 2008. - <p> Our New Zealand fav , Kim Smith , finished 15th in a solid time 2:26:59 . <p> Team USA teammates Flanagan and Goucher help each other off the course after the grueling marathon race. - <p> Soon after the last update Keitany faded as we thought might happen . Gelana was the first to throw in a surge and the past London Marathon Champ had nothing left to respond . Behind Gelana , - Jeptoo and Arkhipova chased as time and ground were running out. - <p> Half a kilometer after the surge was throw- Arkhipova was out of the picture and Jeptoo began to fade . <p> The gap continues to lengthy and all the stands between Gelana and the finish is her own fatigue , which she had well under control . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meters to go and a long straightaway ahead , the finish line is in sight . <p> 200 meters to go , Gold medal almost in hand . <p> Gelana crossed the line in a PR and new Olympic Record of 2:23:07 . For the next four years bragging rights will be in Ethiopia . The second half of her race was run in 1:09:54 , a 3 minute and 19 second negative split . <p> 40k Split : They are seriously still together up front , Flanagan Fading Split : 2:16:10 Last 5k : 16:40 <p> The four women still remain and with only 2k to go we can not believe no one has separated or made a move ! This leads us to believe that Keitany is having a rough go . When a race favorite does n't have the confidence to take control in the late stages its hard to believe they 'll be a factor the last 1k . <p> Shalane Flanagan who had moved into 5th place has faded back to 8th place , now 1:33 behind the leaders .

Russia looks good and now taking the lead for the first time ! Gelana of Ethiopia sits with her and looks smooth . Of the two Kenyans that remain , Jeptoo looks to be more comfortable than pre-race favorite Keitany . It 's hard to say Keitany ca n't be the one to take this but the next 7k will tell us the story . <p> Right after the 35k mark Shalane Flanagan moved into 6th place , 28 seconds behind the leaders and closing on a fifth place Kiplagat . <p> Kara Goucher still sits in 12th , 1:09 behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Moving quietly through the field and up front now is Russia 's Tatyana Arkhipova .

So after the hours of research put in to rank this top 50 , if there is still someone that is not on this list that is deserving of being so , but is n't a better 5k or 10k runner , let us know . We definitely want to make sure we have the best 50 women 1500-meter runners in the NCAA on this list . We promise we 're not trying to insult your family or your best friend. - <p> 1 . Natalja Piliusina- ( Oklahoma State ) - 4:09.51 <p> I see a lot of similarities between Mac Fleet of Oregon and Piliusina of Oklahoma State . Both have incredible 800m talent , but are capable of kicking with the same speed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reigning champion and , as so , is deserving of this top spot . WIth the second fastest PR in the group and the race savvy to win in any type of race , Piliusina is the favorite to win the 2014 1500m title heading into this season. - <p> 2 . Cory McGee- ( Florida ) - 4:06.67 <p> After having the- strongest summer of any collegiate 1500m runner , it was very difficult for me to not put McGee at the top of this list . Qualifying for World 's and running 4:06.67 is absolutely out of this world good . But , McGee has yet to run a great - race at NCAAs and Piliusina has proven herself race in and race out . <p> The battle between the two will be outstanding this season . I think McGee can kick from farther out and will need to in order to fend off Piliusina and her nasty speed . There may be no other race as exciting as this one will be in Eugene in June. - <p> 3 . Emily Lipari- ( Villanova ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is a master tactician . Lipari had so much left in that mile she won at NCAAs that I was surprised she did n't start her victory lap straight after she crossed the line . <p> With the 7th best PR in the NCAA and the momentum carrying over from NCAA Indoors , Lipari will be the last person Piliusina or McGee will want to see on their shoulder at NCAA Outdoors . Coach Procaccio is developing some of the most outstanding middle-distance talent in the country right now and I 'm all aboard the Lipari and the Villanova bandwagon. - <p> 4 . Katie Flood- ( Washington ) - 4:11.38 <p> Call me crazy . That 's fine . I know Flood has not been as good as she once was . Toby Keith once sang , " I ai n't as good as I once was , but I 'm as good once , as I ever was .

Stephanie Brown- ( Arkansas ) - 4:14.41 <p> It looks as if Brown has turned her focus away from the 800m and on to the 1500m . Coming off of a 2nd place finish at NCAA Indoors and a 6th place finish last year in Eugene , Brown is certainly one to keep an eye on . <p> Brown has great 800m speed ( 2:02. xx PR ) and understands how to race , indoor and outdoor . She also gets to run with a very , very solid group of athletes and more you surround yourself with quality athletes , the easier it is to improve . Stephanie Brown will certainly be a factor in Eugene this June. - <p> 6 . Carly Hamilton- ( Georgia ) - 4:12.15 <p> At Drake Relays in 2013 , many were shocked to see not only how fast the time was ( 4:12.15 ) , but who the winner was . Carly Hamilton is now not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or championships setting ) , but has proven herself to be great when it matters--5th place at NCAA Indoors in Albuqerque ) . <p> Hamilton has the 5th best PR of any girl in the NCAA , was 14th Outdoors in 2013 , and will be one to watch for in Eugene this season. - <p> 7 . Shelby Houlihan- ( Arizona State ) - 4:13.64 <p> I was surprised to see when I compiled this list and all of the PRs of the top 1500m women in the NCAA , that Houlihan was n't in the top 10 . This proves to me that Houlihan most be one of the strongest racers in the NCAA . <p> I also believe that Houlihan will certainly dip under the 4:13 mark this year and maybe even go sub-4:12 . <p> Considering how well she ran in Cross Country , her strength and speed is a scary combination . Along with her race savvy , Houlihan is a dark horse 1500m favorite heading into this 2014 Outdoor season. - <p> 8 . Linden Hall- ( Florida State ) - 4:12.16 <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out party as she shocked a lot of very good 1500m runners and beat them to qualify for the final . In that final , Hall finished 9th and put herself in the conversation as one of the best metric milers returning for 2014 . <p> Linden went on to back this up with a quality XC season and a solid indoor , and qualifying for NCAAs . Although the altitude might have affected Hall more than some of the other athletes in the field , Eugene is as flat as a pancake ( similar to her home town of Melbourne , Australia ) and Hall will certainly be looking to improve upon her 9th place finish from 2013. 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The new venue is not just a soccer stadium or a tennis stadium , it 's a 164 acre complex with a large , covered hockey stadium with equally- easy access to water and wooded areas . <p> Carson and the StubHub Center were solid venues , but in practice the athletes were regularly bussed around all of Los Angeles just to get to various other venues ( like the beach ) for events outside of the main venue .

Toomey finished eighth in the event and Davidsdottir finished tied for 12th . The points were n't enough for Toomey to jump over Davidsdottir , and for the second consecutive year , Katrin Davidsdottir is named the Fittest Woman on Earth . This makes her the second woman to do so after- Annie Thorisdottir in 2011 and 2012 . <p> For the first time in CrossFit Games history , we see the exact same podium finishers in the exact same order as the year before . Davidsdottir in first , Toomey in second , and- Sigmundsdottir in third. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Basically , we 're trying to figure out , right now , who stands the best chance of qualifying for regionals , nationals , and who is going to score at NCAAs . <p> I will once again be breaking down only those that I feel will score in the 1500m and then list the rest of the 42 by how I feel they stack up against the each other. - <p> It is also important to note that I did my best to only include those athletes that seem to focus primarily on the 1500m . There are many very good 1500m runners that are not on this list because they generally run the 5k , 10k , or 3k Steeple more often than not . Some of the PRs listed are converted from a mile. - <p> Again , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't on this list that is n't a very good 5k or 10k guy , let me know , so we can give them some love--I 'm not trying to offend you or your family , I swear. - <p> 1 . Mac Fleet- ( Oregon ) - 3:38.35 <p> Coming off a third place finish at the high altitude 1500m in Albuquerque , Fleet is definitely the favorite to defend his title this year . Considering the race is at Hayward Field , and that Fleet looks to be much better on a 400 meter track than 200 , Fleet is as tactically gifted as they come . With is speed really coming around in the 800m and his very strong base from cross country , Fleet is fit and ready to repeat in 2014. - <p> 2 . Lawi Lalang- ( Arizona ) - 3:33.20 <p> So the PR difference between Fleet and Lalang is astonishing , but here 's why we put Lalang at no. 2. - He 's most likely going to double . If this is the case , he 'll be facing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy Kithuka thrown in the mix . If he 's doubling and has to come back on a hot June day in Eugene to beat reigning champ Fleet , that seems to be a tall order . <p> Still , we can not forget that Lalang , on paper , should be the favorite . Maybe , we 're just jaded because we all wanted him so badly to triple at indoors and it did n't happen . We 'll see how things pan out this outdoor season for Lawi. - <p> 3 . Peter Callahan- ( New Mexico ) - 3:41.14 <p> Forget about him ? I almost did ( thanks Gordon Mack ) , but you should n't . Remember the guy that shocked a lot of teams in the DMR in 2013 and anchored Princeton to a national title ? Now a Lobo at New Mexico , Callahan is primed for a big final season. - <p> With his finishing ability , you can never leave Callahan out of the conversation when it comes to athletes that are capable of winning any race . His PR is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will certainly see him scoring big points in the 1500 for Joe Franklin and the New Mexico Lobos at NCAAs in Eugene . - <p> 4 . Austin Mudd- ( Wisconsin ) 3:40.37 <p> Although Mudd had a somewhat lackluster indoor , that gives me even more reason to put him high on this list . He is a very very tough competitor and is very well-rounded on the track . Mudd was fourth last year and with the extra motivation to overcome his challenges this indoor , I feel that Mudd is ready to reach the next tier of 1500 meter runners in the NCAA . <p> Do n't be surprised to see Austin run sub-3:38.00 . With a possibly deeper 1500m field than last year , Mudd would do well to repeat his - performance from 2013. - <p> 5 . Rich Peters- ( Boston U. ) - 3:37.67 <p> Although , our boy " Dicky P " has yet to really tear it up outdoors , he is looking great coming off a fantastic indoor season . His fourth place indoors was great in the mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national 1k record earlier in the year . <p> I think Peters is better suited for a 400 meter track that allows his frame to take advantage of the straights . Although he was 19th in 2013 , Peters is certainly one of the best five 1500m runners in the NCAA and will prove it in Eugene. - <p> 6 . Will Geoghegan- ( Dartmouth ) - - 3:40.47 <p> I have jumped aboard the Will Geoghegan bandwagon and for good reasons . Not only was he maybe one of the biggest surprise performances from NCAA XC , he had an amazing indoor season to follow that u , p where he finished 5th at NCAAs in the Mile . He might not have the best chops in the 1500 , right now , but if he does n't break 3:40 his first or second attempt in the 1500 this season , I will be very surprised. - <p> 7 . Jordy Williamsz- ( Villanova ) - 3:36.74 <p> One of the most impressive races this recent indoor season was the Iowa State Classic Mile , where Jordy Wiliamsz proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamsz ended the season off decently , finishing 8th in Albuquerque . Considering his chops though , I think he underachieved . It 's hard to leave a guy who has run so fast in both mile and 1500m out of the scorers at NCAAs and if Williamsz can keep his momentum from indoor and race well when it matters , he should be looking at scoring some serious points for ' Nova. - <p> 8 . Zach Perkins- ( Air Force ) - 3:41.46 <p> I almost feel like a bad person putting last year 's 2nd place finisher six places lower than where he finished the year before . It 's just that Perkins did not put up anything worthwhile enough this past indoor to really merit that much . <p> To his benefit , Perkins is a big guy and sometimes those tight turns are difficult to manage for bigger fellas . Also , he could have had some injury or illness that we were not made aware of . Either way , Perkins was only beaten by Fleet in the final in Eugene last year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hopefully can prove us wrong and repeat 2013. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

With- Jenny Arthur 's spot- locked in and Sarah Robles ' spot- essentially untouchable , - just- one of Team USA 's three spots is- up for grabs in a very tight race. - <p> Arthur was first named to the women 's team back in January via Path 1- ( honoring the athlete who scored the highest number of points in the previous two World Championships ) . The other two spots will- be decided based on Path 2 , the " Ability To Medal " ( ATM ) standard . Although 15 of the nation 's top female lifters will- compete- for those two spots , the real competition will be for the third and final spot between the four women with the highest ATM percentage . On February 22 , 2016 , USA Weightlifting- ( USAW ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Path 2 : ATM Ranking List . <p> Based on the Path 2 ( ATM ) statistics , it was- apparent that- Robles had all but secured the second spot on the women 's Olympic team . A previous- member of the 2012 US- Olympic Team- with extensive national and international experience , - Robles is currently ranked by the International Weightlifting Federation- as No. - 10- worldwide in the 75+ category . Since returning to competition after- a two-year suspension , - she has dominated the national scene , set- two- American records , and- performed- well at- Worlds with a 279kg total , which- helped- earn important points toward- the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio . <p> Seeing that the second spot has been all but secured by Robles , the bigger question is , - " Who will be the third woman on Team USA ? " Looking at the ATM standards , there are really only a few women capable of attaining- this third spot . It will come down to Mattie Rogers ( 69kg ) , Morghan King ( 48kg ) , Kathleen Winters ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle it out for the final spot . <h> Mattie Rogers <p> Mattie Rogers ' - juggernaut of a performance at Nationals Juniors , where she went- six-for-six and set- all three senior American records for the 69 kg category , has positioned her as a strong favorite . Rogers will enter- these Olympic Trials with remarkable- momentum- -- she has- performed increasingly better in each competition she has entered , and more importantly , as- a heavier lifter , she will know the numbers her lighter competitors have scored . By virtue of lifting after them , she- will know the numbers she needs to hit to secure this spot . Rogers is predicted to surpass her previous American records ( 105kg snatch /133kg clean and jerk , and 238kg total ) with a 110kg snatch , 135kg clean and- jerk , and a 245kg total . This will give her an ATM score of 95.553 , which is still not enough to beat Robles , - but a very strong performance nonetheless . This outcome would- likely make Rogers the third 2016 US- Olympic Team member . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . <h> Morghan King <p> Morghan King , who- actually qualified in both the 53kg and 48kg weight categories , has a real shot at that third spot as well . Her ATM is higher as a 48kg , which is the category she will compete in during the Trials . King is capable of big numbers , and she could- score- a 79kg snatch and- 100kg clean and- jerk for- a 179kg total . These numbers are still lighter than the current American records ( 82.5kg snatch , 102.5kg clean and jerk , 185kg total by Tara Nott ) , but they- would give her an ATM of 95.927 to- potentially- edge- out Rogers . Morghan King appears to have the best chance of- beating- Rogers for that final spot . <h> Kathleen Winters <p> Another strong contender is 48kg lifter Kathleen Winters , who matched her all-time best total of 165kg at Worlds . She has lots of national and international experience , and recently added several kilos to her total , which is now- neck-and-neck with King 's . She would also need a 179kg total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48kg women will battle it out with Rogers for the third spot . <h> Jessica Lucero <p> Finally , we have Jessica Lucero , who has really been on the rise . Coming off a first-place finish in last year 's USAW Nationals , she delivered another- solid performance at- Worlds with a 199kg total . She- also increased her total in local meets- and seems poised for- another very competitive showing . She would- need to greatly increase her current best total of 199kg to 220kg to score an ATM of 95.556 , which would put her- ahead of Rogers ' - projected score . This would be a very tall order for Lucero , but do not count her out . Anything can happen , and we will all just have to wait and see what happens on May 8 . <h> So , who 's it going to be ? <p> Jenny Arthur- secured her spot as the first named team member of the 2016 women 's Olympic Weightlifting Team .

Here are my picks for the top 10 women heading into the 2016 CrossFit Games . <h> 1 . Kara Webb ( AUS ) <p> She 's been on the brink of winning the CrossFit Games two years in a row . In 2014 , a neck injury pulled her out on the last day . In 2015 , she suffered from severe heatstroke early on , and still finished fifth . This is Webb 's year to put it all together , and her performance during the Open supports this theory . <h> 2 . Sara Sigmundsdottir ( ISL ) <p> Young , fit , and disciplined , Sigmundsdottir had an incredible rookie year in 2015 when she finished third overall . If she could have tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have won the Games last year . Her strength and consistency will work to her advantage , but she 'll have issues with any agility or sprint events . <h> 3 . Annie Thorisdottir ( ISL ) <p> The 2011 and 2012 champion is a force to be reckoned with . She had to withdraw last year after getting wrecked by Murph , which clearly affected her performances across the rest of the weekend . With a year of recovery and fitness under her belt , the Queen of Smiles will be back for a podium spot in 2016. <h> 4 . Emily Abbott ( CAN ) <p> Abbott 's strength has always been her strength , and this year , she 's upped her game with longer , more gymnastic , and more engine-based workouts . Between that improvement and her already high-level power and work capacity , she 'd poised for a top-five finish in 2016. <h> 5 . Sam Briggs ( GRB ) <p> Briggs has the best arms and engine in CrossFit , and even if she were to rely solely on those two gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consistently finish in the top three in multiple events at the Games , and has the work capacity to do well even in events that do n't necessarily play to her favor ( like Heavy DT in 2015 ) . Unfortunately , the field of competitors is getting stronger each year , and her subpar showings in those few strength-based events will be difficult for her to overcome . <h> 6 . Lauren Fisher ( USA ) <p> Little Fish finished ninth in her rookie year at the 2014 Games . She did n't qualify last year after injuring her ankle the week before Regionals , but that could work in her favor since she did get a chance to compete on the Invictus Team and did n't get put through the wringer like many of these other athletes . She 's hungry to return to the big show , and she 's only gotten better . <h> 7 . Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir ( ISL ) <p> The reigning champion is awesome . She knows how to suffer , has a great team of coaches and support , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 24th in 2013 , to not qualifying in 2014 , to winning the 2015 CrossFit Games . Her biggest strength is her mental game , which is clearly demonstrated by the fact that her performances got better as the Games went on last year . But her margin of victory was just too close to mark her as the favorite going into 2016. <h> 8 . Brooke Wells ( USA ) <p> Wells kicked 2016 off with a win at WZA , and has been putting in a ton of work to make 2016 her best year yet . She 's improved significantly from her rookie debut all the way to this year 's Open , and I expect that improvement to continue at the Games . <h> 9 . Kristin Holte ( NOR ) <p> Holte is my pick for biggest improvement . She 's got the work capacity to win events , and she 's been working on her strength a ton this offseason . Between that and her mental toughness , she 's headed for a top-10 finish at the Games in 2016. <h> 10 . Tia-Clair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tia-Clair Toomey is young , strong , and ready to make 2016 her year . I think she 's got the capacity and will to put herself in the top 10 , but I think the different events in 2016 will work against her . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

That was a surprise for everyone . But after some protests and scoring recalculations , Providence was announced as the runner-up to the Oregon women . <p> Was that a surprise ? To some , yes . Providence was ranked eighth in the USTFCCCA National Coaches ' Poll prior to the NCAA Championships , but we thought they were very , very underrated ( according to The Butler Projects , Providence was slated to finish second , which they did ) .

In case you want to skip the quick math , her win at NBON was 5:14.85 pace . <p> We were pumped for Erba this fall , but her last three meets were mixed . The season-long battle between her and in-state rival and eventual Foot Locker champion Anna Rohrer ended with Erba finishing runner-up to Rohrer at the Indiana State Meet .

His analysis track and field is unparalleled and according to the ladies of Florida State , he 's quite the singer too . If really like to stay updated , be sure to follow him on Twitter too . Every year , there seems to be a debate over which state produces the best cross country runners in the country . Of course , most states believe that they put out the best harriers around and they probably have some good logic to back up their argument . This year as I tuned in to the NXN and Foot Locker races , I started thinking the same thing . Which state really is the best at turning out the highest quality of cross country runners per capita ? <p> So I decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I found to be a fair assessment of the top runners in the country . I took the results of the top-50 finishers from each Foot Locker Regional and the top-100 runners at NXN . Foot Locker is usually more oriented towards individuals and NXN more towards the team race ( although some athletes are doing both and the trend is leaning towards NXN for individuals than Foot Locker anyway ) . <p> Based on the elite teams and individuals at NXN , I believe that the top-100 runners at NXN were most likely the highest quality of athletes in the race . Also , the top-50 from the Foot Locker Regional races makes sense to use because there are four regionals and of the four , only one lands on the same day as NXN ( West ) . <p> After compiling the nearly 300 names per gender , I sorted the spreadsheet by state and came up with how many athletes from each state met the given criteria . With the number of athletes qualifying for the list , I then took the population of each state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best cross country running state in the country , but population across the board seems reasonable ) and found how many runners in the given state met the criteria of the list per every 1,000,000 people . <p> Editor 's Note : We thought about asking Isaac to change his criteria to reflect state gender population , but the results would have been pretty similar anyway . If you 're interested , here 's the census . <p> The number associated with the state is the amount of people per 1 million individuals that live in the state who are some of the elite high school runners in the country . The beauty of running is that you can either run that fast or you ca n't and at the end of this week , the entire country will know , at least what region , in the U.S. has the best high school cross country runners in the land . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

His- event lead showed- he was- back in top form after a few injury-plagued years .

After the log lift , - Bjornsson- moved back into first- place- and looked on pace for his third consecutive Europe 's Strongest Man title . <h> Car Walk <p> The car walk proved to be the key turning point in the contest. - Shahlaei was the current world record-holder in the event going in , and did not disappoint . He- obliterated- the 20-meter- course in a- faster time than his previous world record , despite the car being even heavier . Bjornsson looked fatigued , and while he finished , he lumbered down the course in a time that just was n't enough for the day , - which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 4.5 points- out of first place , with Arsjo in second and Shahlaei in a comfortable first place. - Overcoming that deficit- among- eight- competitors was a tall order for Bjornsson heading into the final event . <h> Atlas Stones <p> The- " King of Stones " - lived up to his title in this iconic event. - Bjornsson- easily loaded- all five- stones in a fast time for the event win , and then he had to wait to see if it would be enough. - Shahlaei would have to make a substantial mistake- for Bjornsson or Arsjo to drop in the standings .

Both Hall and- 10 challengers will have to prove themselves over the following six grueling events . <h> Safe Press , Max Reps : - 160kg <p> We got a quick glimpse of just how tough this event really is- at the Battle of the Norse Giants- late last year , with many of the athletes being left with only a few reps to show for all their hard work . From what we saw , there seems to be two distinct ways to excel on the safe press. - The first is to be brutishly strong and almost strictly press it . The other is to- master the movement , ideally with a lot of practice on the kit itself to get used to the swing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be- at the Doncaster Dome this weekend- in Hall and- Graham Hicks , both of whom will be looking for big numbers despite its awkwardness . Mark Steele and Laurence Shahlaei have- also- looked- great in training . <h> - Deadlift , Max Reps : - 350kg <p> The deadlift at Britain 's Strongest Man this year will be beautiful in its simplicity : no car frames , no fat bars and no silver dollars , just a standard gym bar loaded to 350kg . Whoever has done the most deadstop reps in 60 seconds wins . On the surface , this might not sound as exciting as last year 's van deadlift , but trust me , - with so many incredible deadlifters- competing , - the event- will provide an undilated insight into what these monsters can do . A few of the- athletes will fancy their chances on this event , primarily- Hall , who- will be looking to make light work of 350kg- with his- 500kg max . But there- is more to this event than just all-out strength , and we could see the endurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Stoltman . <h> Yoke Carry , Fastest 20m : - 2 Bikes <p> One of the brilliant things about strongman is that the weights do n't always need to be exact as long as they are heavy . This point was drilled home by the- car walk last year , when- Shahlaei sprinted- the 20m course with a Volkswagen Beetle on his back in a record-breaking 11.92 seconds . This year it wo n't be a Beetle that the competitors are carrying but instead- two motorbikes attached to a yoke frame . I 've heard rough estimates of this setup weighing an incredible 450kgs or 1,000lbs . Shahlaei will be looking to show that he is still the fastest in the world when it comes to yoke , but that title wo n't come easy. - Felix , - Hall and- Steele will all be looking to take it from him . <h> Hammer Hold , Max Time : - 30kg <p> Weighing only 30kgs , the hammer hold is definitely the odd one out in this list . But if you- ask the athletes which event they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nod . The competitors must stand with their backs firmly pressed against a pole and then hold the hammer out at arm 's length for as long as possible . While there are a few attributes that can make this easy --- weight , strength and arm length among them --- this is really a test of will and how much pain you can tolerate. - Hall took the win in this event- last year , but both- Felix and- Shahlaei will be looking to challenge . <h> Shield Carry , Max Distance : - 200kg <p> If the hammer hold is a test of mental toughness , then the Shield Carry adds- endurance into the equation . A truly heinous event , the competitors must pick up the 200kg shield and then carry it in the crook of their arms as far as possible . This task is- made even more difficult by the absence of handles on the shield- and the reduction in breathing capacity caused by 200kg of steel compressing your lungs . Expect the slightly smaller , fitter athletes to take some points back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an advantage . Adam Bishop , Paul Smith and the Stoltman brothers could all be a threat . <h> Stones , Fastest Time : - 100-200kg <p> It 's the final event and the only real way to finish a strongman competition -- five spherical concrete balls- ranging from 100kg to a huge 200kg being loaded onto platforms . With such a competitive lineup , expect any slip-ups with the Atlas stones- to cost the athletes dearly. - Hall is fantastic on stones , and barring any mistakes , - this event is his to win . But- Felix , - Bishop , both- Stoltman brothers are no slouches either . Expect drama and a close finish . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

I have also noticed that when one of those songs comes on , such as Jupiter One 's " Fire Away " , it seems much easier to run effortlessly fast . Why is this ? - Of course " Fire Away " has an upbeat tempo and words ( such as fire ) that to me suggest speed , but I have also listened to it while watching runners on Workout Wednesdays perform incredibly fast and smooth workouts .

Ivan Pavlov first demonstrated this phenomenon when he started ringing a bell every time he fed dogs in his laboratory . When people eat a series of involuntary behaviors occur that help them to digest food , including salivation . Pavlov 's dogs were no different , and salivated every time they ate . Later in his experiment , Pavlov started sounding the bell to his dogs but did not present the food , and the dogs still salivated . This allowed Pavlov to conclude that if you repeatedly pair a conditioned stimulus ( known to evoke a response on its own ) with an unconditioned stimulus , you can eventually use the unconditioned stimulus to get that same response , without use of the conditioned stimulus ( Pavlov , 2003 ) . - In Pavlov 's experiment , the food was the conditioned stimulus , the bell was the unconditioned stimulus , and salivation was the conditioned response .

You could listen to the music during hard training sessions , or before races . But other runners use different types of cues as their unconditioned stimulus . When training for the 2007 World Championships , Kara Goucher used the word " fighter " as her cue . Kara and her coaches would use the word during particularly tough training sessions when she was running well ( Barcott , 2010 ) . Thus , Kara was paring the word " fighter " with her strongest running performances , just as Pavlov paired the bell with salivation . Then during races , Kara could use the word to remind herself to perform just as she had during those challenging workouts . After all that practice , the word " fighter " had become the equivalent of the bell and the word could be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the word " fighter " , but it became a powerful cue for Kara because she used it over and over at the right times . If you decide to use classical conditioning and cues yourself , the cues could be other words or even simple motions ( such as the wipe of your brow ) . - This is what you want to become your bell. - Next , you should incorporate this word or gesture at first when you are running well. - So if your cue is a wipe of the brow , you should wipe your brow in practice situations when you are doing particularly well . Thus , you are pairing the cue ( in this case the wiping of your brow ) with a good performance . Later you can use the same cue in an important situation or when you are struggling , and the cue will evoke the same strong performance and the feelings associated with it . If you first introduce it when performing poorly , using the phrase in the future when you really need it could evoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random and must be practiced over and over for it to be effective . The cue must be paired many times in practice with the feelings you hope to have during tough races when you use the cue . Then when you use the cue in a race , you can feel just as dominant and smooth as the stars of Workout Wednesday . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

While the format has changed over the years , one thing that is- a near-perfect mainstay is the success of Team USA . In the four prior invitationals , the Americans have come away with the title three times , with the lone exception being a- loss to Team World in 2013 . <p> However , since the format changed from two six-person teams to four four-person teams , Team USA has proved to be a dominant force . Team Canada gave a late- charge in 2015 , going into the final event in position to win the title by finishing ahead of USA , but was unable to do so in an- electric arena in Madrid , Spain . <p> The question- this time around : Will Team Canada seal the deal- with a completely reloaded team on its- home turf ? <h> TEAM CANADA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Canadians . This past year 's team of Emily Abbott , Camille Leblanc-Bazinet ( who returns as coach this season ) , Alex Vigneault , and Lucas Parker has been completely reloaded . This year we see two men who had breakout seasons , a quiet but worthy of getting noticed boxer-turned-CrossFitter , and the final appearance of an underappreciated Games mainstay before retirement . <h> PATRICK VELLNER <p> Starting with the man who grabbed the most headlines this season , Patrick Vellner- won the Open in Canada East in impressive fashion , but when you share a regional with Mat Fraser you tend to be overlooked . Coming into the weekend in New York , Vellner had the attitude of proving that he belonged and his Open ranking was not a fluke. - Despite tearing the long- head of his bicep in the first event , the Montreal athlete- took- third overall in the East Regional just- after- finishing his- exams- as a chiropractic doctorate student . At the CrossFit Games , the former national-level gymnast quietly hovered around the top five for- much of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brent Fikowski for the bronze medal , despite not winning an event . Vellner had three top-three finishes , including second place in the climbing snail event , but most importantly had an impressive 11 top-10- finishes in the 15-event week . That consistency , grit , and an almost uber-Canadian positive mindset will be a great addition to Team Canada 's roster . <h> BRENT FIKOWSKI <p> In Carson , the battle for third was between Vellner 's consistency and the home-run abilities of Brent Fikowski . " The Professor " mirrored four finishes outside of the top- 20 with an eye-popping ( and rookie record ) four event victories in his debut Games appearance , leading to a fourth-place finish that was- just two points behind Vellner . The journey has n't been easy for Fikowski , who missed qualifying in 2014 and 2015 by a combined three points . This year , however , was an entirely different story , as the- former collegiate volleyball player- cruised through the West Regional , 70 points clear of second- place Ben Stoneberg . For the past couple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakthrough moment before becoming a force in the " Sport of Fitness . " That breakthrough came in 2016 , and there is no chance he will ever be considered " The Whitest Darkhorse " again . <h> CAROL-ANN REASON-THIBAULT <p> Easily the athlete representing Canada with the least amount of fanfare is two-time Games athlete is- Carol-Ann Reason-Thibault . The former boxer has made regionals every year since starting CrossFit and improved from 27th in her rookie appearance at the CrossFit Games to 14th in her second trip this year . She only scored two top-10- finishes- but never found herself with a finish worse than 25th. - Her growth as a Games athlete is eerily familiar to Team Canada- teammate- Michele Letendre . Through CrossFit and her athletic background , Reason-Thibault- has developed an excellent engine to go along with a solid strength game and has the ability to be- a Team Canada mainstay going forward . Plus , if things get super Canadian in Oshawa on Sunday , she has it covered <h> MICHELE LETENDRE <p> One of the more underrated Games athletes in the past few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday. - Michele Letendre is set to- close- her career after announcing before regionals that this would be her last- season . The six-time Games athlete took- 16th place in Carson during a week that seemed to be filled with embracing one final trip to the Games . Quietly , Letendre put together one of the more impressive resumes of a Games athlete , with 24 top-10- event finishes and a career-best fourth-place finish in 2014 while being one of just three from the 2011 rookie class to qualify for six straight- appearances . As- one of the most well-liked and respected athletes in the Games field , it comes as no surprise that many analysts are considering Letendre to be the " team mom " for Canada . With the lineup that Canada has this season , perhaps she may get a championship send-off in front of her home-nation crowd . <p> This year 's all-star event will be closing out the season with a bang- and- what should be the closest Invitational competition yet . Team USA will enter as the favorite , but Teams- Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada has a stout lineup combined with a home crowd behind it . The two-hour event typically provides for an exciting format and should be a great watch on Sunday afternoon .

The American mile record-holder had grown dissatisfied with his situation in Portland . Race results suggested stagnation , and doubters everywhere voiced their incredulity over Webb 's ability to return to peak form . The decision was made to leave Alberto Salazar and the lush green confines of Nike 's bosom and return to a more familiar -and colonial- place . With former UVA standout Robby Andrews as his new training partner , and former UVA middle distance guru Jason Vigilante as his new coach , Webb sought out to reclaim a spot among America 's miler elite . <p> Based solely on precursory glances at results or browsing the boards at Letsrun.com , it would seem that this back-to-the-basics approach has done little to rejuvenate a career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Webb remains optimistic about his training . Additonally , a 3:37.26 ( 1500m ) showing at Occidental in May offered a glimmer of hope for those remaining ardent Webb supporters . While the Virginia native has seemingly gone back to his roots in a geographic sense , recent reports indicate that Webb will once again pack up his bags -this time metaphorically- and move up in distance . The US Olympic A-Standard in the 1500m of 3:35.50 has continued to elude the musclebound and Asian-character-tattooed miler . It seems as though the event that gave him his initial success , stardom , and an appearance on Letterman , is being cast aside for a 12.5 lap mistress . <p> Once America 's preeminent miler , Webb , 29 , now joins the ranks of other athletes in the Olympic Scramble . These competitors , finding themselves just short of a requisite time or mark , are taking deep breaths , looking themselves in the mirror , telling themselves " hell , you 're good enough , champ , " and hitting the road looking for opportunities to chase down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the country the sense of urgency will be palpable . ( The alternative to The Scramble is to simply attack the trials with a reckless abandon , as NY-NJ Track Club 's Liam Boylan-Pett -boasting marks of 1:46.87 and 3:37.05- describes : <p> I did n't really do much chasing , and I 'm going into the Trials without the Olympic A , but we felt that the best way to get ready was with the right schedule rather than flying around the country chasing times . Definitely sucks not to have an A , but whatever , I 'm gon na try to sneak in and beat as many guys as possible either way . ) <p> Team Webb-Vigilante opted for the pursuit , and unlike Boylan-Pett and his Trials qualifying teammates , Webb will be on the prowl for an Olympic " A " Standard . At the American Milers Club meet on June 16th , Alan Webb is entered in the 5,000m with the intent of hitting the Olympic A-Standard of 13:20.00 . According to the meet 's website , Webb will be the sole entrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the field -comprised primarily of University of Wisconsin guys- are chasing the Trials standard ) . Accordingly , his success will be heavily dependent upon superior rabbiting , fitness and mental preparedness notwithstanding . <p> Webb has acknowledged that his greatest roadblocks are often of the self-imposed and mental nature . His 3:46.91 mile came at a low key Belgian meet , far from the judgmental gaze of the track media , but close to some fantastic waffles . So if we 've learned anything , it 's that Webb is not a fan of the pressure cooker that is a nation 's expectation . Give the guy a break . Alan Webb and his notoriously finicky psyche will be flying under the radar in Indianapolis -the Belgium of the Midwest- this weekend , and here 's hoping he gets out there , runs fast , and has fun doing it . <p> To watch Webb 's interview after his recent 1500m at Ichan Stadium , click here . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The reigning champions Christian Brothers Academy ( CBA ) from Lincroft , NJ look to run themselves into the cross-country history books as they enter the season as the number one ranked team in the nation . Can they win a second consecutive NXN team title ? <p> Since the inception of NXN in 2004 , the greatest teams in high school boys cross-country have been unable to replicate their title run . Perennial powerhouses such as Fayetteville-Manlius High School from New York , Ferris High School from Washington , and York Community High School from Elmhurst , Illinois can testify to the degree of difficult involved in the NXN repeat championships . <p> However , CBA is a special case because they have already had their name recorded in the NXN record books .

Those graduating seniors include George Kelly ( 4th in team scoring at NXN ; 23rd overall at NXN ) , Tim Gorman ( 14th in team scoring ; 36th overall ) , and Conrad Lippert ( 54th in team scoring ; 95th overall ) . <p> The returning top five have personal bests at 3200m between 9:08 and 9:17 . Lead by senior Jack Boyle , CBA looks to improve on their impressive 24-second spread for their #1-5 runners at NXN . The team also includes returnees junior Mike McMclemens , senior William Bragg , and senior Aaron Libertore . <p> Additionally , there are three runners that are making a push to toe the line in Portland , Oregon . Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but posted a personal best of 9:11.53 for 3200m this spring . Rooney should solidify an already airtight top-five for CBA . Additionally , both junior Fran Bogan and top returning freshman Jack Mangini ran the open race at the 2011 NXN Northeast Regionals , but should be looking to compete in the championship race in 2012 . <p> Christian Brothers Academy not only have the potential to be the first team to repeat as NXN champions , but the first to take home a second title . A squad such as the 2012 CBA boys seldom exists in a year following a championship because a team will graduate their top runners , which are mainly the more experienced seniors . While the 2012 CBA squad exhibits no lack of depth , can they achieve what no other boys cross-country team has ever done ? <p> When setting a world record , an athlete must be equally audacious and talented in order to do what no other athlete has done before him or her . Christian Brothers Academy must set aside the past in order to achieve history . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Who will be the top freshman in the NCAA ? <p> Taking a glance at the women 's side , Elise Cranny and Sarah Baxter appear to be obvious choices . We 've got Cranny ranked #17 in our Saucony Flo50 , - and have yet to place Baxter in the top 25 because of her outdoor season injury . Predicting freshman success is fun , but their success requires a delicate balance . <p> Last year , Flotrack ranked the Duke women preseason #1 partially because of their recruiting class featuring Hannah and Haley Meier , and Wesley Frazier ( who so famously completed a 4:30 , 10:07 , 15:55 triple at NBN Outdoors in 2013 ) . Frazier did not compete last year , and the Meiers could n't propel the Duke team to the NCAA Championships. - Similar to Duke , the Washington women are famous for having stacked incoming classes , but multiple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American status . <p> So why talk about freshmen ? Because every year there are those who will lead their teams to success . The trend of these young athletes is interesting though . In 2013 , three true freshmen placed in the Top 40 . Erin Finn was the best in Terre Haute , finishing 30th and leading Michigan to a 4th place finish . Megan Curham of Princeton ( 34th ) and Bethanie Brown of Iowa State ( 37th ) followed . <p> 2012 told a different story . Laura Hollander of Cal Poly ( 9th ) , Sarah Collins of Providence ( 10th ) , Emily Stites of William and Mary ( 26th ) and Cayla Hatton of Stanford ( 28th ) shook things up and proved their raw talent as true freshmen . Hollander , Collins and Stites have yet to race in 2014 , and Hatton is no longer on the Stanford roster . <p> So is finishing too high at the NCAA Championships a bad thing ? Absolutely not . But with the real fall season kicking off last weekend and featured races on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the top youngster in 2014 . <p> LOOKS GOOD ON PAPER <p> Elise Cranny , Stanford , Yet to debut in 2014 It should not come as a shock that we have Cranny ranked so high . A runner-up finish at 2013 NXN and 4th in the World Juniors 1500m are only two of her many accolades . The Colorado native has yet to debut in her Cardinal uniform and we may have to wait until the Wisconsin Invite to measure her up . A smart move for the much-hyped Cranny whose track season extended far longer than most high schoolers . Based on her gutsy World Junior performance , there 's no doubt she has the talent and attitude to finish top 20 in the NCAA . <p> Sarah Baxter , Oregon , Yet to debut in 2014 Quite possibly the most decorated high schooler from California , Baxter shut down her outdoor season after an injury . Was the move made to preserve her for the upcoming season as a Duck ? It 's possible , but coming off an injury is difficult , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oregon women to debut their top guns at the Washington Invite this weekend , but do n't expect to see Baxter quite yet . <p> Anna Laman , Stanford , Yet to debut in 2014 The Australian native ran 2:05 and 4:15 in 2014 , finishing 12th at the World Junior Championships 1500m final . With similar PRs to her new teammate , Cranny , there could be something magical brewing between these two in Palo Alto . Whether her track speed equals cross country success is undetermined , and we 'll hopefully find out in Seattle this Saturday . WE 'VE ALREADY SEEN <p> Bethan Knights , Cal , 15th at Roy Griak Knights was a stud in high school ( She holds the record for the fastest 1600m/3200m double ever run by a high schooler ) and claimed the top frosh position at Roy Griak , finishing the difficult 6k in 21:37 for 15th place .

Feeny won the Montana State Invitational three mile race in 16:56 and will face stiff competition in Seattle this weekend .

@@23250086 @3250086/ <p> 500kg ( 1,100lbs ) is the gold-standard benchmark that some of the lifters will try to hit this weekend , and it 's insane to think a deadlift at this weight is even possible .

Held annually in Columbus Ohio , as part of the Arnold Sports festival in late February/ Early March , it has grown to be one of the main attractions of the Arnold Sports Festival since its addition in 2002 . This year 's event offers a grand prize of over $70,000 ; making it the biggest payday in all of Strongman , and rightly so as it is the heaviest . The Arnold features no medleys or long duration moving events like seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brute power . Events will include pressing a 300lb circus dumbbell with 1 arm , a 450+lb log press , and a 1,540lb yoke walk . Given the insane tonnage , it is hard to argue the winner of the Arnold Strongman Classic is the strongest man in the world . <p> Mark Henry of WWE fame won the inaugural contest in 2002 <p> Yet the coverage for this event has been lacking , it was broadcast a few times in the early stages but has not in recent years . 50,000 people may watch 1,000+ lb hummer tire deadlifts live but for everyone that ca n't make to Columbus the best they could get was shaky cell phone videos from fans . If any Strongman contest was fit to be watched live it is the Arnold : the events are short and to the point and easy to follow with most everything being for a max or in the rep range of 5 and below and with only 10 competitors , the action is reserved for only the best of the best . <p> Thankfully FloElite agrees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Championships but the Pro Arnold Strongman classic as well !

" Where can I watch it ? Is it being filmed for TV ? There is n't a live stream ? ! " I 've been saying for years that live coverage of events is what the sport needs for the sport to grow . It was always frustrating to not have an answer but thankfully now there is ! FloElite is going to bring you unprecedented coverage of the Arnold Strongman Classic &amp; Arnold Amatuer World Championships and I am happy to announce I will be part of the team working to bring you just that . <p> Between a live stream of all the events over the weekend to preview shows , daily recaps and on location athlete interviews I feel this weekend will be even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will work tirelessly to bring a unique and unseen aspect of the sport of Strongman to you that till now was only experienced if you were an athlete at the event .

While there is no independent factor , one can assume that a combination of excellent coaching , talented players , and a devoted fan base will produce a perennial championship team . <p> If we examine legendary dynasties in different sports , we can find correlation among these factors . For example , the Boston Celtics ( 1957 - 1969 ) , Chicago Bulls ( 1991 - 1998 ) , UCLA Basketball ( 1964 - 1975 ) , and the New York Yankees ( 1947 - 1962 ) all nearly won every championship in the years listed for each team . Each team was anchored by a charismatic and intelligent coach who created a belief system that talented players could willingly accept . Whether the fans were supporting the team before or after their success is irrelevant . <p> Even in track and field , dynasties exist . The U.S. Men 's Olympic 4x100m team won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1916 and 1992 ( they missed two because of disqualifications and one for the 1980 Olympic boycott ) . The Kenyan men have won a gold medal in every 3000m steeplechase they have participated from 1968 to 2012 ( they boycotted the 1976 and 1980 Olympics ) . <p> The Fayetteville Manlius ( FM ) High School girls cross-country team from New York has exhibited the qualities of a dynasty from 2006 to 2011 . Over the last six years , FM has won six straight Nike National Cross ( NXN ) titles and will vie for their seventh title in 2012 . <p> While FM defeated their intrastate rival , Saratoga Springs High School from New York , with a score of 60 points to 84 in 2011 , the epitome of their dominance can be drawn from the 2010 NXN results . FM not only crushed Saratoga Springs with total points of 27 to 104 , but FM 's score was enough to beat the entire rest of the nation if it competed as one team . The only possible way that their 2010 NXN title run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored 15 points at NXN , which is the lowest possible amount of points a cross-country team can accumulate in a single race . <p> Fayetteville Manlius , or the " Stotans , " are coached by the enigmatic Bill Aris . Similar to any other coach of a dynasty team , Aris instills a belief system in his runners that produces success . The word " stotan " is a combination of the words stoic and spartan , which the team has adopted as both their nickname and philosophy . The " Stotans " must stay healthy , train properly , and yearn to be great . No absurd workouts or performance enhancing drugs ; just a powerful belief system . <p> Fayetteville Manlius returns six of their top seven runners from last season . Senior Jillian Fanning leads the team again after she stepped up into the #1 position last season as other top varsity runners were sidelined by injuries . Fanning finished third in the team scoring last season and posted a US #7 time in the indoor 3000m of 9:57.67 . <p> Not far behind Fanning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scoring last year at NXN . Other returners include junior Alana Pearl , senior Hanna Smith , freshman phenom Jenna Farrell , and sophomore Annika Avery . FM 's team spread from #1 - 5 was a mere 49 seconds while their spread from #1 - 7 was 1:16 . <p> FM has an almost limitless talent pool that is able to produce " Dark Horse " runners that could surprise others this upcoming cross-country season . Senior Michelle Duffy , who did not compete in the postseason in 2011 , posted a personal best of 10:03.88 in the 3000m in the spring . <p> However , all dynasties have a finite amount of years in which the team is at the pinnacle of their sport . Will Fayetteville Manlius raise the trophy at the 2012 NXN Championships or will be see another top team seize the crown ? Fans love to watch their team crush their opponents , but people also enjoy a good underdog story . <p> If everything goes according plan , the " Stotans " should carry on their winning tradition . But in cross-country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting to see how the FM team handles the pressure . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The Aggies seemed to be in trouble midway through Satruday 's action , but they stay composed and did what they had to do to come away NCAA Champs . <p> Meanwhile , Makusha 's 9.89 in the 100 tied Steve Mullings for the 4th fastest mark in the world this year and his long jump of just over 27 ' 6 " is second in the world .

They based their findings on a 40-point rating system based on four criteria with a max allotment of 10 points for each category . <p> Strength : The pushing power of a lineman or the force of an ultimate fighter Speed : The top end of a sprinter or the burst of a running back Endurance : A runner 's bottomless reserve or a boxer 's ability to keep going in a bout Agility : The balance of a downhill skier or a euro step at full speed on the break <p> First off , before we even get into how Rich Froning , the four-time Fittest Man on Earth was only deemed #32 , this article lost all credibility when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Really ? ! I do n't doubt that Steve Weatherford is fit in his own right , but do n't start a 50 Fittest article with a guy who 's position consists of punting a football and getting out of the way as bigger , faster athletes sprint and collide down the field . <p> Now let 's take a look at how SI ranked Froning in all four categories on a scale of 1-10 . Strength : 6.5 Speed : 6.5 Endurance : 6.5 Agility : 6.5 <p> I 'm not sure if this was a lack of time , creativity , or effort , but this is laughable . Not only do these numbers have no basis , these " writers " lazily applied a 6.5 across all four criteria . Are you telling me they feel Froning is slightly above average in speed , strength , agility , and endurance ? <p> Let 's take a look at each category , and compare it to Froning 's ability . <p> Strength - This to me is the most glaring blunder of them all . How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean &amp; jerk 370 lbs. , snatch 300 lbs. , and deadlift 545 lbs . is a 6.5 on a scale of 1-10 ? I 'm at a loss . <p> Speed - This is the one score I do n't look at with extreme contention . Froning is not known for his speed , but that is not to say that he is n't fast . He runs a 400m in 65 seconds and is as explosive as they come when it comes to power and Olympic lifts . <p> Endurance - Endurance is a close second for me behind strength as the greatest oversight in this breakdown . Some of you may think Froning 's endurance is his greatest strength , and you would n't be wrong . His combination of strength and endurance are what make him the elite of the elite . Froning has a motor that allows him to push through pain that would cripple most . His lung capacity is off the charts , and no one in the sport manages their endurance better than Froning . <p> Agility - If you ask any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them will tell you the snatch is the most difficult lift and that it takes years of dedication to master . ( This is why it is one of only two events judged in Olympic weightlifting ) . It takes an extreme amount of agility to move quickly and efficiently under a bar that you catch over head weighing 300-plus . Along with Froning 's lifting prowess , he can handstand walk 330 feet on his hands . Enough said . <p> Arguing who is the fittest can be like debating whether Jim Brown or Bo Jackson was the greatest athlete . There will never be a right or wrong , but strong cases can be made using facts , and statistics . <p> The fact that SI ignored facts in favor of names from more mainstream sports in deciding to rank the four-time CrossFit Games champion the 32nd fittest man in their poll with scores of 6.5 out of 10 in all four categories is blasphemous. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Each competition picks the events that it thinks will bring out the best in the athletes and provide the greatest spectacle for the fans . This is more art than science , and organizers do n't always get it right . This time , though , Giants Live seems to of hit the nail right on the head for Europe 's Strongest Man on Saturday , April 1 , in Leeds , England , by effortlessly combining our favorite movements with some that have perhaps unjustly fallen to the wayside in recent years . <p> Of course the biggest change comes in the form of the removal of the World Deadlift Championships , which has been kicking off Europe 's Strongest Man for the last few years now . But with England 's Eddie Hall having set an almost unreachable precedent for European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall on another lift -- this time the axle -- at First Direct Arena this weekend . <h> Truck Pull - 20m - Fastest Time <p> The other major change to the event lineup at this year 's Europe 's Strongest Man is that it is no longer a one-day show . The inclusion of the truck pull on Friday changes everything for the competitors . Recovery becomes a huge factor , if they want to be at their best for the next day . This is especially true as the pull itself is reported to be hellacious ; the competitors will have to pull the truck a brutal 20m run on slight uphill . <p> Terry Hollands is known as one of the very best in the world at this event , a reputation that he has proved worthy of time and time again . Going into this first event , it will be difficult to bet against him . However , all it would take is one misstep from Hollands , and it becomes open season for some great truck pullers in the lineup . - - <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredibly beautiful about a max axle . To the layperson it looks nothing more than a slightly enlarged version of the barbells they 're familiar with from their own gyms , and the technique it requires -- the continental clean -- is often misattributed to poor form . As is so often the case with strongman , however , looks can be deceiving , and the Apollon 's Axle is arguably one of the most technical lifts in the sport . <p> This year the competitors will be going up against a particularly nasty piece of kit . A two-inch thick , unknurled , non-rotating axle with a giant cartwheel on either end . Simply , it could not be any more awkward to pick up if you designed the thing for that sole purpose . It wo n't be normal men , though , who will be battling this monstrosity , and we should see some big numbers going up , maybe even a new world record . Hall is looking brilliant on this event and has been seen putting up 200kg with relative ease in training . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 460kg - 20m - Fastest Time <p> Returning for the third year in a row at Europe 's Strongest Man is the car walk . And you 'll find no better example of how quickly this sport is progressing than in this event . When it was first introduced , most of the athletes struggled to even get it across the line . Three years later , however , and there are three or four guys all with their eyes firmly on setting a new world record . England 's Laurence Shahlaei is the current holder of that record , taking 11.92 seconds to run 20m with a Volkswagen beetle strapped to his back . While Loz may be the fastest man under a yoke ( or car ) in the world at the moment , there are a few who want to take that title , including Hall and the Polish sensation Mateusz Kieliszkowski . <h> Deadlift - 362.5kgs - Max reps <p> You ca n't have a strongman competition without a deadlift . While it might not be the crowning glory of this year 's Europe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite event . And it will be an incredibly straightforward one at that : 362.5kgs loaded onto a standard barbell and after 60 seconds whoever has done the most reps wins . And with the caliber of deadlifters present , you can expect an epic showdown too -- although it would take a man far braver than I to bet against Hall , the greatest deadlifter to have ever walked the earth . The real battle will be for the points available for second place , and eight out of 12 competitors have a fair chance of snatching those . <h> Tire Flip and Drag - 410kg - 20m - Fastest Time <p> Not that long ago the tire flip was the cornerstone strongman competitions , but in recent years it 's seen a drastic fall from grace . Many athletes have even gone as far as skipping the event altogether amid fears of tearing their biceps . However , the reality is that the tire flip is no more dangerous than many of the other events we see at shows around the world and is a brilliant test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be pushed even further this time , though . Not only will they have to flip the tire the length of the course , but they 'll also have to drag it back . This is an event that will favor the larger but fitter athletes , as they will be able to leverage their weight on the drag back . Expect to see Thor and Loz pushing for a winning time . <h> Atlas Stones - 140kgs- 200kgs - Fastest Time <p> Is there any better way for a strongman competition to close than head-to-head atlas stones ? If the competition is as close as people are predicting , then it could all come down to that final pairing . The athletes that want those points , though , are going to have to be fast over the five stones and not slow down as they get heavier . Starting at only 140kgs , the weight quickly ramps up , with the final stone totalling in at a man-breaking 200kgs . <p> There are a few guys who will be wanting to sign off with a victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been known as the king of the stones because of his prowess on the event . Luke Stoltman , however , proved himself the best stone lifter in the UK a few months ago at Britain 's Strongest Man , beating everyone including Eddie and Loz .

She currently sits at #22 in the Saucony Flo50. - <p> Princeton 's Megan Curham may pose the biggest threat to Borchers on Friday . Curham was 34th in Terre Haute last year as a freshman , finishing as the second frosh behind only Erin Finn . Curham ran an impressive 16:00 5k on the track last spring which showed that her first XC season was no fluke .

With #2 Stanford most likely sitting two of their top three , a victory becomes all the more likely. - <p> Prediction : Guessing the individual winner is tough because we 're not sure who is running from Stanford , but we 'll say that Jim Rosa wins in a close finish with Futsum Zeinasellassie .

The Ducks were less than impressive at Bill Dellinger , but that was a month ago , and they were not at full strength . If Baxter and Waverly Neer compete , the Ducks will be our favorites to score a victory at U-Dub. - <p> Prediction : Even if the Ducks are without Baxter , we think they will win on Saturday . With no Cuffe either , Neer scores a victory in her first race in the Oregon uniform. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

" I knew in today 's events I could do what I needed to do . " he said . Not a doubt in his mind he would be back to Carson , and not a doubt in our minds if he can battle back like he did this weekend he 's going to put up a fight at the Games this summer . <p> Zeke Grove and Mitchell Sinnamon both will be making their first appearances at the Games as individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grove and Khan Porter . In the end , slowed down by a no-rep on one of Grove 's rope climbs , Porter took the win , but Grove still managed to snag just as many event wins in the weekend as Porter .

At the end of the weekend only 2 points separated Sinnamon and the 6th place finisher , Ricky Garard . <p> It 's worthy of noting , despite Brandon Swan 's hospitalization the evening after day 2 , he came out for the final day , and looking far better than the day before .

Long , slow runs to build the runners ' base have been replaced with a more-focused , speed-oriented regimen that leads to peak form come November . While each athlete 's ultimate goal is to be at their best at the end of the season , there are a few meets early in the schedule that coaches and runners circle on their calendars . For over 25,000 runners , the Mt . SAC XC Invitational is one such meet . Held annually for the last 66 years in Walnut , CA . Mt . SAC is famous not only for its terrain ( all dirt , hilly ) , but also for its alumns . Most recently , Mt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16:00 in 2012 that smashed the course record by 16 seconds .

SAC Cross Country CourseLocation : Walnut , CAUsage : Elementary , Middle school , High school and College- - - - - - <p> History : The Mt . SAC XC Invitational began in 1948 as a way to promote a sport that at the time had no other regional competitions in the state of California . With two divisions consisting of men and boys , 148 runners competed in distances ranging from 1.2 miles ( high school ) to 3.1 miles ( college ) . According to the meet website , most of the competitors in the inaugural meet ran barefoot on the course , relying on their thick calluses to protect their feet from the terrain . While Abebe Bikila may have immortalized the barefoot runner with his shoeless victory in the marathon at the 1960 Rome Olympics , it should be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as forgiving- the blisters of those first competitors in 1948 were often torn off , " leaving a raw and bloody mess of tissue exposed beneath . " Today , flats provide a much more enjoyable ride through the 3-mile course . <p> Layout : The 3-mile course features a unique series of hills and switchbacks that test both the runner 's physical and mental ability . Starting on a flat , concrete road known as Airstrip , many runners take out quickly as they head to the Valley Loop , which they cover twice before reaching the first- mile marker . The first mile is fool 's gold for the unseasoned , however , as the grueling portions of the course lie ahead . <p> The switchbacks that the competitors encounter at the beginning of the second- mile form the first real test of the race . The zig-zags and steady climb of the switchbacks will begin to punish the greedy who went out too fast in the first mile . Even worse than early oxygen debt from these hills is knowing the brutal terrain that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runners head toward aptly named Poop Out Hill . This hill begins to pick off the weak and separates the contenders from the pretenders . Even after completing Poop Out , there is still one mile remaining and one more nasty hill to conquer . <p> Reservoir Hill is the final test before heading to the home stretch known as the Gauntlet . Before everyone can " throw down " to the finish , Reservoir forces you to use up any strength left in your already spent legs . Any first timer that went out too hard over the first mile will remember next time that Poop Out and Reservoir are waiting . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

After tying on the opening event , the Viking press , the two exchanged the lead multiple times as they muscled through the next four events . <p> The rest of the field included four former World 's Strongest Man competitors , and many more who would n't of been out of place competing alongside Brian Shaw in Botswana this year . <h> Viking Press <p> American Eric Patterson kicked off the weekend 's action and really set the tone by battling his way to 11 reps at 145kg -- a number that kept him ahead of the pack until title contender Rob Frampton laid down 16 whopping reps . Unbelievably , it was bested by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reps and stopped before he broke a sweat . <h> Yoke <p> Next , the competitors faced a staggering 420-kilogram yoke . Understandably , it proved to be too much for some , but not for Sweden 's Stefan Bergqvist . He completed the 20-meter course in 17.14 seconds , which demonstrated he was capable of hanging with the best . But Best stole the show , and ultimately the win , when he sprinted the course in an incredible 9.29 seconds . It bested Blekaitis 's leading time by less than half a second , and put him back into the title race . <h> Van- Deadlift <p> In the third event , Felix was the clear favorite -- the van deadlift is his speciality . The Englishman has only been beaten twice in the event in his long long career , and were at the hands of 500-kilogram deadlifter Eddie Hall . But it was clear that Felix had no intention to let a third loss slip by him . With the van deadlift set at 360kg , a few athletes struggled , but the atmosphere really spurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early lead when he threw down 14 world-class reps -- a number that could only be beaten by the big four .

Five of the earlier competitors were unable to complete the course . But Pollock , " The Machine , " finished the course , and finished it fast . He ran a blistering-fast time of 15.62 seconds before jumping onto the frame to delight the crowd . Best was the next to really shake up the field -- he put up a quick time of 11.8 .

But that would n't stand up to the mighty Felix , who literally destroyed the course in a winning time of 20.38 seconds and slam-dunked the last stone straight through the top of the antique whiskey barrel much to the joy of the crowd and the dismay of Best . After the barrel was replaced and the stone thoroughly dried off , Best took the field knowing he needed a fast time to secure the title . He completed the course in a fast 21.66 seconds . Although it was n't enough to beat Felix , it was more than enough to put the pressure on Blekaitis . He knew all he had to do was put up four stones in a respectable time to take the win .

With Blekaitis only able to complete two stones , Best was declared the World 's Strongest Master . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

We 'll post daily with workouts and other protocols . Posts will go up at 9PM- for the following day . <p> See below for details ! <p> What is the goal of FloTraining ? <p> FloElite 's daily workouts are designed to improve general physical preparedness . Almost all of our workouts will include some sort of skill or strength work followed by conditioning . From weightlifting to gymnastics , we 'll provide diverse routines designed to challenge and improve your fitness . <p> Bottom line : these workouts are for anyone looking to improve work capacity across broad time and modal domains ( aka , anyone who wants to be fitter ! ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistency above all else . Training hard a couple weeks at a time before running yourself into the ground is cool , but you know what 's cooler ? Training consistently without being forced to take down time . <p> If you walked into the gym and killed yourself every day , you 'd stop progressing very quickly . With the " 100%-all-the-time " mindset , everything becomes competition -- every movement , lift , workout , and session is magnified in importance , because you 're suddenly adding value judgments . <p> Instead , most of FloTraining 's workouts are designed to put you in a space to push hard while learning how to pace and stay consistent . You can hit these workouts with plenty of intensity , and while none of them are easy , you wo n't crush yourself every day . That only results in burnout , plateau , and injury , which will cut into your ability to continue hitting workouts in the long term . <p> Your goal through each workout is to stay in control and move with purpose . Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better score or time . <p> Where does FloTraining come from ? <p> Armen developed this training methodology and philosophy through not only his own experiences , but also by running a CrossFit affiliate and weightlifting team for nearly five years . He realized the most successful athletes -- the ones who made the most progress , stayed the healthiest , and had the most fun -- were the ones who were able to consciously regulate their intensity . These people showed up every day and did the work without trying to run themselves into the ground , but also knew when it was time to turn up and let loose . <p> Prior to this realization , he 'd spent years training himself into pulp with huge volume and heavy weights , yet the fittest he 's ever been has been the result of the smallest amount of volume . <p> The Program <p> This program is based on 8 to 10-week cycles . Each workout is made up of one or more of the following pieces : strength , power and conditioning . <p> We train strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosive , and we train it through cleans , snatches , and clean-and-jerks . We view conditioning as more than just being able to breathe through a workout , and these pieces are designed to increase muscle endurance as well as mastery in pacing . <p> Skill unites all of these elements . Moving skillfully is the key to success , even through the simplest exercises . Remember : stay present and conscious . <p> Each week , the cycle has an ebb and flow of volume , load , and movements . Control and pacing are key throughout nearly the entire cycle , but near the end of each cycle , we start loosening up the reins . On these days , I will make it very clear : it 's time to turn it on and crush the task at hand . Thanks to the programming , not only will you be chomping at the bit to let it all go , but you 'll be ready and able to do just that . <p> These terms are purposely a little vague . You should treat each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your max , and sometimes 80% of your max will be a challenging single . <p> Generally speaking , light weight is anything between 50-65% of your max ; moderate weight is 65-85% of your max ; and heavy is anything over 85% . But let me say this again : this program is about being present and in control , so you should use these as broad guides . If you 're feeling good , go beyond these percentages , and if you 're feeling crappy , stay below them . It 's better that you have a few average training days in a row rather than crush yourself and take a week off . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

For former Stanford superstar Chris Derrick , one quote that stuck with him from his early running days is a message that Hakon Devries told him as a young college freshman , " Good guys take a long time to die . " As Derrick closes his collegiate career , arguably one of the most successful college running careers in history , he reflects on the process and his last race wearing the Cardinal red . <p> " I think it is a very dangerous thing as an athlete to focus on the big picture too much before a race . I 've always believed the best thing you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunn is always saying , " Derrick said after being asked about his approach to the 10k at NCAA Outdoor Championships . <p> Almost two weeks ago , Derrick 's college running career ended at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships where he was favored to win the 10k and finally earn his first championship title . The race came down to the final three of Stephen Sambu , Cam Levins , and Derrick battling for every inch of the last 400 meters . Levins of Southern Utah would be the one to emerge with the victory , followed by Sambu , and Derrick in 3rd place . It was not the ideal storybook ending for the graduating senior , who put all of his eggs in the 10k basket for the championship . <p> " I think I probably ran the style of race that I should have . The longer drive for home has always been my strength and I wanted to play to my strength . I think that something like 64-61-58 would have been good enough to win in the last 3 laps ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along those lines . I just did n't have it physically or mentally and I can only blame myself for that . Either way I think that Cam has shown that if the pace is even up until the last lap , he has the superior burst , " said Derrick on wondering whether he ran the race that gave him the best opportunity to win . <p> Looking back on the past four years , to say that Derrick has had an amazing run at Stanford is an understatement . His resume includes 14-time All American , four consecutive top seven finishes at the NCAA cross-country championships , school record holder in the 10,000 , and two-time USTFCCCA NCAA Division I Men 's Scholar Athlete of the Year , among many other honors . Although Derrick has had numerous accolades during his running career , he has never won an NCAA title , and many would consider him to be the best collegiate runner to never win an NCAA title . This last race marked the end of an era for a true team contributor to the Stanford distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have prided myself on in my running career is always putting aside how I 'm feeling and focusing on delivering my best effort . To not do that in my last collegiate race is shameful , " Derrick said explaining how his plantar fascia issues affected his mental state during the race . <p> His college racing days may be over , but Derrick will embark on the post-collegiate running journey starting with the Olympic Trials on June 22nd . Since graduating on Sunday , Derrick has signed with Dan Lilot of Aurum Sports Group , who also represents Dathan Ritzenhein , Kara Goucher , and Garrett Heath . <p> For the first step in his post-collegiate career , Derrick plans on racing the 10,000 and possibly the 5,000 , depending on the outcome of the 10,000 final this Friday at the Trials . In 2012 , Derrick posted personal bests of 27:31 in the 10,000 and 13:19 in the 5,000 , both times hitting the Olympic " A " standard for each event . With the race quickly approaching , Derrick finds his strength by reflecting on lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process ' and ' good guys take a long time to die ' pretty much sum up it up . If you add in ' consistency and moderation ' you basically have all of my running beliefs summed up in 15 words .

It 's only a matter of time before we see some big names pop into the international field of play . <p> There are a lot of reasons for this type of churn in Games qualifiers , but most of these athletes just plain lost . Between new competition in the combined Regionals , growing fitness at the top levels of the game , and injury , we 're starting to see some big names miss out and set themselves up for redemption . <p> The most notable of these would be Josh Bridges , Val Voboril , and Julie Foucher . While Foucher lost out due to an Achilles injury suffered in Regional Event 3 , Bridges was 15 points away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing in Randy and the handstand walk . <p> Voboril on the other hand had a surprisingly bad Day 1 and just could n't make up the points on Day 2 and 3 despite some masterful performances in events 3 and 6 . <p> Old faces find redemption <p> On the flip side of the coin , we saw some old faces return to glory . The East Regional 's men 's competition was full of athletes who 've been to the Games but missed out on qualifying recently . Spencer Hendel , Austin Malleolo , and Daniel Tyminski are all making their return to the Games after missing 2014 . <p> In the Central Regional , Nick Urankar broke a 4 year streak and qualified for the Games again for the first time since 2011 .

Every season we see the demands on the athletes increase . In 2012 and 2013 we saw the weights get heavy and and the field compensated to accommodate the new levels of strength necessary . In 2014 and 2015 , Dave Castro has made it clear that barbells are n't the only measure of strength and athletes who were n't able to transfer their power from the bar to their bodies were badly punished . <p> Qualifying for the Games means you 're a mutant <p> Long gone are the days of " sign up and show up " for the CrossFit Games . We 're now seeing the effects of years of serious and comprehensive training on the human body . Athletes are now popping up with tremendous capabilities in weightlifting who can also keep a high rev pace for a 20+ minute chipper and also navigate the demands of strict deficit handstand push ups. - <p> Just qualifying for Regionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of Regional level athletes has been narrowed and sharpened , qualifying for the Games means you 're a specimen of performance , dedication , and mental fortitude . <p> It 's impossible to guess where the athletes will be in 2 years , much less where they 'll be in 10 years , but expect the CrossFit Games continue to push the envelope with what they expect their competitors to be able to do and expect the competitors in turn to meet the challenge . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

It 's not that we needed it to have extra attention or that we 're organizational neat freaks . Both are true . We made sure to keep an eye on that weekend because , historically , Flotrack usually made that quiet trip to Ames , IA ; however , for reasons I ca n't explain , we did n't go last year . <p> We promised we 'd make it up to the Cyclones this year . In return , because they 're from the Midwest and everyone from the Midwest is kind ( according to Iowan Alex Lohr ) , they made this year 's Iowa State Classic absolutely incredible . <p> The quality of teams and individuals pouring into the Lied Recreation Athletic Center is nothing short of national caliber . We 're thankful we did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of last year 's hiatus as more of an " au revoir . " <p> Because this is our sixth trip to the ISU Classic ( I think ) , we 've provided six races to watch below . Here 's the link to the full list of entries . <p> This race alone makes the trip worth it . The field consists of 14 athletes who have gone sub-14 , 11 All-Americans , some national contenders , some young sleeper picks , and one with some experience on the world stage . <p> While Shadrack Kipchirchir ( running unattached , but of Oklahoma State ) has the top seed in 13:38.57 , Wisconsin 's Mohamed Ahmed is the big threat here . I mean , anytime you have a picture of yourself hanging on the heels of Mo Farah , you gain some credibility . <p> Last week at the Armory Collegiate , Ahmed had a " solid debut " in the 3k . He won- handedly- in 7:55.45 and the Badgers took home the team title . Both are all well and good , but what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about those conversion calculators ( we are ) , his winning time from New York , NY converts to roughly 13:42 for 5k . Ahmed 's 5k PR is 13:40.43 , which is from last year 's University of Washington Husky Classic . That time is #4 in Wisconsin 's school history . <p> Editor 's Note : It 's also where Kipchirchir ran his seed time . You can watch the race here . Since- Kipchirchir has yet to debut this winter , we 're unsure of his fitness . <p> What about Chris Solinsky 's Wisconsin school record of 13:30.74 ( from 2007 and oversized ) ? It should live for quite some time . <p> However , it wo n't just be a head-to-head match-up between Kipchirchir and Ahmed . There 'll be company . <p> The flowing locks of North Carolina State 's Andrew Colley will make his official return since his 7th place finish at NCAA XC . Earlier this indoor season , Colley ran a 4:12.25 mile at the Hokie Invitational . <p> It 's also good to see Wisconsin 's Reed Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double duty at the Armory College , running on the team 's winning DMR ( 9:39.09 ) and finishing ninth in the mile ( 4:13.14 ) . Connor 's last 5k was at the NCAA Outdoor Championships , where he finished sixth in 13:50.70 . <p> Rather than go through the whole feed and pick out who we think will win ( it 'll be Ahmed ) or who 's a wise dark horse choice ( it 's Villanova 's Tiernan ) , the rest of the Flotrack crew previewed the meet here . <p> Women 's Mile <p> - <p> Rather than stay home in Seattle , WA and run at the UW Husky Classic , the Brooks Beasts decided to make the trip halfway across the country to Iowa because when you have a travel budget , you might as well use it . <p> - <p> The three Brooks Beasts entrants are- Deb Maier , - Jessica Tebo , and- Jamie Cheever- . The trio opened their indoor season at the JDL Fast Track 3k , where they finished 1st ( 9:02.79 ) , - 2nd ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tebo has n't run the indoor mile since 2010 and Cheever has skipped the distance since 2009 , so it 's definitely time for a return to under-distance event for the two . That , or punishment from Brooks Beasts head coach Danny Mackey . As for Maier , we could n't find any indoor mile marks , so this might be her debut at the distance . Have fun . <p> adidas Rogue TC- Violah Lagat- is a good pick here . The former Arizona Wildcat star ran 4:05.66 for 1500m last outdoor season and will be looking to better her indoor mile PR of 4:39.42 . Last week , Lagat was in the mix at the New Balance Indoor Grand Prix 1k , where she finished 7th in 2:40.72 . There 'll be some NCAA athletes in the mix , too . Watch out for- Kentucky 's Allison Peare , - Duke 's Haley Meier and Anima Banks , and Texas ' Marielle Hall. - <p> Women 's DMR <p> While we claimed that two weekends ago was #DMRmadness , the medley absurdity should pick up right where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entries are lead by the Georgetown squad of Sabrina Southerland , Amanda Kimbers , Chelsea Cox , and Andrea Keklak and their seed of 10:55.95 . Which , if you really think about it , is kind of crazy considering the NCAA 's leading time in the DMR last year was future national champion Michigan and their 10:56.66 win from Notre Dame Alex Wilson . <p> The Hoyas will be again challenged by the Duke women . The two teams met at the Penn State National DMR , where Georgetown ran 11:04.79 to finish 4th and Duke ran 11:07.85 , placing fifth . Both teams will have different lineups for this weekend . <p> Shout-out to Iowa State for their school record run of 11:11.93 at Armory Collegiate . They bring the same team back home and will look to improve on that time , which hopefully has n't been chiseled into the record board plaque just yet . <p> Men 's 3K <p> For those fighting for an NCAA berth , the goal here will be sub-8 , in the very least . Oklahoma State 's Shane Moskowitz ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hehir ( 7:59.40 ) have the top entries , but watch out for Villanova 's Sam McEntee . Dude is a cheeky miler . <p> Even though the college men will be slugging at out , the real race will between Furman Elite 's Jeff See and Craig Forys . The two have already run 7:43.60 and 7:41.20 this season , respectively . <p> Men 's Mile <p> It 's a little reunion for ISU head coach Martin Smith . The Brooks Beast 's Riley Masters ( 3:37.19 1500m PR ) and Indiana Elite 's Frezer Legesse ( 3:41.14 PR ) , both of whom ran under Smith at the University of Oklahoma , lead a field that consists of 16 sub-4 milers . We 'll name a few below . <p> NJ*NY 's Kyle Merber has been working on his speed and posted back-to-back 1:47.94 and 1:49.69 800m marks last weekend . <p> Furman Elite 's Jack Bolas has already gone sub-4 twice this winter season , dipping under the mark at the often confused New Balance Games in New York ( 3:59.38 ) and the New Balance Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split ) . <p> Leaving the crisp 70 degree afternoons in Austin , TX and making the trip up north will be Austin Track Club 's Duncan Phillips , who 's coming off a win at the JDL Fast Track mile ( 4:00.94 ) . <p> In terms of collegiates , Iona 's Matt Gillespie leads the way after his 3:58.48 run at the magic BU Valentine Mile last week . He 'll be joined by Air Force 's Zach Perkins ( remember him ? ) , NAU 's Nathan Weitz , Villanova 's Jordan Williamsz , Oklahoma State 's Chad Noelle , and , honestly , I could list almost anyone at this point because there 's a bunch . <p> Men 's 800m <p> Gators , Cyclones , and NJ*NY'ers . Florida 's #4 ranked Ryan Schnulle leads the field after his 1:48.05 win at the Razorback Invitational . He 'll be joined by teammate Sean Obinwa , who had an off-day at Razorback and finished ninth in 1:51.54 . Remember : this is the same 800m specialist that barely made the NCAA final last winter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duo will be joined by high school phenom Andres Arroyo . The freshman finished right behind Schnulle in Fayetteville , AR in 1:48.53 . <p> Iowa State will have some representation on their home track with Edward Kemboi .

Last winter , Murray stormed onto the national scene with a third place finish at NCAAs , which garnered him first team All-American and this awesome splash page by Loyola 's ( Ill. ) athletic department . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

In 2016 , - the CrossFit Games Open- provided such a way , with the introduction of four- unique divisions : Military , Law Enforcement , Firefighter and Emergency Medical- Technician . <p> On the law enforcement- side , Oklahoma native Casey McCallister ended- up finishing first in the United States and second worldwide ( Canadian Games- veteran Albert-Dominic Larouche- finished in first ) . What 's more , the- 27-year-old finished tenth in the North Central region to earn a trip to the Central- regional at the end of May . A five-and-a-half year- veteran with the Norman- police department in Norman , Oklahoma ( home of the University of Oklahoma ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team- as well as a defensive tactics- instructor , firearms instructor , fitness instructor and training officer . He is- also a coach at Koda CrossFit Norman . McCallister recently sat- down with- FloElite to describe what it 's like being the Fittest Cop in America . <p> How did you find- CrossFit ? When did you start and what did you like about it ? <p> I found CrossFit through one of my best- friends at work . We started doing what we thought was CrossFit in 2013 . We did- a Hero workout every day and usually- finished with some type of bro-flex- workout . I.E. curls , bench press , triceps extensions , and so on . I loved the- idea of a workout everyday in honor of someone who- had made the ultimate- sacrifice for our country . It was a daily reminder that no matter what I was- going through , it was n't as bad as what that hero and their families- were going- through and to suck it up . I would say , " this is just a workout . It's- temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be successful in the- sport of- CrossFit I would have to work with some people who actually knew what- CrossFit was . <p> Your first regionals experience was pretty unique in that it was your first CrossFit- competition and you 'd only been- CrossFitting for a few months . Can you describe- what it was like to compete on- that stage ? <p> Yes . Regionals- 2014 was my first individual competition . I honestly did n't realize what the- big deal was at the time . I had only been at my gym Koda CrossFit- Norman for- four months when the Open started that year . It was my first Open and I just- kind of thought regionals was just the " next " step in going to the Games . I- was- wrong . The first event was a one-rep max hang squat snatch . I knew I wasn't- very good at it but when we started warming up in the back and guys were- " warming up " with weight I could n't even fail correctly , I realized these guys- were in a different league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " regionals " thing- was a bigger accomplishment than I had originally given it- credit for . I was then determined to just not embarrass myself . At the end of- the weekend , I was able to- look back and realize what a great experience it was. - The support from everyone was incredible and made me determined to get back on- that stage . Little did I know- that they would cut the field by more than 50- percent a year later . Kept my head down and just focused on having fun while- getting better . <p> What did you- think when you first heard that CrossFit was creating a special Open division- for law enforcement officers ? <p> I was extremely- intrigued . I was immediately determined to win the division worldwide . I hoped- that Castro would do like he did with the teens last year , making a- LEO-specific division for the Games . <p> What made you- want to become a police officer ? <p> Two reasons. - First one sounds cheesy but the thing that made me want to become a police- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When people are in- danger- and need help they call the police . I wanted to help those people . Second , my- dad was a firefighter for 30+ years and he is my biggest hero . I wanted to be- like my dad , helping people and making the community a better place . When I was- little I remember him missing little league games and family events and always- wondered why . When I realized that he was working so that everyone else could- safely enjoy those moments with their loved ones , I knew I was meant to be in- public- safety like Dad . <p> What 's your- schedule like as a police officer ? Is it difficult to balance work and CrossFit- training ? <p> Schedule ? That- implies that there is some regularity to it . Seriously though , the schedule can- make things difficult but if you want something bad enough you 'll make- it- happen . I have an extremely strong support system around me that makes it- easier . <p> What 's it like- being a police officer in Norman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we get a little bit of everything here . We- are big enough that we have several special teams and special- assignments but- small enough where I can at least recognize all of our officers . <p> Who 's fitter ? - Police officers or firefighters ? <p> ( laughing ) - I hate to admit- it , but draggin ' hoses all day makes you fitter than eatin ' donuts all day . <p> I ca n't stand- people who ride the fence so I would say that , although both statements are- true , " being a CrossFitter helps me as a police officer " is the truer- statement. - I believe that being a CrossFitter helps me in nearly all facets of- life : physically , mentally , spiritually , emotionally , career , family , public- speaking , and many more. - However , the warrior mindset that is instilled upon me- from being a police officer definitely helps me with the mental side and pain- tolerance of being a CrossFitter. - <p> What are your- thoughts on being the fittest cop in America ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger deal it 's just a stat that people can talk about . The support that it- has generated around the department , - however , is amazing . People who I thought- were anti-CrossFit have sincerely congratulated me , which is really cool . It- has also sparked a lot of interest within our- department in officers taking the- initiative to become more fit . Not in everyone , but there have been several who- have started sipping the CrossFit Kool-aid . <p> Do you have any- specific goals for regionals ? <p> Similar to 2014 , - do n't embarrass myself and have fun . I think I will definitely appreciate this- trip more than last time as I realize that not everyone gets to throw down- side- by side with some of these studs . <p> Has your fitness- helped you on the job ? Can you think of any difficult encounters where being a- fit made a big difference ? <p> I believe your- physical appearance helps you on every encounter you go on . If you appear to be- in shape , boots shined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident- you have a stronger , what we call , " command presence . " It 's human nature to- " size up " anyone you plan to attack . So being a fit officer immediately gives- you more command presence making subjects you encounter second-guess themselves- on running , assaulting , or resisting . Specifically , I- have never lost a foot- pursuit ( knock on wood ) . Any assaultive subjects I've- encountered we have been able to take into custody quickly and without injury- to the officers . All of this is great , - but being fit does not guarantee- anything . Even the fittest cop in America ca n't stop or outrun bullets . " Train- as though your life depends on it , because it just might . " - Fitness is one of- dozens of facets in police work that officers must constantly push themselves- to be better at . However , fitness should be one of the most important- to all- officers , in my opinion . Being fit does n't make you a good cop but being unfit- makes you less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @qwx219704

A few years back , North Dakota had an athlete by the name of Laura Roesler winning state track titles in the sprints to go along with state titles in cross country . After completing a successful collegiate career and winning NCAA 800-meter titles at the University of Oregon , Roesler is now running pro and winning races on the elite level . <p> Today , South Dakota has an athlete at Ipswich High School , sophomore Macy Heinz , who has already claimed a double digit number of state titles since her 7th grade year in distances ranging from the 100-meter dash to 1600-meter run. - Just two weekends ago , Heinz won the Beresford Cross Country Invitational with the nation 's fastest time at that point for 4000-meters with a- 14:25- victory. - <p> What might the future hold in store for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the South Dakota state champ miler as well as the state champ in the 100-meter dash as part of our Future Stars series presented by Hoka One One . <p> Track has been a tradition in my family . My aunts held many track records at Ipswich before me . I also grew up watching my sister Tara Heinz and neighbor Tori Moore compete at track and cross country meets . Being in the environment really got me excited to be able to compete at a young age ! <p> What do you attribute to your ability to run such an incredibly wide range from the 100 meter dash to 4K/5K in cross country ? <p> I am so lucky to have coach Todd Thorson ! He has helped find a good balance of distance and sprint training . In track I am also apart of a 3-time state champion team in track , and 4-time state champion team in cross country . Being on such a good team allowed me to get workouts in with the sprinters and distance runners because we were dominate in both areas ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your best event and why ? <p> I consider the 800 or 1600 my best events . They take a good mix of endurance and speed . It is a perfect fit for me . <p> - <p> How are you able to get the proper training to be successful in both the 100 and 1600 during the same season ? What is a typical training week like for you during the track season ? <p> Well , you ca n't really get " proper " training for both . You have to be really cautious about the stress that sprinting can put on your body while you have distance training . I run the 400m dash in track as well , much of my speed work is done training for that along with a few other speed workouts . My typical week consists of a long run , a tempo run , and a speed workout . Usually 3 quality days a week along with mileage and rest days . Coach Thorson and I try to find the best way to balance the two that we can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , but for now , everything is working out well . <p> What was it like winning South Dakota state titles as only a 7th grader ? Is it remarkable to think back that you were able to become the best in your state as only a 7th grader ? <p> It is an honor winning state titles at a young age . I never really knew how successful I could be in track and cross country . I really did n't know much about competing then . I 'm pleased with how I 've continued to progress , and I 'm thankful for the coaching I 've had , and the encouragement from my community . <p> Credit : Kermit Grimshaw- - - <p> What was your athletic background growing up ? <p> Growing up I was very active . I participated in softball , volleyball , soccer , and basketball . I enjoy being on a team and setting goals to improve on . <p> How different or how have you improved as a runner since your 7th grade year ? <p> Since 7th grade , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger now . My weight training has improved so much since 7th grade . I have also learned so much more about competing in a race . I have learned to race so much smarter . <p> You have stayed predominantly in-state for meets . As you continue to develop over the next few years , do you plan to seek out better competition out-of-state and potentially compete in national meets ? <p> I try to find in-state meets with good competition in the Midwest . It is great getting to see out of state competition but it is hard finding close races . It would be nice racing out of state more but it can be expensive . Coach and I try to find some races and pick a few . National meets are great to see how you can match up with the rest of the country . Last year I was only a freshman so I did n't compete in any . I did n't want to get overwhelmed by the national scene . For now I am just working on training and improving more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned so much more about competing . As I continue to get older I want to see how I can compete nationally . <p> Which race or performance are you most proud of and why ? <p> I think I am most proud of running the 1600 at the University of Sioux Falls in a time of 5:04 in 2012 in 7th grade . The top 25 in the Midwest were invited to compete . I came into that race ranked 9th and ended up getting a PR by about 20 seconds . It was n't the PR that made it so memorable though , it was the fact that I had the ability to compete with some great athletes in the Midwest that I was unaware of . <p> - Credit : Kermit Grimshaw <p> While you have won quite a few state titles on the track , you have not won a state title in cross country . How big of a goal is that for you and what would that mean to- achieve it this fall ? <p> Obviously it 's a big goal for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have put a lot of work into my cross country training this year . I can only control how I race . I just want to show up , compete hard , and run my best . I definitely have my eyes on a state title this year , but the ultimate goal is to just work on personal improvement and doing better than the year before . <p> Initial glance at your early success and range draws a striking resemblance to a similar past great all-around athlete from a Heartland state in Laura Roesler , who is now a professional half miler for Nike and NCAA 800m champ at Oregon , but also was a state champion sprinter and distance runner in North Dakota in high school . How does it feel to be compared as potentially the next Laura Roesler ? Is she someone that you would consider as a role model in the sport ? <p> Laura Roesler is one of my biggest role models in the sport ! I always am watching her races on TV and online . I admire her so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the events that we run . I think it is an honor to be compared to such a remarkable athlete in the sport ! <p> What are your remaining goals for the rest of the year and what long-term goals would you like to accomplish before you graduate high school ? <p> Again , the ultimate goal is to just improve and get better . Defending our team titles in cross country and track are also goals . Individually , I want to get that state cross country title , and in track I want to defend my four titles and keep an eye on some state records . I really want to do my best to inspire others and bring good recognition to two wonderful sports . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

She is by no means a " dark horse , " either . In fact , by the end of the year , - Weissenbach- could be Stanford 's best 800m runner . <p> Think about that a minute . <p> Weissenbach possesses great race savvy and has proven throughout her career that she is fearless in any competition . Considering she was 7th at the USA National Outdoor Championships in the 800m , there is no doubt that Weissenbach is one of the top 800 meter talents in the NCAA. - <p> 5 .

Especially considering Houlihan ran this race at USA Outdoors last season and finished 7th in her heat , right behind none other than the World Indoor Champion Chanelle Price . <p> Houlihan 's racing record at big-time meets has been unreal . She was 7th in the 1500m last year , 8th in cross , and finished 3rd in the mile final at indoors this past weekend . That kind of race savvy is rare and her grit always helps her close like a train. - <p> 8 . Savannah Camacho- ( Oklahoma State ) - 2:05.41 <p> If this ranking would be done purely off of PRs , Camacho would be a total afterthought for the top 8 and maybe he even top 25 . Good thing Camacho ran an incredible 800m race at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd and proved the country that she is one to watch . <p> Honestly , if I did n't put Camacho on this list , that would be a total travesty to someone who totally deserves a spot in the outdoor final this spring .

For the best in the world , this is a brutal workout because they 're asked to do this as quickly as possible . For the rest of us , this is a brutal workout because you either kill yourself to make the next time gate and pay the price when you get there or you kill yourself to make the next round and watch it slip away from you with only a few reps left . <h> 5. 14.4 <h> Notable scores : <p> Rich Froning - 277Ben Smith - 265Sam Briggs - 256Kara Webb - 236 <p> This is a workout designed to end with the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stingy calories .

The log is made from wood , so the weight varies year to year , but typically is around 440-460+lbs. - Last year seemed to be a heavy year , as Zydrunas Savickas was the only athlete able to lockout the Oak overhead . Of course , he did it for 4 reps to rub it in everyone else 's face . For those that can not press the Austrian Oak , they get a chance at the feather log which weighs in at a " light " 375 or so pounds . 1 rep with the Austrian Oak beats any number of reps with the feather log , so a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be fatigued following the max deadlift . If the Oak is above their ability , it may be smart to skip attempting the Oak , and reserve their energy for the Feather . Of course , this is the 10 strongest men in the world , and in a group such as this strategy tends to take the back seat to a challenge . <p> Zydrunas Savickas is the clear favorite , as he always is involving anything overhead . He has only been beaten once on this event , and that was in 2012 by the late Mike Jenkins . It is not often that an athlete almost has a guaranteed 1st place in an event , but Big Z log pressing is as close as you will get to a sure thing in Strongman . <p> Eddie Hall , well known for his incredible static strength , will be coming off what I assume will be a big deadlift in the prior event , which could affect his performance in the log press . Much to the surprise of the crowd last year , Hall failed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of this log makes it much more challenging than equal weight of a steel gym log . Hall has a very good shot at being one of the few to hoist the oak above their head , but if he fails on the lift , he will drop a lot of points as his long setup on the clean hurts him when going for multiple reps , which- he will need if reduced to the feather log . <p> Hafthor Bjornssom 's log pressing seems to be going well in training with gym lifts of 200kg/440lbs. - Will that work carry over to being able to press the Oak ? <p> A rep on the Oak would be huge for The Mountain , but if not he- will certainly improve on his 4 reps with the feather from last year . <p> There must be something in the water in Lithuania as Lalas was able to press the Oak successfully in 2014 the question remains on how healthy he is from his back injury which forced him to sit out last year . <p> Jerry Pritchett 's pressing strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oak is still a bit far off . Expect Pritchett to put up 5-6 reps on the feather log . <p> Dimitar Savatinov is one of the best overhead pressers in the world . Dimitar 's training looks much better this year as last year he did not get an invite until a few weeks out . With a whole year to prepare it would be shocking if Dimitar did not get a rep or two on the Austrian Oak , Dimitar has been smart in his training by making sure to train on a wooden log . Never to tip his hand Dimitar posted this 415lb " warm up " before moving on to working sets with 440-445lbs according to his Instagram : <p> Mateusz Kieliszkowksi , the 21-year-old Polish Strongman , shocked the world last year taking third overall . The very explosive athlete is probably not up to the challenge of the Austrian Oak yet but I expect him to have the most reps of anyone on the feather log which should still give him good points in the event . <p> Want more strongman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Strongest Man : 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

" - <p> While Magnolia has since become a tourist attraction for pro athletes and running fanatics alike , Coach Wetmore continues to employ it as a cornerstone in his famous method . Claiming that there is " no more important workout , " the Sunday long run in Boulder gives the Buffs a step up on the competition . <p> Domestic RecruitingWhile it must be tempting to snatch up the latest international talent , Wetmore has kept his recruiting domestic during his tenure in Colorado . While other elite programs have loaded up on the best that the UK , Australia , and East Africa has to offer , he has focused on the top talent in Colorado first , and then built out his roster from the rest of the country . " It 's just more gratifying to put a team on the starting line that we felt we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wetmore told Flotrack in 2010 . <p> Staying within the region to find athletes has accomplished two things for Wetmore . For one , his stake within the state of Colorado has set up a monopoly on the very best from the Centennial State . The elite preps in Colorado want to run for Wetmore because his plan has remained consistent and he has continually churned out Olympians throughout the years . " We start first with Colorado talent . We say ' who do we think is PAC-12 material ? ' And then of course we look around the country . " <p> Secondly , this homegrown method has allowed former athletes to stay close to the program . Recruits see that athletes like Jenny Simpson , Emma Coburn and the Gouchers have remained loyal to the Buffs , and they know that their relationship with Wetmore will extend past their four years in Boulder. - <p> Removing The EgoSome coaches feel obligated to give pre-race speeches to motivate their athletes before they get to the line . Not Wetmore. - <p> Wetmore 's ability to keep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of the ' factor . ' It takes a special kind of coach to realize that his work is done by November . Wetmore in an interview with tips4running , " I 've never been able to think of any speech that is motivating enough , so I just try to get them to the line on time . " - <p> Wetmore trains the Buffs all season to be prepared for conference and the NCAA meet . His philosophical methods are instilled all year round , and his athletes know what they have to do on race day without him having to tell them . This takes the pressure off of the athlete because they are not expected to do anything heroic after the gun goes off. - <p> The MythNo matter that a book has been released detailing his coaching and personality , there remains a mythical element surrounding the aura of Wetmore. - <p> Part of the man 's legend can be attributed to the success attained by Colorado athletes while their pony-tailed coach remains in the background , far from the spotlight . Emotionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can come off incorrectly as him being distant or indifferent . It 's quite the opposite . Wetmore cares immensely about the process and the development of good character in his athletes . " The best part is seeing the athletes take their character out of a scary place and managing it well , learning courage . That happens more in training and lifestyle than in racing , " Wetmore told tips4running . Wetmore continues to build national championship caliber teams year after year , but his primary purpose remains molding strong individuals post-Colorado . Wetmore does so by maintaining a calm demeanor and valuing consistency in training and life . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

What does he or she say ? - " Okay , this is it . Today its time to create your championship moment and make your dreams come true . Go show everyone why you have been working hard for the last six months and dominate this race . " We think that as athletes we should be most fired up for when it matters most . We may even think that if we are not this pumped up that there is something wrong with us . So many athletes try to get as psyched as possible before the biggest of races . Soetimes when this happens we perform better than we have all season . Other times , we blow up . While understanding a good or bad performance in distance running ( or any other discipline ) can be difficult , performance may be moderated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " pumped up " . <p> There is in fact an optimal amount of activation required for peak performance in sport , and this level is explained by the Inverted-U theory . Performance is best at a moderate level of arousal , but will worsen if arousal is too high or too low ( Martens &amp; Landers , 1970 ) . But the amount of arousal or activation that is too high or too low for each individual varies . Research has suggested that activation needs to be at a moderate level for each individual for the best performances to occur. - The pattern was confirmed in a study with basketball players , where the best performances were associated with moderate levels of state anxiety , but worse performances were related to elevated state anxiety ( Sonstroem &amp; Bernardo , 1982 ) . <p> The key , therefore , is to learn how to read activation levels and understand how to change activation or arousal in order to reach the optimal individual level . High activation or arousal is what we think of as being " fired up " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a feeling of readiness to act . In order to reach a high level of activation athletes may use self-talk or can imagine great performances and success . Individuals can also use fast and intense music or an especially aggressive warmup to reach this state ( Lauer , 2010 ) . A loud and intense pep-talk would also probably do the trick . High activation states may be ideal for middle-distance races where it is important to be running hard from the gun and to react quickly to moves in the race . It will also be very easy to reach this state at events with a great deal of pressure or many fans , such as a national cross country meet or a large track invitational . <p> Low activation , however , is characterized by a feeling of relaxation and calmness . In order to lower activation and reach this state , individuals may listen to calming music and practice deep breathing . Some may also read a book or talk to friends about matters unrelated to competition . Athletes may also use a more gentle warmup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Many others also lay down before warming up for a race and imagine a calming place , such as a beach , in order to lower arousal or stay relaxed ( Lauer , 2010 ) . Reaching a state of lower activation may be more important in the distance races , such as a 10k or marathon , where relaxation through the first half of the race is important and sudden moves early in the race are rare . Individuals are likely to feel relaxed in smaller early season meets or practice and can reach this state easily , whereas it may be more difficult to maintain low levels of activation before a very big or important race . Finally , a coach 's instructions can also impact arousal level . An intense speech will certainly elevate activation level , but a few relaxed words or minor instructions said in a calm voice will likely lower activation or arousal. - <p> The best way to determine your optimal level of activation is to pay attention to how your level of arousal before action impacts the subsequent performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include feeling jittery at the start line , going out too fast , or feeling drained and devoid of energy relatively early in the race . But if you struggle to really " get into the race " or do not feel very fired up or competitive during the race , your activation level may have been too low before the performance . If your activation level before performance is not ideal , use some of the above strategies to change it and your performance may improve for the better. - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Below is her advice on the 1500m . If you enjoyed this post ( because we did ) , be sure to check her blog and follow her on Twitter for more words of wisdom . <p> The 1500m has been called " the best event in Track and Field " ( by me ) . Mostly because it 's an exciting combination of speed , endurance and smarts ( and I am also a little bit biased ) . - <p> Do you want to set a PR in the 1500 ? Well , me too . But unfortunately , if this is not your first 1500 , you probably are going to have to learn a few things before you get that PR . Usually you learn by making mistakes . This is known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why learn your lesson the hard way when you can simply read this blog and learn from my mistakes ? ! <p> Years and years of mistakes have taught me these key lessons : - <p> 1 ) It 's not about how you start , it 's about how you finish ( but in the 1500 , it really IS about how you start ) Get off that line and establish a good position early ! A common mistake here is to cut straight into lane 1 , instead of taking the tangent to the curve . ( For those who did n't have a math teacher for a dad growing up , " taking the tangent " is fancy runner lingo for taking the most direct route to that number 1 at the 200m mark. ) - <p> 2 ) You have elbowsuse them ! The inside of lane 1 is appealing , being the shortest distance to the finish and all . And who wants to run the 1510m-1517m while everyone else is running the 1500m. - But in lane 1 you also run the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a person equally as slow beside you ( for purposes of this blog we will assume all hypothetical competitors are slower than you , and thus , in your way ) . Ideally , you want to be as close to the inside of lane 1 as possible while maintaining the ability to pass . This usually means being a little bit towards the outside of lane 1 and sometime the inside of lane 2 so you can keep that position right behind the leaders . Elbows help you keep that perfect position . - <p> 3 ) Do n't use up your " mushrooms " too quickly ! Imagine that you are in Mario Kart and you have mushrooms that give you a temporary burst of speed- but you only have a few to use . Save some for your last 100m when you REALLY need it . Making a whole bunch of quick , short , aggressive moves will come back to bite you ( probably literally in the butt when you get booty lock ) . When you need to move up or pass just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve . - <p> 4 ) Indian running is not an effective way to PR ! Imagine that you are running in a line and the leader starts to sprint , then the next person and the next person . When it finally comes your chance to react to the person in front of you the leader already got a couple seconds headstart ! Pay attention to the lead pack and respond to them . Stay engaged . <p> 5 ) Be smarter than everyone else ! When the big - " 1 " on the lap counter comes into sight with 500m to go , everyone is vying for position going into the last 400m ( this is especially true in slow and tactical races ) . But since you are smart from reading this blog , you know this is going to happen . You can anticipate it on the backstretch when you hit 600m to go and make a gradual move up towards the leaders then ! <p> 6 ) It 's not about how you start , it 's about how you finish ( oh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah , the final lap . The finish is so close that you can taste it ! But do n't react too quickly , otherwise you might run out of gas in that last 150m . Maybe you know what this feels like ? Hitting a cement wall . If the pace has been slow , you might be able to get away with starting to press the pace around 400m , but generally winding up around 300m-200m is safe . Learn what works for you . Use the final turn to slingshot out around other competitors and wait for the final 50-60 meters to kick it into an 100% all out sprint ( using your golden Mario mushroom ) . - 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

You 're freshmen and your priorities should be limited to staying healthy and not royally screwing up . <p> But sometimes , you 're not just wide-eyed high school blue chippers . Sometimes , you 're the past , present , and possibly the future all wrapped up in one . <p> The point is n't to to tell you that the quartet of Edward Cheserek ( Oregon ) , Sean McGorty ( Stanford ) , Ben Saarel ( Colorado ) , and Jake Leingang ( Oregon ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The point is that after watching the men 's finish at Pre-Nationals , I felt like I 'd seen it before .

At the 2008 NCAA XC Championship , - Derrick took 7th and lead Stanford to a third place finish , Puskedra was Oregon 's number two on that year 's winning squad , Lowe was Oklahoma State 's third man in 80th , and according to his bio on okstate.com , Fernandez " was in position for a top-three finish at the NCAA Championships with only about 1,500 meters remaining before he crumpled to the ground with an injury to his lower leg that forced him to not finish the race . " - <p> But when we looked back to that group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eerily similar to last weekend . Probably because we just watched them again , literally . <p> The four that we saw run at Pre-Nationals last weekend are on pace to equal the efforts of the fabled class of 2008 . Here 's a side by side comparison of the two groups of four and why we 're in store for something special . <p> The Favorite - Edward Cheserek and German Fernandez <p> Both were touted as the number one cross country recruit coming out of high school and were strong favorites to be up near the front at NCAAs throughout their freshmen season . Though Fernandez ran in the open race and Cheserk was Oregon 's top man in the main show , they ran near identical times at Pre-Nats . <p> Though Cheserek is on the same path , hopefully his fate at NCAAs is a little different from that of Fernandez . <p> The Cardinal - Sean McGorty and Chris Derrick <p> Perhaps overshadowed by some " bigger " names , both Stanford men had a big showing at Pre-Nats and also ran near identical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford , there was something comparable about Derrick and McGorty when they made the jump from high school to the NCAA . <p> Though they were both atop their class ' ranking , they did n't have a certain " je ne sais quoi " to vault them to the number one spot . Call it an " X-Factor , " but despite two incredible resumes , neither were regarded as the undisputed number one recruit . <p> Here 's a little background on the two . Derrick was more distance orientated ( 13:55 for 5k at Arcadia ) , ran 8:48 for 3200m , and took the individual title at NXN ( his team won , too ) . <p> McGorty was more of a miler ( 4:04.47 for the mile at Penn Relays ) , ran 8:46.07 for two miles , and finished second behind Cheserek at Foot Locker ( he also finished behind him at Pre-Nats , too ) . <p> Despite strong credentials , the two did n't have the same pop coming off their senior year as the others . Maybe that 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's running career path , which would n't be a bad choice of where to be in five years . <p> The Quiet Utahn - Ben Saarel and Luke Puskedra <p> Two guys that doing their talking with their legs . While they were n't / are n't the favorite for FloFrosh of the Year , they both had / have the potential to be the top freshman at NCAAs . At Oregon , Puskedra would run with near reckless abandon while Saarel is one of the toughest competitors we 've seen in , well , five years . <p> We think that like Puskedra , Saarel will thrive in longer races . When he made the move up to the half marathon , the former Oregon Duck seemed to finally find his niche . Saarel has shown excellent wheels at shorter distances with a 1:51.13 win at the UT State 800m ( at altitude ) and a convincing win at the adidas Dream Mile , but we share Saarel 's own opinion that he 'll be a " five , ten thousand meter guy in the future . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solid incredible talents , but both were a step behind the rest of the class . Like Lowe , I would put a lot of faith in Leingang to come up big when it counts , but not necessarily at the front of the pack . Him and Lowe are both guys that their coaches could rely on to run smart when it counted . <p> Prior to drawing this big conclusion , we 've talked about how we think Leingang will have a Lowe-esque progression where he becomes a bastion of stability for his team in the years to come . <p> This parallel universe of freshmen classes does n't just end with individual results . There are similar team implications as well . <p> In 2008 , Oklahoma State had their two freshmen ( Fernandez and Lowe ) in their top five . In 2013 , Oregon is calling for their duo to be in nearly the same positions . <p> But the overarching and arguably the most important comparison is that all eight freshmen had a chance to guide their team to a podium finish at NCAAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough as there was an overwhelming preseason favorite for the team title that remained in the top spot throughout the fall . In 2008 , it was Oregon . In 2013 , it 's Oklahoma State . Oddly enough , that 's the reverse from the above . Silly coincidences . <p> Still , a podium finish requires a level-head and perfect race execution at NCAAs . Considering that these teams that are going to lean on freshmen to do both of things , I 'd be a tad nervous . I 've never trusted freshmen . Never have , never will . <p> But these four ( or eight ) are n't just your run-of-the-mill " I carry my room key on a lanyard " freshmen . They 're a cut above the rest and they 're in the running to overtake the quartet from 2008 . The next three meets - Conferences , Regionals , and potentially NCAAs - will be where these four can complete these comparisons or maybe , surpass them . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

There are plenty of people doing big things at the ripe old age of 32 ! Beyonce is running the world . That song by Pitbull is everywhere . Justin Timberlake just released his third album and he 's pretty much won over everyone in the world since stuff like this and that . <p> This year also had a " third " for Wilson . If you do n't want to watch the full press conference video from Lausanne , we have this excerpt for you ( below ) : <p> - <p> " This is not a surprise for me .

He rose to prominence around the middle ( in 2007 when he ran his personal best of 13.02 ) , sort of fell off the radar ( comparatively ) , and then stormed back onto the scene this season in dramatic fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , which includes four 60mH indoors . <p> How did it all start ? We first really saw glimpses of his breakthrough at Mt . SAC , where he took the win over some strong competition in 13.23 ( note the sweet jersey ) . <p> The highlights between Mt . SAC and the U.S. Championships include a second place at the Shanghai Diamond League Meeting ( 13.25 ) and fourth place at the Prefontaine Classic ( 13.18 ) . <p> But the race that really started his breakthrough season was the U.S. Championship final , where Wilson took down the #1 ( Aries Merritt - 12.80 ) , #2 ( David Oliver - 12.89 ) , and #9 ( Jason Richardson - 12.98 ) all-time 110mH Americans to win the national title . <p> Though it was n't a surprise for Wilson , it was still a big deal . Why ? Because the U.S. is absolutely stacked in the men 's hurdles and to beat out some of the all-time greats ( who are also much younger than him ) and the world record holder is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did we mention he was unsponsored at the time ? <p> Here 's a little backstory . Wilson was sponsored by Saucony in 2012 , but was dropped in 2013 . He ran unattached for the majority of the season , as he did in 2010 when Ryan Fenton interviewed " the fastest unsponsored athlete in the world " after the Monaco Diamond League Meeting . We do n't mean to jump to the conclusion , but spoiler alert - he 's now sporting a Mizuno kit . Back to his 2013 season . <p> Riding high from USAs , Wilson had big aspirations for his first World Championships final . Although he took some knocks in Lausanne ( he placed third ) , Paris ( sixth ) , and London ( fourth ) , everything was building towards another big championship performance . After a strong semifinal in Moscow , Wilson made it clear - the goal for the year had been a world title . <p> Once again stepping into the blocks with those three Americans and plus five other world-class hurdlers , Wilson came up big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lane nine ( LANE NINE ? ! ) , Wilson swopped in to take the silver medal . <p> He wo n't admit it , but 2013 was a dream season for Wilson . He 'd reemerged not just as someone on the world rankings , but as someone who was clutch on the biggest stage . Age and form from past seasons aside , Wilson showed the world that he never left . He just needed to put all the pieces together in a World Championship year . <p> And we 'll reiterate that to even be a member of Team USA in the men 's 110mH , where there was almost a sweep at the World Championships for goodness sake , is pretty hard . Wilson 's silver medal was well-earned not just through one strong race or even one successful season , but was earned from a decade 's worth of preparation . <p> He had been close to the top in past seasons , but this was the big one - this was Ryan Wilson 's breakthrough . <p> - <p> Editor 's Note : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Wilson 's 33rd birthday just a little over a week ago .

He 's worked with high school athletes since 2006 to try and develop their full potiental by combining sprint experience with his therapeutical background . Marc was the athletic therapist for Team Quebec at the Canadian Youth Championship and strongly believes that the future of sport comes from the proper development of youth athletes . He lives in Montreal suburb with his 3-year-old son who will do track very soon and his girlfriend who does n't understand sports ! <p> Click here to learn more about Marc and his clinic , **25;518;TOOLONG common injuries in high school track athletes <p> Even though it would be pretentious to say that all injuries can be prevented , it is easier to do in track than in a sport such as football because the environment is much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being tackled is much less ! Nevertheless , we know that a faulty movement pattern will eventually create micro-trauma that will lead to pain , cessation of the activity , long rehab process , anger , sadness , and no personal bests ( to say the least ) . As a coach , a major problem is the limited knowledge when it comes to injuries and that 's all right - it 's not your job . But here are some tips to keep your athletes on track ! <p> Screen your athletes <p> They are many tests out there that claim to prevent injuries . One of the most common and by far my favorite is the Functional Movement Screen ( FMS ) by Gray Cook . This test is very easy to conduct ( approx.7-10 minutes ) , can be done with large teams ( eg : football teams ) , and almost anyone with knowledge in sports or exercises can learn how to do it . Go get your certification and start screening NOW ! Otherwise , ask an athletic trainer or physical therapist to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give you recommendations . <p> Another quick and easy test is the Knee Tuck Jump Assessment . This test consists of repetitive knee tuck jumps in 10 seconds where the examiner watches different dysfunctions . More information on this test can be found here . <p> Old testing session like hamstrings flexibility , maximum push-ups , maximum sit-ups and grip strength are pretty useless when it comes to injuries prevention in track . Running is a movement pattern and we need to it is n't functional , correct it ; if it is , reinforce it . <p> How many of your athletes have shin splints or knee pain during a season ? How many have tried orthoses and stretching to no avail ? The problem might not be so superficial . <p> Have you checked their core stability ? Have you asked a specialist to check if their pelvis was properly aligned ? What if the answer was that simple ? What if months and years of pain could be resolved just by looking at a chain instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knee pain almost never comes from the knee . If you do n't have the knowledge to check all of these things , hire someone to do it . It 's a very good investment to see your athletes running instead of doing correctives exercises the week before the nationals ! <p> Flexibility and Stretching <p> This is a very delicate subject and some people do n't like to hear about it . Here is my opinion based on recent research : static stretching ( holding a position for an amount of time ) before a power exercise , such as sprinting , may reduce power . That 's why it is suggested to do dynamic stretching ( moving through a range of motion ) . <p> Having said that , some people NEED to do static stretching before training . Someone recovering from an injury with some muscle tension will benefit from fascial releases and stretching before his or her activity . <p> Here 's an example of a protocol : Foam roller on the tight muscles for 20-30 little oscillations on the tight point ( you know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , then stretch that muscle for 30 seconds , and then progress to your drills such as A skips and butt-kicks . This sequence gives the muscle a new range of motion and then allows it to use it for the training . <p> Convenient is n't it ? <p> Build a Foundation to Work On <p> That 's a concept that many coaches already know and use , but what about applying it to prevent injuries ? At the beginning of the season , sprinters do more volume to build up their endurance . What about adding an important part of the training on stretching and preventive exercises to make sure everybody is on the same page ? You can even do a " yoga-like " routine at the end of training that stretches all the patterns and muscles . Also , get a few foam rollers or sticks that athletes can use before and after . <p> For strengthening , your screening at the beginning of the season will show you the main issues with your athletes . You can either do a general corrective exercise program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your athletes do an individualized program made in relation to their own weaknesses . You can also ask the athlete to do their corrective exercises as part of the warm-up . <p> For shoes , I suggest wearing minimalist/barefoot shoes for track and for gym trainings . All athletes compete with spikes which are minimalist shoes . You have to make sure your athletes are ready to withstand those forces and more importantly , that their running gait is the same during training as while competing . That will increase your bone density and reduce the chance of stress fracture . If your athletes have been running for a few years in big shoes , make sure to do a slow transition to minimalism . <p> Posture <p> A tall and relaxed posture is essential in track . Telling your athletes to stay tall and relaxed is probably not enough . Give them automatic feedback . Teach them how to do a deadlift while holding a hockey stick on their back . The stick should be in contact with the back of your head , mid-spine ( between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they should always keep those three points of contact . <p> Jumping rope is also a good exercise to keep a tall posture . You can not be efficient if you slouch. - Plus it 's a good plyometric exercise and can also work on your anaerobic and aerobic endurance . Vary your position : try on 1 leg , 1 leg in front 1 in the back , etc . <p> Good posture should be maintained also during resistance training . Avoid machines as much as you can and focus on dumbbells , pulley systems , body weight training etc . Machines will make your stabilizer muscles lazy . Using free weights properly will allow you to train your stabilizers , so you wo n't need to rely on a machine for positional feedback . <p> Medical Questionnaire <p> Probably one of the easiest parts yet much forgotten ! Having your athletes complete a medical questionnaire at the beginning of the season can save you from emergency situations . For example , on a trip for a meet one of your girls begins having difficulty breathing , her tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you she was allergic to peanuts and someone had a peanut butter sandwich right next to her . There are so many medical conditions that we are not aware of and your athletes might have one of them . It takes about 5 minutes to complete a questionnaire and can save a life . If the questionnaire comes back clear , then there is nothing to worry about and no harm 's done . If there 's a positive answer then you ask your athletes to get it checked by a physician to clear them for play . <p> What to do when injuries happen <p> Here are some quick tips before we go . Anytime you have an acute injury , do n't even ask yourself , " hot or cold ? " It 's always cold ! Ice helps to decrease metabolism and pain , both of which your athlete will benefit from . <p> Supportive tapings . Even though these are seen less than in football , some people tend to like taping as a preventive tool . Unfortunately it 's not . Having your ankle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce your proprioception , and make you more prone for injuries . Taping should only be used in the return to play phase after an injury and for a brief period of time . This is even more important when working with kids and adolescents who are still growing . The last thing you want to do is create an asymmetry . <p> Finding a good therapist for your team might be hard when you do n't know what to expect . Have someone with good manual skills , that is knowledgeable about track and field , up to date , is good with exercises prescription ( thus original ) , and cares about your athletes . Some therapists schedule 60 minutes appointments but in fact only spend 15-20 minutes actually treating your athletes . The rest of the time the athletes are plugged to a machine . Unless your therapist is alone for 500 athletes , they should take the time to treat , talk to , consider and educate your athletes . <p> If your athlete is injured , should he/she runs even if it 's painful ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my university professors used to say " No brain , no gain " . Pain is a signal sent to your brain saying something is wrong down there . So the answer is no . If your athlete only has mild pain after training , it might be the beginning of a chronic injury . Give him some time to recover and get it fixed , and if it 's the early stage of an injury , it should n't take long to heal . If the athlete always has pain then it 's more serious . It might take more time to treat , but if you do n't allow the body to recover , it will get worse and instead of having 2-3 weeks of rest it will probably be a few months . <p> Invest time and money in prevention , it will be worth it . Do n't do any drastic changes . Start incorporating some preventive exercise such as a mobility routine progressively . Athletes like their routine , do n't rush them . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Colorado head coach Mark Wetmore was the man behind all of those accomplishments on the collegiate and professional stage and is the Flotrack Coach of the Year . <p> THE SILVER MEDAL <p> After failing to make the 1,500-meter final at the 2012 Summer Olympic games in London , 2011 World Champion Jenny Simpson returned to Boulder to continue her training under the watchful eyes of Wetmore . In her days as a Buffalo , she was an NCAA champion in the steeplechase and made two international teams. - <p> " Part of the reason I left Juli ( Benson ) is because I do n't think the method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's because she 's less of a coach , " Simpson told The Denver Post of the move . " I think it 's because she 's a different type of coach . Mark just has a method that is perfect for my talent set . " <p> The move paid off and Simpson ran the 5th fastest 1,500-meter time in the world for 2013 as she won the Monaco Diamond League meeting in 4:00.48 , which is three seconds faster than any time she ran with Benson . The win in Monaco was the perfect tune-up en route to her silver medal in Moscow . <p> THE NCAA STEEPLECHASE TITLE- <p> Simpson was not alone in Moscow from coach Wetmore 's training group as Shalaya Kipp also managed to make Team USA and finished ninth in the heats of the women 's steeplechase . Emma Coburn was a lock to make the United States national team after winning the NCAA Championship title with ease , but could not compete at the U.S. Championships due to a back injury . Coburn 's 9:23.54 from the Olympics in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 2008 Olympics , which dropped ten seconds in 2009 . A healthy year for Coburn could get her close to Simpson 's 9:12.50 . Wetmore was behind one American record , he could have another one in 2014 . <p> Note : Coburn 's 9:28.26 from Payton Jordan was the fastest time by an American in 2013 and 13th in the world. - <p> THE RETURN <p> Coburn , Kipp and Simpson have all provided Wetmore success in middle distance . 2014 will bring on a familiar face with new goals . Almost a year to the date of Simpson 's return , Kara Goucher announced she will head back to Boulder to be coached by Wetmore. - <p> " I feel almost giddy with excitement when I think about training with Mark and Heather . I have a lot of big goals left and I feel like they are the ones to help me achieve them , " Goucher blogged about the move . " Although I am saddened to leave a place I love , I know the right decision is to move back to Boulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best American marathoners .

" And now I do doubles every day . We 've both changed so much , " Goucher told Runners World. - " You never could have imagined back then that I would end up being a marathoner because I broke down a lot , I was a little bit wussy at times . " <p> Wetmore will be keeping her mileage at 80 miles per week before getting back into more workouts . A fall marathon may be in the plans for 2014 after a foot injury sidelined her from running the ING New York City Marathon in November. - <p> The ultimate goal Goucher proposed to Wetmore is still three years away : Make the 2016 Olympic team. - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the giants that many were talking about heading into the National Cross-Country Championship in Terre Haute , yet Wetmore kept his team in the mix for the title. - <p> A staple of Wetmore 's coaching philosophy has been the lack of recruiting from outside of the United States . He chooses to develop talent from within the United States . <p> 2013 Dream Mile champion Ben Saarel was one of the biggest additions to the Buffaloes this year. - <p> He would be right as Colorado won the Pac-12 Conference Championship , punched their ticket to the Big Dance and then walked away with the championship title . They peaked at the right time. - <p> The Buffalos also did this all without running Jake Hurysz at the National Championship. - <p> Wetmore 's recent success has him in the conversation with Dave Smith and John McDonnell as some of the best coaches in recent NCAA Division I history .

Last week , Air Academy High School 's Andy Boyle sent us a Nostradamus-esque message .

The first are the " lone rangers , " who are a team 's real deal front runner . The second category consists of " dynamic duos , " who are two very good athletes that work off each other and make a nice 1-2 punch . <p> Emma Bates ( Boise State ) She has some serious motivation to roll this weekend after being surprised at the last minute of Dellinger and beaten by high schooler Alexa Efraimson . Bates is super talented and has some nice track PRs as well . <p> Although she has never made the NCAA Championships , that will be no problem for the Bronco . Bates is one of the toughest competitors in the NCAA and will prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The " Diego Estrada " of the women 's side of NCAA Cross Country is Laura Hollander of Cal Poly . Similar to Estrada , Hollander loves to take things out from the gun and makes others beat her . As was the case at Wisconsin last season where she blew everyone away by taking the pace out hard and early , eventually no one could catch up to her . Since her 9th place finish at NCAAs in 2012 , she has run a few decent track races and only one race this fall ( on August 31st where she won by nearly 50 seconds ) . Will she be back in 2013 to punish the fields like she did last year ? We will find out on Saturday . <p> Cally Macumber ( Kentucky ) Macumber started her season off right by getting an individual win over a pretty good field at the Cowboy Jamboree in Stillwater , Oklahoma--seemingly going right on with the script from 2012 . Macumber was money last year in cross winning the Southeast Regional ( beating Juliet Bottorff of Duke by four seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second best girl coming back from NCAAs last year , Macumber now has a target on her back . A loss to Ann Eason at Greater Louisville a couple weeks ago can be avenged this weekend as she will rub shoulders with Eason once more . An interesting stat is that Macumber also finished second last year at Greater Louisville , losing to Elvin Kibet of Arizona . If she can pull off the same finish to her season as she did last year , Macumber will be right in the thick of things at Pre-Nats in Terre Haute . <p> Darkhorse Individual - Ann Eason ( EKU ) Flying onto the scene at a high level this season is Ann Eason of Eastern Kentucky . With solid track PRs of 9:24 and 16:06 , she does not at first stand out as someone that is going to be good enough to win the individual title at a meet of this size , but do not sleep on Eason . <p> After a pretty good performance at Panorama Farms in her first race of the year , Eason finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field ) and Strehler of Virginia . She proved her legitimacy by beating All-Everything imaginable Cally Macumber of Kentucky at the Greater Louisville Classic a few weeks ago . <p> Maybe it was being able to run in her home state and in front of the home crowd that enabled her to run so well , but either way , beating Macumber head-to-head automatically gives you the chops to be able to compete with the who 's who in the NCAA . <p> The Dynamic Duos <p> Colleen Quigley and Hannah Walker ( Florida State ) The funniest dynamic duo goes to Quigley and Walker of FSU--mostly over height . Quigley is quite tall and Hannah Walker is barely 5 ' 0 ( that would be a basketball roster 5 ' 0 " ) . Regardless of their difference in size , they make up a nasty 1-2 punch that lead the Seminoles into war . <p> Aisling Cuffe and Jessica Tonn ( Stanford ) The Foot Locker Champion of yesteryear Aisling Cuffe is now being relied upon as a leader and front runner for the Stanford Cardinal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculously good front two . With similar 3k PRs and also comparable ability on the XC course , with these girls up front , Stanford will always be in the mix . <p> Elaina Balouris and Emily Stites ( William and Mary ) Maybe the unsung heroes of the mid-major schools in NCAA XC , Balouris and Stites are absolute studs on the cross country course and should be the fear of every big time university in the country . Balouris and Stites , having finished 13th and 26th at NCAAs in 2012 , respectively , are the best 1-2 punch in the field just from purely looking at results from last year . Stites a sub-16 5k girl and Balouris a pure distance runner ; William and Mary , much like Stanford , are a contender ( on some level ) at Pre-Nats this weekend solely because of the nasty low-sticks they have in this pair . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Flotrack was there to capture it all . Though the Oregon Project was focused on using the thin alpine air to stress and build their aerobic capacity , as always , coach Alberto Salazar 's group was training much more . <p> The pictures below shows that- the group also maintained an intense strength training regimen. - Strength training has become a- more and more important focus of elite distance running . Because of its ability to boost performance , Salazar 's group is setting time aside for running specific strength training - often lifting heavy weights with limited repititons - to perfect their form . <p> Human Racecars <p> To understand why strength training betters running form it is helpful to think of running form as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Formula 1 racecars hold themselves together by being built of lightweight and super-strong carbon fiber frames that hold form even at maximum speeds around 215 mph and forces five times- the weight of gravity . <p> By rigidly holding their form , F1 racecars efficiently move energy from their engine through wheels into forward motion . Without such strength , F1 racecars would lose power and speed to flex in their frames and wobble in their misaligned wheels . A strong chassis is key to F1 racecar 's performance . <p> Similar to a racecar 's chassis , good running form also translates power into efficient forward motion . Running with good biomechanics transfer- most of your effort into forward motion . Running with a wobbly axle ( see hips ) or sagging frame ( see core ) wastes forward motion and- energy is lost in excess body movement . Having the strength to maintain good form makes a huge difference in forward momentum . <p> Several energy systems , not mutually exclusive <p> For the most of a distance race , the aerobic system 's low-power / long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it came to strength , distance runners have taken a light approach -- training with sit-ups and other high repetition conditioning exercises . However , runners are discovering moments , especially at the end of the race , when the pace accelerates or when their aerobic abilities fatigue . They- need energy delivered in a powerful snap . The Body 's Energy Systems <p> Aerobic System Aerobic power , the kind that propels distance runners through most of their race , is a low power / long endurance sort of energy system . It is fueled by a combination of oxygen and sugar / fat ( glycogen or lipids ) . The aerobic system can take you far , - but not fast . <p> Anaerobic System The body 's energy system which generates energy without oxygen has two parts : the Anaerobic Glycolytic system and the ATP-PC system . <p> ATP-PC system Delivers explosive , short term power . Think powerlifting , or sprinting for around 8-10 seconds . <p> Energy Systems <p> Maximum Power Duration <p> Where it works ( examples ) <p> ATP-PC <p> 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glycolytic <p> 10 seconds - 2 minutes <p> Sit-ups , 800m <p> Aerobic <p> 2 minutes and beyond <p> 5k , 10k , and beyond <p> The strength to hold it all together : ATP-PC system <p> The ATP-PC system is primarily trained by lifting heavy weights . It's- the perfect backup for when the body 's other energy systems just wo n't cut it . When a runner must suddenly accelerate or needs an additional strength boost to hold their running form together , the ATP-PC system delivers the power needed . <p> With the Nike Oregon Project , it is typical to see Mo Farah or Galen Rupp working their ATP-PC systems by doing Olympic lifts . Olympic lifting is fundamentally the practice of standing up straight- against the weight of a heavy barbell . For runners , - Olympic lifting trains the body to maintain upright form against the fatigue and forces of racing . When your aerobic capacity and strength endurance ( Anaerobic Glycolytic system ) can no longer hold your form , the strength developed from high weight / low repetition activities like Olympic lifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Workout Video <p> What 's more , coach- Salazar has tailored the exercises specific to running by modifying the Olympic Lifts to mimic running form . This gives the athletes the added benefit of specificity . He explains , " This is as important as anything we do in our training . It is n't just , ' Well let 's just go hit the weight room and do a few exercises . ' This is a very sort of synchronized and specific training program that they are on . " <p> Rupp performs a modified squat , which is designed to mimic and strengthen good running form . <p> A lost art <p> While strength training is fashionable lately , Salazar 's Nike Oregon Project certainty is n't the first to pioneer the concept . <p> Nearly three decades before Salazar , Peter Coe , the- coach and father of famed Sebastian Coe , used strength training to develop strong and efficient form and to prevent injury in his athletes . He explained that- strength training benefited his athletes by " minimizing stress on the connective tissues of the musculoskeletal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making " the entire support system more durable . " <p> An engineer by training , Peter Coe 's approach was always methodical and technical . In his all-encompassing book Better Training for Distance Runners , you can see his thinking first hand . <p> Observing the photograph below , - Peter Coe noted that even the powerful engine of Steve Cram ( former 1500m world record holder and ' 84 1500m Olympic silver medalist ) , was poorly served by his misaligned gait and could benefit from improved biomechanics . <p> Photo from the ' 86 European Championships <p> " Lower-limb running mechanics in three of Britain 's best 1500m runners . Note the optimal foot orientation parallel to the path of movement in Seb Coe ( 326 ) and Tom McKean ( 351 ) , but excessive lower-limb rotation in Steve Cram ( 328 ) , " observed Coe . <p> You can almost imagine Peter Coe perfectly placed in a Formula 1 pit crew . He would go onto describe the seriousness of poor biomechanics that burdened even the great Steve Cram. - <p> Steve Cram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , as well as his left knee , giving that leg a reduced forward vector as it generates propulsive thrust , " said Coe . " An excessive amount of Cram 's propulsive energy is being absorbed by the knee and ankle joints in resisting the torsional stresses generated by his everted foot plant . " <p> " This style of foot planting not only increases the risk of lower-limb injuries , but also reduces his stride length by more than 1 cm . At his race pace and stride length in Stuttgart ( ' 86 European Championships ) Cram was losing a little more than 50 cm for every 100m of distance covered . In today 's races , this is an enormous disadvantage to overcome . " <p> Steve Cram lost the ' 86 800m- European Championships by 0.33 seconds to Sebastian Coe . Cram finished in- 1:44.88 , which was good for third place while- Sebastian Coe took the win in- 1:44.50 . That margin could have been the made up in the 50cm Steve Cram was losing every 100m due to poor biomechanics . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be of interest that over several of his competitive years , Steve Cram was bothered by lower-limb running injuries , particularly to his calf muscles . " Injuries probably caused by his poor mechanics . <p> Loose biomechanics can put a lot of stress on the body 's joints , ligaments and muscles - stress that in time can cause injury . The body may in time beat on itself until breakdown , much like a car with a bent wheel axle . <p> The margins still matter <p> As was the case in the ' 86 European Championships , the importance of winning the margins remains paramount today . Take for example the 2012 10,000m Olympic final . The difference between Mo Farah 's first place and Galen Rupp 's second , was 0.9- seconds . Over those 25 laps , 0.9 second seconds is equal to 0.055% of Farah 's race . If he ran 0.056% slower , - he could have lost the Olympic title . Better biomechanics may have made- this difference . <p> This is why having excellent biomechanics matters so much and Salazar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very direct correlation to speed development , and endurance , and strength , " says Salazar . He elaborates , " this is how you create runners that have great biomechanics , and are able to hold those great biomechanics throughout the whole 10,000 meter race , and be able to sprint at the end .

" Again , the Nike Oregon Project is focusing on strength training to improve stride mechanics and power . <p> Inside Nike : Bounding <p> Strength training has been long dormant , but why ? <p> Though Peter Coe championed strength training 30 years ago and Salazar is helping to make it popular again , for many years weight training was thought to be detrimental . Ever mindful of their mass , runners avoided weights fearing the possibility of bulking up . Salazar takes this fear head on and dismisses it . " It 's very hard to bulk up . I 've never seen a single athlete of mine bulk up . " <p> " Bulking up not only means lifting really hard but eating a ton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not even a single one of my athletes have gained 2lbs . The only one 's that have gained a little bit of weight have been the girls because they have n't been as muscularly toned but it 's good functional muscle that actually allows them to compete better . " <p> In fact , Salazar emphatically states weight training is needed to make it to the next level . " Back going thirty years ago there was an old philosophy about strength training for distance runners . It was this idea of lightweights and lots of reps . And I really do n't believe in that . When do something like that , at some point there 's no stimulus or further growth . At some point if you 're just doing lots of reps and light weights , you 're going to maintain where you are at but you 're not going grow , " he says . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

At the Oregon Twilight 1500m , the Holt took down a solid field , set a seven second personal best , and hit the USATF " A " standard . We wanted to introduce you to the best runner you 've never heard of , but now we 'd like you to get to know her . Going into the Oregon Twilight 1500m , did you see 4:11 coming ? What about a win at Hayward Field ? <p> I definitely did not see- 4:11 coming . I did not even see a win coming , for sure . My objective for the race was to run a fast 1500 in a good , elite field and my coach and I were hoping the time would take care of itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but mentally I was like , " Ohh , can I do this ? Can I actually run that fast ? " When I got on the line and the gun went off , I just got into race mode ... When I hit the finish line , I was in total and complete shock . I wanted the win , but I definitely did not see it coming at all . <p> Right before the bell , you took the lead from OTC 's Jemma Simpson . What 's going through your mind with 400m left no one in sight ? <p> With 400m left , my thoughts were just on finishing as hard as I possibly could . I was n't thinking of who I was running against or what I would run , just finishing . My coach told me to take the race to everyone in the field and that 's all that was running through my mind . <p> Now you have the USATF " A " standard . Did a 5:09 girl from Meridian , I 'd ever think that she 'd be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school , I never would have imagined myself where I am now . I knew I was going to really commit to running once I got to college , but I never pictured myself going from 5:09 to roughly 4:30-4:29ish . My goal was just to try to be an all-American my freshman year . Laughs Every time I think about what I ran , I have to stop and be say , " Whoa . Did that actually happen ? Was I just dreaming ? " Then I remember that I actually did it and get super happy and smiley . <p> It 's incredible what a difference one year can make . Last spring , you won one NAIA Outdoor title in the 1500m ( which was your old PR before this season ) . This year at NAIA Indoors , you won a triple crown in the mile , 3000m , and DMR . What 's your goal for this upcoming NAIA Outdoor Championship ? <p> My old PR actually came from Portland Track Festival that summer where I ran 4:25 . It 's not on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final NAIA list was submitted , at least I think that 's why . Laughs <p> From goyotes . <p> But , this year has been incredibly different . I ca n't even believe how much has changed . XC nationals and Indoor nationals were incredible for me , but this year at NAIA outdoors , I definitely want to defend my 1500m title . I also would like to try and win an additional title in the 800m . I originally thought I would run the 5k , but my coach thinks the 800m is much more crucial to my speed development for the 1500m , so I 'm thinking I 'll be going with the 800m . The 800m is actually my favorite race , so to win a title in that and possibly get a huge PR would be awesome for me . Especially since there are some pretty good girls who will really challenge me in the event . Our 4x400m relay team has an NAIA " A " standard right now , so I would really like to help that team to an all-American honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you picked up a stress fracture in your fibula . When did that happen ? How was the recovery process ? <p> I got the stress fracture in my fibula at the very end of February last year . It was actually about the week before NAIA Indoor Championships , which was a huge bummer for me because I had one of the top times in the mile as well as the DMR . My goal was to win them both , but the stress fracture kind of got in the way of that . It was weird because it happened right after I was coming back from an IT band injury . So I was running really low miles and doing a lot of pool work . <p> The recovery process from the stress fracture was really rough at first . I was pretty upset , and it was really hard for me to sit on the sidelines while I watched my team do hard workouts and get so much better . But , I just put my all into my pool workouts and trained harder than I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the runner I am right now . It helped me to realize how truly special this is and to make the most of it . <p> It also taught me how to really work for something . I was n't running so I had to work twice as hard in the pool to get myself into a good spot to come back and try to win the 1500m at outdoors . After the recovery process and not even knowing where I would be , it made the win that much more special . <p> What 's a typical week of training like for you ? <p> A typical week of training for me is n't too crazy . I actually do not run a lot of mileage . I make sure whatever I do is quality , but I do n't think I even crack 45-50 miles a week . I have the usual long run , hard workout , easy run , tempo run kind of set up . There 's lifting and strength training thrown in there , too . <p> I also do a lot of swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year it kind of came to me as a blessing in disguise . It 's really relaxing to me . So I make sure to swim a few times a week . <p> This is an honest question from an ignorant east coaster : How 's Idaho ? <p> Laughs Ohh man . Idaho is great . The weather is crazy and weird . It does n't stay one temperature for longer than a few hours laughs . But I LOVE Idaho . I am a proud Idahoan , born and raised here . It 's starting to get hot , so that kind of sucks . I do n't like the heat all that much . Some of the mountains and wilderness here are incredible . This summer I will be training in BEAUTIFUL Ketchum , Idaho ( which i am totally stoked for ) . <p> If you could pick one song to be your entrance song , ( a song that plays every time you walk into a room ) what would it be ? <p> Laughs An entrance song ? Ohh my goodness . This question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ! ! I do n't know ... I wish I could come up with a totally legitimate , sweet , and original answer . My coach would tell me to say " Wagon Wheel . " That 's our team 's song and we sing it pretty much wherever we go ( no joke , we sang it at an open mic night at some restaurant we went to in Ohio while we were at indoor nationals ... coach 's idea ) . <p> But if I had to pick a song ... I think I would pick a song called " Seventeen Years " by Ratatat . It does n't even have any words , it 's just one of my favorite songs of all-time . Either that or something like " Girl on Fire " by Alicia Keys : ) <p> And just like that , we 've listened to this song a few hundred times today . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

While we ca n't post any highlight videos from the meet , we 'll break down those three seconds that moved Jenkins from second to not even in the results . At the bell in the men 's 3000m , Jenkins tries to move inside . We 're not sure why he was trying to slide into lane one with a clear opening on the outside , but it 's a moot point . We 're primarily concerned ( maybe too much ) with what happened next . <p> Jenkins tries to move inside and Arkansas ' Kemoy Campbell gives him a nudge with his right arm . It 's natural as- Campbell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lose some balance . The awkward momentum forces him to extend his hand to find some stability , which just so happens to land on Oklahoma State 's Kirubel Erassa 's back . <p> This is where everything becomes incriminating . Jenkins then tugs on Erassa 's jersey , which pulled him backwards ever so slightly . <p> In the next few strides , everything seems fine as Jenkins swings outside and Erassa takes two more steps . But the loss of momentum caused Erassa to slow down , which was bad news for Campbell , who was still in full stride . <p> One could argue that Erassa was n't impeded , but the next chain of events would n't have happened without the initial jersey grab by Jenkins . <p> Campbell 's right foot catches Erassa 's heel , which causes the actual tumble that was seen on ESPN3 . <p> Erassa recovers to finish fourth* , Campbell scored valuable points for the Razorbacks with his third* place finish , and Jenkins gave Lalang a scare as he charged home for second* . <p> Northeastern and Jenkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that some good-natured coaches helped write it and since we 're not sure if we can publish their names or not , they 're currently omitted .

@@23250231 @3250231/ <h> The Thrill and Illusion of the Men 's DMR <p> Before the lights went down after day one of the NCAA Indoor Championships , there was a short meeting of the minds about the men 's distance medley relay . <p> The group that had survived the war of attrition that was the first day of NCAA Indoors was Flotrack ( still uploading videos ) , the Princeton DMR ( drug testing ) , and Letsrun ( still writing ) . <p> The DMR capped off an incredible evening that brought the Fayetteville crowd to their feet despite their Razorbacks being out of it . <p> But what about the event itself ? <p> Earlier this winter , we argued that the DMR is one of the most exciting events and should be run more often . No other event offers the unique blend of four different disciplines legs rolled into a- haphazard- 4000m ? <p> Not everyone shared our excitement .

In a sense , the DMR is an illusion because there is no direct correlation between a quick fast first three legs and a blazing overall time . <p> In the case of the DMR , like most championship races , the pace will dawdle and the relay will resemble more of an accordion as more and more teams can get back into the race before the final 200m . <p> Three and a half legs later , it 's still up in the air . <p> But that does n't mean it 's not an interesting race . The DMR is the rare occasion where overconfidence from the leaders and tenacity from the chasers can create mayhem over the final stages of the race . <p> It may be based on false hope ( an illusion perhaps ? ! ) , but it 's still thrilling to watch teams that were once completely out of the picture have an outside shot of actually winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy ?

The downpour was less than ideal for the multi-events and all Eaton had to do was finish in the top three to qualify . <p> - <p> It appeared as if the Gods of Track and Field did n't want Eaton to break the mark , but after the first two events , it was apparent that he had their blessing . <p> - <p> Eaton 's marks of 10.21 in the 100m and 8.23m ( 27-0 ) in the long jump were n't just personal bests , but world records for those events in the decathlon . <p> - <p> To give those performances even more perspective , Eaton was 0.3-seconds short of the- Olympic " A " standard in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for second at the Trials . <p> - <p> Not bad for someone who did n't primarily concentrate on those disciplines . Then again , you 're not crowned The Greatest Athlete in the World for cheap . <p> - <p> The rest of the rainy filled day consisted of a 14.20m ( 46-7.25 ) throw in the Shot Put , a 2.05m ( 6-8.75 ) jump in the High Jump , and a 46.70 finish in the 400m . By the end of day one , Eaton had 4,728 points . <p> - <p> Eaton and Sebrle would trade world record leads throughout the competition . Even though he was ahead after day one , Eaton would fall behind in his own personal race to be the best decathlete in the world . <p> - <p> After starting off the day with a 13.70 finish in the 100mH , Eaton slipped behind world record pace with an eighth place finish in the discus with a 42.81m ( 140-5 ) throw . <p> - <p> However , a personal best in the pole vault ( 5.30m or 17-4.5 ) would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In baseball , it 's taboo to talk about a perfect game when it 's ongoing . In track and field , is it taboo to talk about records when they 're happening ? <p> - <p> When it came down to the last two events ( javelin and 1500m ) , Eaton may have been too in the moment to realize that he was on the cusp for something special . <p> - <p> " Before the javelin my coach called me over and started showing me different technique things with the javelin and how I should do this and that to throw far and I was getting the impression that he really wanted me to do well or that this javelin was more important than others . I said ' OK coach , how far do I need to throw to get the American Record ? ' - At this point the possibility of breaking that record was floating around so I figured that 's what he was hinting at . - He kind of looks at me and smiles and says , ' Not the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was kind of like a mission . - I was nervous of course but I also thought if was going to happen anywhere it was going to be at Hayward field . " <p> - <p> Nervous , but confident , Eaton 's throw of 58.87m ( 193-1 ) left him within the realm of possibility with one event to go . That event was the daunting and exhausting 1500m . <p> - <p> " After the javelin coach told me I had to run 4:16 and that 's when the nerves hit hard . - It 's interesting though because the way I felt then is the same way I had felt before a lot of the great moments in my career ; nervous but not scared . - It 's like my thoughts were on the fence of something not being possible but then possibly in the realm of happening . - It 's a very interesting feeling . " <p> - <p> World record holder and Olympic gold medalist Ashton Eaton sometimes get nervous before an event . <p> - <p> He 's just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Curtis Beach from Duke asked to pace Eaton to the record , but he declined . He had to break his previous personal best of 4:18.94 after the best decathlon performance in his running career. - <p> - <p> To once again put this record in perspective , Eaton- would have finished second if he decided to forgo the 1500m . On the edge of history , it 's not much of a surprise that he decided to make a run for it . <p> - <p> Eaton was on perfect pace through 400m with a split of 67.2 . He then split 71.2 through 800m ( 2:18.4 ) , and came through 1110m at 3:12.23 . He needed a 64-second split to break the record and crossed the line in 62.26 . <p> - <p> Eaton 's total of 9,039 broke Sebrle 's previous record of 9026. - <p> - <p> Not only do the pictures of the final meters capture Eaton 's elation , but the class of fellow decathletes Joe Detmer and Curtis Beach . Both athletes moved aside to let Eaton take the glory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 15. - Classic multi-event mindset and a reflection of who those guys are . - The whole thing was just right .

There 's an incredibly high expectation to win gold at the Games that some athletes think about the next step before the Trails . <p> - <p> All too serendipitous , this decathlon marked the ten year anniversary for the failed " Dan and Dave " campaign sponsored by Reebok for the decathletes Dan O'Brien and Dave Johnson . The ten events comes with an added pressure and Eaton casually brushed off failure . <p> - <p> " I was nervous for the trials but the Games trumped. - After my performance at the trials I felt an increase in expectation for a similar outcome at the Games . - Not necessarily a WR but definitely the gold . - The time between the trials and the Games was n't very activity filled and despite my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time about the competition . - I was just making myself nervous . - I kept trying to downplay the whole thing telling myself it was n't the Olympics but that 's pretty hard to do . - The one revolving thought that had the most impact was the fact that this may be my only chance to get an Olympic gold medal so I wanted to maximize the opportunity . " <p> Eaton fulfilled all of his goals last spring . Not only did he maximize his athletic potential , but his marketability as well . Skillful as he 's charismatic , Eaton was as nimble on his feet as he is during the jumps during his Letterman appearance . - <p> He wants to score over 9,000 points again , but we 'll have to wait until the spring . The world 's best are asked whether they 'd rather have an Olympic gold medal or a world record . Ashton Eaton has both . 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

The race that followed was a different story . <p> The 2012 Nike Cross National Championships was filled with drama , surprises , and most importantly , mud . Although there were a few moments of disbelief , the girl 's championship race went as expected . The sense of confidence among analysts was immediately destroyed as all predictions were thrown out the window during the boy 's championship race . <p> The Community Race had both a humorous and concerning message . The image that best fits both descriptions was one competitor who chose to race in goggles . <p> Once everyone had finished with a hearty early morning chuckle , thoughts about the condition of the course grew . How bad was it out there ? <p> When the race went off , the sweeping shot of the start really painted an accurate picture . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race . It was going to be a strategical slopfest . <p> The early favorites initially tucked themselves near the front . In any type of championship race , it 's important to get out hard or you 'll be caught dodging runners in the back . There was a fine line for that strategy : How much energy do you sacrifice to get a good position ? <p> If you 're the Fayetteville-Manlius girls , staying back means not winning with 15 points through one kilometer . When the first split of team scores were announced , it looked like FM 's to lose . <p> They moved up . A lot . <p> By 2k , the race for the individual title started to become more clear . The defending NXN champion Sarah Baxter , the 1500m specialist Mary Cain , and the always dangerous Katie Knight started to make their way towards the front . <p> From that point on , Baxter took a page out of FM 's playbook as it was her race to lose . Even though Cain was only a second back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still looked like an uphill battle for the Bronxville junior . While people traditionally scoff at Californians who try and run in the mud , Baxter was in the zone . - <p> If Cain could keep it close until the end , there may have been a huge upset . But with under 1k to go , Baxter started to wind it up and slowly pulled away from Cain . At the finish , Cain seemed to muster her finishing kick , but Baxter was out of range . <p> Sarah Baxter crossed the line in 19:17 and became the first prep to defend an NXN individual title . Cain took second in 19:21 . <p> What 's next for Baxter ? The Simi Valley junior told Runnerspace.com that she had planned to take a month off from training . " A month ? ! " some consecutive day running aficionados said in surprise . <p> The longevity is sure helping Baxter . She took things easy her freshman year and even after winning the California state title , she chose to not compete at NXN . Bernard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests on Sunday . Sometimes rest is the key to longterm success , which should be Baxter 's long term plan . <p> Not far behind her were two Washingtonians who are always in the top three . Katie Knight , who missed some training due to mono , took third for the second year in a row. - <p> Behind her was sophomore Alexa Efraimson , who 's challenged Knight and fellow Washington native Amy-Eloise Neale throughout the season . She finished third at the NXN Northwest Regional ( to Knight and Neale ) , but took fourth at nationals . <p> I 'm in a New York State of Mind <p> Whether it was Frank Sinatra 's New York , New York or the New York 's more modern victory anthem of Empire State of Mind , NY once again dominated the team competition. - Actually , there are a lot of songs we could have used . <p> FM maintained their position to take the win with 54 points and a 37-second spread . That was pretty much as expected . <p> But New York was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in the top five , but they were n't in their usual order . <p> Aurora High School came up huge and took fourth place over intrastate rival Saratoga Springs High School . Aurora , who were considered the fourth best team in NY after taking second to the Academy of Holy Names at the NYS Cross Country Championship , ran out of their minds . <p> Since then , these girls have been on fire . The managed to secure a well deserved at-large bid from the NXN committee with a third place finish at the NXN NY Regional Championship . <p> At the NY Regional , Manilus won with 28 points , Saratoga took second with 59 , Aurora was third with 123 , and Academy of Holy Names placed fourth with 132 . But Aurora 's cinderella story was n't done yet . <p> Similar to Knight and Efraimson , the Aurora girls have to compete in a tough state . Even though they may had been ranked fourth in NY at some point , they took fourth at NXN with 212 points . Saratoga took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Aurora 's fourth runner at the regional championship , was their number two at NXN . Their 2:25 spread from regionals shrunk to a mere 48-seconds at nationals . Sometimes you just have to believe . <p> That may have been the case for Shelby Chapin of Southlake Carroll . Even though SLC was projected to finish second ( which they did ) , Chapin stepped up big time to ensure the silver medal finish . Chapin was SLC 's fourth girl at the NXN South Regional , but finished as their number one at NXN . <p> The air of excitement about defending champions soon died down in preparation for the boy 's championship race . Christian Brothers Academy looked ready to be the first team their NXN title while the individual race was wide open . <p> There were still favorites that should 've been in the mix . Early on in the race , Nick Ryan , Bernie Montoya , Jake Leingang , and Jacob Burcham were up front . Totally normal . <p> Makes sense , right ? <p> For the last race of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The course was so chewed up from the two earlier races that hanging back off early pace would be the most wise strategy in the end . <p> That 's why the team title was so tough to call early on . The first team split at 1k had Southlake Carroll in the lead with 227 points . The 200+ team score was a testament to the depth of the field and conditions of the course . <p> The real challengers started to emerge in the next few kilometers . Eventual NXN champion Sam Wharton and soon to be second place Estevan De La Rosa started to move up to the front . It was still hard to tell who was going to take the crown . <p> The team battle was also still in question . American Fork had moved into the lead with 107 points to North Central 's 170 . SLC had fallen to third . <p> American Fork maintained their position as they went through 3k with 125 points . Christian Brothers Academy , who moved late in the race last year to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second with 162 points . North Central was now in third with 168 . <p> Even though the team race had n't been broken up yet , the amorphous individual race was starting to shape up . Connor Olson made the first big surge to break the field open , but he was tracked by Arcadia 's Estevan De La Rosa . <p> The individual race became more definitive as the team race remained unknown . At the 14-minute mark , Sam Wharton made a move to the front and never looked back . Wharton had finished second at both Foot Locker Midwest and NXN Midwest , but would n't be denied on Saturday . <p> The 21st place finisher from 2011 was not concerned about the competition or course . <p> Even though he would never relinquish his team , Wharton said that he only knew he was going to win " two steps before the line . " <p> Prior to the finish , it was n't CBA that was moving up , but Arcadia High School . The 2010 NXN Champions were stalking then first place American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Arcadia rolled in the last kilometer to come home with the win with 108 points . American Fork was second with 122 points , North Spokane was third with 146 points , and CBA finished a disappointing fourth with 167 . <p> Everyone loves to rag on Californians for not being able to run in the mud . Then again , Sarah Baxter had just defended her national title and Arcadia had taken their second title in three years . <p> How does a team that never runs in the mud compete so well in these conditions ? Strength training . <p> Coach Jim O'Brien told the Los Angeles Daily News , " Every single one of these guys ran more than 1,000 miles during the summer and it paid off today . " Strength , not speed , definitely paid off on Saturday . " <p> Physical strength was n't the only factor for the top three teams . Junior Kai Wilmot from North Central had been sidelined with an injury since October and " had only run three miles once prior to this race " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have finished in fourth to CBA . The Midwest , but more importantly , Ohio <p> When they were in the lobby of one of Nike 's many buildings , the boys from the Midwest looked upon the display of posters of previous champions . The last two winners , Lukas Verzbicas and Futsum Zeinasellaissie , had been from the Midwest . The Midwest boys made a promise to continue that tradition and it was fulfilled through Wharton . <p> Recently , the road to the championship was just as difficult as the actual course . The Ohio High School Athletic Association had ruled that athletes could not accept any funding for postseason competitions or they would be forced to forfeit their amateur status . <p> Thankfully , Wharton 's parents paid his way to Portland . Imagine if Wharton was unable to compete ? The Course and Cross Country <p> There 's been a lot of backlash about the conditions of the course . Some say it was unsafe for the athletes while others feel that it was true cross country conditions . <p> The times were slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats of mud . This may have been an extreme example of " what cross country is all about . " However , what was the alternative ? Should Nike have moved the course or covered it with tarps to prevent the rain from turning NXN into the 2012 Tough Mudder High School Nationals ? <p> Course conditions is still a big issue in the U.S. The best example comes from a few years ago when Galen Rupp pulled out of a cross country race because of the quality of the course . This spawned a meme about different courses being " Rupp Certified . " If they were n't perfected manicured golf courses , some runners would chose not to run . <p> Things could have been worse . USA Cross Country Nationals and the IAAF World Cross Country Championships have been held in snowy conditions . <p> The famous Cinque Mulini cross country race in Italy is literally run through the town of San Vittore Olona , Italy . - <p> Frank Shorter , not really caring about footing . <p> Whether the course was dangerous or favored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same conditions . <p> In the girl 's race , that did n't affect the favorites .

Some members of Total Sports management team as well as the New Jersey-New York Track Club are among those who take over the trails of Leuven as they prepare themselves for their Euro seasons and for some the Olympic Games . <p> Leuven is a pretty unique place as it is n't one of Belgium 's big cities like Brussels or Antwerp but still has the bustling feel of a town of nearly 100,000 residents . The center of all the action in Leuven is its town square where the town hall and St. Peter 's church are located . Both were constructed in the 15th century , and despite damage suffered during World War II , they are both still standing strong today . <p> Town hall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall <p> The bell tower on top of St. Peter 's church has a small figurine that rings the bell at the top of every hour . Pretty neat . <p> European town squares are pretty lively places . Every evening locals and tourists alike flood the area in pursuit of tasty food and drink . Restaurants vary from serving sushi , pizza and Mexican food as well as the tastiest of Belgian beers . My two nights of eating out consisted of a steak dinner on one night and spaghetti bolognese with a healthy portion of cheese sprinkled on top on the other . Speaking of beer , here 's a fun fact - Stella Artois was founded in Leuven and continues to be brewed in the town. - <p> French fries are a big deal in Europe . In America fried taters are typically a side dish served with hamburgers and other main food items . They can serve a similar role in Europe but can also be served by themselves .

That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pulp Fiction . <p> Fries equivalent of the Hamburglar <p> Finally , a little story on the track in Leuven . It 's located at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven , the oldest Catholic university in the world still in existance and the biggest university in Belgium ( according to Wikipedia , so take it for what it 's worth ) . At this point of the season , pretty much every runner is on the track doing final sharpening work before their European races . As a result , they 're forced to deal with the interestingly shaped Leuven track . The oval is more like a circle ; the straightaways are just 35 meters or so long , making the turns extremely long and gradual . The common start/finish line and the 200 meter mark are almost straight across the field from each other . It 's a pretty funky configuration , but most of the athletes were able to adjust and get in some good speed work prior to their next races . <p> For more pictures around the town of Leuven , check out the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Total Sports crew for providing me a place to stay for a few nights .

It appears that at the Western Washington University ( WWU ) both men and women finished second in that event . <p> Keith Butler : The WWU meet was an excellent meet for both our men 's and women 's teams . We ran the same meet last year , but two weeks later in the season , yet all of our men , and several of our women ran faster than the year before , in some cases by 20-40 second margins . <p> What I like about our women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could all run well at CIS . Coach Fougner has some tough choices to make for our top seven . Our men are coming of age a bit . Other than Cliff Childs , who is our fittest runner , the team is comprised of guys who are all in the their first , second or third year . Adapting to the 10k race distance takes some time for the men and we have reached that point with our men 's program this season . <p> CK : Vikes won the 2010 Canada West Championships however , finished fourth at CIS ( Nationals ) . What are your expectations for this year ? - <p> KB : Our men and women were both fourth at CIS last year . The men 's team won Canada West while the women were second in Canada West . Our goal is to win both Canada West team titles and to finish top three at CIS . Saskatchewan on the women 's side and Regina on the men 's side appear to be the strongest Canada West opposition at this point . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap between us and the top two women 's programs in the country , Guelph and McMaster . Guelph is the clear front runner on the men 's side with Windsor a strong second . For our men to finish third we are going to have to beat out Western , Queen 's , McMaster , Laval and Regina . The race for third is going to be tight . <p> CK : Does having just one fifth-year male ( Cliff Childs ) , temper your original expectations ? <p> KB : Not after our race in Bellingham . Rookie Ryan Cassidy is the real deal . He ran 31:41 for the 10k race distance and was totally in control . Dylan Haight is fit and super talented . We need him to put it together on race day . Our eighth runner ran 32:41 so we have very good depth this year . <p> CK : With the women you have three in their fifth year in Mitic , Roske and McQueen . Does maturity at CIS come into play on the road as the team is together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KB : Absolutely . Mitic was a second team All-Canadian at CIS last year , Roske is the Canada West 3000m indoor champion , and McQueen raced CIS Championships for Calgary . Fourth year runner Deirdre Moran was 15th at CIS two years ago and is in the shape of her life . Stephanie Trenholm was the Western Canada Games 1500m champion and is rounding into great form after taking a well deserved slow start to the season . So our veterans are fit and experienced . Rookie Grace Annear , who came to us as a 2:11 800m runner , has demonstrated the ability to handle the cross-country training very well . And then we have yet to run Ellen Pennock , who raced the world junior triathlon championships in Beijing in September and had the fastest 5k run of all the girls in the field . But for two falls on the bike and Ellen would likely have won a medal there . We also have Brittany Therrien , who won the Western Canada Games bronze medal in the 1500m and Shauna McInnis , who is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : At the time of the writing Ellen Pennock took first overall at the UBC Open , October 22nd , where the women swept the podium . <p> CK : What have you and Fougner done differently this year to stimulate this apparent new level of fitness ? - <p> KB : We have really emphasized tempo running more than we have the past two seasons and we have done the tempo running over hills . I think this is the biggest difference , especially for the men . Racing 10k requires aerobic strength . Our athletes have noticed the difference in their early season races . The biggest factor however is that our athletes completed successful summer seasons and were able to return to training , after a two week break , very smoothly . <p> CK : You personally had great success at Oak Bay High School for a number of years . Was the transition to University-level athletics smooth ?

Because I was not at all of the Vikes workouts , it was hard to form the coach/athlete relationships that are crucial to successful coaching . Brent ( Fougner ) has been extremely supportive of my transition and has given me the role of men 's cross-country coach . This is the first season where I feel like I am having some positive impact on the program as a coach . <p> CK : Do you remain involved at Oak Bay at any level ? Tessa Logan is the new head coach , I understand . Was there a transition plan , where you were able to impart your experiences at Oak Bay ? <p> KB : I had a number of roles that needed to be filled by my stepping away from the high school scene in Victoria . I was league commissioner for both cross-country and track and field as well as the Island Zone Rep for both disciplines . Brad Cunningham ( Reynolds ) and Paul O'Callaghan ( GNS ) both agreed to take these roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , filling the Oak Bay coaching positions was a priority as well . Tessa assisted me last fall so she was a natural fit . I was impressed with her enthusiasm and organizational skills and she has a very good rapport with the students . If she can add the coaching knowledge she will become an outstanding coach. - <p> I ran our traditional cross-country camp in August and Tessa came as a coach so the torch was passed then . Mike Sheffer , my longtime co-coach with the track and field team at Oak Bay , will take over as head coach this spring . I have not gone to one Oak Bay high school training session or meet this fall , but have provided lots of advice and will keep doing so as long as needed . I wo n't be able to stay away from the Island Championships Oct 26th however . I will be in the woods racing around the course on my secret trails , cheering on the runners in green and white . <p> KB : Now that CIS schools are able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to full tuition , the recruiting landscape is quite competitive . The NCAA schools also recruit the top Canadians . However , we have lots to sell to a prospective student athlete about Victoria and our program. - <p> Victoria is considered a destination university . Seventy-eight percent of UVic 's students come from cities outside Victoria . The climate , the west coast lifestyle , our picturesque campus , definitely help . Victoria is also the National Endurance Center . Brent Fougner and Wynn Gmitroski are the national team center coaches so the coaching expertise is high . UVic also specializes in middle distance and cross-country . Thus our team size is small , 18 men and 18 women this year , so athletes receive full attention . We can focus all of our resources on the middle distance events . We also run a full summer program even though the CIS does not . Most of our training group stays in Victoria through mid-July and when the national center athletes return from their winter base in Phoenix , Arizona . We have some amazing workout groups through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent competition in the US and take part fully in the National Track League meets as well. - <p> We have athletes on our team from throughout Western Canada and from as far away as New Brunswick . We expect to land some outstanding recruits for the 2012/13 season . <p> CK : That is a sound value proposition for prospective recruits . What is the next major meet for the Vikes ? - <p> KB : - We will race our top seven men and women at the CIS Championships this Saturday , November 12th in Quebec City . Those not in the top seven will have raced the BC Club Championships October 29th in Aldergrove , BC ( near Vancouver ) . Several athletes will then race the Athletics Canada Cross Country Championships , they happen Nov 26th in Vancouver while the others will transition to training for the indoor season , joining our 400m/800m group for some sessions. 19702 @qwx219702 19704 @qwx219704

Who gets in to the Olympic Games ? <p> There has been a lot of questions as to who will be getting into the Olympic Games based on the qualifying procedures around athletes hitting A and B standard marks . Based on the rules it is safe to say that NO athlete will qualify in for Team USA that does not have an Olympic A standard in a running/track event .

He , in fact , never held the record , as Chris Nelloms ran 13.30 some 14 years earlier . ( Warsinskey may have been confused , as Ginn 's 13.40 is the state meet record , but a journalist should know the difference . ) <p> This all came up not because of Ginn 's notoriety as a hurdler but as an NFL return specialist . I was asked if anyone has ever compiled all-time lists for NFL players in the various track and field events . I replied that I was not aware of any , but putting one together sounded like a job for yours truly . <p> I dimly remembered a compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Google helped me find it : Track Guys Gone Bad , available at the great www.tilastopaja.org statistics website . It 's a very good piece of research and quite deep . So the heavy lifting had already been done for me . <p> Over the years there have been a lot of discussions about who the fastest guy in the history of pro football was , and it usually comes down to Bob Hayes and Darrell Green . Notably absent from the discussion ? Tommie Smith . <p> Yes , Tommie Smith played pro football , a total of two games for the Bengals back in the AFL days . He was signed more or less as an experiment and publicity stunt . Putting aside a longing for days when a pro football outfit would turn to track stars for publicity , we have to decide who really qualifies as a pro football player . <p> I did n't want players who were experiments or washouts to take precedence over bona fide NFL players . - Here 's what I decided : the athlete in question must have played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AFL team . That means appearing in a career total of at least 16 games , or 14 games prior to 1978 . ( Thus Trindon Holliday is not listed here . ) Players in other leagues , such as the USFL or CFL , were eligible if they were bona fide stars who unquestionably would have made an NFL roster . <p> Two things to note ... 1 . Al Davis liked speed , and the fact that seven out of the above played for his Raiders really calls that into focus . 2 . Johnny Majors apparently liked speed too , as Graddy , Gault and Miller all were football/track dual-sport stars for his Tennessee Volunteers . <p> Two things to note ... 1 . When defensive backs show up in these rankings , it appears to be in the 400 ( and hurdles , below ) . Is this because the position requires greater endurance , or because the 400 does n't attract the attention hogs you tend to get at wide receiver ? 2 . Darrell Green was one hell of an athlete . <p> Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bills ' punter up there at #3 .

Robert Griffin III , this year 's Heisman winner , sports a 49.22 PR and will go to the head of the list if he makes it in the NFL . <p> Two things to note ... 1 . Eric Metcalfe is , in my opinion , on the short list for the best at both football and track ; he is by far the best long jumper ever to play pro football , and is the NFL 's #2 all-time punt return touchdown leader . Some of the moves he made for the Browns in the early 90s are still highlight-film material . 2 . Texas ' Marquise Goodwin has a PR of 8.17 , but it is unclear whether the Longhorn wide receiver will pursue football at a level beyond college .

His best mark ever reported is 7 ' 4-+ " , listed in the USATF Annual as a " questionable performance " ( a designation not given out lightly , so it 's highly likely to be a bogus mark ) . He never competed at an NCAA Championships , and Track and Field News has no mention of him whatsoever , either on their annual lists ( going down to 7 ' 1-+ " ) or at the SWAC Championships . 2 . The crossover in this event is n't particularly big , as the long-and-light body type required for great high jumping does n't stand up well to NFL abuse . <p> Two things to note ... 1 . Carter and Stover played on the same 49ers teams that dominated the 1980s. 2 .

@@23250256 @3250256/ <h> Thinking on the Run : Association Vs . Dissociation <p> Thinking on the Run : Association Vs . Dissociation <p> Jan 31 , 2010 <p> Bryan Loy 19708 @qwx219708 <p> ShareThis <p> What do you think about on the run ? Without a doubt your thoughts , whatever they may be , have an impact on performance . Some runners may think performance is best when they focus on form , while others my have a pump-up song stuck in their head that they " sing " over and over . I even had a middle school teammate who told me that he pretended a particular girl 's behind was a few meters in front of him and that he was chasing it . It is probably obvious that some patterns of thinking work better than others . I personally have experienced success when I am focused solely on running , but have struggled when I allowed my mind to drift to topics outside of running ( I also tried the butt idea and did n't experience improved performance ) . Generally , focus can be associative or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an athlete uses . Here I hope to introduce these styles so that you can better understand your thought patters and the resulting performance implications from using a specific style . <p> Associative thoughts are based on the race or performance itself . While running , Schomer ( 1987 ) states these thoughts could include monitoring of bodily sensations such as respiration or muscle pain . Associative thoughts also include internal commands or instructions , such as " surge to that next person " or " relax the shoulders " . An athlete in an associative state may also consider their present emotional state and have a thought such as " I feel light and fast today " or " I 'm really mad that coach put me in the 10k and I have 15 more laps to go " . Finally , according to Schomer ( 1987 ) , association can also include thoughts about pace . The bottom line is that athletes who associate are focused on the task at hand and this only . <p> Athletes who dissociate , however , may think about things unrelated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These dissociative thoughts , according to Schomer ( 1987 ) could include reflection on past events and planning for future events . Athletes who focus on the environment ( looking at the trees or the pretty girls in the stands ) or listen to music while running are also dissociating. - <p> It may sometimes be more enjoyable to hum a song or work out problems of the day on a run , but- associative thinking is related to the best possible running performances . This belief is based on the Morgan and Pollock ( 1977 ) study of marathon runners , which found that most runners used a dissociative style , where they may have tried to notice scenery on the course or sung a song in their head as a way to focus on something besides the pain of running a marathon . Yet elite marathoners used an associative style , instead focusing on breathing and feelings coming from the leg muscles . The monitoring of bodily sensations , according to Morgan and Pollock , helped runners relax so that they could achieve performance goals . Smith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) also found that the most economical distance runners reported dissociating less but focusing on relaxation more than did less economical runners . However , use of association did not differ between the economical runners and the less economical runners . The implication is that association itself is not what is responsible for improved performance , but it is instead the improved economy that typically comes through relaxation . But relaxation does not come easily during a painful event such as a marathon , so athletes must associate and think abut relaxing if they are to achieve such a state . <p> Is it necessary , or even desirable , to associate at all times while running ? The answer is probably no , and in fact many elite runners drift between styles , even during the same run ( Morgan , 1981 ) . Athletes do tend to rate dissociation as a preferrable state ( Gill &amp; Strom , 1985 ) , and many runners ( even competitive ones ) want to run just to clear their mind or enjoy a beautiful trial every one in a while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical factor for performance , association may be the way to go . <p> References <p> Gill , D.L. , &amp; Strom , E.H .
