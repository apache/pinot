If you file separately , you generally can not take tax credits , such as the child and dependent care credit , and you ca n't claim the standard deduction unless your spouse does the same . If you live in a community property state , you may have to claim some of your spouse 's income and deductions , even when you file separately . <h> Marriage Tax or Marriage Penalty <p> You may have heard of the " marriage tax " or the " marriage penalty . " There is no specific tax for married people . The so-called marriage penalty is the higher total tax some taxpayers may pay due to provisions in the tax code . <p> For example , you can use $3,000 of capital losses to offset ordinary income , such as wages , every year . A single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a married couple together can only deduct up to $3,000 against ordinary income .

Make sure you really owe the money <p> If you owe a lot more tax than you expected , find out why . <p> Read your completed return carefully , and look for errors . Its easy to add the same income twice or to forget an important deduction . <p> If your tax return does n't  show a deduction or credit you thought you qualified for , make sure you answered all the questions correctly . <p> One missed question or checkbox can cause you to miss out on tax benefits you may be entitled to . <p> Another way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years return to your tax return from last year .

Call or write to the IRS for clarification . <h> 2 . Minimize penalties and interest <p> Large tax bills are worse if you have to- pay penalties and interest on top of the original amount owed . Luckily , you can minimize these extra charges- in three ways : <p> Exceptions to underpayment of tax penalties <p> If you underpaid your taxes this year , but owed considerably less last year , you typically do n't  pay a- penalty for underpayment of tax if you withheld at least as much as you owed last year .

@@12200407 @800407/ <h> 7 Best Tax Deductions , Exemptions , and Credits for Families <p> While your children are young you have plenty of expenses . Fortunately , some of those expenses can directly or indirectly turn into deductions , exemptions or credits that may mean big savings on your tax bill . <p> Take a look at the following tax benefits to see which ones could be beneficial for you . <h> 1 . Dependency exemptions . <p> You ca n't take a deduction for money you spend on food , clothing , shelter and other basic necessities for your children , but the dependency exemption lowers your taxes in much the same way as a deduction would . <p> Typically , you can claim an exemption for each child or relative who meets a certain set of tests who you claim as a dependent . In 2015 , you can likely reduce your taxable income by $4,000 for each of your dependents . <p> If you welcomed a new baby into your family this year , remember that you can claim the dependency exemption . It does n't  matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 you can still take the exemption for the entire year . <h> 2 . Child and dependent care tax credit . <p> If you paid someone to take care of your child or another eligible dependent while you worked or looked for work , you may qualify for a credit of up to 35 percent of the first $3,000 you paid the provider for one child . For two or more children , the credit may be as much as 35 percent of up to $6,000 in expenses " that 's a maximum credit of $2,100 . <p> The amount of your credit goes down as your income goes up . If your adjusted gross income is over $15,000 , the percentage used to calculate the credit is reduced . If your adjusted gross income is over $43,000 , the percentage is 20 percent of expenses . <p> You can take this credit until your child reaches age 13 . You can also take the credit for children over 13 and other qualifying dependents who are physically or mentally incapable of caring for themselves . They must live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking a credit , you may be able to use dependent care benefits offered by your employer . These benefits may include contributions paid by your employer to you or directly to the care provider . . You do n't have to pay Social Security or income tax on this money , which makes for better tax savings than the child and dependent care credit . <h> 3 . Child tax credit . <p> Thanks to a permanent extension , you may qualify for a $1,000 child tax credit for 2015 and beyond . The credit is good until the year your qualified dependent turns 17 . <p> It starts to phase out when income rises past $75,000 ( $110,000 if filing jointly ) . For taxpayers in lower tax brackets , the credit is refundable , which means they may get a refund even if the credit exceeds their income tax liability for the year . <h> 4 . Earned income credit ( EIC or EITC ) . <p> The earned income credit helps moderate-to-lower income working families make ends meet . It can mean a significant amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For example , if you have three or more qualifying children , you could qualify for a maximum credit in 2015 of $6,242 . This is a refundable credit , meaning you can get money back even if you had little or no income tax withheld . <p> To qualify for the earned income credit as a single , head of household , or widowed filer , you must have adjusted gross income of less than $39,131 if you have one child , $44,454 if you have two children , or $47,747 if you have three or more children . <p> If you are married filing jointly , you may qualify if you have adjusted gross income of less than $44,651 if you have one child , $49,974 if you have two children , or $53,267 if you have three or more children . <h> 5 . Adoption credit . <p> If you adopted or paid adoption expenses in 2015 , the adoption credit can be a financial lifesaver . The credit refunds qualified adoption expenses dollar for dollar , up to $13,400 in 2015 . <p> If your modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit is reduced . If its $241,010 or more , you wo n't qualify for this credit . <h> 6 . Head of Household or Qualifying Widow(er) filing status . <p> It 's not a deduction or credit , but it can save you money . If you 're single , you would normally use the Single filing status . <p> If you have a child , however , and you pay more than half the cost of maintaining a home for that qualifying child , you may be able to file as Head of Household . This is true even if the childs other parent claims the dependency exemption . <p> If your spouse died in 2013 or 2014 and you have a dependent child or stepchild living with you , you may be able to file as a Qualifying Widow(er) . ( If your spouse died in 2015 , you generally file a joint return with him or her for the year . ) You should pay less tax by using either of these filing statuses than by filing as Single . <h> 7 . Education tax credits . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , especially when they go to college . <p> Education tax credits can help significantly , however . The American Opportunity Credit , which expanded and renamed the already-existing Hope Scholarship Credit , can be claimed for up to the first $2,000 you spend on tuition , fees , books , supplies and equipment for yourself , your spouse and your dependent children . <p> If you qualify , it also gives you 25 percent of the next $2,000 back as a credit . That means you could receive a total credit of up to $2,500 per eligible student . You can now use the American Opportunity Credit for all four years of a child 's undergraduate studies . <p> The American Opportunity Credit amount you can claim is reduced when your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $80,000 ( $160,000 if you file jointly ) , and disappears when your modified adjusted gross income is over $90,000 ( $180,000 for joint filers ) . <p> If you do n't qualify for the American Opportunity Tax Credit , you may be able to take the Lifetime Learning Credit . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain related expenses up to $10,000 . <p> No matter how many students are on your return , the most you can take under the Lifetime Learning Credit is $2,000 . The maximum Lifetime Learning Credit you can claim is reduced when your modified adjusted gross income exceeds $54,000 ( $108,000 if you file jointly ) , and disappears when your modified adjusted gross income is over $64,000 ( $128,000 for joint filers ) . <p> You ca n't use the same expenses for more than one education tax benefit and you can not claim both credits for the same student in the same year . You can only claim the American Opportunity Credit for up to four tax years for the same student 's expenses . @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325

He we will have to report the money to the IRS , BUT will pay nothing since it is under the 5 million . Is this correct ? <p> Any amount over $14,000 that your father gives you will need to be reported to the IRS through a Gift Tax return and will go toward his Lifetime Exemption amount which is $5.45 million ( current figure for 2016 ) . As long as your father has not given over $5.45 million total in his lifetime , he will not have to pay taxes on the amount until that point . <p> Anyone can gift an individual up to $14,000 in one year without having to file a Gift Tax return or pay taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give $14,000 to a friend , you can do that and neither of you will have to pay taxes . If someone borrows money from you interest free with the intent to repay you later , that is considered an interest free loan and is not subject to taxes either . If you charge interest , then you would have to pay income taxes on the interest earned . <p> Hi Mike ! If your mother gifts you $60k , you will not have to pay any taxes on the amount . However , she will need to file a Gift Tax return when she files her taxes and that $60k will go toward her Lifetime Exemption amount . She will not have to pay taxes on it until she gifts over $5.45 million . Let us know if you have any other questions ! <p> Hi Catherine !

Thank you ! <p> This is certainly an interesting scenario . And , in this case , while we cant speak for the IRS , we are fairly confident they will frown upon this type of situation . More than likely , as they review where the money went and discover it ultimately landed with your brother , they will go back to your parents and require them to complete a Gift Tax Return .

While we cant cover all possible situations with one answer , generally money any received through a GoFundMe account is not taxable .

The funds would be used towards our personal debt . Would we have to pay a gift tax ? <p> This sounds like an interesting situation and definitely one we would need to know a few more details about before being able to give a confident answer . However , any money earned through a website is typically considered taxable income and not a gift .

If so , do I have to transfer to their account three separate checks , or is one check for the total amount OK ? <p> You are able to give up to $14,000 to any one individual in one year without being subject to tax .

For example , one source of some of the money told him that he could use it to buy pizza if he wanted . <p> Generally , a scholarship is tax free if you are a student pursuing a degree at an eligible educational institution and meets these requirements : amount received does n't  exceed your qualified education expenses ; it is n't earmarked for other purposes like room , board or pizza and does n't  require that it ca n't be used for qualified education expenses ; and it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to receive the scholarship .

For example , if your mom bought the property for $100,000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is $100,000 . If later you end up selling the home for $300,000 , you then have a taxable gain of $200,000 and will have to pay capital gains tax on that amount . <p> I have read that parents should not put children on the title but should leave it to them in their will . Then the house passes to the child at the current market rate as the new " basis " which is more beneficial when selling the house one day . <p> You 're right . Making the decision to not add your child to the title is often times the better route to go for the children . The higher the basis when the house exchanges hands , the better off the children will be when they go to sell the property later on down the road . <p> You will not be liable for any taxes on the monetary gift . However , your parents may be responsible for a gift tax being that your suggested amount exceeds the annual exclusion amount of $14,000 for tax year 2016 . Your parents will need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make sure they are in compliance with those rules and guidelines . <p> my dad sold his condo and wants to give me half of the proceeds to help me pay some of my bills . The other half of the proceeds is going to help him buy a house with himself and my brother for them to share . Do I have to pay taxes on that money ? <p> You will not have to pay a gift tax on the amount your dad gives you . However , its important for your dads gift to not exceed the annual exclusion amount of $14,000 for tax year 2016 if he wants to avoid being subject to a gift tax on the amount he gives you . <p> My dad paid cash for an auction house for my family . He put the house under my husband and my name . We plan on taking out a mortgage to repay him the cash he put down . But , now the house is in our names and shows that it was paid with cash by us and we also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will happen when we do taxes ? Do we have to pay any kind of extra fees ? Feeling very confused ? ? <p> In this case , your dad would likely need to file a gift tax return if the house value is more than $14,000 . And being that you already technically own the home , you may not be able to take out a traditional mortgage . Using a home equity line of credit ( HELOC ) is an option to pay back your father and the interest on the HELOC will be tax deductible similar to a mortgage . There will not be any other fees or taxes related to this item on your tax return . However , we would suggest consulting with your loan provider first before making any decisions to discuss your options and determine the best fit for your situation . <p> You are not liable for any tax on the gift , however your mom will want to make sure she files a gift tax return when she files next tax season . She is responsible for the taxes associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion , she will not have to pay any tax until she has given over $5.43 million* . <p> my son incurred 125000 in bail and legal fees , my parents gave the money to me to dispurse to him <p> my parents file joint taxes and paid taxes on this money . I file joint taxes with my wife and our combined income is about 85000. my son ( with legal problems / 19 going on twenty and living at home no going to college yet ) and daughter ( senior in highschool ) are dependents . 56000 could be claimed as a gift <p> can i receive $14000 from more than 1 family member without having to pay taxes . I am in the process of buying a house and my dad was going to give me $14000 and my brother $14000 for the down payment . Would I have pay taxes since it is coming from 2 different family members ? <p> You would not have to pay any taxes whatsoever on any gift received . The only people who would have to worry about taxes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have to pay or file a gift tax return because they are allowed to give up to $14,000 per person per year in 2015 . The number of family members giving you a gift has no importance whatsoever . <p> What , if any , taxes are to be paid on money given to workers from the owner each week during the year and for year after year . Personal checks are written for $300-$3,000 a week to some of the more than a dozen females . Much is supposedly for needs like a new motorcycle for the husband of one , new TV for others and some just go on vacations and buy jewelry . Not related with any of them and prefers to use them for groping . It is hard for me to believe these minimum wage girls are buying new cars , dressing nice , I phones etc. when they make min. on 35 40 hours a week . Loophole or a week IRS ? <p> My Parents live in israel and i live in nyc they want to transfer me money as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " report " my self so i do n't  have problem later on i need to point out i 'm currently on green card but already in process to become citizen thank you in advance <p> That is correct Mary , but that is the limit per year per person . You also get a lifetime exemption of $5.43 million in case you happen to go over that $14,000 threshold . If you do go over the $14,000 , you must file a gift tax return . The likelihood of you paying any gift tax though is slim because of the lifetime exemption . <p> My Grandmother , whom is still alive , set up paperwork to where my MOM receives the profit from the sale of her condo- which sold two years ago , and was 180,000 . The tax preparer had to consult a supervisor , etc , and they said they do n't  think that the gift means that Mom owes taxes on it- but they said something about the " five year " period of time , which DID pass- being the reason that the inheritance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is n't an " audit " but is asking for proof of this or that- but does n't  say anything about the inheritance- but asks for other proofs such as the " circuit breaker " Senior credit proof .

@@12200459 @800459/ <p> No matter how large the transaction , or how much money you received as a result of the sale , you wait until you file your income tax return to report the sale to the IRS . <p> However , that does n't mean you do n't need to do anything until next year . In fact , it could be an expensive mistake if you wait until you prepare your tax return to plan for any tax on capital gains . <p> It 's very important when you sell an asset to determine if you need to make estimated tax payments or otherwise plan for the tax consequences of the sale . <h> Why worry about estimated tax payments ? <p> The IRS may require you to make quarterly estimated tax payments if you have substantial income , such as that from the sale of an asset , not subject to withholding . <p> For tax year 2015 , you may need to make quarterly payments if you owe more than $1,000 when you prepare your tax return , and your withholding and refundable credits are less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your tax for the previous year . <p> If you do n't make estimated tax payments , you could face penalties and interest charges on the amount of tax you should have paid during the year . <h> Will you pay additional taxes as a result of capital gains ? <p> The first thing you need to know is if your tax bill will go up as a result of the sale . If you did n't have a substantial gain , the sale may not affect your taxes much . <p> For example , if you sold an asset , no matter how valuable it was , for less or little more than you paid for it , there 's little to worry about . <p> Perhaps the easiest way to find out if you owe more money as a result of selling an asset is to run next year 's tax numbers using TaxAct 's tax calculator . <p> Answer all the questions based on your expectations for the entire year . It 's alright to estimate . As you work , you 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due in the upper right corner of your screen . <h> How else can I estimate the tax on a capital asset ? <p> Another way to quickly determine how much tax you 'll pay on a sale is to estimate the gain based on your tax rate . <p> If you sell a capital asset you owned for one year or less , you will pay tax at your ordinary income tax rate . <p> For example , say you sold stock at a profit of $10,000 . You held the stock for six months . If your federal income tax rate is 25 percent , you 'll owe about $2,500 in tax on your short-term capital gain . <p> If you had the same $10,000 profit , but you held the asset for more than one year , the tax rate is lower . <p> If you are in the 25 percent tax bracket , for example , your tax rate on long-term capital gains is only 15 percent . You only owe $1,500 in capital gains tax . <p> In that case , the entire gain is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is now in a higher bracket . <p> Consider an example where a taxpayer is in the 15 percent marginal tax bracket before any capital gains . The taxpayer then sells a parcel of land that is considered to be a capital asset at a significantly greater value than the taxpayer 's basis in the land . The taxpayer will have to recognize a capital gain from the sale of the land . <p> If the capital gain is $50,000 , this amount may push the taxpayer into the 25 percent marginal tax bracket . In this instance , the taxpayer would pay 0 percent of capital gains tax on the amount of capital gain that fit into the 15 percent marginal tax bracket . <p> The remaining portion of the capital gain that pushes the taxpayer into the 25 marginal tax bracket is then subject to a 15 percent capital gains tax . <h> When to make estimated tax payments <p> You should generally pay the capital gains tax you expect to owe before the due date for payments that apply to the quarter of the sale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter , June 15 for second quarter , September 15 for third quarter and January 15 of the following year for the fourth quarter . When a due date falls on a weekend or holiday , your quarterly payment is due the following business day . <p> Even if you are not required to make estimated tax payments , you may want to pay the capital gains tax shortly after the salewhile you still have the profit in hand . <h> Making quarterly estimated tax payments <p> You can use TaxAct to determine your quarterly payments and print out a quarterly payment voucher . You 'll need to print the voucher , attach a check or money order and mail it to the IRS before the due date . <p> Another option is to use Electronic Funds Withdraw ( EFW ) to have a payment deducted from your bank account automatically . You can set this up using TaxAct software . <p> The IRS also has a phone system and Internet site that accepts payments by credit or debit card . Unfortunately , there is an additional convenience fee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated taxes and other payments regularly , it 's worth the time required to set up an account with the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System ( EFTPS ) , which is a service provided for free by the U.S. Department of Treasury . If you wish to use EFTPS , its always best to plan ahead . <h> Alternatives to making estimated tax payments <p> Instead of making estimated tax payments , you may choose to increase your income tax withholding to cover the additional tax . <p> Another strategy is to plan other tax events to counteract the effect of the capital gains tax . <p> For example , you may want to sell an asset that has gone down in value , make a business investment or contribute to charity during the same year as the sale . Losses on investments are first used to offset capital gains , which means the less tax you 'll pay on the capital gain . <p> However , it 's important to note , losses can only be deducted against capital gains of the same nature . For example , short-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Additionally , you can only deduct up to $3000 of net long-term capital losses in a given tax year . Any excess net long-term capital losses can be carried forward until there is sufficient capital gain income or the $3000 net long-term capital loss limitation is exhausted . <p> If you 've sold an asset recently , did you plan for the tax consequences before you made the sale ? @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325

@@12200463 @800463/ <h> Investments and Taxes <h> Share This <p> Many of your returns from investments are treated favorably under the tax law . For example , if you sell a long-term capital asset , such as stock , you may pay less than half as much tax on any gain as you would pay on the same amount of wages . Not only is the capital gain not subject to payroll taxes , but it is taxed at a lower rate than you pay on ordinary income . <p> To take advantage of the tax benefits for certain investments , you need to understand a few rules . <h> Length of Time You Hold an Asset <p> The length of time you hold an asset can make a big difference in how much tax you pay on any gain . If you own a stock for 11 months , for example , you pay ordinary income tax rates on the gain - 25% for many taxpayers . <p> If you hold that stock a little longer - over the one-year mark - you pay the capital gains rate of 15% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains tax rate may be 20% , 15% , or even 0% . High-income taxpayers are subject to an additional 3.8% capital gains tax . ) <h> Wash Sale <p> Wash sale rules are another case where you need to know the rules - before you sell stocks and buy them back again . In most cases , if you sell capital assets at a loss , you can deduct that loss against other capital gains or , to a limited extent , against ordinary income . If you buy the same stock back within 30 days before or after the sale , you ca n't take the loss this year . Instead , the loss increases your basis in the new stock . <p> Knowing the rules can help you make better investment decisions . <p> For example , say you are comparing an investment that pays dividends to a deposit account that pays interest . If they pay the same rate , it seems like a toss-up - until you consider that qualified dividends on stock you have owned over 60 days are taxed at 15% , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Interest is taxed at ordinary income tax rates . That makes the dividend paying investment with a comparable return a better deal after you consider taxes . <h> Real Estate Rental Property <p> One investment that has traditionally provided tax benefits is real estate rental property . If you invest in real estate and rent it out , or you convert a former residence to rental property , you probably have many expenses you can deduct against the rental income on your tax return . You can deduct mortgage interest , property taxes , repairs and maintenance , for instance . <p> You can also deduct depreciation expense to account for loss of value of the building ( but not the land ) over time . Because depreciation does n't represent a cash outlay on your part , the depreciation deduction means you could have a tax loss on your real estate rental , even if you do not have a negative cash flow . <p> If you actively participate in the management of the property , you may be able to use a loss of up to $25,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as wages . Be sure to file jointly if you live with your spouse , otherwise you ca n't take this deduction . If you lived apart from your spouse the entire year , you may be able to use a loss of up to $12,500 . <h> Employee Stock Options <p> If your employer offers employee stock options , you may benefit from special tax treatment of these options if you meet the qualifications . <p> If you meet the qualifications , you do n't pay tax until you actually sell the stock , not when you receive or exercise the option . In addition , you effectively convert a benefit from your employer from ordinary income to a capital gain - so you can use the lower capital gains tax rates . <p> The holding periods are different for statutory stock options than for most capital assets . To use the preferential capital gains tax rates , you must wait two years from the option grant date , or one year from the exercise date , to sell the stock . Otherwise , part or all of your gain is taxed as ordinary income .

The entry of days is only used for the calculation of the Vacation Home Limitation Worksheet , if it is necessary , or the determination that there was only minimal rental use . <p> The following information is from IRS Publication 527 , starting on page 17 : <p> Personal Use of Dwelling Unit ( Including Vacation Home ) <p> If you have any personal use of a dwelling unit ( including a vacation home ) that you rent , you must divide your expenses between rental use and personal use . In general , your rental expenses will be no more than your total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the total number of days the dwelling unit is used and the numerator of which is the total number of days actually rented at a fair rental price . Only your rental expenses may deducted on Schedule E ( Form 1040 ) . Some of your personal expenses may be deductible on Schedule A ( Form 1040 ) if you itemize your deductions . <p> You must also determine if the dwelling unit is considered a home . The amount of rental expenses that you can deduct may be limited if the dwelling unit is considered a home . Whether a dwelling unit is considered a home depends on how many days during the year are considered to be days of personal use . There is a special rule if you used the dwelling unit as a home and you rented it for less than 15 days during the year . <p> Dwelling unit . A dwelling unit includes a house , apartment , condominium , mobile home , boat , vacation home , or similar property . It also includes all structures or other property belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as sleeping space , a toilet , and cooking facilities . <p> A dwelling unit does not include property ( or part of the property ) used solely as a hotel , motel , inn , or similar establishment . Property is used solely as a hotel , motel , inn , or similar establishment if it is regularly available for occupancy by paying customers and is not used by an owner as a home during the year . <p> Dwelling Unit Used as Home <p> If you use a dwelling unit for both rental and personal purposes , the tax treatment of the rental expenses you figured earlier under Dividing Expenses and rental income depends on whether you are considered to be using the dwelling unit as a home . <p> You use a dwelling unit as a home during the tax year if you use it for personal purposes more than the greater of : <p> 14 days , or <p> 10% of the total days it is rented to others at a fair rental price . <p> If a dwelling unit is used for personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental price , do not count that day as a day of rental use in applying ( 2 ) above . Instead , count it as a day of personal use in applying both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) above . <p> What is a day of personal use ? A day of personal use of a dwelling unit is any day that the unit is used by any of the following persons . <p> You or any other person who owns an interest in it , unless you rent it to another owner as his or her main home under a shared equity financing agreement ( defined later ) . However , see Days used as a main home before or after renting , later . <p> A member of your family or a member of the family of any other person who owns an interest in it , unless the family member uses the dwelling unit as his or her main home and pays a fair rental price . Family includes only your spouse , brothers and sisters , half-brothers and half-sisters , ancestors ( parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , grandchildren , etc . ) . <p> Anyone under an arrangement that let 's you use some other dwelling unit . <p> Anyone at less than a fair rental price . <p> Main home . If the other person or member of the family in ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) above has more than one home , his or her main home is ordinarily the one he or she lived in most of the time . <p> Days used for repairs and maintenance . Any day that you spend working substantially full time repairing and maintaining ( not improving ) your property is not counted as a day of personal use . Do not count such a day as a day of personal use even if family members use the property for recreational purposes on the same day . <p> Minimal rental use . If you use the dwelling unit as a home and you rent it less than 15 days during the year , that period is not treated as rental activity . See Used as a home but rented less than 15 days , later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renting a dwelling unit that is considered a home is not a passive activity . Instead , if your rental expenses are more than your rental income , some or all of the excess expenses can not be used to offset income from other sources . The excess expenses that can not be used to offset income from other sources are carried forward to the next year and treated as rental expenses for the same property . Any expenses carried forward to the next year will be subject to any limits that apply for that year . This limitation will apply to expenses carried forward to another year even if you do not use the property as your home for that subsequent year . <p> To figure your deductible rental expenses for this year and any carryover to next year , use Worksheet 5-1 . <p> Reporting Income and Deductions <p> Property not used for personal purposes . If you do not use a dwelling unit for personal purposes , see chapter 3 for how to report your rental income and expenses . <p> Property used personal purposes .

It is used much like a credit card . A line of credit is considered a short-term fix , and interest and fees can be high . Thus , they are best utilized in cases of temporary cash flow issues , not for capital improvements , expansion , or business acquisition . <p> Alternative financing. - Non-bank lending products include merchant cash advances that are repaid as a percentage of daily credit card receipts . These generally are short-term loans at very high interest rates , as much as 30 to 40 percent .

If you are still in the process of going through a divorce , then you are still considered married .

You can not deduct the costs of getting married or divorced . You can , however , deduct any legal fees you paid for tax advice related to divorce and any legal fees you paid to receive alimony . <p> Know the rules about alimony and child support .

You must include your former spouse 's Social Security number on your tax return in order to claim the deduction . <p> Save time and money now and next year . If your name has changed , remember the names on your tax return must match the names the Social Security Administration has on file . If the information does not match , the IRS will likely reject your return . <p> Just because your marriage status changes does n't mean you ca n't do your own taxes .

Burt had $7,000 in total qualified expenses . His parents claimed an American Opportunity Credit based on $4,000 of qualified expenses .

Both distributions need to be totaled before being compared to Burtha 's AQEE . <p> TaxAct automatically totals distributions entered in the return . If the student was the beneficiary of any distribution not entered in the return , TaxAct will prompt you to enter this amount after you have entered your 1099-Q information . <p> Since the calculation of taxable earnings is made separately for QTP and ESA distributions , the distributions for each type of program must be totaled separately .

The calculation is made separately for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by total distributions . <p> The ratio determined in Step 1 is multiplied by total distributed earnings .

This is the amount that must be included in income . <p> On whose return is the income included ? <p> The recipient listed on the 1099-Q enters the form in his or her return and therefore should report any taxable income . The beneficiary is listed as the recipient of a QTP distribution when the distribution is made ( 1 ) directly to the beneficiary , or ( 2 ) to an eligible school for the benefit of the beneficiary .

Typically , you 're only responsible to pay tax on the gain . <p> A- gain- is the dollar amount you made on the sale . This is calculated by taking the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset . <p> For example , if you bought one ounce of gold years ago at $300 , and you sell it at $1,200 , you have a gain of $900 ( $1,200 " $300 = $900 ) . <h> What 's a tax basis ? <p> The amount you originally paid for an asset is generally your tax basis . <p> However , in some cases it 's more complicated . <p> If you take depreciation deductions for the asset , your tax basis is reduced by the deductions . A lower tax basis means a higher taxable gain when you sell . <p> On the flip side , if you make improvements to the asset , the amount you spend increases your tax basis . <p> For example , if you have a rental house and add a deck to it , the amount you spend on the deck increases your tax basis . <p> Your tax basis adjusted for depreciation deductions , improvements and any other adjustments is called your- adjusted basis . <p> This is the amount you use to determine if you have a capital gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital asset ? <p> Most personal items you own , such as a car , investments or real estate , are capital assets . <p> If you own a business , all business assets are not considered capital assets .

@@12200527 @800527/ <h> Pros and Cons of Refinancing Your Home <p> The decision to refinance your home can be a tough one . Not only can the process of refinancing seem like a lot of work , it 's often hard to know who to trust as some lender 's advertised offers sound too good to be true . But , if you find a- low mortgage rate , refinancing your home may be one deal that 's too good to pass up . <p> Here 's a few things to consider when determining if refinancing is a smart move for you . <h> Pro #1 : You may lower your current mortgage interest rate . <p> Typically , this is the main motivator behind refinancing . If you originally got your mortgage when interest rates were high , and you 've never refinanced , you may be paying more than you need to . Taking the time to apply for a new loan at a lower rate could save you hundreds of dollars a month . <p> For example , if you have a $200,000 loan and are paying 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monthly interest and principal payments are probably about $1,331 . If you refinanced at 3.8 percent , your monthly payment could be reduced to $932 . That 's a monthly savings of $399 ! <h> Pro #2 : You may be able to pay off other debts or get cash . <p> If your home is worth substantially more than the amount you owe , you may choose to take out a larger mortgage when you refinance . The cash you get back could be used to pay off car loans , credit cards or any other debt you may have . In some instances , this can be a good strategy if the debt you 're trying to pay off has high interest rates . <p> However , be careful not to overdo it or to habitually refinance your home every time the credit card balances get too high . It 's hard to pay off your house if you keep borrowing money from your equity . <h> Pro #3 : Refinance an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate loan . <p> An adjustable-rate mortgage ( ARM ) often comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loan . But over the life of the loan , the interest rate " and your mortgage payment " can increase significantly . <p> When interest rates are low , refinancing your ARM for a fixed-rate mortgage may make sense " and it means your interest rates and payments are constant " even if interest rates skyrocket down the road . Knowing what your mortgage payment will be every month can help with budgeting and money management . <h> Con #1 : Refinancing can be expensive . <p> Before you get started , make sure you know how much it will cost to refinance . Generally , refinancing costs between 3 and 6 percent of the loan 's principal . Therefore , it 's important not to be tempted to spend too much money refinancing if you know you wo n't live in the home long enough to recoup the costs . <p> Ask yourself these questions before moving forward : how long do I plan to live in this house ? How much money will I save by refinancing ? The answers to these questions will help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Refinancing is n't always easy . <p> Many people find it very time-consuming to refinance . Expect to spend hours , or even days , gathering information and paperwork for your loan application . <p> Additionally , if something has changed in your financial life , such as your career or the amount of debt you carry , you may not be able to get a loan at the rate you expected . <h> Con #3 : You may not be able to deduct your entire mortgage interest expense after refinancing . <p> If you refinance your home for the same amount you already owed on your mortgage , you can keep taking a mortgage interest deduction as always . The same applies if you take out a slightly larger loan to pay off some bills . As long as you itemize deductions on your tax return , you generally can deduct your total mortgage interest expense . <p> However , your deduction may be limited if you refinance and get a substantial amount of cash back .

If you are married or claim dependents on your return , you get additional exemptions and a bigger deduction from income . For 2013 , you are allowed to deduct $3,900 for each exemption claimed on your federal return . <p> There are two types of exemptions : personal exemptions and dependent exemptions . We 'll explain the two types of exemptions and also answer some questions you might have . <p> Personal Exemptions <p> You can generally claim one exemption for yourself . If you are married and file a joint return , you can also claim one exemption for your spouse . In certain situations , you may be allowed to claim your spouse 's exemption on a separate return . <p> Can I claim my spouse as a dependent ? <p> You can not claim your spouse as a dependent .

The rule applies even if the other person does not actually claim you . <p> Dependent Exemptions <p> You can claim one exemption for each person claimed as a dependent on your return but several tests must be met in order to claim someone as a dependent . If you are not sure whether you can claim someone as a dependent , use the interactive Dependent Quiz in TaxAct 's Federal Q&amp;A to guide you through the IRS rules . <p> Does my dependent have to file a return ? <p> A separate return must be filed for a dependent if filing requirements are met .

Several other factors must also be taken into account , such as age , filing status and any special taxes that may apply . <p> Can I enter my dependent 's income on my return ? <p> You generally can not include your dependent 's income on your return . An exception to this rule allows you to include the dependent 's investment income on your return in certain situations . Investment income for this exception includes interest , dividends and capital gain distributions . <p> Claiming Exemptions on Your Return <p> With TaxAct , your exemptions are calculated automatically as you complete your return .

According to a recent ORC International Survey conducted for TaxAct , 45 percent of American taxpayers plan to invest their tax refund in a general savings or retirement/investment account . Similarly , about half of millennials plan to do the same . The survey also revealed that a quarter of working American taxpayers will adjust their withholdings based on this year 's refund . <p> " It 's great that Americans are applying their refund to savings , but by not taking a close look at their withholdings throughout the year , many of them are giving the government an interest-free loan , " said Sanjay Baskaran , president of TaxAct .

" These scams can end up costing taxpayers more in penalties , back taxes and interest than they saved in the first place . " <p> The IRS continues to address those using abusive shelters through audits , litigation , published guidance and legislation . <p> Tax law generally allows businesses to create " captive " insurance companies to protect against certain risks .

For example , coverages may insure implausible risks , fail to match genuine business needs or duplicate the taxpayer 's commercial coverages . Premium amounts may be unsupported by underwriting or actuarial analysis , may be geared to a desired deduction amount or may be significantly higher than premiums for comparable commercial coverage . <p> Policies may contain vague , ambiguous or deceptive terms and otherwise fail to meet industry or regulatory standards .

@@12200688 @800688/ <h> How a Summer Job Affects Your Taxes <p> A summer job is a great way to add some extra money- to your bank account . Whether you 're a cash-strapped college student , a teacher trying to stay- busy during the summer months or simply have some extra time on your hands , racking up those part time hours can really pay-off . <p> However , before you go out and celebrate with all the money you 've made , its important to understand your obligations to Uncle Sam . If your only income for the year is from part-time , summer work , there 's a good chance you may not- owe too much in taxes . But , if you earned income throughout the rest of the year , you 'll want to make sure you 're prepared come tax filing season . <p> To help you get prepared , there are- three types of tax you 'll want to pay most attention to : <p> Social Security and Medicare tax ( often called FICA ) <p> Federal Income tax <p> State Income tax <p> Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Social Security and Medicare tax <p> Your employer will automatically deduct Social Security and Medicare taxes from each of your- paychecks . The Federal Insurance Contributions Act , or better known as FICA , is a federal law that requires employers to withhold these two taxes from your wages each pay period . <p> But , on a good note , your employer also kicks in half for your Social Security and Medicare tax payments . <p> If you are self-employed , meaning you work as an independent contractor or for- your own business , you will need to set aside money to pay your taxes. - That money should include Social Security and Medicare tax , which is lumped together and called " self-employment tax . " - Self-employment tax- for 2016 is 15.3%- on the first $118,500 of net income and then 2.9% on the net income that is in excess of $118,500 . <p> Be sure to keep track of all your expenses because- you can deduct them from income before paying Self-Employment tax . <p> While the average- taxpayer is subject to Social Security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule . For example , if you 're under age 18 and perform household work , such as babysitting or yard work , you do n't  have to pay Self-Employment tax . The same goes for newspaper carriers , distributors and vendors . <p> And , if Mom and Dad hire you to work in- their business , there 's a good chance you may not have to pay Social Security and Medicare tax , either . However , to meet this exception , you must be under age 18 , and your parents ' business must be a sole proprietorship or partnership , not a corporation . <h> Federal Income tax <p> Another important tax to be aware of is the Federal Income tax . This tax is levied by the IRS and based on your taxable annual- income . However , in some cases , this tax does not apply to everyone . <p> If you 're a single student being claimed as a dependent on your parents tax return , you can generally earn up to $6,300 ( in 2016 ) before you owe federal income tax . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the next $9,275 you earn . After you pass the $15,475- mark ( $6,300 + $9,075 ) , the rates are higher . <h> State Income tax <p> Unless you live in one of the seven states that do n't  have income tax , you 'll have to pay- state income tax- too . <p> State income tax varies in respect to tax rates , how they- are applied , the types of income that is taxable and what- deductions and credits are allowed . However , it is usually less than Federal Income tax . <p> If you are only working during the summer , you may qualify for a tax exemption , meaning- your employer will not withhold income tax- from your paycheck . This only applies if you made less than $6,300 . And , keep in mind , - an exemption- does not extend to- Social Security and Medicare taxes . <p> In order to qualify for a tax exemption , you must meet specific criteria . To claim exempt , you must have received a refund of all income tax withheld from your paycheck in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the current year . If you meet both of those criteria , you can- mark " EXEMPT " on line 7 of Form W-4 . Typically your employer will ask you to complete Form W-4 when you start working . This form is used to notify your employer how much tax they should withhold from your pay . <p> If there 's any chance you may earn more than $6,300 during the year , you will- then owe income tax . In that case , its better to have income tax withheld from each paycheck . It 's a lot easier to have money withheld now than to come up with it next year when filing your tax return . <h> Do I- need to file an income tax return ? <p> If you do n't  make more than $6,300 as an employee , you generally do n't  have to file a tax return . However , if you had income tax withheld from your paychecks , you 'll want to- file- return- in order to get that money back . <p> If you run your own business and make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your tax return and- pay self-employment tax , unless you qualify for one of the exceptions . @qwx180326 @qwx180320 @qwx180325 <p> Yes , there is no age limit as long as they have earned income .

@@12200707 @800707/ <p> WASHINGTON The Internal Revenue Service and partners from the states and tax industry today reminded taxpayers that the nation 's 2017 individual income tax filing season opens Jan. 23 . <p> The IRS expects more than 153 million tax returns to be filed this year and taxpayers have until Tuesday , April 18 , 2017 , to file their 2016 tax returns and pay any tax due . The deadline is extended because the Emancipation Day , a holiday in Washington , D.C. , will be observed on Monday , April 17 , pushing the nation 's filing deadline to April 18 . <p> " There are a number of important changes this year involving refunds and tax law changes that we encourage people to keep in mind , " said IRS Commissioner John Koskinen . " We encourage taxpayers to plan ahead and take a few minutes to review these changes . As we enter the filing season , taxpayers should know that the dedicated workforce of the IRS and the nation 's tax community stand ready to help . " <p> Taxpayers that are e-filing can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They will hold the return and transmit it to the IRS when the systems open . The IRS also reminds taxpayers that they do n't have to wait until Jan. 23 to contact their tax professional . <p> In 2016 , the IRS issued 111 million individual tax refunds and expects more than 70 percent of taxpayers to receive a refund in 2017 . Also , the IRS reminds taxpayers that a new law requires the IRS to hold refunds claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit ( EITC ) and the Additional Child Tax Credit ( ACTC ) until Feb. 15 . " We encourage taxpayers to file as they normally would , including returns claiming the EITC or ACTC " Koskinen said . " The IRS and the nation 's tax community are committed to making this another smooth filing season . " <p> e-File and Free File <p> More than four out of five returns are expected to be filed electronically , with a similar proportion of refunds issued through direct deposit . The IRS encourages taxpayers to plan ahead and take advantage of the online resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for refunds remains the fastest and safest way to file an accurate income tax return and receive a refund . The IRS anticipates issuing more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days from the time returns are received . <p> The IRS Free File program , available at IRS.gov , opens Friday , Jan. 13 . Commercial partners of the IRS offer free brand-name software to about 100 million individuals and families with incomes of $64,000 or less . Seventy percent of the nation 's taxpayers are eligible for IRS Free File . <p> All taxpayers regardless of income will again have access to free online fillable forms , which provide electronic versions of IRS paper forms to complete and file . This option is available through IRS.gov and is free . <p> Protecting Taxpayers from ID-Theft-Related Refund Fraud <p> The IRS continues to work with state tax authorities and the tax industry to address tax-related identity theft and refund fraud . As part of the Security Summit , the IRS made significant inroads against fraudulent returns in 2016 . While working to stop the issuance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate refunds as quickly as possible in 2017 . Thus far , Summit efforts have led to a 50 percent decline in the number of new reports of stolen identities on federal tax returns . Late last year , Summit leaders detailed new and expanded safeguards for taxpayers in the upcoming 2017 tax season . The 2017 focus revolves around " trusted customer " features that will help ensure the authenticity of the taxpayer and the tax return - before , during and after a tax return is filed . The additional protections will build on the 2016 successes that prevented fraudulent returns and protected tax refunds . <p> Health Care Basics <p> Again this year , meeting the tax obligation of the Affordable Care Act for the vast majority of taxpayers will simply mean checking a box to verify everyone on their return has health coverage . For others , IRS.gov/aca features useful information , tips and interactive online tools to help taxpayers with the premium tax credit , the individual shared responsibility requirement and other tax-related provisions of the ACA . <p> More than 90 percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This software generally includes tax law help along with reminders and prompts about tax breaks and responsibilities . <p> The IRS urges all taxpayers to make sure they have all their year-end statements in hand before they file their return . This includes Forms W-2 from employers , Forms 1099 from banks and other payers , and for those claiming the premium tax credit , Form 1095-A from the Marketplace . Doing so will help avoid refund delays and the need to file an amended return later . <p> Delayed Refunds <p> The IRS expects to issue more than nine out of 10 refunds in less than 21 days . However , the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes ( PATH ) Act mandates the IRS hold refunds on tax returns claiming the EITC or the Additional Child Tax Credit ( ACTC ) until mid-February . The change helps ensure that taxpayers get the refund they are owed by giving the IRS more time to help detect and prevent tax fraud . <p> The IRS will begin releasing EITC and ACTC refunds starting Feb. 15 , but cautions taxpayers that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on debit cards until the week of Feb. 27 . The IRS wants taxpayers to know it will take additional time for their refunds to be processed and for financial institutions to accept and deposit the refunds to bank accounts . The IRS reminds taxpayers many financial institutions do not process payments on weekends or holidays , which can affect when refunds reach taxpayers . For EITC and ACTC filers , the three-day holiday weekend involving President 's Day may affect their refund timing . <p> Where 's My Refund ? on IRS.gov and the IRS2Go phone app will be updated with projected deposit dates for early EITC and ACTC refund filers a few days after Feb. 15 . Taxpayers will not see a refund date on Where 's My Refund ? or through their software packages until then . The IRS , tax preparers and tax software will not have additional information on refund dates , so Where 's My Refund ? remains the best way to check the status of a refund . <p> Expired Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers ( ITIN ) <p> The PATH Act requires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ITIN not used on a tax return at least once in the past three years and any ITIN with middle digits of either 78 or 79 ( 9NN-78-NNNN or 9NN-79-NNNN ) must be renewed before a return can be processed . Anyone filing a tax return with an expired ITIN could experience return processing and refund delay as well as denial of some tax benefits until the ITIN is renewed . <p> An ITIN renewal application could take as long as 11 weeks to process during tax filing season . ITINs are used by people who have tax-filing or payment obligations under U.S. law but are not eligible for a Social Security number . <p> Help for Taxpayers <p> The IRS reminds taxpayers they have a variety of options to get help filing and preparing their tax return on IRS.gov . Volunteer Income Tax Assistance ( VITA ) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly ( TCE ) offer free tax help to people who qualify .

If you work in your home , you may be able to take an employee expenses deduction or a business deduction for a home office . <p> You can only take a deduction for a home office if you use an area in your home regularly and exclusively for business . It must be your principal place of business or a place you meet with clients , or it can be used in connection with your business if it is a separate structure not attached to your personal residence , such as a shop . <p> With the simplified option launched in 2013 , you can deduct $5 per square foot ( up to 300 square feet and with a $1,500 limit ) . This option greatly reduces time spent on paperwork and tracking expenses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home office must also be for your employer 's convenience - not yours . <p> If you can deduct expenses for a home office , you can deduct a proportionate amount of all indirect expenses for your home , including mortgage interest , real estate taxes , rent , utilities , and so on . <p> If you are using the simplified method of reporting the deduction , you list these deductions on Schedule A , but you do not need to allocate them to business or personal use . Unlike the regular reporting method , the simplified option does not allow you to depreciate the portion of your home used to conduct your business . <h> Employee Expenses <p> If you are an employee , you may also be able to deduct unreimbursed travel and transportation costs , supplies , uniforms , and other expenses . Employee expenses must be significant before they actually lower your tax bill . You can only deduct your employee expenses to the extent that they exceed 2% of your adjusted gross income , and only if you itemize your deductions . <h> Self-Employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ordinary and necessary expenses for your trade or business . Some expenses , such as the cost of inventory or business equipment , may not be deductible in full in the year you pay them .

TaxAct also calculates depreciation or first-year expensing for business assets you acquire . <p> If you pay people in the course of your business , it 's important to correctly determine if they are independent contractors , or if they are really employees . <p> The IRS uses common law rules to determine if a worker is an employee or an independent contractor . Revenue Ruling 87-41 contains 20 of these rules you should take into consideration . <p> According to these rules , a person is likely to be an independent contractor if he or she requires little training , and has latitude over how the job is completed . An independent contractor is less likely to have a temporary relationship , to provide tools and supplies , and to work for more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employee if he or she is an integral part of the business and works only for one company . If an employee has travel or other expenses , the employer is more likely to reimburse them . Employees generally have set work hours and work on the employer 's premises . <p> It 's easier to write a check to independent contractors , rather than dealing with the paperwork that comes with hiring employees . However , it 's important to classify employees or contractors correctly , to avoid reclassification by the IRS . If the IRS reclassifies a worker at some later date , you will be liable for back payroll taxes , plus penalties and interest . <h> Travel Expenses <p> If you travel for your business or as an employee , you can generally take a deduction for your travel expenses . Your trip must be for longer than a day - even a long day . Your duties must require you to be away from home long enough for you to need rest , generally meaning overnight . <p> Besides airplane or bus tickets , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you took to the airport or from the airport to your hotel . You can also deduct any costs for getting your business materials , e.g. , exhibit booth or conference materials , to your destination , and your actual car or truck expenses or the standard mileage rate , in most cases . <p> You can also deduct the cost of meals and lodging while you travel , although you generally can only deduct 50% of the cost of your meals . <p> Miscellaneous expenses while traveling add up .

Yes , it saves you money , but only if you spend your money on things that you were going to buy anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example that your favorite shampoo is on sale for 60% off , pick 5 or so and you 're set for a few months to a year ( depending on how much hair you have ) , and you just saved yourself money , but say you see a type of juice for sale for 70% off , but you do n't  drink juice . Well , in that case you just wasted money . <p> Just because something is on sale does n't  mean that it 's a smart investment . <p> Less time in the stores . OK , so this is not as clear so I 'll explain . Initially you spend a ton of time starting your stockpile , but once you have all the basics , you do n't  need to make last minute trips thus cutting down on your shopping time . <p> You are prepared for emergencies .

If you 're single , you can make things last a lot longer than if you have a family . <p> I see people get carried away all the time . They buy way more than they will ever use and eventually get sick of making the same thing . <p> Stockpilling food is an art and a science , and finding the balance is key . <h> How to get started ? <p> Figure out how long you need your stockpile to last .

This is very important . I recommend $5-$20 per week for stockpiling ( more , if you can afford it ) . Do n't  go over this budgeted amount . If you do , your savings will go up in smoke . <p> If you do n't  use all of your " stockpile allowance " in one week , carry it over to the next week .

But when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the ACA 's constitutionality last year , it gave states the right to opt out of Medicaid expansion . That means eight million people who could have been covered could be left stranded without coverage . <p> Medicaid is n't the only avenue available to low-income Americans seeking to get covered through the ACA . Some low-income households will be able to buy subsidized commercial insurance policies through the new health insurance marketplaces . <h> Here 's a look at how the ACA will affect low income Americans . <h> Subsidized Coverage Offered in Marketplaces <p> For many Americans , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reduced by federal subsidies . <p> Eligibility and amounts are based on the cost of marketplace premiums and your household size and income . In 2014 , the subsidies are available for individuals with annual income between $11,490 and $45,960 ; for a family of four , they cover households with incomes ranging $23,550 to $94,200 . <p> The definition of income used here is modified adjusted gross income ( MAGI ) , which includes wages , salary , foreign income , interest , dividends and Social Security benefits . <p> One type of subsidy , the advanced premium tax credits , will be applied upfront as an adjustment to premium costs and paid directly to the insurance company . If you elect to receive a lesser credit or no credit at all , you can claim the refundable credit on your 2014 tax return ( due April 2015 ) . <p> Plans with the higher premiums will have lower out-of-pocket costs . Bronze plans , on average , will cover 60 percent of enrollee costs , with the rest covered by deductibles and coinsurance . Gold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectively . <p> If you do n't think you 'll be in a position to cover high out-of-pocket costs in the event of a health emergency , your goal should be to get the most coverage that you can afford . <p> The HealthcareACT.com subsidy calculator can give you an idea of your premium tax credit eligibility . And the Financial Samurai blog offers a series of helpful charts showing insurance premium costs for various household sizes and incomes for Silver plans . <p> For example , a family of four with income of $50,000 receiving the premium tax credit would pay an annual premium of $3,365 ; an individual making $25,000 with the credit would pay $1,729 annually . <p> Some low-income people will qualify for additional cost-sharing subsidies . The ACA reduces deductibles , copayments , coinsurance and total out-of-pocket spending for people with income below 250 percent of the federal poverty level ( FPL ) . <p> The reductions will help people who expect a high amount of spending to bump up to a higher-priced metal tier . Click here for details on this extra help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ACA , Medicaid served only children , parents , pregnant women , people with disabilities and seniors ; starting in 2014 , it 's available to any adult with income below the law 's threshold . <p> The law also creates a national definition for the income qualifications for Medicaid in states that accept the ACA expansion of the program ; prior to the law 's passage , definitions were set by states , and they could vary quite a bit . <p> Twenty-six states are moving ahead with Medicaid expansion next year . To find out what 's going on in your state , check this status report , which is updated regularly by the Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> In states that accepted the expansion , Medicaid will cover adults with income up to 133 percent of the FPL . The 2014 definitions wo n't be announced until early next year , but this year that translated into $15,282 for an individual . <p> In states that are n't expanding Medicaid , many low-income uninsured adults will be uncovered . <p> However , low-income adults with incomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for subsidies to help purchase private policies through the health insurance marketplaces . <p> But people with incomes below that level are n't eligible for the subsidies . That creates a perverse outcome : in some states , people will be denied access to health insurance because their income is too low . <h> Enrollment Help <p> Does all this sound complicated ? <p> That 's because it is and the problems have been amplified by the technical trouble surrounding the launch of the federal health insurance marketplace Healthcare.gov . <p> In-person assistance will be available from health centers around the country that have been awarded grants by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to hire and train " navigators .

If only that were as simple as remembering what you paid for the asset . <h> Here are 7 questions and answers about cost basis to help you finish your return accurately and quickly . <h> When do I need to know the cost basis in an asset ? <p> You 'll need the cost basis in an asset when you claim a credit or another tax break based on the asset , or when you deduct depreciation on the asset . <p> You 'll also need to know your cost basis when you sell or trade an asset in order to determine your gain or loss on the sale or the basis in a new asset acquired by trade . <h> How can I find the original cost basis of something I purchased ? <p> Look for your receipt or other record of the purchase , such as a credit card statement or cancelled check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing papers . For stocks and other securities , look for your brokerage statement . <p> If you purchased stocks on or after January 1 , 2011 , your brokerage keeps track of the stock basis for you . For mutual funds and similar investments , they keep track of your purchases on or after January 1 , 2012 . <p> If you purchased securities before these dates , look for your brokerage statements for the year you purchased the stock . You may also be able to find information online , or you can call your broker . <h> Does cost basis include sales tax and shipping ? <p> Sales tax and shipping are considered to be part of the cost of an item . <h> What if I inherited an asset ? <p> When you inherit something , whether its a car , real estate , or a mutual fund , your basis is generally the value of the property on the date of the persons death . If its gone up in value since that date and you sell it , you may have a gain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use an alternate date , your cost basis is the fair market value on that alternate date . Ask the personal representative if you 're not sure . <p> Special rules may apply to inherited farmland or a closely held business , or if the person died in 2010 . <h> I had a trade-in when I bought this car . What 's my basis ? <p> If you trade in a car or truck , your basis in the new vehicle is your basis in the old one , plus the amount you paid with the trade in . <p> For example , let 's say you have a car with a basis of $2,000 . You trade it in for a new car , and you pay $20,000 cash . The basis in your new car is $22,000 ( $2,000 + 20,000 = $22,000 ) . <h> I sold mutual fund shares last year . Do I need to adjust my basis ? <p> When you own mutual funds , you may pay tax on reinvested dividends and capital gains while you hold the funds . You do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sell the mutual fund shares . <p> Be sure you increase your mutual fund shares basis by the amount of any dividends and gains on which youve paid tax . <h> What are some other reasons I may need to adjust my cost basis ? <p> If the stock splits , and you sell less than 100% of your shares of a stock , you 'll need to adjust your cost basis for the split so you can correctly calculate your cost basis . The same is true if the stock has a reverse split . <p> To adjust your cost basis for depreciation , look at your tax returns , starting with the year you purchased an asset . Add together all the depreciation taken for the asset , and reduce your basis by that amount . <h> I only sold some of my stock in a company , which I bought at different times and at different prices .

This may not be the best tax result for you . <p> If you 'd rather sell other stocks from a particular company , you must tell your broker ahead of time . You must also get a confirmation from your broker saying which stocks you sold . <p> Do you keep receipts for major purchases in a folder or other designated place ? @qwx180326 @qwx180325
