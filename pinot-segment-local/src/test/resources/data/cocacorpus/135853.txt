David left town yesterday and will be gone fishing all week in Alaska ! He went with my dad , brother , and bro in laws . So just me and the kiddies this week ! Kinda excited because my sisters and I just wan na have sleepovers all week haha = I might take the kids on a mini road trip to the mountains too . Atticus won some points tonight when I was editing photos and he kept kissing my face on the computer screen and tickling my back that boy knows how to shmoooze it up = <p> The other day for a Barefoot Blonde Hair photo shoot we got popsicles and this is what I wore !

I think there are more good things this time than any other Anniversary Sale ! <h> Read the Post <p> One of the reasons I am happy to be in Arizona is because I get to see my grandma a lot ! She is such a ray of sunshine . She is so happy all of the time and I always love her little bits of advice on how to be happy . I want to get her on a vlog one day so you guys can hear some of her thoughts because I think you guys would love her too ! She always comments on the clothes I wear and shows my blog to everyone haha ! Anyways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love adding bright colors to my closet . That is why I love Kate Spade pieces I love all of the color ! ! How fun are these shoes ?

A lot of you asked about shopping at Romwe it is a Chinese company ( from what I gather ) and that explains why it takes so long to ship .

I want to do a post from the weekend but do n't  want to rush it so todays post is a round up of some of the outfits I have worn on social media lately . I did a big haul and got tons of stuff $25 and under so I am going to try to include all price points more often !

I know I only cut around 3 inches off but it just feels so good. - Remember a while ago when I dyed my hair pink ? Well the pink would n't fade out so I had to bleach it back and it really damaged my hair in the process . It felt so dry and dead on the ends . I gave myself a little trim then and have been really good to it since but I still needs those three inches gone and I am so glad I finally did . In addition to cutting off my ends I decided to challenge myself to a little summer hair rehab . I was telling my sisters about what I have been doing the last few weeks and they were like , you should make it a challenge and tell your readers ! And I thought it was a cute idea so here I am !

@@98069834 @2269834/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> When I was in college I loved to go to thrift shops to find cool clothes and bags it was my favorite thing finding gems amongst a lot of not so great things . One of my first blog posts was about what I bought at the thrift store that day and I remember that day so clearly because me and my roommate thought we totally scored . David and I also thrifted most of our wedding decorations and used spray paint to make them look a little nicer . When we were first married we would go there and get kitchen stuff I swear thrift stores have the best casserole dishes and we have multiple dishes that we got for like $2 back in the day and still use ! Anyways , I have always thought the hardest part about shopping for secondhand stuff is just digging through everything to find that perfect pair of old cut off Levi 's or awesome dress . <p> thredUP is the largest online resale shop that makes secondhand shopping convenient and easy as you can sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did searches for Rebecca Taylor , J. Crew , Topshop , Madewell , and some other favorite brands and found super cute stuff . I thought I would feature a couple of the pieces I found today ! I got both of these dresses on thredUP as well as a couple cute tee 's and a blouse ( got this J. Crew dress worn as a shirt in this post ) ! I got this Tanvi Kedia dress for only $41.00 ( 78% off retail ) and this dress from Topshop for 22.99 ( 68% off retail ) ! <p> thredUP is offering Barefoot Blond readers a special discount ! The first 100 people to use code BLONDE40 will get an extra 40% off their first order ! ( Applies to new US customers only . Discount up to $50 ) <p> YESSSSS . Thred Up is amazing . Ive been using it SO much recently . Im amazed at the items you can get NWT for 50+% off ! ! Buying second hand is sustainable and does good for the earth reducing waste = I 'm so happy to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in Belgium I recommend you to go to the cities of Ghent and Bruges instead of Brussels . You should google some pictures of both cities it is really one of the prettiest places in Europe ! <p> ah I 've been wanting to try thredUp and love how you can send your clothes too them to sell as well ! I thrifted for most of my wedding decorations too ! It was fun trying to find cute used things that matched <p> I love your new pices ! So summery happy and colorful looking = And the pictures are super beautiful as well , so flowery and perfect for taking pictures in summery dresses = I especially love the violet T-Shirt Dress because it looks so comfy and perfect for every day ! = <p> Love this post ! Thrifting is my FAVORITE , I have multiple " thrift store finds " posts where I feature my fashion scores ! ! Such a great way to find new accessories , thred up looks really cool , thanks for sharing ! That is an awesome discount ! <p> Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked on their site and was disappointed . Their prices are wayyyy more than thrift store prices and not accurate they had a dress from Express that my friend wore to prom in 2008 that said it was originally $250 . Nothing from Express is $250 . They are definitely not the largest used clothing platform Poshmark and even Mercari apps have way more options and allow comments for questions , offers etc . I personally could n't find anything on ThredUp I really wanted to buy : / <p> Thank you , thank you B.B. ! This post about ThredUp came just in the nick of time . I 'm going on safari in Africa this Summer and own almost no earth-toned clothes . I was about to drop a lot of money on new gear , but just got everything I need for under $100 on ThredUp ! Thanks a million ! <p> I love thredUP ! I think its a great way to help the environment by thrifting . I 've checked out their website a bunch of times and they have great finds ! I 've never bought anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out again ! <p> I LOVE thredUP ! They have so many great items and you can easily search your favorite brands .

I love to put it on before I blow dry to protect from the heat of the blow dry or add some to my ends before curling . <p> There are amino acids which help with split ends . <p> It is less than 3.5 oz which means I can bring it in my carry on . It also does n't  come in a glass container or anything heavy which is good because it makes it lightweight for traveling . I bring this on every trip . <p> This oil mist smells amazing because it has jojoba , avocado , coconut and argan oils as well as sweet orange essential oil and Damask rose flower water . I like to use mists vs. just straight oil because you have way more control and can distribute more evenly . It is nice to use the mist to control frizz and fly-aways . Bonus that all of its ingredients are of natural origin .

I went to go do this lemon-honey-sugar magic and remembered I needed to share it ! = <p> I am not exclusively all natural , but I do prefer all natural when it comes to products and if I can do something completely natural ( while still effective ) I will .

I hate hate hate , double hate , loathe entirely ( the Grinch anyone ? ! ! oh please tell me someone got that reference ? ? ) BLACKHEADS ! Oh I hate them . I also am one of those sick people who love to pop zits and extract blackheads .. I could sit down and just spend an hour extracting my blackheads one by one and have a ball . So usually my extracting process goes like this <p> 1 . Cut a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sugar , although its not pictured ) to the lemon half . <p> 2 . Rub on problem areas , for me that is my nose and in between my eyebrows and a few on my chin . This exfoliates and removes a lot of them . <p> *I would recommend DEFINITELY using a blackhead extractor because it is more sanitary and wont get bacteria into those open pores ! I use this one but there is also this one as well ! And for a lot of you lemon , honey , and sugar might just be enough but for me I always have those stubborn ones that need to be extracted with an extractor ! <p> Another way I like to remove my blackheads is with this recipe I posted , here . A lot of you have said it hurts to pull off , It really shouldnt hurt so my advice is to NOT put it anywhere you have peach fuzz ! ! ! And add less milk . <p> Or if you are not into the homemade stuff then I LOVE LOVE LOVEMario Badescu Silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I got it as a free sample with a purchase one day at Nordstrom and I have used the sample for probably 6 months already haha aka it lasts forever and its only $12 ! I use it differently than the directions , I believe the directions say to use a cotton ball but I get a Q-Tip wet and then dip it in the powder .. it will immediately create a paste around the Q-Tip and then I apply it to my problem areas . Let it dry and remove with a warm wash cloth . I love to do it before I have a big event or going somewhere and want my skin to look really smooth because it literally makes my skin so smooth and diminishes my pores . So I definitely recommend trying that out ! <p> Here are some other blackhead removal products Leave any you guys love in the comments below = <p> Love this post !

@@98069851 @2269851/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Santorini was unreal ! Everyone needs to visit once in their life , it is exactly what I pictured Greece to look like . If you have seen Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants then I 'm sure its been on your bucket list since then ; ) anyways I wanted to share where we stayed and what we did since we got a lot of emails about it ! We have only been to Santorini the one time so we are n't  experts but are just sharing what we personally found worked best during our week there ! It was AMAZING ! <p> Where we stayed <p> - - - We stayed in an amazing villa in Oia that we found on- HomeAway.com . ( You can find our villa here . ) If you have n't used it before , you need to ! - HomeAway- is such a great travel resource . Its especially great when traveling with large groups , or with children . Its a vacation rental website that specializes in entire homes , apartments , flats , and villas . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were 6 and a half in our group so we were totally comfortable . It had 2 full kitchens and 4 bathrooms , with a breathtaking view . Atticus even got his own room which was nice for nap times and bed time . Even had his own crib . Honestly the view was so pretty and the weather was so nice , we really did n't  have to leave with the exception to go out to eat . But included with the villa is a traditional Greek continental breakfast on one of the 3 terraces every morning . So we really could just relax most of the day . The villa manager came a few times a day to prepare breakfast , put up the canopies and sunbrellas , and clean . I am convinced the villa has the best view in Oia its the furthest outward and is also so high up ( if that makes sense ) but it really is in the most ideal spot ! <p> How we got around- <p> - - - We rented a car in Santorini ( I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do without it . Especially since our rental offered airport pickup . But you could take taxis , buses , and then you can even rent scooters or ATVs if you 're looking to cruise around the island . A taxi to Oia from the airport is $40 Euros , which is n't too bad. - Santorini is very unique . All of the little towns are accessible- by car , but once you get to the towns , you park outside , and go from there on foot throughout the towns . They have the cutest narrow cobblestone streets and walkways with lots of steps , all line with shops , villas and restaurants . So while Santorini is baby friendly , it was n't exactly stroller friendly . Make sure to bring a carrier if you plan to travel with a baby . So we arranged to meet our rental manager when we arrived outside of Oia , and then walked to our villa . This would be a pain if you were by yourself because the towns can be hard to navigate , especially while lugging all your bags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who also carried bags for us . Just remember to ask for help from rental , and remember to tip of course ; ) <p> What we did <p> - - - Like I said before , we would have been completely content with just laying around and enjoying the view , but the island offers some fun activities . There is a little port on the western most tip of the North part of the island in the town of Oia ( its easy to see in google maps ) where there is a tinly little island almost connected , which is only accessible by boat or swimming . You can get to the beach where you would swim from by walking straight west through Oia until you get to a staircase which takes you down to the port . Or you can drive to Ammoudi and walk the rest of the way . You 'll pass a bunch of cute restaurants with great seafood ( according to David , I 'm not the biggest fan ) and you walk around the island on a foot path . Once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little island . Its so pretty but there is n't much to do there , unless of course you like cliff jumping . I do n't  , obviously , but David never passes the opportunity . <p> - - - Another day we went on a fishing tour which you might have read about here . It was so much fun ! It was 130 Euros per hour , and they took us around the inside of the island ( the island is a giant circle formed by a volcano ) and stopped off at the hot springs , let us swim around , and finished off with some fishing . This tour that we went on left out of the old port in Fira . Its about a 20 minute drive from Oia , but then about a 30-40 minute walk from there . If you 're adventurous , take the steps down , but you 'll probably want to take the gondola back up , which is only 5 Euros . Or if you 're even more adventurous you can take a donkey taxi up or down for 5 Euros , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my previous post : ) <p> - - - Go to sunset point for a great end to the day . But get there early , people start getting their spots hours early and it gets crowded . But the sight is amazing . The point is hard to miss , its the highest point with a view of a sunset in Oia . You 'll see all the people on a structure waiting and you 'll know you 're there . <p> Where we ate <p> - - - There were so many good restaurants that we really loved right by the villa . We went to Terpsi en Oia a couple times and it was so tasty with an incredible view of the caldera . They have authentic Greek cuisine ( David recommends the Mousaka ) and then also traditional Mediterranean food , but more importantly , they have waffles on their menu all day and an amazing yogurt parfait with seasonal fruit : ) <p> - - - Kyprida is a great restaurant and an alternative to sunset point if you do n't  want to fight for spots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . <p> - - - By the bus stop they have a lot of quick Greek grill food . Gyros , wraps , sandwiches , salads . All very cheap , quick and delicious . There is a little burger place there called Zs Burgers ( they also make delicious pizza , try the Santorinia ) and it was soo good ! We got in late our first night and everything was closed , and Zs closed the moment we showed up . The owner was so nice and fired the oven back up and made us some light night pizzas . Definitely recommended . <p> - - - Most of the restaurants have freshly squeezed orange juice which is so delicious but do n't  assume that if it says orange juice on the menu , that its freshly squeezed ; ) Make sure and ask . They also all had high chairs which makes it great if you 're traveling with children . <p> - - - Like I mentioned before , we had 2 kitchens in our- HomeAway- which was really nice . There was a market by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wipes , baby cereal , and David also bough some breads , cheeses , meats , and olives so we had the fridge stocked for when we wanted to snack on something authentic but did n't  want to leave the villa .

Or even Cyprus ( Greek part of course ) which is great as well ( since I am from there lol ) .

I feel like fast forward the plan to autumn this year after looking at gorgeous pictures you took . They really are nice . <p> Just wanted to drop by and say while I love your blog , I miss the posts you used to do that were more lifestyle based and just the random iphone picture filled posts . they were so real and authentic and that 's a reason I started loving your blog in the first place = Obviously its a business now and your style has developed but just wanted to throw that out there ! love your blog and if you have time to do more lifestyle posts that would be so awesome ! <p> Santorini is so gorgeous ! Its definitely high on my list of places to visit . I love that striped dress on you ! You 're looking amazing , Amber ! You cant even tell that you 're pregnant in that first shot . <p> Hey Amber , love all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Karpathos-Greece and absolutely loved it . Ill definitely go back . I was wondering if Santorini has some kind of shopping town . Karpathos has a cute little town with a few designers stores and I want to know if Santorini shopping would be better for my next vacation . Thank you so much ! http : **30;94;TOOLONG <p> You have me totally craving a vacation to Santorini now ( and it has been on my bucket list since sisterhood of the traveling pants haha ) . I love hay sweet photo of Atticus in the sink , he s such a cutie . <p> My husband just asked me the other day where I want to travel next and I suggested Greece ! I 'm glad to know its totally worth it . I do n't  know where in Greece I particularly want to go , but you are making Santorini sound/look incredible ! Haha , Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants " yes ! Totally want to go watch that movie now = <p> Greece is a beautiful country and there are many places/islands you can visit there . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one ! ! Being from Greece I can happily suggest places you can/should visit in Greece and do have a relevant post on my blog ! <p> Did you visit ancient Akrotiri ? Its a Minoan archaeological site that dates to the 16th century BCE , at the time of the Thera eruption , which resulted in a climatic impact that ended up shaping much of the ancient history ( and geography ) in the region . Its pretty fascinating and probably the main reason I 'd want to travel to Santorini . Anyone who has studied art history would recognize the Akrotirian frescoes immediately they are some of the most famous works of the Bronze Age . Did you get to see the Prehistoric Thera Museum or Oia Castle ? How about the Orthodox Panagia Episkopi Church ? It dates to the 12th century and houses some incredible Byzantine icons . There are also a lot of ruins from Venetian Medieval rule . The anthropological richness of the island is incredible . <p> Granted I 'm a history , art , and archaeology geek but these sites would have been non-negotiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the cultural impact the Minoans had on the world as we know it ; seeing some of the remnants of their civilization is a once in a lifetime opportunity . <p> For anyone trying Greek food Spanakopita ( spinach and feta pie ) and Tiropita ( cheese and egg filled phyllo ) are delicious staples and if you 're feeling more adventurous , Moussaka and Dolmades are winners . Pickier eaters would probably enjoy Chicken Souvlaki doused in Tzatziki . And you get to eat almost everything with your hands without seemingly lacking table manners . <p> If you 're thinking about breaking into the travel blog space , I think you could but bear in mind many of us with wanderlust would not be content at all with just laying around and enjoying the view , especially when spending precious vacation hours away from work and paying full price for accommodation etc . <p> Santorini does have an airport that has direct flights to Athens and many European destinations . In the summer there are seasonal flights as well . Akrotiri is an archaeological site worth visiting as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city was built back then ! I hope you manage to visit Santorini ( and Greece in general ) soon . <p> Oh my goodness , it looks so wonderful . I cant wait to go there someday soon ! Thanks so much for such a great blog ! And ps I was just wondering how old you and your husband are ? Cause you both look so young yet you 're married with kids and have this properly grown up life haha ! &lt;3 xoxo <p> These photos are a dream ! What a beautiful place ! For some reason , that orange juice looks way better than the orange juice we have over here ! Haha ! = So many great suggestions ! Thanks for sharing , girly ! <p> Every time I see your pictures of Greece , I just want to book a trip there immediately ! It looks amazing and its been my dream to visit !

We are just steps from a beach here in Hawaii so we promised that we would n't miss a sunset . So far we have only missed a few and those were while the kiddos were sick this last week . Some days the kids are extra- lovey and playful and this was one of those nights . I love my little best friends ! <p> A lot of people have asked how Hawaii life is vs . New York life ! Obviously we are still new to Hawaii so hard to say yet but they are extremely different for sure . Both places I find so inspiring for different reasons . In New York I was always so inspired by seeing what go getters people are . Everyone is chasing their dreams there and I think its amazing . I also loved passing SO many people on the street and thinking about how each of those people has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their relationships , thoughts buzzing through their head , their jobs , maybe they are running late or on vacation .. and I do n't  even know them and they do n't  know me . I do n't  know if that makes sense , I am horrible at explaining things , but it made the world feel so big and always put things in perspective and I really liked that . Here I have loved seeing what simple lives people live here and how happy they are . I think my personality is more drawn to island life rather than city life I have more of a carefree spirit and I feel so extremely happy here . I felt extremely happy in New York as well but this is just a different happy . Everyone has a spot where their soul just feels content and I think Hawaii is my spot . <p> Amber this is beautiful ! I totally understand what you 're trying to say about a different kind of happy in Hawaii .. I moved from El Paso , TX to Hawaii a year and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about life have changed a LOT ! It is something that I cant really explain , it goes way beyond the beautiful views it is just the way the people live and enjoy the simple things in life . <p> Enjoy every second of it ! We are blessed to live in this beautiful place ! xoxo <p> Love your blog and watching reading about your new adventures . We recently moved from Chicago to San Francisco- although not as far as your move I understand the magnitude of a cross country move . We are going to Oahu next month for a family vacation . Any must see/must do things in Oahu ? Our twins are almost 3 so any family friendly activities are perfect . Thanks ! <p> Hawaii is where my soul feels content , too . I think wherever I came from in a past life it was super similar to Hawaii . Love your photos . And I 'm so glad you guys are catching Hawaii sunsets . There are no other sunsets like them on earth . <p> GORGEOUS sunset ! There 's nothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks there are a different type of dreamer than the people in New York . Completely agree that both places are beautiful and wonderful in their own right . <p> Again , another amazing blog post ! ! ! Seriously I look forward to opening your posts because they are so uplifting and fun to read . I grew up on Maui so I can totally relate to loving Hawaii life for sure ! Love seeing all your island pics with your family . Thanks for sharing ! ! <p> Hi Amber ! You 're not horrible at explaining things at all ! In fact , you perfectly described the word " Sonder " its definition according to " The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows " is : noun ; the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own " populated with their own ambitions , friends , routines , worries and inherited craziness " an epic story that continues invisibly around you like an anthill sprawling deep underground , with elaborate passageways to thousands of other lives that you 'll never know existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra sipping coffee in the background , as a blur of traffic passing on the highway , as a lighted window at dusk . <p> Such a beautiful idea . I did n't  know there was a word for it ! I often think about this as well , especially living in nyc these days . I love to imagine what other peoples lives might be like and see how our paths intersect for just one small moment <p> Beautiful pictures ! There is nothing better than getting loves from your babies ! Question how far apart are your kiddos ? I ask because my second is due in February and my first with be 20 months at that time . Your kiddos seem to have such a great bond . <p> Its so great to see you thriving in both kinds of environments ! I 'm not sure if I could do fast paced city life or slow paced island life , I like it somewhere more in the middle , haha ! Love following you on your journey and cant wait to see what adventures you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so gorgeous , I absolutely adore sunsets , and you guys are so lucky t have the beach right there ! I totally agree about New York , I 've been on a holiday , and there 's always so much happening and I love it ! xxxxx Isobel <p> New favorite post/stream of photos ! HOW CUTE . I 'm like getting emotional over here hahahaha . But really , looking at these made my heart so so so happy . Nothing but pure JOY on all of you faces . One thing I love most about watching your snap chat stories is seeing you interact with your kids ( especially Atticus considering he s a little older ) you 're seriously such a fun , cute . and awesome mama ! ! Your kids are lucky to have you . And they know they 're lucky to have you ! ! You can tell how much they just love and adore you . Makes me smile everytime . ALSO the low loose messy bun is so cute I love it ! <p> I enjoy all your posts and pics ! = I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if your babies get vaccinations ? Also , any tips on traveling with babies ? Do you avoid traveling during flu season ? Thank you = <p> Aw thanks ! Yeah the kids are vaccinated ! I have a post on traveling with kids if you search " 50 tips for traveling with kids " on my blog it will come up ! Those are from when we just had Atticus . It has changed a bit with two ! We travel with disinfecting wipes and always map out where the nearest pediatrician and Urgent Care are wherever we go . As far as just getting from A to B , we try to make everything really fun for them get them excited about helping push the suitcases , getting weighed at the check in counter ( agents always let them weigh themselves ) , then racing to the gate , playing hide n seek at the gate , watching planes , etc etc . We also love to get them a new little toy for each hour of the flight ( could be a stamp and a post it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything little ! ) xoxoxo <p> I totally get the same feeling when I 'm in NYC ! I cant explain it . NYC is like its own bubble . It feels like anything is possible when you 're there . I do n't  know what it is ! ! So glad to hear you are so happy in Hawaii ! Island life seems like such a more simple , carefree life . I love the idea of getting up and moving to an island . Such cute pictures ! xo <p> Hawaii is such a special place . When I visited , the island life was so simple and laid back it was all about spending time with others and enjoying the beauty of nature around you . I would love to live there ! <p> This is so true ! I completely relate to what you 're saying . I lived on Maui for 8mo. and I really admired the simplicity of life and how material things seemed to fade away in light of relationships . Always being outside in the sunshine does something wonderful to your soul . It comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I love seeing all the Hawaii adventures especially though ! <p> While living in London I felt exactly like you did in New York . I would always watch people on tubes and buses and think that these people are all special to someone and all have their own stories and memories and it always put things into perspective for me too . I would be grumpy in rush hour but then would remember that everyone is going through the same thing as me , if not worse . They are someones brother , son , husband , sister , granddaughter , best friend , mother . It made me appreciate and realise how special life is . I miss that about city life , I now live at the seaside in England . Thank you for bringing all my city memories back to me . <p> " I am horrible at explaining things " I have understood all you have said and I am so happy that you also be in Hawaii . I am spanish and now me I do n't  if I am explaining well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the photos you are reaching , hope one day you come to SPAIN and can come to Zaragoza , that beautiful city and me waits to you ? <p> I am actually still using the same Kate Somerville tanning towelettes ! ! !

While its not as big as a city as New York , I still love the hustle everyone has everyday , and how artsy everyone is. &lt;3 <p> I can totally relate to your feeling of looking at people and realizing how they all have full , complex lives that you know nothing about !

This year I wore a full Marks &amp; Spencer look . I wore a plaid dress , booties , and a cross body bag . I love long sleeve dresses paired with booties for the transition from summer to fall ! Cross body bags are always my go to because I love being hands free . I also love all of the fall colors in this look . And I am really excited to be able to wear chunky knits with booties ! How cute is this M&amp;S sweater- with daisies ? ! M&amp;S has really good price points and great quality which they have always been known for . <p> I am in LOVE with this look !

It ca n't be anymore British actually ! Yes , the value for money is pretty good at M&amp;S and they are trying hard to appeal to younger customers these days . I buy the odd piece from them but they are particularly good for underwear and hosiery so check them out too . The dress is really cool with the booties and definitely shouts autumn mode !

I have tried literally so many ( From bareminerals to estee lauder to toofaced to No7 to MaryKay ) and I can not for the life of me figure out the right color fit for me . Could you kind of talk about , if you 're shopping for foundation , how to fit your skin ton , how you figured out your skin tone , and bits of advice about finding the right foundation for you ? I have tried Sephora and Ulta . I am naturally blonde with dark eyes and eyebrows and I have heard everything from that Im neutral to I 'm light olive and I am so confused . Thanks Amber !

@@98069866 @2269866/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Finally have this tutorial ! ! ! We were having some technical difficulties with it- lol but it is finally done and I am so excited because it is requested on the daily ! I have always had STICK STRAIGHT natural hair so doing these no heat , tight waves is fun for me . I kind of envy people who have hair like this naturally ! But luckily it is really really easy to achieve this look and there are three ways I get my no heat beachy waves so in the video I share all three . In these photos I had my natural hair braided and my extensions just scrunched from the salt water in the ocean and I let them air dry like that . The good thing about most hair extensions is that they are naturally wavy so when wet they scrunch super nice ! You can use a mousse or salt spray if you are n't  by the ocean but you may have to wash them sooner since product does kind of start to build on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 4 clip/8 inch , 3 clip/7 inch , 3 clip/6 inch ) and in the video I am just wearing 2 wefts ( 7 and 8 inch ) ! Since my hair is thinner I love the thickness . <p> You obviously do n't  need extensions for this style and if your hair is already naturally thick then you can do just the braiding portion I would maybe do three french or dutch braids if your hair is naturally really thick and make sure you do them really tight ! They do n't  have to be perfect and in fact the less perfect they are the more they will look like waves you get from the beach . <p> Also one more thing ! - When you take out your braid make sure you toss your hair around a little and break up the waves a bit you can even add texture spray if you want but DO NT brush through your hair with a brush because it will turn into a bit of a frizz ball . If you are wanting to brush it then just brush through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to salons ? I have lots of clients that ask about clip ins and Ive seen yours and they always look beautiful . I sell Halo couture extensions but like I said I have lots of clients that want the clip ins as a option . <p> Your hair is beautiful like always = i love your ideas and i am going to try and recreate them . my hair is also so straight and so sometimes it is difficult to curl it or wave it out without heat so i will definitely try this ! <p> These are so beautiful ! You 're the cutest Amber ! I do have a question ! I have been using your hair extensions since January ( Love them btw ! ! ) but I just washed them for the first time and they are supppper dry . Any suggestions to rehydrate ? ! I have used a ton of Paul mitchel hair oil but it does n't  seem to cut it . I also left them to deep condition over night . <p> Aw thank you Sydney ! ! ! So glad you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear that they feel dry ! I would say to try getting them wet with warm water and then put a deep conditioner on let them sit for a while but sounds like you already did that ! How long have you had them ? You can email us directly too at **30;255;TOOLONG = <p> Using a salon quality sulfate-free shampoo is the best for extensions and to wash with cold water . Also to use salon quality conditioner be gentle to the hair do n't  rub or twist it . Gently squeeze out excess water and pat dry with a towel . Gently comb the hair starting from the ends , keeping the pressure off the weft area . Using a wide-tooth comb . Do not use a hair dryer to dry the extensions . Hang them up on a hanger and let them air dry . And extensions do n't  require a lot of product . Its worth the money to invest into good shampoo and conditioner and a good heat protectant . You pay lots of money for the hair and most people do n't  know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much longer with good products . <p> I have the same thing , my hair is dead straight , people at school tell me they want my hair , but I 'd rather have this= ! I 've done this method before and works well , but do you have any tips on hair holding curl longer since my hair tends to just go straight almost immediately ? <p> I have waited for this tutorial for so long ! YAY and now its finally there = I really need to try the braiding method tomorrow after washing my hair ! Your hair with the extensions is soo freaking pretty and perfect ! I really wish I would have naturally hair like that = but I think we are all dreaming to have hair like that = But why did you cut your hair when you love having long hair ? Your hair was so long before ! Or do you want to grow it healthy and thicker back ? <p> Gorgeous ! I love the french braid idea , starting at the top of the head .

If you are looking more for something for dark spots , the Phoretin CF is very similiar to the C E Ferulic but with more added anti-discoloration ingredients . I would definitely add an antioxidant to your regimen . I was n't a believer until I tried it and now I will always buy it . <p> I love when you do beauty posts !

I love that you are spending six months in Hawaii ! What a great time for the kiddos , I cant wait to hear how much they are loving it . I bet they are so excited to just run and play on the beach where its beautiful and warm every day ! Enjoy it and we will live it and love it through you ! <p> My husband and I recently lived on a Caribbean island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely came with some difficulties , but I looooved and miss the simplicity and slow pace of island life . No makeup and messy hair for dayyyyyz . I 'm so glad you 're loving it , and you look amazing as always ! <p> Oh man what a dream you are living right now ! My husband and I want to visit Hawaii so bad . Looks like you guys are already having the BEST time . Oh and love this simple warm weather look . So cute .

( like in the picture below ) <p> and the feeling of missing someone is the worst ever . i cant imagine having a husband be gone for weeks at a time and especially over the holidays ! <p> have you seen the movie New Years Eve yet ? <p> if you have n't do n't  read this . <p> if you have how stinking cute was Halle Berrys part ? ! ? ! ahhh it broke my heart ! cutest thing ever ! ! ! i loved their little skype date and how she got all dressed up for it ! so precious . <p> also a random thought .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a guy came up to her and asked her on a date and told her she was gorgeous . she then proceeded to joke about it and say how creepy and weird it was . <p> okay . i have a problem with girls who act disgusted or " creeped out " when a guy comes up to you , gives you a- compliment- and has the freaking balls to ask you out ! cant you at least just be flattered by , a. the compliment and b. the fact that he had the courage to come up and talk to you ? i mean who are you to think you are too good for him to talk to or ask out ? if you do n't  want to go out with him then that is 100% fine . but i have so much respect for a guy who sees a girl , ACTUALLY walks up to her and says , " i think you are absolutely gorgeous and was wondering if you would want to go out sometime " like are you kidding me ? that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl you should be even more flattered and even more sweet to him because the fact that you 're hot probably makes it a million times harder ! granted , there are plenty of creeps out there . we all know creeps when we see them . so that is different . but i am talking about normal guys , good looking or not . EVEN if the guy is HIDEOUS .. i do n't  care how hot you are .. take the compliment . be flattered that he asked you out . give him the respect he deserves . politely decline or accept . and move on . end of story . <p> ( not referring to facebook ask outs either . anyone can do that. ) also .. i know i have probably done this .. but i do make a conscious effort not to . <p> I totally agree with the asking out thingthe girl just seems full of herself . Its hard to do whatever the guy did , and they should appreciate it . Does n't  mean they have to say yes , but they should n't be a bitch about it . 
@@98069898 @2269898/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> By now you have probably heard that we moved to Hawaii until the home we are building in Arizona is done ! One thing we have been really excited about getting after leaving the city is a car ! ! ! We 're looking at different ones and have some favorites in mind that we have rented over the last couple years , but keep going back and forth . I want a minivan so so so so bad haha ! I know they are the ultimate cheesy mom car , but whenever we rent them , I am like This is the greatest ! ! ! ! Sooo who knows . <p> We are renting a car for the time we will be spending in Hawaii , so we will test out that car and see . We will need to get two cars and have no clue what to get for our smaller car . Do any of you have favorite family-friendly cars that you drive ? ! I am not terribly concerned about the brand , I just want a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minivan for myself = <p> It was nice not having to worry about a car , but I have to admit , I 'm excited to get one again . Car buying can be kind of a pain , but I 'm excited to use Capital One 's new Auto Navigator site , which is essentially a one-stop website that allows you to get pre-qualified for financing , and also search for your car . While we wo n't be buying in Hawaii , we 're going to use that time to find the right car for us , so that when get to Arizona , we 'll know exactly what we want . Hopefully with the Capital One Auto Navigator site , it will be an easy transition ! Let me know your car recommendations , we 're currently keeping a list of our favorites ! <p> It is really hard and time consuming to find the right car when you have a growing family . We spent about 1 month thinking and searching for the car we wanted . We have three kids ( 4 and 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroller-yes it is a member of our family too- , so we needed a bigger car that is reliable , nice looking and have more space than our old car . I wanted a minivan , but my husband thought it was not modern inside and out , so we decided to buy Audi Q7 which was the best decision we made so far . The exterior and interior designs are fabulous , and it offers lots of features . Great for road trips and everyone enjoys it ! Good luck ! <p> I definitely recommend a minivan for so many different reasons . My husband and I have three kids , and THERE IS SO MUCH SPACE ! ! ! Like , we could fill the car with food to feed an entire country and still fit the massive infant car seats ( car seats are so obnoxiously huge , am I right ? ) Anyway , you will love the space , and so will your kids . There are so many different options to choose from , but I love my Honda Odyssey , and so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last like 400 years or something like that . I swear , it is the most reliable car ever heard of . Before I got my car , I was so worried about what people would think of me being a " soccer mom " , but forget them ! You will not regret this car choice at all . But the best part of any minivan you get is this YOUR KIDS CANT DENT THE DOORS BY SWINGING THEM INTO OTHER CARS ! Say goodbye to embarrassing car alarm moments in the Target parking lot ! Amber , I hope you guys find your dream car , and I hoped my prattling helped you out a little bit . = <p> I am totally living the mini van dream in my white Toyota Sienna &amp; I would not go back . I was hesitant &amp; felt weird at first but it simplifies mom life so much . Doors that open themselves , keyless entry , a legit trunk enough for a double stroller &amp; all our crap . An SUVs trunk space sucks for a family with little ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; drive little friends &amp; our Goldendoodle around . <p> Get a fun , sexy car for your 2nd car so you feel awesome when you 're not in the mini van . We love our Range Rover but my husband is probably switching it out for a Tesla soon . Happy shopping ! <p> Hi Amber , I do love the idea of the mini van seems very easy to get the kids in and out of and also has enough room for family when more neices and nephews are visiting , but I really just havent fallen in love with them . When we delivered our son , baby #2 my husband bought me a Toyota 4 runner . I love it . We kept my small Mazda 3 which is a great small vehicle to run errands in but the 4 runner is our main vehicle . We now have three children and I still love my sporty 4 runner . Lemon is 8 , Tagairus just turned 3 , and Savvy May is 19 months ! My husband is a bigger guy 61 ? at 220lbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seats in the back . <p> Hi Amber , I 've never commented on your blog before . Not bc I 'm not a committed follower with lots of positive things to say , but its just not my thing I guess . However , I could n't hold back on my opinion when it comes to helping you choose a smaller vehicle . PLEASE consider a Subaru ! ! ! ! I currently have a Forrester and before that I had an Impreza . They used solid panels of steel , not pieced together , which is huge in fight for safety . Gas mileage is nothing to complain about and they hold their value ! Were expecting our 2nd daughter , so I 'm currently trying to decide what to upgrade to accommodate 2 car seats and you 've talked me into opening my mind to a mini-van haha . But I can not praise Subaru enough for your smaller car . Good luck ! <p> Oops one last thing , very reliable car never had any issues other than the basic maintenance . We drove it from California to AZ once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yay and that helps a lot in hot climate and that a big plus with kids . ? <p> I 'm on my second Yukon vehicle . I love it ! Super roomy , comfortable and great city and travel vehicle . Great car if you have kids . With lots of space for all the kid stuff . I 'm anti mommy looking cars so this was perfect for us . You should rent one and take it out for a spin = good luck <p> We just bought a Toyota Venza last month and its the best . Its technically a crossover , but it drives like a sedan and feels heavy and safe like an SUV . There 's nothing I do n't  like about it ! Its not annoyingly bulky like SUVs sometimes feel , but its insanely roomy inside and has a massive trunk . I have two kids the exact ages of yours and their carseats and stroller fit with room for another person in the backseat and suitcases/groceries in the trunk . Its also four wheel drive which is a must since we live in snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minivan yet haha so this is a great compromise ! Not like a regular mom , cool mom ! = <p> Hi Amber , I live in Phoenix , AZ and I love my Rav4 ! Its a small SUV , large enough to fit the kids and animals , small enough to easily park around the valley . I bought mine in a lighter color and it stays fairly cool on the boiling summer days ! <p> Amber and David . First super excited you guys are moving to AZ . I moved to AZ myself three years ago and loving it so far . I have been driving VW for the past 9 years . From a rabbit to Jetta to a Passat and loved every moment of it . The body of a German car is like no other . Hard as a rock as far as safety goes . And inside is spacious for kids and plenty of room in the trunk for your stuff or shopping . Not to mention the simplicity inside makes it more luxurious with all the gadgets . I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got out of my car I honestly thought my back bumper is completely gone but not a scratch to it . Unbelievable . All my friends were in shock . Same accident happens to them and their cars were damaged . I come from a long line of German car family and would n't trade it for anything else . VWs are good looking , fast and comfortable and got curves ? And the prices are so affordable So I vote for VW ? ? @barefootapple <p> For a smaller , good gas mileage and still family friendly car I recommend the Hyundai sonata . My husband uses it for work and the kids are in it every now and then when needed and they actually prefer it to our big expensive SUV . They think it looks like a spaceship inside ? . Its pretty nice on the inside but not too much to where I would be freaking out every time there is a juice spill which is all the time ha <p> The AudiQ7 is very comfortable . Its also very smooth , safe and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also very nice , but smaller and I like the Q7 more . But f you want something more affordable then the Outlander by Mitsubishi is perfect . It is very safe and big . <p> i love our families subaru outback , i would n't trade it for any other car in the world . i love photography and it gets me to the craziest spots and up into the mountains no problem . i get to go to so many places that are off limits for most people because of it . they 're reliable and roomy as well . <p> My first car was a Volkswagen Passat . It was a great first car . I recently just bought at Volkswagen Tiguan and the safety features are phenomenal ! Toyota Highlanders , Honda Odessays , and the Honda Pilots are awesome too ! <p> My family has always driven Subarus , specifically outbacks . Were from a mountainous area that gets quite a bit of snow so having an all wheel drive car is important . Outbacks are super reliable and safe as well . Currently , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it gets great gas milage and was relatively inexpensive . However , I definitely miss having a Subaru . <p> Love the Subarus ! ! I had a 2015 Crosstrek but sadly had to sell ( not because there was anything wrong with it , I 'm sure it would have lasted me for over 10 years ! ) and now I have a 2016 Toyota RAV4 . Both are awesome cars and super reliable ! <p> We have three children ( 7 , 5 and 2 ) and I drive a Honda Odyssey . Just make sure that whatever you get has leather interior . We went with fabric and I 'm constantly having to scrub my seats ! LOL . Good Luck ! xo <p> Definitely go for a german brand like Audi , BMW , Volkswagen or Mercedes for the family car AND the smaller one . They are a bit pricy but totally worth it , its really good quality , super safe , good looking and the choices are endless .. And I promise I 'm not biased since Im french ( and french cars are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that germans really are the best constructors , they lead the european market . Have a great time in Hawa+ ! <p> Hey girl ! Good luck picking out your car ! I drive a 4-door Mini Cooper S and I love it . I have three little siblings , and I 'm able to transport them super easily in it . its a lot roomier than one would think . If you have any questions about it , feel free to shoot me a dm ! My instagram is @theroadtohannah = <p> Good luck ! Hyundai Elantra is a low maintenance , safe , smaller car . Plenty of room in the back , more than you originally think you 'll get when you first look inside . Once you sit back there you 'll see you have a lot of leg room ; great for A and R when they get older ! <p> Oh , wow ! Enjoy Hawaii while you wait for your home to be built . You might not want to leave though ! ! I got my new Tesla X a couple months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about having the falcon wing doors because I do n't  like to draw attention , but Ive grown to love them . We have twin 5-year-old girls who are tiny so still in 5-point boosters . The wing doors make it so easy getting them in and out . I also love that we were able to configure the back seats how we wanted and the chic stain resistant white interior ( it really is stain resistant ! ) . Since there is no engine , the car has a trunk in the front and in the back . Teslas are also some of the safest cars on the road which is most important for me . Since its all electric , I have n't been to a gas station since we got it . Love this car ! <p> My husband and I are going through the same thing right now ! He s finally letting go of his 04 Envoy and were looking the Grand Cherokee , Ford Explorer and GMC Terrain = Let me know if you look at the same ones ! xoxo , Christinehttp : **26;318;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now lives on the East Coast I was picky when buying my new car . I ended up buying the Mazda CX-5 and I am in love with it ! Even though I 'm in my young twenties it was perfect for moving furniture for my new apartment , I could safely drive my god-daughter around , and the ease of the car is amazing . Big enough to haul things around , but small enough to feel like you are n't  driving a boat . Plus the safety features and ratings are high which is a big plus ! Good luck // Cassandra <p> First off , I loveee your outfit ! ! Secondly , as an 18 year old many might question my knowledge on cars but let me tell you I absolutely love the Ford Explorer ! ! ! Its super family friendly and made in the good ol USA = I drive that car to school everyday and I feel empowered by driving the typical suburban mom car ! Good luck on your car search and cant wait to see which car you pick ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much experience with cars , but I love my Tahoe . My mom now drives a volvo xc90 which is the perfect family car . She drove a honda odessey for 10 years and my brother and sister got sick on every car ride , but some people love them . They do last forever . I 'm sure any car you pick will be perfect for your family ! oh and my dad has the tesla x and LOVES it . <p> I drive a Toyota Camry and love it ! My moms car is also very nice- Volkswagen Touareg . Both are great options for the smaller vehicle , but I 'd really recommended researching the different manufactures . For example , volvos are supposed to be extremely safe , while Jeeps can break down quite often . Good luck with your search ! <p> Tesla Model X or wait for the Model 3 ! ! They have such cool technology and are very safe and easy to drive . Model X would be better for family but the Model 3 has other upgrades and would be better for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally that it was not cute or lux enough for me , but I have had it for a year now and love it ! I got it totally decked out with the 6 cylinders and the eyesight control ( the car can practically drive itself on the highway and it breaks for me in a near accident and tells me if I zone out at a light if the car in front of me has gone ) . It handles all the messes our kids throw at it and we can fit a lot in the trunk . <p> I like our dodge journey a lot-it seats seven or the back seats can fold down for cargo space . Its also great with gas mileage . I watched Rosies birthday video and thought it was so sweet ! Atticus is such a sweet little guy ! I noticed he is n't too verbal , though . My two year old was also like this . We ended up having to do a few months of speech therapy , much to my dismay . I really thought she would just start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . I would get upset when others mentioned my daughter not talking yet . We did the therapy and now she wont stop talking . It took just a few months , once a week . I can understand if this comment upsets you in any way , my apologies if so . Love your blog ! <p> Amber- I love your Blog ! I 'm somewhat older than you but I LOVED my Honda Odyssey mini-van ! ! I do n't  think there 's a better family vehicle &amp; I loved driving it . When my daughter graduated &amp; went off to college I sold it &amp; recently purchased the Toyota Highlander and I LOVE it . Still spacious but not as roomy . ( I did a lot of research vs . Honda Pilot since I 'd owned Hondas for 20 yrs . but went with the Highlander because we do n't  have little ones anymore . You might opt for the Honda Pilot as the 3rd row seat is MUCH more spacious ! Google YouTube view Honda Pilot vs . Toyota Highlander-very informational ! ) A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would n't have traded it for anything ! And it totally moved all my daughters things into her dorm for college by taking out some of the seats.so useful ! ) Also , since we just bought ( I 'm in N.C. ) there 's a APP you can put on your phone TrueCar that helps you know what others in your area are paying for make/models so you know what price range to negotiate with ! It is stressful but I think you cant go wrong w/Toyota/Honda ! ! Happy Car Buying ! ! <p> You two are super cute together ! Love your entire family ! ! My husband is a jeep , dodge , and Chrysler dealer so I 'm very biased but I drive a Dodge Durango and I absolutely love it for my family . Seats 6 and has room for luggage or a stroller . Chrysler just came out with the new Chrysler Pacifica and it is amazing for a growing family . Lots of room for passengers and storage ! ! ! Take a test drive . You 'll love it . For cars-the Chrysler 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite car by far ! My husband loves his Jeep Grand Cherokee ! ! Perfect ride and look for a jeep . I guess my opinion is to go see a jeep , dodge , Chrysler dealer near you ! ! I think you may find both your vehicles ! ! ! But again I might be biased ! ! Lol ! <p> Hey ! For my family , we love the Ford Fusion and the Ford Edge or Explorer . The Fusion fits five people and is a smaller car . The Edge and Explorer also fit five people but are mid sized cars . They are both awesome and I used to always get told that my Fusion looked like it could be a Mercedes . My dad owns a couple of car dealerships in Southern Utah you could check into ! = <p> Smaller car Subaru Outback . They last forever and tackle any weather you can throw at it . Plus you can get one that you can drive as either a stick or an automatic . We had an old Legacy and whenever we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask if we were trading in because they had such high demand . <p> Minivan we adore our Honda Odyssey . We have three kiddos , but have room for 8 people total . Its popular for a reason ! Plus you can get some excellent upgrades . <p> I drive a Jeep Cherokee and absolutely love it ! Small enough to feel comfortable driving around but big enough to have car seats and easy to have kids in the back seat ! I nanny for two little boys and it is very comfortable getting them buckled into their car seats . I hope you are enjoying Hawaii ! I love keeping up with you all on social media = <p> I live in Arizona and my whole family drives Teslas ! They are amazing cars especially in a place that is so compatible with them ! There are charging stations everywhere . The model S is a great smaller car , very sleek feel while being very practical ! The model X though is the ultimate " mom " car ! They designed it with moms in mind which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiddos in even easier ! Either way Tesla is a great brand to have in Arizona ! <p> Hey Amber ! Kia Optimas are really great cars ! Theyre spacious enough to fit 2 car seats in case you ever needed to . Its be a nice car for David . For a family car I 'd recommend a Jeep Grand Cherokee ! Like a minivan but very sporty : ) good luck ! <p> My sis has two kids and she recently got an SUV . Its super convenient for changing diapers because you can leave the kid back in the trunk area which is the perfect height for changing diapers . But I would definitely recommend getting an SUV with a third row , if you decide to go the SUV route . With two car seats in the back row , there is absolutely no room for another person to sit in between the car seats . Its almost impossible to squeeze back there to feed the baby or comfort them , etc . That 's just my two cents . Good luck with whatever you decide to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minivans . I had to drive one as a loaner vehicle while mine was getting repaired , and I could n't believe how roomy and awesome it is ! <p> The new 2017 volvo xc90 is an amazing car , very safe and has a lot of room . Honestly big cars make a difference especially with tots ! If you want an SUV , mercedes and BMW do a great job too ! All three car brands are awesome , great reputation and last a long time ! = <p> My mom drives a Mazda CX-9 and its perfect for the whole family ! My brothers car seat is behind the passenger so she can keep an eye on him from the driver seat . Then the rest of my brothers and I fit perfectly . The third row is convienient when we need it but mostly we just lay the third row down for more trunk space , groceries , strollers , luggage ( for traveling ) . All in all I think a Mazda is a perfect family car . <p> I just moved from Williamsburg , Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three daughters . Loved it . But after we moved back to TN , we got Ford FLEX which is my absolute favorite . It seats 7 and you can customize the back for whatever you 're hauling around . The back seats also flip for tailgating seats , and the color selection is great . We have Guard Green with white top and tan interior , Love it ! <p> Audi Q5 is the smoothest , best driving and comfortable family car I have EVER driven . You may want to look into the q7 since you have 2 kiddos . We call ours the " Butter Queen " because she 's smooth as butter and as sparkly as British royalty = haha ! <p> Get a Subaru ! Everyone in UT has one and they 're incredible for all seasons ! The Outback is a wonderful family car ( we had one growing up ) and theyve gotten more spacious with each remodel . Plus good $$ <p> I previously owned a Lexus RX ( it is an SUV ) and loved it ! I currently own a Mazda 3 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are very reliable , spacious , and good on gas . Good luck with choosing your new car , moving into your new home , and for the meantime enjoy Hawaii ! <p> I have a Mercedes ML350 and absolutely love it ! Smaller SUV model but still holds so much when traveling and has a comfortable back seat . My mom has an Audi Q7 and the Q7 and Q5 are both fantastic cars as well . Hope you guys are enjoying your time in Hawaii ! <p> I do n't  have kids yet , but my husband and I bought a Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk last year and we absolutely love it ! Treys cousin has a young family and they bought the GMC Acadia , and love that . For a smaller car , my family has always driven Hondas . I 've had my Honda Civic for almost 10 years now and havent had a single issue with it . I test drove a Ford sedan recently too and it was great ! <p> PS so excited to follow along through all of these exciting transitions ! I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I feel like I know you guys personally ! I 'm always saying to Trey , " You know Amber ? They did " haha so cheesy but I love you guys ! <p> I just bought a bigger car a couple mo this ago and love it . Its a brand new Land Rover LR4 . It fits up to 7 people . Lots of windows and room = For the smaller car , look into the Porsche Macan . David david david would love it . Very price reasonable . Xoxo <p> I remember an old post where you went to Vermont or something and you rented a Mercedes Sprinter van and you LOVED it . So I may have found your dream car considering you love mini vans.My hubby and I are in the market for a new car and I we stumbled upon a Mercedes Metris that was outfitted by some company in Indiana ( this is the key cause otherwise they are kinda boring . Must be outfitted ) OMG Amber I died ! Its amazing ! It has the extended roof which essentially like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amazing chairsOh and I almost forgot .. its a freaken small refrigerator ! Like what ? ? ? Which would totally come in handy when we have our second baby with bottles and all Listen.Ive never been down for a minivan but this van sent me into a happiness nirvana . My husband was laughing so hard when I pulled into the car lot after test driving it cause I had a massive ear to ear smile . I hope you take a gander at it and tell me whatcha think ? Its like a sexy minivanif there ever is one ? ! <p> I love your outfit in these pictures , especially the boots ! My mom has a Toyota Tarago and its the greatest car , it has so much space and was so good for us growing up ! I 'd definitely look into that one ! xxxx Isobel <p> I 'll tell you one car NOT to get- a Ford Escape . I bought one brand new ( in a stupid moment of urgency ) , and in less than a year its been in for serious repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off while driving on the highway ) . Technically its a crossover , but still warning ya ! As for a good recommendation , I stand by Kia . I 'm so so happy for you guys ! Your family is absolutely adorable ! <p> I have to say Im in love with my Honda Civic ! I just got it this year after moving to my new home , and its been a dream . I also drove my moms Honda Accord all throughout high school back in the day , so I definitely recommend Hondas . A civic or an accord definitely falls more under the " small car " territory rather than your dream of a minivan , but I 'd definitely give them a look . <p> the ultimate cool mom car would be Mercedes GLK 350 but since that seems like a far away dream to me when I currently have no kids and share a tiny pumpkin orange hatchback with my husband I would say any SUV ! ! Volkswagen Tiguans are really nice too ! <p> I have a Subaru Crosstrek which is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a bigger version of the Crosstrek with more room in the backseat and trunk . I love the Subaru brand and I can not recommend it enough . Also , its dog-approved , which is what sold us ! : ) ) ) <p> Hi Amber , I drive an Audi Q5 3.2 ( 6 cylinder ) and can not absolutely can not say enough good things about this car . It is a crossover so not as big as an SUV ( the Q7 would be maybe a better option for a family of your size ) .. It is a luxury yet utility vehicle . I 'm absolutely in love with it . I feel very safe driving my daughter around in it . It has great features and its a very high quality ( absolutely no repairs on now a 4 year old car ) .. I 'd highly recommend it ! <p> SO excited for you ! You have lots to look forward to in the near future , whoooo ! I grew up with a Honda Pilot and it was just the best ever ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , snacks , travel ! It was the ultimate road trip car ! Good luck and enjoy soaking up the sun ! ! xoxo you 're just the greatest and I admire you so much ! <p> I am not really a car person either , but I 'm IN LOVE with my Mazda 3the gas is great like amazing I can go a week and a half without getting gas and the inside lights and dashboard kind of resemble a sporty car so its great for guys in that aspect . I 've had very few issues with it and ive had it for almost 7 years . <p> The new Volvo XC 90 is the coolest mom car and so comfortable/easy to drive ! ! VERY safe for the kiddos . I 'm a nanny and have the XC 90 and all the families I nanny for love that I have this car and it is my joy ! I love driving it . I also really love the Toyota Highlander for families . My aunt has one and Ive driven it before and it is AWESOME . For a smaller car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Subaru . <p> Hi Amber ! So excited for this new chapter in your guys life ! When we were getting a new car just before having our baby , my biggest thought was " if I were to get into an accident , what will keep my baby safest ? " After looking at many varieties , we went with a Tacoma . Its not a huge truck like some others , but is specious enough ( for us 3 and 2 big dogs ) and its safe ! I feel confident driving around my precious little peach in it . Bonus : with a shell cover , its super easy to pack up and go somewhere for the weekend or the day ! Good luck with your search and hope you 're loving Hawaii ! <p> Oh amber ! These photos are absolutely beautiful ! I love them . And your look in this photo is stunning . Yah . My family had mini vans growing up . They are pretty nice . I 'll admit that . They are very spacious and can fit a lot of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We used to have the Toyota Sienna . Honestly do n't  know if it still is around . Haha . But it was an awesome car ! For a small car , right now I have a Honda hrv which is absolutely amazing . Drives nice and is right in the middle of being a big car and a small car . Hope you guys find the perfect one ! Ca n't wait to hear more . &lt;3 Xoxox <p> Hi Amber , just tip for Az . With kiddos in the back seat try and get climate controls for the back seats ! It makes those July days so much nicer ! Tinted windows are a must as well . We spent 11 years in Phoenix , we loved it ! <p> The moving sounds so exciting ! ! Yall should come to Austin , Texas , and do a meet up soon !

I 'm so happy for all the amazing things going on in your life ! I personally have a Tahoe- its tough , easy to pack up my 3 kids and I love the way I sit up high ! You should try it out . Much Love ! <p> For a smaller car ( and small is kind of an understatement since this car has so much room ! ) my husband loves his hyundai sonata . It has tons of trunk space ( more than my jeep ) , and the backseat is really roomy and great for long road trips and carseats . For a family car other than a minivan , we really like the honda pilot because its got 3 rows , which is great for a growing family , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back for even more space ) , and awesome safety features . <p> We have a 2001 Lexus RX300 ( its a small SUV ) and we love it ! Its so comfortable and feels spacious even though its not that big , and its family friendly . Ours is pretty old we bought it used on Craigslist a few years ago but still SO reliable . I 'm sure the new ones are even nicer ! ( and cuter ! ) <p> First off , you guys are the cutest ever ! ! For cars , I recommend anything Toyota or Honda . Those brands have great cars/SUVs/minivans . If you want economical , spacious , and luxurious ; I 'd totes recommend a Lexus SUV ! ! ! ! Those are amazing . <p> I want a minivan sooooo bad too ! People do not understand how amazing and convenient they are ! I also imagine that our dog would sit up in between the two front seats which he would love ! We actually have a Toyota Tacoma and love it ! So far with one car seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I actually live on Oahu and I 'm from Manhattan so were in similar situations . When my husband and I moved out here a few years ago we got a jeep , and when I had my twin boys I got an Audi A4 and my husband kept the jeep . I can not recommend a better car , Audis are a little more on the expensive side but its an amazing car and great for two little ones ! I have had it for about a year and a half now and its perfect for Hawaii , but I 'm sure it would be even better for Arizona ! Much luck ! Xx <p> I drove a Ford Edge for 3 years and absolutely loved it ! I never had any issues , it was very spacious in the back ( car seats ) , and you really ca n't beat Fords padlock on the door so convenient ! This is n't necessarily a " small car " but it would n't be as large as your mini van ( btw I 'm totally down with that ) , and it would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in without seeming crammed ! Good luck and have fun in Hawaii ! <p> if you want a family friendly care , i suggest the chevy tahoe or gmc yukon . I also really like the lexus gx460 and 470 . The honda accord is a great small car that is also pretty family friendly . If you want a small suv for the small car , the volvo xc90 is great , as well as the xc60 . The built in wifi is great for car trips and my family loves playing our own music ; ) . <p> OH MY GOSH these photos are too freaking adorable ! ! ! When I was pregnant ( and before we found out it was twins ! ! ) we bought a 2017 Kia Sportage and love it so much ! But then we found out there were two babes and thought shoot maybe we should have gotten a mini van right off the hop lol ! But we really really love the Sportage , its the perfect size , not too small but definitely not a big car either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mini-vans are the greatest . My mom always had one and took me and all my friends around and everyone remembers that van ! I would love a Mazda9 for the room because I currently have a Mazda6 ( smaller car ) and it has been great ! Plenty of room for 2 carseats in the back and my husband is 64 ? and still fits easily . On a side note-please have breakfast at Sweet Es when you are near Waikiki beach . It is AMAZING ! ! <p> Haha ! What timing ! ! We are living in Africa right now and will visiting the US in June and will purchase a new car to use while in the US and store when we are out of the country . Our old car is just too small now . The local cars are all built to be driven on the left side of the road , so we cant shop locally . Manufacturer websites just do n't  give me the information I want , so maybe the site you recommend will be helpful . We do n't  want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US , so if I can just walk in , know which vehicle I want , and buy it , that would be great . <p> RAV4 XLE by Toyota ! ! I have a white 2016 RAV4 XLE and I absolutely love it ! ! ! It is actually very spacious in the second row which I did n't  expect ! You should totally try to test drive one of them ! I do n't  think you 'll regret it = <p> I lOVE my Volvo XC wagon . It is 13 years old , has a ton of miles , and still has never had any problems . I am really into older cars that are worn in so I do n't  want to upgrade , but regardless , Volvo is one of the safest , most durable brand of cars . And a plus is that the wagons come with a large trunk and a dog net so Chauncey can come along easily for the ride ! ! Let me know if you have any questions about my car ! ! And best of luck ! = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that love is in the air . You guys are the perfect couple ? About the cars It depends on what you guys like , and what makes you comfortable . I personally love Audis but it depends on what you need ? <p> SO I have the Subaru Crosstrek and I absolutely LOVE it . I 've had it for about a year and a half . Its the most dependable and super spacious along with being cute = I have the leather interior to make it seem a little less rugged than normal Subarus . I hope you give it a try ! <p> Sidenote , how cute are you and David ? ! Such adorable photos especially for the holidays ! <p> I had three children in three years . I had a 3 year old , 18 month old , and a newborn . I do n't  know what I would have done without my minivan ! ! ! I have a Honda Odyssey and we have never had to do anything but maintenance and new tires . Kids are now 14,12 , and 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bought the new Honda HRV EX when it was released ( 2016 ) and its amazing ! Its not as big as the CRV but is so functional . It was my first new car I bought so I did a lot of research on all the cars in its class . I had older used cars in college and I had never bought an automatic car before I only drove manual sports cars , its definitely worth a look at ! The Honda Odyssey is also one of the most reliable minivans too , my family had one until everyone grew up ! Good luck , love your photos they are the sweetest to look at always ! <p> Hi Amber , I am so so happy for you = About your car plans : My parents have the Peugeot partner . I do n't  know if you actually can buy it in America since we live in Germany . But I really like this car , because it is high and has a lot of space in the back . We actually can put two adultsize bikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive . I hope you find your dream car . Best wishes <p> Awesome Hawaii its such a pretty place , I say more so if you are a sun , beach , sand lover ; ) . We have two little boys and we finally decided on the car that was perfect for our family , after looking for months we decided to get the Honda Pilot Elite 2017 . It has the look of a minivan inside as the second row seats have what they call captain chairs , it has a third row and all the fancy needs a BMW could possibly have , the kids have a TV back there , and the phone connection for both my husband and I are amazing ( meaning I can plug my iphone and be able to play pandora in the car ) . The panoramic sun roof its a hit for the boys , overall the best car I have ever had and I LOVE IT so so much . So check it out , the price its truly on point and its AMAZING family car in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they just came out but it was worth the wait . Good luck to you guys . <p> I had two Toyota Sienna mini vanstotal 18 years . We have three kids and if you want to bring along even one friend you need a van ! Plus as a volleyball mom we often carpooled to out of town games.parents , bags , kidslived my Sienna ! Now that the girls are all in university , I went the other way and drive a small Mazda 3 . Sporty without the sports car price . I 'd recommend both <p> Love these photos of you two ! So sweet ! For car recommendations , I 'm loving the Mazda X5 or X9 . We have the X5 and I love how nice it drives and that it comes stocked with some great features . This is our first Mazda and know for certain well get another one some day ! We also love Cadillac but the price tag on that is much more ! = <p> you can never go wrong with a Toyota .. the new Highlander is awesome &amp; so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like a good 15 years ) . if you get the premium package for them they are SO much nicer than you would expect ! ! with kids it just sort of makes a lot more sense to get a car that is n't too fancy or precious ( I always cringe when I see moms with BMWs or Audis &amp; there are crumbs &amp; dirt all grinded into the leather haha ) I also really trust Honda and some Nissan cars , but just always read the Consumer Reports before you buy = good luck ! <p> I have a Volkswagen UP with five doors . It is the most popular car in Copenhagen , Denmark , and I love it ! Spacious , environmentally friendly ( I know that is not the biggest concerns for Ameicans , but none the less , it will save you money ) ; great design and the size makes it easy to park everywhere &lt;3 Good luck on finding the perfect car ! &lt;3 x Carolinehttp : //www.silverstories.dk <p> I had a honda civic that I loved and sold when I moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outdoorsy lifestyle so I want my next car to be a rugged hatchback or some sort . I 'm a big fan or Subarus . I need space for tents , bikes , kayaks , etc . <p> Oh , I forgot to mention my mother in laws car : As a mother of five , she was/still is a minivan mom . She said she got so used to such a car that even now with all children being grown-ups she would n't want to miss is , since its so convenient . She purchased the newest version of the Renault Espace . The newest version looks smaller than the older version , yet , it has all the space you need on the inside ( + parking camera- yeah ! ) We have made use of her car several times before ( for moving , skying trips , road trips etc . ) . It is so easy to take out as many seats as possible in the back rows . It fits 8 people if needed . Everyone has their own seat and especially with childrens car seats this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the seat in the middle should your children ever start arguing = Perhaps this option fits your wishes of a minivan car better . Enjoy your time in Hawaii , Chloe . <p> Hey Amber . We bought the Nissan Quashqai for our current family of three . However , there is the also the Quashqai +2 , where you can add two additional seats in the back row or have a larger trunk space if not needed . Also it has a bird-view camera for parking which always comes in handy especially if one has not driven a car in a while . It has all the comfort of a minivan , I think , but the size of a small SUV . Maybe it fits your needs for the smaller car . Also , friends of ours with two kids bought the Volvo CX 60 . Very nice looking , lots of space , camera for parking , however a bit bigger in size . Considered one of the safest cars since the Swedish car manufacturers have fantastic ideas to make driving as safe as possible . Hope this is helpful .

If you 're too dang ugly without make up on because your face has been invaded , boil some hot water and either stick your face over the steam for a good ten minutes or dip the wash cloth in and lay it over your face while laying down .

Its like when you tell an angry person to calm down that usually just makes them want to grab a chair and chuck it at your face . No one wants to be told to calm down or to stop stressing . So maybe just go for a run and take a bath . Do whatever calms ya down . <p> 10 ) maybe you have raging hormones . I do n't  have a solution for that . so that just sucks , sorry . <p> 11 ) make an oatmeal and rose water paste , apply to your skin , wait fifteen minutes , then wash it off with cold water <p> 12 ) mix fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let it sit for 15-20 , rinse with fresh , cold water . this helps fight against any infections and bacteria <p> 13 ) I 've also heard that applying strawberry leaves OR tomatos to problem zones , ( I hate the words zits and pimples .. but I just said them anyways ) so apply them to zits and let it sit for 15-20 minutes .

But when you do find one , I say splurge , splurege , splurge ! <p> I 've noticed you said you do n't  like to wear bikinis and that you and your husband did n't  move in together til after your wedding .

@@98069922 @2269922/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> When we were at lunch together for our anniversary we tried not to talk work stuff ( its sometimes hard not to when you work , parent , and do married life with your husband ! ) and one of the things we talked about was starting a new hobby together . Sometimes at the end of the day we end up watching TV shows til 1am but we want to have an activity we both love to do together . David has always been the cook in the family . He makes us dinners all the time and when I try it usually does n't turn out so great lol . So we are going to try cooking and baking together and learn to make new things ! Especially recreate yummy baked goods we try in all the countries we travel to . ( I have a favorite pastry that I ate every day while in Croatia ! ) <p> So last week when we got back from Australia we got lots of groceries for the week and cooked up a meal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kabobs , and a fruit platter . We used these new platters we got from Etsy the woman who owns this Etsy shop makes all of these pieces by hand and then paints them . We happened upon them randomly and both fell in love with them especially since that color blue is perfect for the ocean vibe in Hawaii . We have loved trying new fruits while being here and we constantly have bowls of cut up fruit so now we have these pretty dishes to eat them off of ! <p> When Etsy asked us to participate in their What Makes Us Different campaign I of course wanted to join ! I think its so important to appreciate differences we all have . Whether it is different lifestyles , family dynamics , parenting methods , anything ! David and I have our own family dynamics that are different than most of our friends and family . Some are more simple things like the fact that he is the cook in the family and others are things like the fact that we work together , co parent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to learn lots of lessons together . Most people are not with their spouse all day and usually not in so many different life scenarios dealing with tantrums and then cleaning the home and cooking and then answering emails and working on our new business . If something goes wrong its hard to not get stressed and have it bleed into the other areas . We have had to have a lot of sit down chats about how we can improve communication and work on these things to make sure we are being good parents , business owners , and spouses all at the same time . We have gotten into a good groove but we definitely know how to get on each other 's nerves = <p> It has also been really fun to observe all of the different parenting styles of our friends . Just last night we were eating dinner and I was telling David some things I love that our friend Hayley does with her daughter . One reason I love my girlfriends was anytime we are together we would usually end up letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and/or why they are a good mom . <p> Differences give us a chance to see new perspective and possibly improve little bits of our own lives by finding inspiration in others ! <p> What a beautiful post ! The pottery colors are so breathtaking I had to order . We were married in Hawaii and These will be perfect for our anniversary dinner . He will definitely be surprised . Can you post the recipes ! ! Enjoy your time in Hawaii . <p> I LOVE that yallboufht some pottery ! ! ! Itll last forever = and so beautiful ! ! I also LOVE and am so thankful that you featured Etsy ! I am a huge fan of Etsy , and all the creative ( and friendly ) geniuses who deal on Etsy ! ! !

Not many couples could do that = <p> Amber this is so sweet ! I can imagine it would be tricky to be with your spouse for work and home stuff . When you said you were talking about what your friend Hayley does , it got me thinking I would love to know what little traditions and cute things you guys do with your kids . I remember you mentioned many posts ago that at the end of the day you guys tell your kids what favorite memory you had with them from the day . I just thought that was sweet and am curious if there 's more little things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on building each other up ! I 'm sure as a mom , you question everything and think everyone is doing better , so to have someone you admire tell you what you 're doing well at , I can only imagine that is a major day-maker ! <p> Thank you for posting this ! ! My boyfriend and I certainly have had a few sit down chats . We know how important communication is and he is one who internalizes everything where I just say everything I feel at that moment ( I 'm hungry , I 'm cold , I 'm tired , etc. ) lol ! Its an adjustment merging two lives together but I would n't have it any other way . You both look stunning and so very happy . Thank you for being an inspiration to us all xoxo <p> I just love everything about your blog = The pics especially , but your thoughts at the end do fill up my day = This is actually the only blog I daily check and your blog posts make my days brighter = I know it sounds cheesy , but they do = Happy New Year gorgeous people =

I use the word freely as I always have to describe an " idiot " . Since when did gays get to have the word faggot ? Who decided that it always has to be used as that derogatory term ? Can it not mean " bundle of sticks " anymore ? I think it is silly , personally . I realize that I should work on not saying the word because I can see why it would offend some people .

You had a huge post about getting mad at people for using adderall inappropriately , but breaking a rule is breaking a rule and i know for a fact that the LDS church does n't  stand for bullying other peoples struggles . just a thought you might want to consider . you say some very hurtful things in your blog and you do n't  seem to be very aware of how you are coming across .

ARCONA Magic White Ice I mentioned this a couple days ago but it is my favorite hydrator and I know I have said a million times before how much I love ARCONA products but they really are my favvvorite . I put this on every day before I do my make up and I do my hair while I let it set it . It is really light though and goes perfectly under make up . <p> 2 . Coconut Oil I am going to be doing a post soon on all the things I use coconut oil for because there are like a million but one of my favorites is I put it on my face BEFORE I shower so the steam sets it in my skin and then before I get out I rinse it off . It makes my skin feel like a million bucks . <p> 3 . TARTE Pure Maracuja Oil This stuff is amazing and I have honestly noticed a difference since I started using it . I unfortunately am already getting fine lines under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so I put a tiny bit this under my eyes before my make up and it helps keep that area really moisturized .

GLAM GLOW Thirsty Mud Hydrating Treatment I read tons of reviews on this stuff and how awesome it was so I decided to give it a go and it is pretttty darn amazing . It is a super hydrating mask that you can wear as a mask for 20 or so minutes or leave on over night . For the last month I have been wearing it to bed every night and love how my skin feels in the morning . <p> 6 . ARCONA Raspberry Triad Pads If you have been reading my blog a while I am sorry you have to hear me talk about these again but by far thee best toner , ever !

Well I always love how my make up looks after the steam has kind of moistened it all .. and I feel like these essentially do the same thing . I have the little two pack of travel sizes and I have one at my vanity I use after I do my make up and then I always have one in my purse to use while I am out and about to keep my skin hydrated . <p> 8 . ARCONA Eye Dew I have been using this for a couple of years now and it is something I allllways have to have . I love putting it under my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick serum and literally makes your under eye feel so dewy and amazing . <p> I recently started using a serum and I 'm just overwhelmed after the first use !

I was scared to try oils on my face at first and thought they would just seep into my pores and make me break out but they just hydrate ! Sometimes if you are really oily you need hydration and your face is trying to produce moisture because you 're not hydrating it so if you have oily skin I would say at least give it a try ! = <p> Amber , you are so stunning !

I actually use it to wash my face-stay with me here = I melt it in my hands and in small circular motions rub it all over my face ( it is great at removing makeup and maskara since oil dissolves oil ) . I then wet a washcloth with water as warm and I can stand it and press it to my face for a few seconds to steam my pores open . I do that 3-4 times before using the wash cloth to wipe away all of the disgustingness . Three times a week I add sugar to the oil to exfoliate and I follow the whole routine with a cold water rinse . My skin is soft , moisturized , and blemish free ! Thank you for introducing me to this little miracle in a jar , I do n't  know what I ever did without it !

Unfortunately this particular one is out of stock now but I have been loving this and this one and can not decide which I should order next ! They both are such classics and especially being a new mom I have plenty of greasy hair days where a hat is the perfect go to . <p> Hope you guys had a good weekend !

We had the best weekend here in San Diego though . even though I was super bummed because I had been looking forward to picking strawberries for WEEKS and the guy told us Saturday they would be open so we had planned on going Saturday Luckily I called to check the hours before we left and he said they closed early for the season !

My friend defends me . Some chick keeps blabbing on . So my friend stands up and says , " uh , you 're a bitch " Conversation ends . <p> - Sorry but , that is awesome .

Along the side of the lake just off the bridge there is this huge , bright red , arched tree and all the leaves are falling off and with the view of the city its magical . - The next day my parents came in town and we celebrated Ros birthday weekend = We made a video of her birthday and I will share it soon . Some of the clips are my very favorite because they just show her personality soooo perfectly ! We got pinatas ( mostly for Atticus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his sissy on her birthday . We also saw Arrival with my parents over the weekend and I thought it was so good ! <p> We have 10 days left in New York City ! I am getting sad to leave the city but am really excited for the change so I am looking forward to December 1st and our new chapter . We have an announcement coming soon ( nooo I am NOT pregnant ) and also an update on our home build ! So stay tuned = But I think I am feeling okay about leaving the city because I know we will be back a lot for meetings , events , and just to visit ! This will always be a special city for us to come back and visit . <p> This choker I basically wear every day if not by itself then I layer it with another . It is total 90s vibe and I love it . I remember a few years ago even looking at a picture of me back in the day wearing a choker and thinking " HAHA whyy ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how that works . <p> I have seriously missed your outfit posts so much ! ! This sweater looks so incredibly cozy . I cant believe you guys only have 10 more days left in NYC . It must feel so bittersweet ! ! I 'm sure MANY amazing things are to come ! ! xo <p> Hello Amber , I write from Colombia . Im Ana Mar+a and for the winter vacation I planning to travel to Barcelona . I 'm so confused because I do n't  know what kind of clothes specifically use . I 'm 20 years old and my style is n't to elegant rather more fresh and relax style , I normaly use for example , NewBalance tennis , Vans shoes , Merrel sport shoes and just a little bit ankle boots and normal boots . I want trying to combine my " fresh and relaxing style " with a elegant style and I also love leather jackets because I like an alternative style too . So You can realize what I am so confused , I do n't  how to dress on my winter vacations in Europa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you for you time , ( you blog its amazing ) <p> Obsessed with this outfit !

My boyfriend is australian = hope you enjoy those perfect places over there that i am looking forward to see one day . = have a beautiful week . Waiting to hear that new announcement ! : * : * <p> Hi Amber ! OMG , your time in NYC is coming to an end so soon !

Would love to check your shoes but the link does not seem to take me to the right spot , could you check it out ? Enjoy your last 10 days in NYC . Big hugs from London , Julie

Since I am not ready to try a new color I went with a new hairstyle that is out of the norm for me = I usually always have my hair down or in some sort of side braid where I can pull it in front so having my hair all the way up is rare ! Today I 'm showing you how to do this bubble pony tail <p> 1 . Pull your hair up into a ponytail at the crown of your head and tie it off with a thick elastic so it stays in place . I use these from Sally Beauty . <p> 2 . Softly tease your hair with a brush or comb I used my Wet Brush found here . <p> 3 . Tie a clear elastic around the pony tail about two to three inches down and pull on the bubble to make it stand out more . <p> 4 . Continue to make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are done ! <p> Sally Beauty is challenging people to try something new whether it is new lip stick , new hair color , whatever ! If you share your new look you will be entered in a sweepstakes with a chance to win a trip to New York where you will get a makeover by a TV stylist .

@@98069977 @2269977/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Today I am showing you guys how to do this fun , twisted hairstyle that I love ! I will be using the Ion Whisper Quiet Lite Dryer from Sally Beauty to diffuse my hair which will help give your hair a really good texture for this style and help to hold the twists together . This is my new favorite blow dryer it really is SO quiet which is amazing because I am usually blow drying my hair and getting ready during As nap times and now it is no problem . Here is the full step by step on how to achieve this look <p> 1 . Apply a generous amount of mousse to wet hair and blow dry the hair using the diffuser . <p> 2 . Twist a section from each side of your part and pull back and secure with a bobby pin . <p> 3 . Take the remaining hair into two sections and twist them about two three inches down . ( does not matter which direction ! ) <p> 4 . Put both twists together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate the two . <p> 5 . Now take your two new sections and twist them , split them in half , and pull them apart just like you did previously . <p> 6 . Continue doing that the rest of the way down and then secure with a rubber band . <p> 7 . Pull the twists apart to make it appear thicker and fuller and you are done ! ! <p> I hope you guys like it and make sure you go get this Ion Whisper Blow Dryer during the month of November so you can get your free tote and gifts ! I got the red quilted holiday tote , a brush , Ion glosser and a comb that was much needed ! During Sally Beauty 's Thanksgifting event you can receive the tote and your choice of 3 Ion hair care products or Ion Brushes ( mix or match ) with the purchase of a full size Ion styling tool . There are over 40 other gifts with purchase available this month so make sure you go into a Sally Beauty or shop online and treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing tutorials and for sharing your life with us ! <p> You also mentioned posting a tutorial all about extensions and I cant wait for that !

You seem like such a kind person and I really appreciate all the tutorials ! I 'm hoping to one day have a modeling career aswell . <p> Hey Amber . I adore this hair style , but I 'm having a lot of trouble replicating it on my own . My end result looks nothing like yours . Would it be possible to have a few more photos of what the hair looks like during the process ( I think my trouble lies around step #4. ) or perhaps a video ? I noticed some other ladies thinking a video may be helpful to them as well . <p> LOVE your hair blogs &amp; use your tips everyday ! I have long hair like you &amp; the one thing I am struggling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your back . I can do all the braids with no problem when they come over one of my shoulders . But for this one , my arms are n't  long enough to braid it straight down my back without turning it to one side . I usually end up with a big turn in the braid about 5 inches down . Does that make sense ? <p> Hi Amber , Can you make a tuto on how your bleach your hair yourself with the products you use ? That would be very helpful ! Sometimes , and I speak by experience , it s better to do it yourself than by a hairdresser you don t know ! ! Many Many thanks . Hope you will answer

I love how they both turned out and Rosie 's room quickly became the hang out spot because we all just love being in there . Rosie 's room suits her so well ! I love pink everything and since she has such a sweet personality we went with a very girly theme . We worked with Joss and Main to get most of the amazing pieces in there . I think my favorite piece is her light fixture . I have already said this before on here but that is always my favorite part of the decorating process getting the light fixture up ! Just ties everything together . A lot of you had been asking about her new rug too ! We had a shag rug in there but it would she 'd evvverywhere and it was super annoying so we got a new one from Joss &amp; Main and I am in love with it ! I also love the fur rug to layered on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our room . We previously had a vintage wooden dresser ( that I do love ) but as soon as we got the white one in there it felt like a breath of fresh air and so much cleaner . I think for small spaces white is the way to go so it feels bigger and more open . I always have to have color though so I love this rug from Joss and Main and the art and pillows for pops of color . <p> I will do a video tour of our apartment soon so you can see the layout and my closet and everything . I love our apartment so much ! ! ! Going to miss it for sure . <p> Hi Amber ! I love your style ! Just curious how do you keep your babies from getting into everything ?

I love the simplicity of the design ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video tour , looking forward to take a peek into your closet . You have such a great wardrobe . I 've always wondered how you manage to store all of your clothes/baby items . I 'm struggling myself , never enough space ! <p> Looks amazing , of course ! Such great inspo as we are about to re-do our master and add a nursery for the first time to our home = I love the bed and how it has an " end " to it , I am searching the internet for something so similar ! I did click on the Joss and Main link but that bed is n't listed there just a similar blue one that 's tufted . Is that bed from Joss and Main or is it from somewhere else ? Thank you ! <p> Oh my gosh Rosies room is so darling ! I love how you decorate . I cant wait to see all the fun you have decorating your new home too ! Also would love to see an apartment tour video so I 'll be on the lookout = <p> Gorgeous Room Amber ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I love having all the basics because it just makes getting ready easier .

I love a good black bag almost all of my bags and diaper bags are black . I love that they go with everything and I can just grab and go . When I got this bag in person I was so surprised because I loved it online but in person it is EVEN BETTER . The flap is suede and the body is leather but the best part is the pockets I do n't  know why I got so excited about the back pocket of this thing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poppins and look small but somehow just hold a million things . And this one could literally go with anything , I am obsessed , so do n't  be surprised if you see it on repeat . <p> On a random note , I went to see a medical spa yesterday because these dark spots under my eyes that I got during pregnancy are not going away and after chatting with the woman there , we set up a plan to get rid of the dark spots and she also gave me some great products that I am really praying work ! I go in tomorrow- for a photofacial and crossing my fingers I see results so I will keep you guys updated because I had a lot of you pregnant moms who said you also got dark spots ! And after I use the products for a while I will share with you guys my thoughts on them but just wanted to say to those who I have promised a post on dark spots , that I have not forgotten ! = xo <p> I am loving both looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look put-together and stylish as a mom !

I am using the Plugged In Professional Turbo Dryer ( on sale ) and the Plugged In Pink Gem Flat Iron ( also on sale ) if you are looking to get a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools. - Here are the steps on how I used these tools to get my curls .. <p> 1 . Start with clean , blow dried hair . If your hair is frizzy , run the straightener through large chunks just to smooth it a bit before curling . <p> 2 . Take 1 inch sections and clamp the straightener on the hair and turn it to the right as you run it down the length of the hair. - If your hair is long you may need to hold onto the ends of the hair to prevent them from slipping out . The more you turn the straightener , the tighter the curl will be . If your hair does slip out half way through the curl , pick up where the curl left off but you do not need to recurl the entire strand again , that will just cause further and unnecessary damage . <p> 3 . Do that to your entire head and then take large sections and lightly run the straightener over large chunks of just the ends to give it a beachy look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Straightener Curl Barefoot Blonde by Amber Fillerup Clark " like every week.Your story-telling style is awesome , keep up the good work ! And you can look our website about proxy free list . <p> Hello.I would love for you to try an all natural plant based hair care line called Monat . The reviews are 5 stars on this . I am a distributor for Monat &amp; would love to get your feedback . I have been a hairstylist for over 20 years &amp; never used anything like it .

Thanks ! Valerie Peacock <p> A friend of mine just curled her hair with a straightener for a wedding this weekend and it looked amazing !

The acidity in them can get rid of acne as well as shrink your pores ! - How to use it : You can apply tomatoes several ways for a facial you can slice them and lay down with the slices placed on the problem areas for about 15-20 minutes or you can scoop out the insides and apply to your face , which I find to be a bit more messy ! <p> 3 . Aspirin : Aspirin contains salicylic acid which is the most commonly used ingredient in acne treatments . It will clean out the pores and exfoliate clearing up acne. - How to use it : So to use this you will get a small bowl and put in just enough water to dissolve the aspirin pills and make a paste . You can use 5-7 uncoated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . When the pills look soft , you can crush them to speed the process . Then I like to add a little bit of honey which has antibacterial properties and will also help with the acne . I just add about a teaspoon or two . Then you apply to your face for 10-15 minutes . *you can also use this without honey as a spot treatment . <p> 4 . Nutmeg and Cinnamon : This is one of my all time favorites . ( I talked about it a long time ago , here ) Nutmeg has major anti-fungal and antibacterial properties that will work as an astringent and clean out your pores . The cinnamon will bring the blood to the surface which will plump your skin as well as dry out any problem areas. - How to use it : - Mix 1 1/2 tsp. honey , 1 tsp. cinnamon , and 1 tsp. nutmeg into a bowl until it becomes a paste . Apply to face and leave on for 20-30 minutes . <p> *Hope you guys enjoy ! Comment if you try any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But remember like any acne treatment it may need to be used more than once depending on how bad the problem area is = - when I break out I usually pick one of these and do it 3-4 times in a week and it clears it up . However , if you are needing just one big one cleared up really quick for an event or something the next day , do the Aspirin one without honey as a spot treatment and leave it on a little longer ! Xx <p> Hi , I have a very painful and gross pimple on my chin right now and I hate it . I am preparing for my sisters wedding and this acne is not helping at all . I 'm trying out your aspirin and tomato suggestions and I will let you know if it worked for me . Thanks for sharing ! <p> I would love to hear more about the daily food you eat to stay healthy with great skin and body and just overall glowing image . Maybe some good healthy recipes ? what is a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do you take vitamins ? <p> Hi Amber , these masks are great &amp; have been using the cinnimon &amp; nutmeg one &amp; just tried the aspirin &amp; honey mask last night ! I was wondering if there 's any nightly masks that you do to sleep in that also help skin ? <p> Oh my gosh ! The Pepto-Bismol thing is so cool ! I always hated Pepto-Bismol solely because I drank it when I felt nauseous , but now maybe this remedy will give me a reason to give it a second chance . Im excited to try it . Oh , and the Asprin one too . ( I 've heard of similar remedies but I was always a little dubious . ) <p> I tired the cinnamon and honey nutmeg mask last night . I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin , however my face burned and itched and turned tomato red after leaving it on for 22 minutes . This morning it was still very red and itchy . Has this happend to anyoen else while using cinnamon and nutmeg on their skin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . <p> Although I have not personally experienced this , I 've heard that sometimes cinnamon can have this affect on some peoples skin . If your skin in sensitive to cinnamon , try using honey and tumeric spice instead . Just keep in mind the tumeric can leave your skin looking a little yellow if you do n't  rinse it completely . It wont stain your skin permanently , but if you try this mixture , I do n't  want it to scare you the first time you use it ! Itll wash off = I hope this helps ! <p> Oh thanks for sharing the alternative ! Yeah I have heard of that happening , I mean when I do it it definitely stings but I do n't  mind a sting if I know it is doing something ! But I have not experienced my face still being red the next day ! Sorry that happened , definitely try what Kristen recommended ! = <p> I am a huge fan of the honey/nutmeg/cinnamon mask ! I do this a couple times a week , and it has transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly recommend it . I usually buy it from amazon . The brand is called Wedderspoon its organic , and it has great antibacterial and moisturizing properties . I 'm loving your skincare posts lately ! I also tried the sugar scrub and love it , its worked really well for me ! <p> These are great suggestions- thank you ! I think I will try them because I will get a problem area now and then . Another idea is if you already have a zit , putting tea tree oil on it to heal faster and reduce the appearance of a blemish or scar . It works really well ! Like $8 a bottle at a health food store .

Not only that but on Monday I got out of the shower and decided hmm . I want lush blunt ends ( on my hair ) like tuula ( from **25;600;TOOLONG ) so I took my scissors and snipped 2.5 inches off . My ends look amazing BUT my hair feels so short and fugly . Why did I do that ? Gosh . No one knows , but I blame tuula. ( just kidding I worship her ) .

@@98070016 @2270016/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> As many of you know I am a hair stylist .. I am not currently doing hair but I was for the past 4 years or so and at my salon I charge $55 for a deep condition treatment . When girls ask for it I always say that I am happy to do it ( obviously , it is business for me ) but I also recommend just buying a deep conditioner for the around that same price and that way you can do them at home weekly by yourself . Some people just want the salon experience with the nice head massage and blow out but if you would rather get more bang for your buck buying a deep conditioner is the way to go . The only problem I found was that , in my salon I would put them under the dryer for 15-20 min for the heat to help open the cuticle and let all the nutrients in , and at home I did n't  have a dryer . So I rigged one . I know different versions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> I wash my hair with hot water in the sink with shampoo like normal , then I towel dry it just so its not dripping you want it wet but not where its going to drip down your neck- then I put my deep conditioner on , clip it in a ballerina bun , wrap saran wrap around it ( helps lock in the heat ) sit under my blow dryer/running shoe contraption , then rinse with cool water . It is my favorite thing to do for my hair because it makes it so silky smooth and it feels so healthy afterwards . So here is how I " set up my dryer " <p> DISCLAIMER : I 100% realize this is the most ghetto thing ever and quite hilarious but ya know who is seriously gon na go buy a hair dryer ? And I am definitely not holding my blow dryer up for 20 minutes haha so this is what works for now = <p> Pretty easy right ? And it works like a charm ! ! I use my NuMe blow dryer on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ min ! I also shampoo with my NuMe shampoo which I just got and love and then I always switch off with deep conditioners so my hair does n't  get too used to it but right now I am also using my NuMe deep conditioner .. it will make your hair so silky whenever I use it and I am washing it out I can never tell if I still have conditioner in there or if it is really just that silky and it really does just make your hair a dream not to mention it is SO reasonably priced and lasts you forever ! ! <p> This is AH . MAZING ! Thank you for your generosity in sharing ! Question : Do you leave an opening in the saran wrap for the hot air to get in ? And how close should you be to the dryer without it being damaging ? <p> My husband came home the other day while I was trying this out , you should have seen the look on his face ! He just shook his head and said that he does n't  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard ! I suppose it was a funny scene , I was sitting on the floor of the bathroom with plastic wrap around my head with a hairdryer in a tennis shoe blowing at me . My dogs were laying on the floor next to me and I was reading a magazine . Hahaha ! Men just do n't  get it ! It worked like a million bucks , though ! I did it with coconut oil and my hair was so shiny and smooth . Thanks for the tip ! ! <p> Oh Amber you are wonderful and honest and that 's why I love reading your blog . And putting the hairdryer in the shoe is pure genius , I 'm SO gon na try thatand I will do it , bracing for an OMG moment from my husband too haha = <p> HI Amber ! I love your blog ! I miss all your tuturials , but I love this one too ! You have been such an inspiration to me and I love how you share all your health secrets . I appreciate it soo much . Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before but I do n't  usually I only do when they get really bad and I am going to get new ones anyways I will try it just to preserve them for a couple more weeks ! It works good sometimes and then sometimes not , its hard because extensions are temperamental and you never know what chemicals are in them ! I would say do it if yours have gotten really bad ! xo <p> I am soooo excited to try this ! ! Where do you get your conditioner ? I 'm too anxious to order it . Plus also another question.I have A TON of hair and its really long , but its curly , frizzy , and breaks easily . Way thicker at the roots than at the ends . Solutions ? Help ? Please ? Haha . <p> I just get mine from online ! ! And hm as far as frizziness goes have you tried using any Moroccan or argon oils ? I think that would help you a lot ! Also try this deep condition but just put it mostly on the ends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! xo <p> Hey Lisa ! ! Yeah this would be perfect for you then ! ! It really works so much better than just sitting in the shower with it on ! ! Hope you like it thanks so much for your sweet comment ! Sending my love ! <p> Haha thanks girl . Hm good question I am not sure ! I use Biolage and NuMe Shampoo and my hair gets really greasy and I think those both do the job so maybe try one of those ! And for deep conditioning I would say to put the conditioner only on mid strand to ends and leave the roots untouched ! ! = xx <p> This cracked me up for some reason . Totally genius , though . Haha ! I do n't  know why I was laughing at the picture of your shoe dryer contraption and you just chilling underneath it . No wonder men think we are crazy . I am always coming up with weird tactics and my husband just rolls his eyes and says , " Whatever it takes , honey . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

I know I am the same way my arm is like dying after a few minutes especially if I worked out that day ! ! You will love it seriously ! You might look ridiculous like I do buutttt your hair will love you = xo <p> Question , I do n't  usually use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends ) because I find that my hair goes super flat ( which i hate ! ) . Amber , do yo have a way around this ? I know my hair is super dry because it breaks a lot , so I 'd probably benefit from a deep condition , but the flat hair issue is such a bummer ! <p> Hey girl ! ! Well honestly this is totally from experience but I think when my hair is healthier it has more volume and the dryer it is the flatter it looks but that could just be my hair .. I would try doing a deep condition from mid strand to ends just to see how it works for you and I would also spray Big Sexy Hair Root Lift spray on your roots and blow dry upside down ! I have tried a LOT of root boosters but I like that one best ! If your hair is really thick I would have your hair dresser thin it out a little near the roots which I know sounds scary but I do that for most of my clients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I would especially do that if you are n't  wanting layers ! I would try those things and see if any of those work for you ! xo <p> OH also I will wash my hair and then when its about 50% dry I put it up in a twisted top not/ballerina bun and use the fabric hair bands so it does n't  give it any creases and I sleep like that then when I wake up it has TONS of volume and natural messy waves which I love . So you could try that also which is a healthier alternative to blow drying upside down ! <p> Well look at me . I just realized that I 'm totally judging this before I even try it ! I 'm just gon na go ahead and do it this weekend , and I 'll let you know if I get flat or full hair afterwards . You have n't steered me wrong yet ! PS I am in love with sugar and teatree oil face scrubs So refreshing in the morning ! Luv your blog so much ! <p> I also do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to going brunette and now I am back blonde .

This is great for the front of your hair that you can see but what do you do to trim the back ? ? Every tutorial I find on this type of trimming never mentions the back of the head/hair . Help ?

I always start by using Arcona Eye Dew around and under my eyes this product I have seen the most results with . i am only 22 so I do n't  have major wrinkles or anything but after my make up has been on for a while I can definitely see some small lines and this product eliminates that and let 's your make up sit on top ! Which also helps keep your skin nice and healthy because its like the make up is n't even touching your skin and meanwhile it is moisturizing and filling in lines , pores , and wrinkles ! Ah it is just my favorite ! I could literally talk about this product for hours . <p> 2 . I then use a primer on my face .. I use the- Benefit Porefessional- I use this because it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oily after ! It also fills in the pores on and around your nose or where ever you have pores ! I love it . <p> 3 . I lightly use Revlon Photo Ready Foundation- I have been using this for over a year and a half now and I am in love . I cant find anything I love more , foundation wise . I say lightly- because- a little bit goes a long ways with this , I start on my cheek bones and do around my eyes and then blend that outward , you really do not need a lot of this product , it spreads so well . <p> - <p> - 4 . I then lightly dust my face with Bare Minerals Matte Foundation .. this is another reason I use my liquid foundation sparingly ! I love the way the matte foundation ( not sure why its called a foundation it is literally just a powder to me ) lays on my face and locks in my base make up . I can go a whole day without touching up my make up if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say this is the biggest must have of all my products ! It is amazing . And if I am ever just running errands and do n't  want to get ready all the way I will just dust this on my face and add mascara and I am good to go . <p> Hey I am so happy I found your weblog , I really found you by error , while I was researching on Askjeeve for something else , Anyhow I am here now and would just I 'm not sure where to start . Do you have any points or suggestions ? Many thanks <p> LOVE Revlon Photo Ready , I think it is the best foundation you can get at a drugstore and I have tried all kinds of expensive foundation . I picked up the purple Lash Blast mascara after reading your last makeup post and love it . Dries out a little quickly though . Will have to try the BM Matte , thanks for the tips ! <p> Thanks for sharing ! Its always great to hear other beauty tips and what other girls are wearing . Can I ask , how long do you use your mascara before you buy a new one ? I 'm trying to figure this out still , just wondering what you do ! =

To be honest , I could n't care less about the food the invitations the sign in book etc . My mom did the invites , I just basically saw them and said , " oh that looks great ! " ( I am so lucky I had my parents to take the reigns ) David and I at first wanted to make our own food and our own cake luckily my parents talked us out of that .. I would have been stressed out of my brains right now if we had ended up doing that . I am still laughing at the idea it seemed so good and easy at the time . Parents know best . <p> I only cared about David and I being happy , my dress , the flowers at the wedding , the photos , and weirdly .. my cake topper . That probably sounds like just about everything haha , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just not true . <p> I have a very distinct idea of how I want my flowers at the wedding if flowers werent so expensive I would have quadruple what I am already having and my whole reception would look like a fairly land . or something . I am praying it all turns out how I am picturing it in my head . I also had an exact idea in my head of how I wanted my dress , so I got it custom made and I love it . And I reeeealllly wanted elephant cake toppers the only ones out there are super expensive , so David and I went and got clay and molded them one night and let me say , they are adorable and just what I wanted . <p> I keep randomly getting caught up in all the madness and small details that I get all stressed out . I need to remember to just chill out and enjoy this time because it is only going to happen once . And at the end of the day , if it is pouring snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls go flat , my make up gets smudged , or whatever . we will still be Mr. and Mrs. David Clark en route to the Bahamas . <p> here is your one and only sneak peak = my wedding pics part 1 ( there will probably be 4 parts haha ) will be posted at 8:30 this friday ! <p> A picture of a screen is all you get today ! Look Friday night to see more = <p> - walking around Ikea after our formal shoot with our photographer <p> - I refused to take off my flower crown that day ! <p> PDA <p> temple lights <p> Our cake topper ! ! This was right when we finished molding them , pre sanding and painting <p> Just got our marriage license ! ! <p> - He looks 10 times better with that ring . <p> Look at this amazing stamp David made for our wedding ? !

But then I keep coming back to the thought that this special day is for me and my fiance it does n't  have to be some grand party . Thanks for the advice = xx <p> I 'm confused , so you already got married ? or did you do all the photos a few weeks before ? if you did them a few weeks before , did you at least do a " first look " portion of the shoot since he s not seeing you for the first time in your dress the day of the wedding ? I 've never heard of doing the shoot weeks before the wedding . <p> I 'm confused , so you already got married ? or did you do all the photos a few weeks before ? if you did them a few weeks before , did you at least do a " first look " portion of the shoot since he s not seeing you for the first time in your dress the day of the wedding ?

@@98070059 @2270059/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> David and I decided to road trip to San Francisco this weekend so while I was at work on Friday David packed for me and got all of our things ready and picked me up from work and we were on our way ! <p> If you have been following along on my instagram ( IG : amberfillerup ) you have probably seen some of our pics along the way . <p> We brought sleeping bags and we slept in the car ( only for one night and stayed in a dirt cheap hostel/hotel one night ) and we even brought cereal and milk and a stove with this camping food David has . We are currently saving majority of our money for big trips out of the country . We are hoping to make as many as we can this year so we decided to make this one an adventure , plus we have more fun this way . For us , we would rather go on 12 vacations and do it dirt cheap than go on 5 vacations and splurge . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like at all . I mean we could have gotten a nice hotel had we wanted to , but we figure we have our whole lives to be older and do vacations the ritzy way .. ( nicer hotels , rental cars , nice restaurants , etc ) but while we are young we want to be little- adventurers- and stay in hostels and take buses and subways and sleep in our car and eat in hole in the wall places and just be wild and young and fit in as many trips as we can ! So that is kinda what we are doing ! <p> These pics are the pictures from our camera from the first day ! We did tons of walking and found that parking rates are freaking insane in this city . We also went into Chinatown and explored and found a cute little restaurant called Chinatown Restaurant on 744 Washington St. and they had a darling balcony you could eat on with romantic lights and pretty greenery . The food was good ( I am not picky , so do n't  take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the setting . We were the only ones on the balcony and it was super romantic , so if you are in the area I definitely suggest going ! <p> you guys are seriously the cutest ! I love following all your adventures = and SF is the best- so many fun things to do there ! oh and i was wondering where your husbands jean jacket is from .. my husband would totally love it ! <p> Good points ! My husband and I just got married in September and were going to Fiji in two weeks ( you 've been , right ? I need more details ) and Portugal for three weeks in July . We just want to travel , travel , travel , and travel some more before we settle down and have kids . I need to be more adventurous , though . LOL Brandon ( my husband ) is willing to eat anywhere , and while I 'm not as picky as my sister , I am way more picky than Brandon ! <p> We want to take a road trip up to Portland ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seattle . I keep going back and forth between driving and taking the train , but a true road trip means driving ! <p> Chandra ! ! OH MY GOSH ! ! ! You are going to Fiji ? ! ? ! K please if you are in Nadi , go on the Robinson Crusoe Trip ! ! Google it , it was my favorite little weekend trip and it is for a good price too ! Also you have to sky dive and go to Mango Bay ! ! ! I am so excited for you ! ! ! Sounds like you guys travel a lot , that is amazing ! We are trying to as much as we can ! Anyways , so excited for your Fiji adventure ! ! I went for 7 weeks and loved every second ! <p> I love that12 inexpensive trips rather than 5 ritzy trips . I guess Ive never really thought about it that way , but I concur.Im planning to move to Europe in the next few months , and taking advantage of inexpensive trips is one thing I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Its cool that you slept in your car- I hope you parked somewhere safe though ! Youll have years to stay in swanky hotels , might as well do it for cheap while you are young &amp; do n't  have back pain haha ! <p> I love San Fran but havent been there in a couple of years . Did you get to see the sea lions basking down by Fishermans Wharf ? What I love about that city is the fact that every street let 's you experience a new culture . Awesome ! I saw your IG pics , looks like you two had a lot of fun .

So we did and they were as good as they look you need to try the fruity pebble donut asap ! Our donut outing was kind of our last hurrah .. now we are trying to eat healthy and get in shape ! We went to a spin class tonight and luckily our gym is a mile away so we end up working out and running a mile DOUBLE WHAMMY . Our gym also has a steam room so I have been steaming every night and I have been lovvving what its been doing for my skin ! After a couple days in LA my skin started to get so dry so it felt good to get back to my steam room = <p> Yesterday was Davids birthday and since we do n't  do gifts ( we do trips instead ) we booked plane tickets to Norway which we found for DIRT CHEAP ( $138 cheap ) ! I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I had to share again . We are still in the works of planning the rest of the trip but I definitely want to go to Fillerup , Denmark since obviously that is where my family comes from . So we will probably make a visit there as well . Planning trips is one of my favorite things in the world to do ( sometimes I plan vacations I know we cant take and make full on itineraries just for fun , weird but fun to me ) so I have been giddy planning our next Europe adventure . <p> PS I also posted the tutorial for the hairstyle in the first photo !

A few other people have said they found similar deals ( this is for a one way ! ) so try and see if it is still there ! Basically what we do is type in NYC ( pulls from EWR , LGA , and JFK ) and then type in Everywhere ( pulls from literally anywhere in the country ) and then for dates we select the entire month of whatever month we are traveling , for instance this time it was May so we selected the entire month of may . Once we did that we knew we wanted somewhere in Europe so the cheapest place to come up for Europe was Norway for $138 so that is what we booked !

We are able to take so many trips for cheap right now because we both travel for work and have tons of airline points but those are going to run out soon , haha ! Will have to keep this in mind : ) . http : //www.amemoryofus.com <p> Oh my goodness ! I need to borrow that yellow sweater ( lol ) my husband and I are going to Jamaica and that would be the perfect thing to wear on the way down there ! I cant wait to try that hairstyle while we are on vacation . It will look beautiful with a tropical flower pinned on the side by the bun .

You can always decide to just be happy . <p> Jackie ! I actually got it at Costco for like 12 bucks or something ! Its not camelback brand its a knock off version but it works great and I love mine !

You guys should go get some and we need to go on hikes and camping trips !

Since I got it I have used it EVERY single day ! With the exception of mayyybe like 2 days haha . Really though its so nice having it all right there . It was also my first time trying a cream blush and I am 100% converted . <p> Stila Dusty Rose &amp; bareMinerals Boss : Chances are if you see me wearing a lip color it is one of these two since they are always in my purse and they look good with almost any outfit ! Stila and bareMinerals are my favorite liquid mattes for sure . My only complaints are that Stila does start to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ( i just put on a lil bit of eos ) then it is fine . <p> Bumble &amp; Bumble Surf Mousse- ( kind of more of a spray .. ish ) : This is the product I have been using to scrunch my hair ! ! I wait til it is almost dry just a tiny bit damp and then spray this all over and then start scrunching ! It holds allllll day which rarely happens with my stick straight hair .

Kind of like when you are SO overwhelmed by the 1 million things on your to do list all in one day so you decide to just forget it all and take a nap . Or maybe that 's just me . So this year I decided to really think about what I wanted my goal this year to be and I have two of them . <p> One of them came the other night when I was telling David ( my husband ) this story about when I was in Fiji .. it was late at night and me and three friends were staying at this awesome resort called Mango Bay .. it was our second to last weekend so we decided to try and fit as much as we could into our time at that resort so we go out onto the beach and borrow these kayaks that were there . My friend and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we rowed suuuper far out . Well , it seemed REALLY far .. who knows if it really was , all I know is I could hardly see the shore . It was the most gorgeous night ever , the stars were so bright and it was so dark so you could see every single one it seemed like and the moon was full and gorgeous and there we were sitting in a kayak in Fiji looking up at the most beautiful sky . <p> BUT <p> I have this super big fear of sharks and the ocean at night .. actually just the ocean in general ( once I get past where I can no longer stand ) is so scary to me . I started to freak out as we got further and further out and as soon as we stopped I was starting to really give myself anxiety .. I kept thinking , " what if a shark sees our kayak , hits it with his nose , knocks us over , and we are toast .. " and a million other stupid , stupid- hypothetical- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being out for like 15 minutes we rowed back in because I was being such a baby . <p> Anyways , I was telling David how I wish I could go back to that moment and just not worry about what could happen and just enjoy that moment and soak it all up . <p> I do that a lot .. I over analyze and I think of the worst case- scenario- or I worry too much about going to the next place and getting the next thing done or worrying that so and so does n't  like me so I make myself feel- uncomfortable- in a social setting or whatever that I kind of miss out on what could be amazing moments . <p> So that is one of my new years resolutions I guess if any of that made any sense ( maybe someone can relate ? ) . To just enjoy moments and people and let go of some of my worries and reservations ( I am extremely shy/reserved around people at first in case you did n't  know ) .

I am so excited for it to warm up so I can throw on some loose , distressed jeans and a tee and call it good ! <p> When the substance has high index of refraction , itll be compacted thus less product is employed in making lens ultimately causing a thin one . Inexpensive eyeglasses which are not manufactured to the best criteria might actually be bad for your eyes , triggering ongoing eye-strain and dry eyes , because of this . <p> That 's so awesome you are saving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of moving to New York a few times , I would LOVE LOVE if you did a post about your apartment , or the decor , or just what it is like to adjust to NY living/lifestyle ! ! <p> Thanks for reading Sara ! ! And I love to wear distressed light jeans for a more casual look for sure ! ! Whether it is running errands , traveling , any situation where I am in " a t-shirt and jeans " type of look ! ! School would be perfect ! But I feel like you could pair it with a blouse or something too , and fancy it up = xoxo <p> Ahh budgeting ! My husband and I are at the same stage as you , young and newly married , so saving for a house is definitely on our mind as well ! Every little bit counts , so thank you for this post ! = Enjoy your weekend too ! xox B <p> I agree ! ! Any little bit of savings set aside can help ! ! It is so rewarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , so its not all bad right ? ! = I hope you had a fabulous weekend love ! ! xo

There is a pizza shop next door to my hotel and the boys who own it are the nicest people ! They keep saying , " we just want you to enjoy the short time you have in our country " and their hospitality has seriously stunned me ! I went and met their families because it was momos dads birthday and they were equally as nice ! So lucky to have met fun , respectful friends to show me a good time in Paris ! Not to mention , since they own the pizza place they have been stuffing my face with free pasta , salads , pizza , drinks I am going to get fat ! <p> We went to see the tower the other night to watch it light up and get desserts to eat under the tower ! I was like a little school girl watching it light up , the boys were laughing so hard . I could not believe how amazing it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to this mountain with a view over ALL of Paris , I could n't get a good picture of it but it was unreal ! <p> I 've just recently discovered your blog and you are too cute !

We got back in our wedding clothes and ate the top of our cake that has been sitting in our freezer for a year and it was pretttty gross haha it was hilarious . It has been the best year ever .. It is crazy how as the days go on I see more and more how perfect he is for me and I could n't have chosen anyone better and I feel so lucky to be with him ! <p> At the end of the day , David and his happiness is the only thing that matters to me .. I always knew that but being at Fashion Week this past September I had this really overwhelming feeling of just feeling claustrophobic from hearing everyone talk non stop about clothes and who she was wearing and how pretty so and so looked and how she had X amount of followers , and so on and so forth and none of that is bad by any means , but since I was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and how little I need all the material things , success ( of any form ) , money , etc .. I know all I post about are material things ( since I do love all things fashion and beauty and love to share ) and I think its good to have those hobbies as long as I always remember what really matters . And truly as long as I have David ( and my pup ! ) I will be a-okay = So cheesy I know , but I know relationships are the best investments in life and I am so happy to be married to my best friend , it is the greatest feeling on the planet ! <p> : ) aw stop . You are too cute . 1 . The pictures are truly amazing and you guys are just radiating with happiness . Its so nice to see that people after a year of marriage are n't  pulling their hair out , but celebrating , having fun , eating old cake ( oh my god , how could you even keep it that long ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photo shoots . <p> 2 . Its such breath of fresh air seeing a popular blogger who 's so down to Earth , and keeps in mind what 's really important . I bet that fashion-week type of life must get exhausting , unless you 're always surrounded by best friends who are also in that type of world . Your writing was so sweet and sincere so you totally just gained extra brownie points with me ! Not only are you drop dead gorgeous and have amazing style , but also a very sensible , normal girl . <p> Even if this sounds weird from a total stranger , I really wish you and your husband the best , hopefully you 'll be as crazy about each other as you look in those pictures . Take care doll xxxxLa vie en low-cost <p> Hi , I do believe this is a great blog . I stumbledupon it = I may return once to help other people . <p> I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material things mean diddly squat compared to those we love around us ! I would love to see you wear and post an OLD outfit , something that you 've worn before but changed it up . So it shows your readers you are n't  always about new new new clothes . Just a thought . You are perfect as you are already ! <p> Such a darling idea . You to are to cute . My mom always told me " material things , and friends come and go . but your family will always be here in the end . " its so true . ! ! Always remember what 's really important . Just enjoy this time together . Because before you know it your 35 with 3 kiddos . It flys by believe me . Happy anniversary to the both of you . <p> Amber This post is absolutely so dang adorable and sweet !

I love you attitude about family vs. fashion week and I completely agree . The only thing NYFW makes me is super claustrophobic and a little well , emptier to be honest . Love this post ! xoxo , Bethann <p> Thanks Bethann ! ! And I agree , as exciting and amazing as fashion week is I learned I need it in small doses because I too sometimes leave with a weird empty feeling ! ! This next NYFW I am only going for a few days and that will be better I think ! xx <p> I have to admit after I saw your post about your wedding last year I actually called up Penelope and asked how much it would cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wedding coming up this February . I almost flew out to Utah in order to get it made but after I tried on a few dresses I realized that the sheath does n't  work with my body . That dress was made for you ! Absolutely gorgeous . Amazing taste and congrats on your first year of marriage ! <p> Oh really ? ! Penelope is absolutely so talented it is ridiculous ! But yeah the material of my dress is different , I think it works on me because I have bigger hips ! Thanks I am glad you like it though ! I hope you found the dress of your dreams and had or will have the best wedding ! xo <p> Happy anniversary ! These photos are so adorable = &amp; I 'm glad that a fashion/beautyblogger dares to say that the most important thing in life is n't anything material but love is !

I wanted to show you some pictures from London , especially since I am wearing some pieces that I am IN LOVE with and you will probably see me wear a lotttt this winter . I apologize in advance for being a repeat offender , but that 's how you know you got something good , when you want to wear it literally every day ! <p> I got this coat from Saks before I left I had n't  brought anything warm enough and was on the hunt for a cozy coat and fell in love with it ! It was sadly their last one and it is sold out all over the web BUT I found a lot of similar and a few that are almost IDENTICAL , like this one ! ( Yay ! That rarely happens ) So I listed all of those below , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable , warm shoes around town since we walked about 4 miles every day , at least .

I feel completely at ease leaving him with her while I leave for an hour or so to attend and event or whatever it might be . I am so lucky to have my sisters .. to be honest I have have lost a few friends over the years just because I have found people change so much and sometimes relationships become unhealthy or just forced . Or in my case they do n't  support the things you do and your dreams ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started my blog and were not shy to tell people how embarrassing what I was doing was ) . While I still have a lot of friends I love and cherish their long time relationships , I consider my sisters my best friends .

I do n't  know what I would do without mine . <p> The pictures are absolutely fantastic !

I have a question about how you edit your pictures I hope you do n't  mind me asking , if you do I totally understand !

Glad you had a happy Mothers Day ! <p> Wow you need to frame likeall of these ! It really is like a scene from a magical fairy land haha . And I loved the insta video of Atticus in the convertible .

Yes , laughing . <p> They would n't stop ! Which made me even more mad. - <p> I could tell they were just watching me thinking , " poor thing , what a bad mom " haha or something like that . It was so annoying . Then I told the boys it was time to go home and as we were walking passed these adults they said , " good luck " <p> Ugh . <p> I 'm trying . <p> But I sure do adore these gosh dang cutest kids . <p> I live in pigtails these days . Something about pigtails just feels right when you do n't  ever want to wash your hair haha . They do n't  use conditioner here and I failed to bring some soooo yeah . My hair is slowly dying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog to look like ! <p> xo <p> oh yeah and my bestesssst best friend is PREGGGGERSS ! ! ! check it out =blueeyedfinch.com <p> Use apple cider vinegar mixed with waterit gently conditions the hair . You can pour it over your ends after you wash your hair or put it in a spray bottle ( which I recommend because the vinegar will BURN your eyes if your not careful ) . Also yogurt as a pre-treatment mask before you wash your hair could help ( leave it on for 5 to 10 minutes or how ever long you have-just do n't  let it dry out ) but it has protein in it so if your hair is sensitive it could make it brittle for a few days . I always add a little oil ( olive , any really ) to the yogurt and as always , only apply it to the ends . Best of luck to your hair ! <p> Okay when you get back I need you to immediately go with me to help me buy extensions and then you need to do that side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it myself . Looks like you 're having a blast ! !

I got to have my hair styled by David Babaii who is the celeb stylist for Kate Hudson , Gweneth Paltrowl , and lots of others ! ! He did a ton of celebrities hair for the Golden Globes last Sunday and he recreated the beach waves he did on Gweneth that night . I LOVE learning to hair tricks from stylists like David and he taught me the coolest tricks ever , it was like seriously heaven for me getting to watch him and pick his brain ! He used a ghd Soft Wand for the beach waves and no product at all so its really easy , there are just a few tricks he does so be sure to watch and see because they are so easy but total game changers ! <p> Ghd is also offering Barefoot Blonde readers 20% off their purchase PLUS a free shine spray and paddle brush with your purchase when you use code ghdBAREFOOTBLONDE ! Which is pretty awesome because their hot tools really are the best , once you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( plus their hot tools make this adorable sound when they turn on and it sounds like a magic wand or something haha you will see when you try it = <p> I wore my beach waves to the beach later that day and David and I were laughing because I got so many compliments on them ! Too bad it was so windy and wind always makes curls fall a bit but even with the wind and ocean draft they stayed pretty good . Atticus kept trying to eat the sand and after trying to stop him 10,000,000 times we finally just let him eat it ( bad parents haha ) but it was too funny to watch because he was just loving it . We have been to the beach with him quite a bit but this was the first time he really played in the sand and it was so cute ! He is seriously such a riot . Some days he acts so mature , I do n't  even know how to explain it but it will feel like we are just best friends hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach felt . <p> Love you articles ? I 'm trying to buy from GHD and tried to used your code for the 20% off their purchase PLUS a free shine spray and paddle brush " but it did n't seem to work ? Any ideas on how to get this working ? I 'm going to buy the ghd AIR- HAIRDRYER ? Thanks so much ! <p> I loved this tutorial because I 'm always trying to get the perfect beach wave . I really need to order the gdh soft wand ! It may be just what I need . I enjoy all of your tutorials . I have been going by your skincare routine that is on your blog for about a month now and I cant even tell you how many compliments I have gotten about my skin ! Thanks for doing all you do <p> I 'm a new subscriber &amp; I totally love your tutorial ! I decided to get the ghd &amp; use the code you provided . I got it yesterday &amp; tried it out today . LOVE it ! ! ! ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shine spray though , boo ! ) Anywaythank you so much ! ! ! <p> That photo of Atticus blowing bubbles with sand all around his mouth is hilarious and sooo cute ! ! ! You have a golden child on ya girl ! ! Love the beach hair tutorial and thanks for sharing the expert tips ! XX <p> Hi Amber . I was wondering if you have naturally straight hair and let it air dry ? Or if you blow dry before your tutorials ? I have really wavy hair and to get it all smooth I have to straighten it and then it wont curl . Just wondering if you have any suggestions . <p> Isnt crazy how much babies love the sand ! We took our mini to Maui at 6 months and really tried hard to not let him eat any , but after a week there it was basically impossible . Needless to say we saw the after effects of sand eating in his diaper . LOL ! Poor little guy . He s almost 2 now and does n't  try to eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look gorg in that romper ! ! <p> AHH I am so embarrassed haha as I was typing that I knew it had to be wrong and meant to google it then fix it and totally forgot ! Haha = good thing she does n't  read my blog = thanks for letting me know ! ! ! xoxo <p> Ive been reading a few months but this is my first time commenting ! Thanks for sharing this tutorial , I just love the beach wave look ! Just so you know , I think your youtube link on the right hand side of your page is broken when you click on it , but I think its just missing the " h " in the Https " . = <p> Thank you so much for this tutorial ! ! I love watching you actually show us all the tricks you 've learned ! I am so excited to purchase a ghd iron but which one would you recommend that you use the most ? <p> Question about your extensions when you go to the beach/swim . I am assuming you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? Kind of a silly question I know . But I am preparing for a cruise next month , I 'm in the market for some extensions to feel extra excited about my hair , but I am worried about having them in , and then potentially swimming/other water activities . Do you just leave them behind on those occasions ? Take them out ? Leave them in and get wet ? I am an amateur . I had the beaded row extensions last time I went so it was no problem worrying about getting my hair wet with them . I am more concerned about getting clip-ins . Any advice/experience you have would be greatly appreciated . <p> Not a silly question at all ! ! I wear mine in the water ! I will just wear maybe two rows instead of all five or I will put my hair in a pony or braid with them . Sometimes I take them out to swim but I also do n't  worry if I get them wet ! It does damage them slightly to have them in chlorine though = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We wont see that for a while up here in Canada , but i 'm glad to see you guys are having such a good time ! I just watched the hair tutorial and I love the look ! Great tips throughout the video , too = <p> Hi Amber love lovebbc.co these beach waves great tutorial ! Thanks for the tips , your the best ! Would love to know what your makeup routine is as of late especially foundation and blush color in these photos and the insta photo on the bed with u , little A , David and Chauncey ? looks fab ! 
@@98070141 @2270141/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> So today I am talking fitness ! Quite honestly I have n't worked out much since I have been pregnant , not as often and not nearly as hard as I was before . I believe in being active for mental health as well as physical health and love to be active in some way each day even if while I am pregnant some days it is just taking my dog on a walk and playing with him out back and making sure I park in a far parking spot haha <p> The #1 thing I get asked to do a post on is my work out so I will be sharing some of my favorite work outs ( throughout the year ! ) and the ones I found most effective ( these I did PRE pregnancy ) but I will also share pregnancy work outs as I get further into my pregnancy . <p> This work out I am sharing today may seem a bit silly because they are really simple moves but to me this is what gets me the leanest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week : <p> CARDIO 60 MIN ( I usually do 30 min on the bike and 30 on row machine ! ) <p> 300 LUNGES ( If this seems like a lot , start out at 150 like I did and I worked my way up adding about 20 each day . I usually do 25 at a time walking around an indoor track and walk 200 yards in between and your legs are supposed to shake afterwards = ) <p> 300 REPS OF VARIOUS AB EXERCISES ( again I know this may seem outrageous if you are just starting to get working out again but just start doing 100 a day and add 15 or 20 each day you do them . ) I will do 25 sit ups , 25 air bike , 25 butt ups , 30 second plank ( I count as 25 sit ups ) and just pick 4 different exercises and rotate between those that day and then the next day rotate a couple different ones into it . <p> And after that I am beat . On the two days in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my body with weights or I do boxing work outs but I will share those work outs another day = <p> Also music is huge for me in working out , if I cant find my headphones or something I will not go to the gym until I have them found ! It is so motivating for me and sometimes just listening to a certain song can put me in the mood to go do a really good work out so as I do these work out posts I will also share my current playlist ! <p> You should talk about your post-gym hair routine when you do n't  wash it . Like how you do your hair while working out so that its easy to rescue/style afterwards ? ( i.e. braid vs. ponytail , do you use dry shampoo before your workout , etc . ) Its so stupid but this seems to be my biggest deterrent for going to the gym = <p> Staying active while pregnant is so important . Alongside with healthy eating , it reduces the risk of gestational diabetes . Great post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is truly like no other life experience xx <p> Oh not random at all ! Um I have n't yet .. I know I will get them since I have had them on my booty since seventh grade from growing so darn fast but I am just doing lotion after the shower for now ! I will probably get a better cream as my belly gets bigger but for now not really ! Do you know of anything that works ? <p> I am also prone to stretch marks ( had the same hip/butt marks from teenage growth ) , so I was pretty diligent when I was pregnant to use a Tummy Butter at least once a day , every day . I know they say that this is 100% due to genetics , but this worked for me . Not a single stretch mark on my belly . Using the butter will also help relieve the dryness and itchiness that comes with growing/stretching skin . I do NOT miss that itchy belly ! Best of luck . Youll be a beautiful mommy ! <p> Geepers so many lunges after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Its getting harder to firm up the butt as I get older ! Love this post , thanks for sharingand keen to hear how your fitness routine varies through your pregnancy = you 're already have in-built weight training now hehe . Will you find out whether the bub is a boy/girl ? X <p> Loved this post ! I am 36 weeks pregnant right now so I have definitely modified my workouts ( run a lot slower , lighter weights , etc. ) , but I am really excited to get back into my old workout routine after I have my baby girl ! I definitely need to incorporate more lunges and I am excited to work my abs and overall core again = <p> YES ! I 'm so excited you did a fitness post , I 'm always curious what all you do for exercise , it sounds like our workouts are almost identical only you look like a goddess haha . I 'm looking forward to the pregnancy workouts , so far I 've just been doing prenatal yoga and lots of walking/elliptical and weights . I just get so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . xo Laurenhttp : **30;838;TOOLONG <p> How do you like prenatal yoga ? I have just started trying it out and do n't  love it but I feel like I just need to keep doing it til I like it haha = So fun that we are practically at the same place in our pregnancies ! <p> I have n't been to the gym in a little while but I LOVED the rowing machine also . I definitely need to start back up at the gym .. Music is definitely a MUST and I wo n't work out without it either .. It definitely gets you motivated .. <p> I do a lot ( " a lot " ) of blogilates work outs , but usually I need to tone her versions down a little . Definitely if I have n't worked out for a while , otherwise I end up straining myself / so sore I literally ca n't move like a normal person anymore I once tried to do the full calves challenge and it took me almost a week to walk without it hurting anymore , so sore ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard over the last few weeks but needed some new exercises to do . I 'm totally going to try out the rowing machine and I am always so scared to try it out . <p> I am so excited I found another American rower ! The gym I visit is in a hospital and the rowing machine is in the geriatrics section . Rowing is a big deal when I was living in the UK , but in America I just look ridiculous haha . Also , the work out is legit ! I need to add more squats and lunges to my mix .

We have been trying to ride bikes every single day in Central Park . It is my new favorite thing ! I always feel the need to hold my arms out and close my eyes like Rose in Titanic lol . It just feels right . Yeah ? ! We rode through the park and then all the way down to West Village . We got some pizza to eat at the park and then walked around town and got ice cream . The next look is a dress I wore to an event we attended in the Hamptons ! <p> Hope everyone had a good weekend ! We had one of my favorite weekends in the city yet ! Will show you guys pics soon ! <p> Ca n't wait to hear what you got up to in the Hamptons ! Such cute pieces . <p> I remember you posting that Rosie had acid reflux , something we thought our 6 month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an allergy to milk protein . I just posted about it , it might be interesting to have a look ! = <p> Amber , you have talked about wearing the Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation in the past . I was just wondering what shade you wore . I am going to try it out because I am desperate to find a foundation that works for me . I was curious about your color to kind of get a feel for it before I go and try to find a color . <p> Both outfits are so pretty ! You definitely know how to rock the boho chic look . All your pics of biking in central park is making me want to do itit looks so pretty and fun Carly at http : //www.AModernMomBlog.com <p> I am visiting NYC for a week in October .. any chance I could get to meet you and the kids ? Just a little obsessed with you all and your sweet , sweet family . Also , do you have any reccomendations on where we should go when visiting ? You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that David and you try to make the time for date time . We struggle a lot more to do this as often as you guys do , maybe its having 3 kids but my husbands long working hours do n't  help either . My resolution before a new school year starts is to do it once a month and try to look as cute as you . Much love from London . Julie ps : I love biking too . We live near a really big park in London and when husband is home not too late I always pick up his bike to get some fresh air and enjoy the sunset ! xx <p> The blue and black dress looks beautiful on you ! Biking around a big city park is so much fun . Here in SF that is one of my favorite weekend dates too in Golden Gate Park , especially since they close the streets to cars so it is a bike riders dream ! <p> I love how you guys do date nights often ! !

And as you can see my hair is crimped again in these pictures .. they were taken in the same weekend as the last post with crimped hair .. turns out crimp does NOT fall out haha even after I got my hair wet I got still feel a little crimp , so I had it like this for three days straight = <p> Do you find this swimsuit revealing ? I am going to BYU Hawaii and I need lots of swimsuits . Pink and red are my favorite colors together too ! My only concern is how high cut the bottom half is and how revealing the chest area is . Would love some intake on it ( : <p> I 've never seen cute crimped hair ! You pull it off so well , I could never do that . The bathing suit is super flattering for a one-piece ( I always feel that they either look too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This one is the perfect amount of sexy yet cute . <p> I love that you love one-piece suits ! I think they are so fun , but I am a tall girl like you ( also 5 ' 10 ? ! ) and sometimes have a difficult time finding one that fits my long body ! This one is incredibly cute ! I would also love a tutorial on the crimped hair , or even just some tips on how to make it look cute ! Thanks for another great post ! ! ! <p> Aw thanks Amanda ! ! Yeah one pieces were hard for me to get used to , I grew up ALWAYS in a bikini but one day decided to give one pieces an honest try ! I think if you find a really cute one that is made well , it will look cute ! ! And for crimped hair I think the key to making it cute it to add a modern touch to it , like a braid or maybe two side bohemian braids or something like that ! ! 
@@98070148 @2270148/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Here are 20 snaps from 2014 ! It was my favorite year yet- with a few rough patches but Atticus coming into the world trumps all and it was such an amazing and fun year ! We celebrated the new year by watching fireworks from our balcony and then got freezing and sat on our windowsill in our apartment . We ate candy and drank martinellis and did facial masks hahaha . Party animals ! <p> One of the rough patches this year was when Atticus was four weeks old he got really sick and had to go to the hospital for almost five days .. it was the worst 4 and a half days ever and I never told anyone about it because I was still a new mom and felt sort of insecure as a mom like I did n't  know what I was doing yet and I thought everyone would think I was a bad mom if I told them ! He was acting kind of strange one day and I had a really bad feeling in my gut so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight to his pediatrician and they sent us immediately to the hospital which was really scary because as a mom I was thinking the absolute worst . We got there and took all the necessary tests ( all of which are heart breaking no one should watch there newborn get poked and scream out of pain that many times ) and it ended up being a UTI . We had to stay there until it went away but since his veins are so small they would have to come swap out IVs almost every 3 hours and hearing his cry would make me shake and I would just literally sob it was torture . The only upside was afterwards were some of the sweetest snuggles . We finally got to go home and it was like heaven being home but mainly it made me so grateful for our health . Its something I do n't  think about often because I have always been healthy but now every day I am extra grateful for another day of health . I pray that all of my babies are healthy through their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best moment of this year is of course the cliche moment the day A was born ! Ahhh I want to have a zillion babies just to experience birth ( and the epidural ha ! ) and that first night in the hospital having your first sleepover with your baby over and over again ! It was the most special thing and I still get chills when I think about it ! Now we get to have sleepovers every night- and it is the bomb . I only bring up a rough patch because I usually only talk about the happy aspects of life on this blog but no one has a " perfect " year and there are always rough patches even though you may not see someones rough patch on social media or online . Occasionally I find myself comparing and I like to remind myself of that because comparing never breeds good feelings ! Its okay to have a " mostly perfect " year and I definitely learn from my downs and turn them into ups for the next year ! Or next day because who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am off to spin class because I am getting back into freaking shape this year ! Hope you all had an amazing New Years Eve and thank you SOOOOOO much for all your love and support this year ! ! Honestly it makes me so stinking happy seeing tweets and comments etc. and getting to feel like we are friends . 2015 is going to rock . <p> I so appreciate your honesty , because there are times when I 'm seeing all these bloggers with seemingly perfect lives , and , you 're right , its terrible to compare , because then I feel bad about my life . So , thanks for sharing that story , and I am SO glad Atticus is okay . He is so precious ! ! My sister had a baby in Feb of 2014 ( the first baby of our family ) , and I honestly do n't  think I could love her more if she was my own baby . She had to go back to the hospital a week after she was born , but thankfully she is healthy and growing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I cant imagine my life without her , and I 'm sure you feel the same about Atticus = I hope 2015 is a healthy &amp; happy year for you &amp; your family ! <p> Happy New Year ! I feel like we are friends too even though its only me reading your blog every few daysyoure family is so sweet ! I 've had experiences as a student nurse in obstetrics and the new moms are always so upset when baby needs blood work .. its hard for everyone , even the lab tech ! ! to hear baby cry ! ! ! You are a great mom and he s a sweet baby ! ! <p> Hey Amber ! Thanks for not only just showing us amazing hair and style posts but really letting your personality shine through . I follow tons of fashion bloggers but it is so refreshing that you are yourself and your readers feel like they know you . Thanks for being honest about the tough timeseveryone has them ! I 'm so glad A is doing great xo <p> Looks like a wonderful year ! Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  know what to do , its so helpful to hear about others and how they handled it . Thanks for sharing.The Doctor Diva <p> Atticus is absolutely precious ! He seems like such a good baby . I can understand how scary it was for you while he was in the hospital . I had my baby girl on October 4th and she was 7 weeks early . She had to be in the NICU for 26 days and watching them poke and prod and the IVs and everything was SO HARD . Shes home &amp; fine now but I know how you felt . Thanks for sharing ! Wishing you all a healthy , happy year ! <p> thanks for sharing that real moment , it really is so easy to compare and think everyone has it better when in reality no ones life is perfect . i am so glad that A ended up being okay and that you chose to focus on the good in the year ! <p> The best/worst part of blogs is feeling like were in the one-sided best-friendship ! You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I think I started following you when David was our EQ president because you went to a Christmas party and I felt silly for wanting to go up and say hi because I felt like we were already friends ! Anywho , I just wanted to comment and say that I love your blog . I love living vicariously through you as you travel this beautiful world and watch your growing family . You are real and I love that about your blog . I hope 2015 brings you and David even more adventures and opportunities to continue following your dreams ! <p> Amber , I totally agree with you ! My boyfriend and I were just talking about this because he was groaning about not going anywhere " fun " for the holidays like he was seeing on social media . We had a great convo about how unrealistic social media is and how it truly only documents the happy parts of our lives . Its up to us to remember that in between the happy photo snaps are the rough patches that are a normal part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we can certainly celebrate both . So cheers to more ups than downs in 2015 ! <p> Honey , you are beautiful enough to be a model , some perfect ideal , but you 're also one of the most real bloggers out there . I hope you never get anyone else to write your posts because that 's the best part ! Your fashion and hair stuff is great , but hearing about your real experiences and struggles , and in your authentic voice , is the best part = Happy New Year ! <p> Oh , I just love you and your family , Amber ! I had a little boy this year too and I relate to sooooo many of your posts . I look forward to sharing in Mommyhood with you through your blog . My 3 month old baby Ezra is the best thing ever and so perfect and fat and adorable like your baby A. = Its refreshing how honest you are and how much you love your son . You are such a beauty INSIDE and obviously outside too . Its inspiring ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> oh that sounds awful- I 'm so sorry ! Delivery day is seriously the greatest day around- its one of the hardest parts for me about even considering to be finished having babies . To think of never delivering a new little babe is near heartbreaking . I hope this year brings even more goodness and happiness to you ! <p> Thanks for sharing this ! I have been following your blog for about 18 months and really enjoy it . I never post comments but feel I had to to this . I gave birth to twin babies 5 months ago and can empathise with everything you say ! Its terrifying and daunting being a new mum I love following you and baby A and often what you post resonates so well with my situation as a new mum . Love your fashion sense and the balance you being to the blog so real Please keep that and do n't  change . Its jut charming ! ! Amazed by your brave move to NYC and hope all works out for your beautiful family ! ! Exxx <p> ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through that with your baby . I am a new mom too ( my baby boy is going to be 4 months old this week ! ) and I completely understand where you are coming from by not telling anyone what happened until now , people can be so judgmental when you are a new mom , its disgusting even with the smalest things , like feeding your baby breastmilk in a bottle ! I HATE when they feel like I have to explain myself ! ! Well I 'm glad everything seems to be ok now ! Atticus looks so healthy and he is such a happy baby , oh my gosh ! I love watching your Snapchat stories , he is so giggly ! ! ! I hope you and your family have a really amazing 2015 ! = I started reading your blog last year and I really enjoyed every little bit of it . Your fashion sense is so inspirational and I love how fun , down to earth you are . You deserve the best ! <p> You are just my favorite ! I love how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories and even tell the hard stuff . You 're my favorite blog to visit because of that ! Thank you for all of your wonderful hard work on you blog and everything you do that we do n't  even see ! I love waking up and grabbing my cup of coffee and coming to your blog ! You 're the best ! xoxo <p> I 'm so sorry you had to go through that with Atticus I can only imagine how scary that would be , especially with your first child . Happy New Year to you and your family &lt;3 Ca n't wait to see what 2015 brings for you ! = <p> Happy New Year Amber ! I wanted to tell you that I totally agree with you . We all share the positive things in life on the social media , and it may lead to the mistaken belief that our lives are perfect , but still is the correct thing to do . In your case I would have done the same . I-m glad Atticus was fine in the end and now you have a beautiful family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I don-t doubt 2015 will be as good as ( or even better ) . Best wishes for the four of you ! xxxhttp : //www.ornelga.com <p> I never ever post comments , do n't  know why Ha ! , but wanted to wish you a Happy New Year and thank you for sharing your post ! My hubby and I went through a similar situation with our first little girl and although it was 7 years ago and we are happy and healthy when I think back on tough times and trials that we have had , the experience with my first born in the hospital for 4 days at 3 weeks old still remains one of the hardest ! I felt exactly the same way as a new mom and remember just balling my eyes while we were there ! I 'm so happy little A is healthy and here 's to a happy new year ! ! ! = 
@@98070149 @2270149/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> I am just so gosh darn happy right now . Mostly because I got to hang out with my cousin/best friend Lauren last week . Lauren and I are super sappy together . Well we are everything together but one of the many things we can be together is sappy or maybe that 's not the right word and I should say cheesy ? Who knows . So we spent our time taking walks , setting goals , making life plans , changing perspectives ( sounds cheesy I know , but sometimes I feel like I am negative and need to- consciously- change my perspective on life/people/everything ) , and just lots of things I just feel like a happier person . <p> Anyways change of topic . Birth control . ( I can talk about this since we are all girls right ? ) I am getting married in less than two months so I started taking it so it could be in my system and what not by the time i am married and just in case I needed to switch or try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard COUNTLESS horror stories about crazy hormones , bad moods , crying for no reason , horrible cramps , etc . I have n't experienced any of that . until tonight . <p> Has anyone seen Walking Dead ? It is on AMC and if you have n't you should watch it ! But anyways my fiance and I watched last weeks episode tonight and after it was over I asked him , " what if I turned into a zombie ? " He responded and said he would shoot me ! ! ! I mean thanks for the honesty I guess ? But since I was acting surprised , he was saying how he would hope that I would shoot him if he turned into a zombie and was going to attack me . I was laughing but was telling him how I literally could not shoot him and I would probably just let him attack me then that thought ( the thought of having to shoot my zombie husband to be ) made me cry ! ! ! ! It was totally my birth control crying .. it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David and I were literally cracking up the whole time it was happening .. but still the tears were there and it counts as a cry . It was too funny . <p> I cried thinking of David being a zombie . <p> Thanks for that birth control . Ps I 've loved all the emails with funny birth control stories I have gotten so far , so keep them coming ! = <p> Thank you a lot for providing individuals with remarkably splendid possiblity to read in detail from here . <p> It is always very brilliant plus packed with a good time for me and my office co-workers to search your site no less than 3 times weekly to see the latest guidance you will have . And of course , I 'm also usually astounded considering the surprising advice served by you . Certain 3 points in this post are undoubtedly the most effective we have all ever had . <p> Estrogen is a natural hormone found in both men and women . Keeping estrogen at a healthy level is important for both genders , but women need more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During menopause , estrogen levels in women decrease significantly . The methods for how to increase estrogen levels are the same for men and women , although men have a lower capacity for acquiring the hormone. - <p> Sooo I have two kids and my husband and I were going to wait a while for a third and I was on Loestrin and got pregnant ! I had recently started taking it after I quit nursing my daughter and yup not long after HEY your having another baby ! Its fine I figure God has a plan for everyone but I 'm just throwing that out there for you hahah ! ! PS BC makes everyone crazy and it can cause Melasma which is scarrrry because you have such nice skin but I think you have to take it for a lot of years for that to happen ! <p> I love Walking Dead ! Haha I love the zombie talk ! Good luck with finding the right BC , when I first started taking it , I had to try so many ! Literally the worset side effects from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do find a good one , just stick with it and you 'll be good . = <p> Ahh the trials and tribulations of birth control . Haha . Having been on a million different birth controls I know what you mean about being overly emotional . And do n't  get me started on having to remember to take a pill at the same time every day . But I recommend NuvaRing , it is the best . Ive been using it for over 2 years and I have n't had any problems with emotions running wild . And a major plus is that because it is n't a pill you only have to remember to do something twice a month . But seriously , it is AMAZING . <p> Ive been married for a little over 2 years and have tried 3 different birth controls . The one I love the most is Microgestin . I have turned like 10 people to it . It is the generic brand of Loestrin . They both have really low estrogen dosages in them . Microgestin is just cheaper than Loestrin . I got sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I switch to microgestin . I love it and it has never had ANY effects on me . <p> K you totally do n't  know me but I wish someone would have told me this before I got married so I 'll tell you ! ! .. I HATED birth control ! ! ! I highly suggest getting an IUD . I hurts like crazy to get one but it is soooo worth it . You do n't  have to worry about taking pills everyday either = I was on birth control my first year of mairrage and felt like a complete psycho and then I switched to an IUD and seriously I forgot what it was like to be a happy person ! Also my husband and I started watching the Walking Dead a few weeks ago and we are obsessed ! Just had the exact same conversation about shooting each other haha ! p.s. love your blog ! ! <p> lol ! That 's too funny . You only have to have BC in your system ( the pill anyway ) for two weeks just fyi = Hopefully you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears hahah Walking Dead is the best show ! <p> And Andrea : that is too funny ! I 've heard that from so many people ! ! I totally can relate on the smells of foods part ! I made David and I soup the other day and he was eating some of the left overs and I had to tell him to leave the room haha it was making me so sick ! ! Its so weird ! Let 's pray we are n't  crazies when we get pregnant = <p> My husband always jokes that pregnancy is going to be worse for him than it will for me if it will be anything like when I first started birth control . I was a nutcase ! Yelling at everyone and telling them not to cook because I hated the smells and not even being able to drink water because it made me nauseous . Oh that was a fun few weeks ! Do n't  worry it goes away eventually ! That is until you get pregnant , supposedly then its like birth control times 1000 . My husband might be right !

@@98070155 @2270155/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Last summer we took Atticus to Water Lab ( a glorified splash pad ) at Pier 6 in Brooklyn and it was the funnest ! I kept meaning to take the kids and the other morning I said okay we are leaving in 30 minutes and going to Water Lab its happening . So we left the apartment and squoze onto the subway during rush hour and had a 45 minute subway ride to Clark St. and walked to Pier 6 . When we finally got there it was CLOSED ! ! ! ! ! It was closed for cleaning and did n't  open til noon that day , but when we got there it was like 8am ! So we decided to do playgrounds , soccer fields , running on the pier , ice cream , and yummy food all on the pier and it was soooo fun . The kids had a blast- and just as we were leaving we saw the splash pad open but by then , they were so ready for a nap . We are pretty strict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naps so they get the full 3 hours otherwise it ai n't  pretty ! I think Pier 6 , Top of the Rock , and Sheeps Meadow might be my favorite spots in the city . Just so pretty ! ! Love this city . <p> This is the cutest post ! Funny thing I wanted you to knowI go to a high school in Oxford , MS and we all have laptops given to us by the school . Every single one of my girlfriends along with about every other girl in the school reads your blog ALL DAY LONG . We have this really weird system that blocks websites and last year it blocked your blog for a day or two and literally every single girl in the school like cried about it ! ! ! haha : ) We got our computers back on the first day and the first thing I did was check to see if the blog was unblocked and it was n't and I was like " omg Ambers blog is unblocked ! ! ! " and everybody like cried tears of joy hahahaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! It keeps us going throughout the school day for real . <p> Hi Amber ! You guys have such a beautiful family ! I loved the pics and the place ! Want to go there when I go to NYC ! = By the way , I 've sent you a message through the " contact have a question " Can I hope for an answer soon ? Thank you ! ! XX <p> Hello Amber , you are truly inspiring . I 'm starting a business and have hired a nanny part time to allow for " business time " but I end up using the time up cleaning and running errands . How do you do it ? You make it seem so easy . David seems to help a lot . My husband works like 60 hours a week so its basically me and my 21 month old . BTW , did I mention Im 7 months pregnant ? Yup . Please help . <p> Hi Amber ! I have never left comment before , but I just wanted to say I really enjoy your blog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( like the Moroccan Oil serum , No. 7 foundation and even hair extensions ) and am so happy with them . I do have one question though I see this bright orange nail color in many of your pictures . What is it ! ? I am so in love ! <p> Same thing happened to me over the weekend but with the pool . I got ready , sunscreen on and all and drove the 20 minutes to the local pool and boom closed ! ! Glad to see you guys had fun at the pier anyways , the photo of Atticus with your sunglasses on upside down is the best ! <p> We might be moving to Brooklyn Heights which is super close to Pier 6 so this makes me happy that we will have a great play area close by for the kids ! Are Atticus and Rosie on the same schedule ? I know you 're not a mommy blog but PLEASE make a post about their schedules and any differences/similarities between how Atticus was at Rosies age ? Pregnant with number two over here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 hour naps ? Girl , what is your secret ? ! I have twins that are Rosies age , and I WISH they took 3 hour naps ! = Your adventures inspire me to get out there with my babies and I think of your LONG flights when I 'm on a plane with whining twins.Longest we have done is 6 hours .

@@98070156 @2270156/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> I am dying for Summer to come .. especially since I have been doing all of my online Summer shopping recently . I got a few of the above things and cant wait to finally have an excuse to put them on ! The rest of the items I am lusting over .. I want it all . <p> I am usually an all one piece kind of girl , but I actually bought a couple bikinis for this Summer . Maybe this will seem like a silly reason but this may be my last Summer before I have kids and who knows if I will wear a bikini after kids or not , cant really say I guess . But I am seizing my opportunity now just in case = Like I said , maybe that sounds silly to some of you but to me it is sounding totally sensible , in this moment at least . <p> One of the bikinis I got is a high waisted bikini , I am totally in love with the look .. which is funny because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style of the bottoms , but something about the retro-ness of it makes me not really care = <p> I 'm pretty sure you could look good in anything ! I WISH I had your body ( do n't  mean that to sound creppy ) haha . I 'm absolutely understand though , babies and your whole body changing is scary . I 'm taking a pregnancy class at BYU-I this semester because pregnancy and birth and after birth freak me out so much . My husband said if I do n't  educate myself and find out its not that bad I 'll never want kids , sooo I 'm trying it out . But since you 're so athletic and fit , I 'm sure you 'll be able to work out throughout your pregnancy and your body will bounce back to your normal weight in no time ! xo <p> Oh my goodness NO girl ! ! But thank you so much ! ! That means a lot ! And yeah I agree pregnancy is scary I have been reading tons about it and apparently if you have strong abs it helps you carry your baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to get my abs strong ! Not that I am having a baby anytime soon or anything = Hard to say how it will be since it is different for everyone ! Do you have a blog or anything ? <p> I am 100% on the same page ! I was hunting for some good , not-so-expensive one pieces and then I realized that this may be my last summer to wear a bikini so I stopped looking so hard for one pieces and decided to go for bikinis one more time ! <p> I am in LOVE with the studded Topshop bikini ! I 've never ordered swimwear from them , and their sizing chart was n't really helpful so I shot them an email to find out ! I LOVELOVE it and MUST have it = Thanks , Amber ! <p> Oh my gosh is it not the cutest thing ever ? ! I am dying over it ! ! A size 4 is usually a small 6 is medium and so forth so 2 would be an extra small ! I usually order 4 for top and 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the seems push into my skin I like when they lay softly , so I always order a size up ! Maybe that helps but yeah see what they say ! xo <p> totally have the same thought as you and reason for buying hottie little bikinis now that Im married , and especially before those future little babies switch up our bods , bless their hearts love this post . makes me want summer even mooooore. 
@@98070157 @2270157/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> Okay you guys know I love my natural beauty tricks so while I was in Morocco I was in heaven with all the herbs and spices on every single corner . I picked up some dried rose because I had read about all of its benefits and remember hearing one of my favorite models talk about how she does rose steam facials with them . <p> Rose has vitamin C and works as an antioxident for your skin and the natural oils moisturize your skin . It also has a natural astringent so it leaves your face toned and glowing . And I have to say this rose steam facial is the most relaxing thing on the planet , which is why spas use rose to detoxify and calm . <p> 3 . Get a towel and place it over the back of your head . Put your face directly above the pot using the towel as kind of a curtain to not let any steam out <p> 4 . You can do this for as long as you would like ( at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do about 7 minutes ! *I always put the pot on a hot pad on the floor and then sit cross legged next to it , that way I am not standing hunched over ! = <p> After this I will usually go put on an organic moisturizer , my favorite is my ARCONA Magic White Ice Hydrating Gel , all ARCONA products are organic and so so amazing , they are by far my favorite skin care line out there . <p> Another thing I like to do with rose is .. - This facial has so many benefits but mostly the same as the ones above I already listed . The honey just adds more antibacterial helping clear the skin and the yogurt helps to brighten your skin = <p> DIRECTIONS : <p> 1 . Boil a small pot of water . Once boiling , add 1 cup dried roses and let sit until they are soft . <p> 2 . Strain the softened roses and place them in a bowl . <p> 3 . Add 1 large spoonful of Greek Yogurt and about a tbsp. of honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just kind of eye ball it ) <p> 4 . Mash all of these together until they are a consistency you like . Apply to face and let it sit for 15 minutes and then rinse with warm water ! <p> **This one is kinda messy but I promise its worth it ! ! ! I usually put a thick head band on and wrap a towel around my neck like a scarf and apply it laying down or you can make your **33;870;TOOLONG do it = <p> I am SO glad you 're sharing home beauty tricks lately ! I was able to make that cucumber sugar scrub over the weekend . Could not find mint leaves anywhere , so I used kalanchoe instead ( pretty flowers with great benefits for the face and hair in the leaves .. really great as just a face mask as well ) and a bit of basil . Love it ! As for the rose facial .. you do not even need dry leaves of the rose . You can just purchases a bunch of roses and take it apart and boil it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but quicker then waiting for delivery ) . Rose water is great for just washing the face . Any recommendations for the lips ? Mine seem have taken a turn this winter . Refuse to be moisturized . <p> Oh yay I am really glad you got to try the scrub ! ! It is my favorite ! ! And yeah I put on there fresh or dried but I just happened to use dried ! ! I should definitely try just washing my face with rose water , sounds amazing ! Oh my heck my lips have been so dry so like a month ago I got this really moisturizing lip mask from Sephora that I wear to bed every nights , its amazing !

What we got instead of power outages and food shortages was one of those days filled with those winter time magical moments I mentioned a few days ago ! Because the city was almost completely shut down , we decided to go to Central Park today , TWICE ! It was one of those movie-esque scenes ! Everyone was sledding , making snow angels , cross country skiing ( we want to do this next time ! ) , snowshoeing , having snow ball fights , and even playing football ? ! Atticus and Chauncey were once again in heaven ! Its so fun to see A take it all in . You can tell he is so curious with- everything . New sights , sounds , textures , smells , all get him so excited . And Chauncey of course just goes bizzerk ! He is literally uncontrollable as soon as the snow starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardware stores looking for sleds but everywhere was sold out ! Luckily we were able to borrow one from some friends in the park . The sad part is , the snow is melting so fast . We know its going to be gone in a couple days so we are trying to take it all in .

The campaign encourages people to share the reasons and inspirations behind why they like to give back during the holiday season . I was very excited to participate in this and share why I love to give back , you can read- an article- I wrote about how my dad played a big role in teaching me to give back ( that is also my cute paps in the picture above ! ! ! = ) . The holiday season is such a happy and cheerful time and I really think it is because everyone has giving and helping others on their minds . Check out the video- to see more on why I think its so important to give back and be sure to share your reasons and inspiration using the hashtag #redkettlereason <p> I could n't agree more . this is most definitely the time of year that everyone has giving on their minds and I think the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cute picture of you with your dad . you look gorgeous ! <p> loved your article ! whenever I hit a particularly rough patch in my life ( and would undoubtably throw myself a pity party ) my friend would always remind me to serve and put others first to help regain that lost happiness . the Christmas season always brings out the service-oriented deeds , and I absolutely love it !

I use the medium for the first few coats and the wet for the last coats and the dry one to comb out and shape them . But mascara ( even the cheap kind like I use ) is at least 10 bucks so I like mine to last long. - <p> So all 3 of mine were super dry like 2 months ago so I put in a few drops of saline and voila ! It was like new mascara ! ! The saline of course evaporates after a couple days so you have to do it regularly but it made mine last 2 extra months , I just barely bought new mascara today. - <p> It was the best money saving trick ever ! ! <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the mascara I use , and swear by . <p> I am pretty sure it does n't  matter what brand saline you use .. I use some no name brand from wal mart and it works just great <p> P.S. Its only Tuesday yet it feels like it should be Friday . What is up with that ? <p> Your reply was really snotty ! The girl simply made a comment that your idea of using saline in old mascara was a better choice then tap water , because of previous eye surgery . Which you respond " haha " , By the way , you complain about a $10.00 item , but buy $600.00 shoes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> I 've had two eye surgeries , and my opthamologist told me both times that nothings as dirty as tap water and to avoid getting it in my eyes while healing . Saline is sterile , so that 's definitely what youd want to add to mascara .

Amber asked me if I 'd write the blog post today , what an honor ; ) <p> Somehow we were late to- the bike game- here in- NYC . We meant to get bikes- for so long but for some reason always put it off , and of course got them just months before we leave the city for good . But now that we have them , we take them everywhere . Trips to the most distant corners of Central Park which normally required- either a subway + a long walk , or an expensive cab trip , have turned into a quick bike ride . Now were able to see a whole new side of the city that we never got to see before . <p> On Friday we- biked over to- Sheeps Meadowagain . But can you blame us ? We cant get enough of that view . If you follow me on snapchat ( davidavidavid ) you might have seen Atticus dribbling the soccer ball . I decided- to try and- teach him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he finally got the hang of it . He actually picked it up suspiciously fast . We might have a young Messi on our hands , or feet . I cant wait to kick/throw/hit/shoot the ball with him . <p> I have to make a- shameless plug . If you do n't  follow me on Instagram or YouTube , you may not have seen my two new videos Ive posted which may answer some of the camera questions we 've been getting . Check out What 's in my Camera Bag(s) and Tips for Taking Candid Pictures of your Kids , below . - Let me know if you have more questions in the comments on my videos and ill try to get to all of them . Who knows , maybe Amber will invite me back for a second post ? Crossing my fingers . <p> I 'm aspiring to be a photographer and blogger . You guys are an inspiration to me . I do n't  have the best of the best of cameras . I have a Canon though . What was your feelings when you first started blogging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I FINALLY just bought bikes too ! ! We have lived in downtown Cleveland for 3 years now , and just like David said , we just kept putting off bike buying . Now that we have them , we take them out almost every single day !

However , being " late to the bike game " in NYC , perhaps you are unaware that children under the age of one are not legally allowed to be carried on bicycles here in the city : LONG ... ( under the section " For Children On Bicycles " ) . Given how much I know you care for your children and their safety , I 'm sure you would n't knowingly break the law by putting sweet Rosie on a bike , so thought I 'd give you the heads-up ( I actually know someone who was ticketed in Central Park for this offense , and hope to spare you the same unfortunate fate ) ! <p> David did a great job writing this post !

I really enjoy when girls flaunt their bodies in the right way ! Amber is not trying to be scandalous . She is wearing a bathing suit just like you and me , the only difference is that she is pregnant ! ( And looks super good ! ) I would encourage you to take a look in the mirror and define who YOU want to be . Do n't  worry about anybody elses opinion . If you are there , great , but do n't  judge other people for their standard of comfortability . Whenever I get comments that are of nobody elses business , I always tell people that modesty is between me and God . Nobody else . <p> Thanks so much girl ! ! I basically have been doing weights for my arms ( shoulders , triceps , biceps ) and I do a lot of oblique work outs and lots of lunges haha but other than that just simple cardio ! I do n't  work out every day though just maybe 3 times a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry that I am just getting back to you !

No woman deserves to be spoken to and judged in that way . I think she looks beautiful and her pictures are always classy and tasteful . Her posts have made me excited about becoming pregnant and I love that she is sharing her journey with her followers ! <p> I love the lash extensions . Iam considering getting some but Iam wondering if they ruin your original lashes when they come off . My lashes are so blonde that I have to put heavy coats of mascara on every day . <p> Yeah mine are blonde as well and mascara takes soo long so lash extensions are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't  pick your lashes or pull them off then your real lashes will be just fine ! you just have to be gentle with them but they are amazing ! <p> I like to think I can still be a " decent " individual and show my pregnant stomach which I happen to be very proud of and I think every pregnant woman should be proud of . Clearly you do n't  feel the same and that is fine but your condescending comment is not welcome here . <p> Isnt it funny that the things you think will be the most memorable end up being the least memorable ? ! Its always those little , special moments that leave the biggest impression . So wonderful you got to travel as a couple so much this past year ! It will be both different and exciting when you have baby to join you in future trips ! Love these photos and love following along on ig . Those bathers are too cute !

But first let me say that I got the idea from cutest Weslie at lovechugs.blogspot.com .. she mentioned she puts coconut oil on her hair and if you have seen Weslie , who does n't  want hair like hers ? I mean seriously . So of course I run on over to the store and pick up some coconut oil to give it a whirl . <p> I love it . <p> I do n't  think it matters how you do it , but this is how I did it : <p> 1 . washed my hair like normal <p> 2. let it air dry til about 30% of the wetness was gone <p> 3. melted down the oil ( it comes in a solid form so just run it under hot water ) <p> 4. applied to my hair from roots to ends <p> 5. pinned it up and put a shower cap on ( or use saran wrap ! you do n't  necessarily need to cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. You want heat so the cuticles of your hair can open and the oil can penetrate if you will ( I hate the word penetrate ) ) <p> 6. took a blow dryer and blew on high for about 10 minutes <p> 7. let it sit for 20 more ( let 's the hair cool which means the cuticles will close and lock in the oil ) <p> 8. washed it out ( I washed like normal with shampoo and conditioner and hot water maybe you do n't  have to but I did and mine was not waxy or greasy after ) <p> Voila . <p> I know that 's a lot of steps but its really not a lot of work and its amazing . Your hair will be silky smooth I promise . <p> I really wish you would have said this does not work on all hair- I followed your instructions to a T and my hair was sooooooo sticky , greasy , and waxy it would not move . It took me 3 days of trying everything I could think of ( and I mean everything from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dish soap , baby powder , trying to melt it out with a blow drier , baking soda paste , and an egg yolk wash ) to get this gunk out of my hair , I was worried I would ruin my hair trying to get this out . It took 3 whole bottles of dry shampoo to get this out . Maybe include how to get this out when shampoo and conditioner does n't  work for girls like me <p> You have to make sure you use organic extra virgin coconut oil . The same exact thing happened to me it was tragic but it was because I did n't  use organic coconut oil . Some of them have protrolyum in it which causes the hair to feel waxy <p> Amber , I love this ! I 'm a big coconut oil fan already and was looking for a way to nourish dry hair using coconut oil , this is IT ! ! !

I was always wondering if putting too much oils into blonde bleached hair wont make it the color go yellowish . I mean it still goes but I use all those purple shampoos , balms etc . I realize with bleached hair which is quite dry ( my case at least ) you need to make sure you moisturize it and put all the good stuff as treatment . I would usually use leave in sprays , deep conditioners stuff like that . But the idea of putting olive oil or coconut oil just makes me freak out since I think it will leave it greasy moreover will hurt the color . Any though on this ? I guess I will give coconut a try anyways . It looks like it benefots your hair , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is a good question ! ! I mean you could do a quick google search and see if it has for anyone out there on the web but for me and all my friends ( who are also blonde ) it has never affected our blonde and we all do it ! ! = <p> Coconut oil is an edible oil extracted from the kernel or meat of matured coconuts harvested from the coconut palm ( Cocos nucifera ) .

I was absolutely disgusted by all of the horrible , vile , mean comments that were left ( which is why the post is now deleted ) . Majority of the comments had nothing to do with politics and everything to do with me , personally . Funny how you can simply state who you are voting for ( and clearly state that you have respect for both parties and anyone who votes for either party ) and in return you can be told , " you have big hips . " " you are a disgrace to women . " " you are so uneducated. " " you 're not even pretty . " .. the list goes on .

I am totally a believer in keeping your mind healthy and reinforcing positive thoughts so I love a good inspirational book . My friend Bree got this book a while ago written by our favorite super model , Miranda Kerr , called Treasure Yourself . - It is a book about keeping your mind and body healthy and she basically just shares tips on how she keeps her skin healthy , body fit , and mind positive . And at the end she gives a whole list of affirmations that she lives by . - In the book Miranda says she will pick out an affirmation before she goes to bed and say in her mind so when she wakes up that is the first thing she thinks about and she tries to live by that affirmation throughout the day . I absolutely loved the idea and so I made my own little jar with a lot of her affirmations as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite pinterest quotes . <p> **The 5 love languages : I do n't  know that this would be classified as self-help but it is really great because it explains how a persons love language is how they show love to someone else and how for that individual to feel loved , they need to also be loved in their own love language . Mine is quality time and physical touch .. so basically for me to " feel loved " someone would have to , as the book says , show it by using those languages and if I were dating someone whose love language was words of affirmation , I would have to show my love that way .. etc. - <p> **If You Have to Cry Go Outside : - This book is by Kelly Cutrone ( one of my most favorite public figures ) and she tells about how she gained her success . - Its kind of a girl power book haha and it makes you want to just go out and accomplish all your goals and dreams . <p> I have all of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , articles , pinterest , etc. and so I basically typed them up and put them in this jar and I try to read one every night before bed . - I still need to finish typing and cutting the rest .. I have so many . - But , I love it because it keeps me healthy and motivated . - <p> I absolutely LOVE the jar idea ! I also enjoy self help books . I think it is important for us to always strive to better ourselves and think more positively about the world and everything in it . I totally plan on stealing the words of affirmation idea = Thanks for the tips on the books , too ! !

It is seriously the most perfect place on earth ( in my opinion = ) and if I could live anywhere I would pick this town a million times over . I keep trying to convince David into us moving there ! Ah I just ca n't handle its charm ! <p> When you are traveling with a baby you literally get 15% ( that is generous ) luggage space so I reallly had to plan out what I needed for the 15 days I would be gone .

That is literally all I had room after packing everything for my baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around more than one suitcase in addition to the stroller , baby , etc. so I pretty much brought my classic go tos . These flats are fab because they can be folded up nice and tiny and do n't  take up hardly any luggage space .

And then I pretty much just brought simple tops that could be worn more than once and relied on my hair and small hair accessories to get me by ! I LOVE Cara hair accessories like this headband I am wearing and bought a few to take on the trip since they add a little something and are so easy to pack . <p> Now we are in Barcelona and we are kind of laying low and relaxing a bit .

In our boutique we have just developed a formula for a sugar scrub that we are all obsessed with . Even my momlol . We all use it on a daily basis everywhere . Including our face and lips .

Maybe be dumb but do you wash your face with anything after the sugar ? Has is broke you out ? I was just wondering because I have sensitive skin .. and was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only fear is it breaking me out . I take it you havent had any problems . <p> Sugar scrubs are not usually recommended for people that are prone to break-outs . Generally speaking sugar-scrubbing your face or using an exfoliate every single day is actually bad for your skin and will probably cause you to break out more because your body will overcompensate for the constant stripping by producing more oil . If you decide to try the oil-route , I would not recommend using baby oil by ANY means . Perhaps try to utilize some of the more lighter oils on the market like Freshs Seaberry oil , which is better for those who have acne prone skin . Not to discredit miss Amber here . I have browsed through some of her skincare posts and a lot of what she does would make my dermatologist scream . Chemical peels should not be done so often , and stripping your skin constantly will actually expedite the aging process .

I would love to know more about the types of workouts you do ( cardio vs. strength training , etc . ) . It could also be fun if you did like a fitness fashion post haha . Just like some cute workout apparel . I am getting weirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post ! I 'm really into fitness right now , trying to get ready for summer , and for me it would be interesting if you showed us what you eat/drink after your workouts etc. , because I do n't  know a lot about that yet . All the information I find contradicts each other =x LONG ... <p> Hi ! I found your blog couple of days ago and to be honest first I was thinking that you are some beautiful but shallow person like so many of fashion bloggers . Then I read more and more your posts especially old ones and I understood that you are one smart and kind-hearted girl ! Du n no if its about religion that makes me feel like we have something common ( I have different religion but many same manners than you ) but I 'm gon na keep following this blog . Also I 'm getting married with my BF and I found your wedding posts so inspiring ! Thanks . I just had to say this to you haha ! = greetings from Finland xx

By then , you usually feel so good and forget about being sad anyways . <p> But the other day I was n't sad .. - more-so- just feeling kinda down/blah and was kinda having a bad day so I decided to go on a walk and pick some flowers . They were supposed to be for me but then I remembered what my dad said and decided to give them to other people . <p> I got brown paper bags for a buck and painted a little heart on them and then trimmed the edges and voila . A super cheap , cute surprise for someone . <p> That day also happened to be the year mark from when my sister Emily had her baby Crew . He was a still born baby and that day would have been his one year birthday ! He is the sweetest little spirit and when I think about that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit so strong that day .

I went through my closet and re fell in love with blazers I love throwing them on over a printed tee ( obsessed with this baby mama one ! ) or even just a plain tee and a slick bun . <p> Speaking of baby mamas this pregnancy is getting to the point where it is extra hard to dress the bump ! I mean there are so few styles that work with a big belly ( while not feeling like you look huge haha ) and let 's be honest some days I just want to be in my sweat pants and a big , comfy tee all day long . I am sure if you are pregnant or have been you know those days when you try on 10 million things and just do n't  feel cute in any and end up crying or something and your husband has to try and make you feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually love LOVE love dressing the bump 95% of the time BUT there are those days of course = luckily blazers are one thing that I found totally work with the bump and have been a go to lately ! <p> Hi Amber I totally know how you feel !

Lisa xxx <p> Aw congrats ! ! ! 30 weeks , you are just right behind me ! And girl , I swear every pregnant woman has those days so do n't  feel bad ! Totally normal ! I think its hard when you have the bump to feel good 100% of the time because of all the weight gain but I have never seen a pregnant woman I did n't  think was beautiful so just know its only you who feels that way everyone else thinks you 're a beauty ! ( easy to say not to hear haha should be saying this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can totally relate to those days and I 'm not even pregnant ! ! It makes me feel better that someone as perfect as you has them too haha . You look gorgeous as always ! I 'm still a few years ( and an upcoming wedding ) away from getting pregnant but I 'll definitely have to come back to these posts for some style inspo when I 'm carrying my first little one . Who knows , maybe your 2nd or 3rd pregnancy will coincide with my first and I could get maternity style inspiration from your current posts at that time too ! = <p> I can totally relate ! Especially the trying on 10 million things and ending up crying part lol . I also love dressing the bump 99% of the time , but sometimes . gosh , I just want to crawl under covers and stay there all day ! <p> Ha I still have those days all the time now ! But YESSSSS !

I kinda feel like the odd man out sometimes , so its nice to be reminded that I 'm not the only one ! ) . Anyways , sorry for the really long and sorta creepy , personal comment . I hope it made you feel at least a little better ! = : * Otherwise , I 'm soooo sorry haha ! <p> He s two now ! Crazy huh ?

My sister was sending me pictures of them making snowmen in ARIZONA ! Like what ? ! I feel like every time Ive come to New York in the winter , there is always SO much snow ! I remember Facetimeing David one night on the way home to my hotel when we were first married , he was in Utah and I was here for fashion week . I was in Times Square- and spontaneously , someone just started a snowball fight ! It was like something out of a- movie . All these strangers just pushed pause on their busy lives and had this magical moment and it was like a dream . So Ive been waiting and- when we got home from Christmas , we woke up one morning to snow ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! We threw on our snow gear and walked to Central Park and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . He was so wide eyed and curious . And Chauncey , the wild animal that he is , just ran- in circles chasing snowflakes and scooping up mouthfulls of snow . It was pretty great . When you do n't  have to plow the side walks , scrape the ice off your windshield , or walk out to your car 20 minutes before you leave to warm it up , snow is a very good thing ! We just ca n't wait for our next storm . Especially with a good pair of boots ! These Sorels are a dream ! I have the worst circulation ( remember how I tell- David how cold I am ) and these are my solution ! If it drops below 40 and the ground is the least bit wet , chances are Im wearing them . Now- we just need more snow fingers crossed . <p> OMG you guys are so cute ! ! ! I just love looking at your photos and being amazed by how good you look together ! Its like a magazines family U are all gorgeous ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ! He is so darn cute ! Love love love <p> Ahh this looks like such a blast ! I know I was just saying to my husband last night how disappointed I am that we have n't had any real snow yet ! We live in CT on the water so even when it snows , we do n't  get much because of the warm , salty ocean air . I think its supposed to snow tonight and throughout the weekend though , so let 's hope ! Oh , I have such bad circulation , too . My fingers and toes go numb so fast even when its not that cold ! Its such a pain when we go snowboarding . Def checking out these boots ! Thanks = xo

And this time it is a one way ticket = I am literally so excited I probably wont be able to sleep for those four hours so I think I am going to pull an all nighter . When I was 12 years old I begged my mom to let me go to boarding school in New York City and I cant believe that I will finalllllly be living there as of tomorrow . It is crazy because it all happened WAY fast . We knew we were moving a couple months ago but everyone said real estate goes so fast so our broker told us not to come until late November/Early December . We flew up there on Thanksgiving day and looked throughout the weekend and ended up finding an apartment we LOVED ! We of course had to go through all of the madness of filling out 10 million forms , giving tax returns , our first born child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and I was crossing my fingers we would get it and then I found out DURING the finale of the Victorias Secret show that we had been approved and got the apartment I was FUHREAKING OUT . I am in love with the apartment and can not wait to get there and start decorating = For those who asked if we are bringing Chauncey yes we are ! ! We are actually going to be living right by the park just for that little stinker . <p> A lot of you have asked WHY we are moving so let me sort of explain . First and foremost , David and I have been working on something that I am sooo beyond excited to be able to share BUT I cant yet ( I know , anticlimactic and a total buzzkill ) I am kind of superstitious so I feel like if I talk about it now I am going to jinx something so I am going to wait until it is totally finished to tell you guys . Another reason we are moving is- because of my blog I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and everything kind of goes on- in NYC so we are going out there to kind of follow some of my dreams . We are going to put Davids work on hold for the time being and go after these ventures we are currently working on . And honestly I feel so blessed to have David he is so amazing for supporting me and helping me achieve all these wild dreams I have and helping me bring all my ideas to life . My blog sort of started because of my hair pictures and tutorials so in going to New York I will be focusing A LOT more on my YouTube and publishing regular tutorials . The blog will remain a mix of **26;1119;TOOLONG but I am going to focus a lot on my YouTube as well. - Another reason is because we love to travel and I often travel for work and traveling out of Alabama is beyond a nightmare ! It is so annoying and really rough tacking on at least two extra flights/layovers to any trip we take , especially since I take Atticus everywhere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrets and whatnot because I have always been super open on my blog but- hopefully in a few months when I can tell you guys a little more of what we have been working on it will make more sense ! <p> Also just want to say THANK YOU for all your comments and support through the years .. A lot of you have followed since I was dirt poor in college donating plasma and working part time to get by - ( lol ) . It really means everything to me ! ! ! Xoxoxo <p> First off , congrats !

@@98070283 @2270283/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> As you have noticed my blog got a makeover ! It was done by Smitten Blog Designs ! I also have a new tab , Fitness , so that means I am going to do a lot more with health and fitness since it does mean a lot to me ! I am excited . <p> I get married ONE month from today ! ! ! <p> So I figured I would share what I am doing to get ready for my wedding day ! Starting with <p> MY SKIN : <p> I obviously want flawless skin for my wedding day .. so there are a few things I am doing : <p> NUMBER ONE : Retin A : I am using Retin A on my face every night for the next two weeks . Then I will wait 4 days ( not using it ) after which I am going to get an intense chemical peel . <p> I have used it off and on for over a year now and it really is amazing . It will clear up any acne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the peeling ends you have the most flawless skin . Its such a joke how good your skin looks . Then I go a week or so without it and then go back . Sometimes I will go off it for a month or longer . Just depends what I have going on or how my skin is at the time . I do still use cream around my eyes while doing this and I always make sure to- moisturize- a lot in the morning before I do my make up ! <p> I used to put it all over my face but stayed away from getting to close to my eyes , ( a lot of people will say to never use it all over your face , I do n't  listen because the results have been amazing ) since I have used it so much I have learned where to NOT put it . Since you do peel/flake , do NOT - put it : <p> 1 . close to the bottom of your nose , you will flake and peel and it will look like flaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2. close to your eyebrows . It will peel under your eyebrows if you get to close and it is SUPER annoying . <p> 3 . I DO put it on my chin but I leave an obvious space between my chin and bottom lip , I also do n't  put it on the skin above my upper lip . If it gets to close to your lips they will get so chapped and you will want to die . <p> NUMBER TWO : Like I said , I will get a chemical peel probably 2.5 weeks before my wedding . My face will peel off for about 1.5 weeks and for the week before I will moisturize using Arcona Eye Dew around my eyes ( its my absolute favorite anti aging/moisturizing product ) , on my forehead , and my smile lines , and I will use a basic moisturizer for everywhere else ( I usually use Cetaphil or Loreal Age Perfect ) <p> NUMBER THREE : I try to go to the dermotologist about twice a year just to get feedback on my skin and what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dark circles around my eyes .. They are not drastic but I notice them . He said I can buy an expensive product from him or double the amount of water I am drinking . I have been drinking about 8 water bottles a day and it has made SUCH a difference in my dark circles and just my skin everywhere . It also helps in muscle building . I hate drinking water , so I am just sucking it up and doing it because it makes such a difference . <p> LASHES/BROWS : <p> NUMBER ONE : I am a religious Latisse user and have been for 2 years ! It is amazing . The results are just incredible and I will never stop using it . I have seen NO side effects . They say your eye can darken , I have not noticed that . ( my dark circles around my eyes are not due to using Latisse ) <p> I have been going back and forth about getting lash extensions for my wedding and honeymoon , right now I am set on using individual falsies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honeymoon . <p> NUMBER TWO : - About 2 days before my wedding I am going to have my eyebrows trimmed , waxed , and dyed ! I love dying my eyebrows . I was so scared to do it at first , but if you get someone good , it really is amazing the difference it makes . <p> HAIR : <p> NUMBER ONE : I am deep conditioning my hair at least once a week using Moroccan Oil Restorative Mask . I have used LOTS of deep conditioners but I love this one and the Biolage deep conditioner best . I wash my hair with shampoo and hot water , get most of the moisture out , put this stuff in from mid strand to ends , wait 15 minutes , and rinse with cold water . Sometimes I will get out of the shower to put it in and walk around and do whatever for about 30 minutes then rinse . <p> NUMBER TWO : In case you did n't  know , I DO use extensions . My hair is the same length as my extensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Euronext extensions from Sallys and I always get the Blonde Frost color in 18 inch length . I am going to get new ones probably 2 weeks before . ( If you cant find your exact color , it is always good to get DARKER as opposed to LIGHTER when it comes to blonde extensions . ) <p> MY BODY : <p> NUMBER ONE : I am going to do the same diet I told you guys about , here . And I am upping my work out routines , I am going to the gym for about 1.5-2 hours a day , 5-6 days a week . I am mostly doing weights as I want to TONE , but I am also doing cardio for at least 15 min a day . <p> NUMBER TWO : I know supplements have such a negative connotation and many people are against them . Well guess what ? I am not ! ( sometimes supplements can be bad , you have to look into them and make sure you know what you are taking ! ) Anyways I have been using this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take and it helps you have energy and it boosts your metabolism ! I have tried a few like this one before , but did n't  like them because they made me super shaky . This one is mild and does not do that as long as you eat before and obviously normal amounts throughout the whole day . I lost 4 pounds my first couple weeks on it . But I was taking it and ALSO doing my normal work outs ! You do still have to work out for it to be that effective , but some days it is nice because if I know I wont make it to the gym I will take it so that I am burning extra calories throughout my day . <p> ( that product was given to me for free , but this is the first supplement given to me of many I am actually telling you guys about . If I do n't  like the product I always send it back and tell them what I did n't  like . ) <p> Anyways , that is all for now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> Hey Amber , I 'm getting married in May . I was reading this and the diet is n't popping up anymore ! Also , are there any supplements you recommend other than that one ? That one is n't available anymore . Thanks ! <p> Hey Amber ! I 'm really interested in using retinA and latisse but I need to find a great dermatologist first . I 'm from the Salt Lake area and wondering what dermatologist you went to while you lived in Utah ? Would love to hear from you , THANKS ! <p> I also use Retin-A but my skin peels like crazy . I have a hard time even wearing makeup while its peeling like it does . Do you exfoliate while your skin is peeling and how do you cover up the peeling so you can still go out and about after using it ? Thanks = <p> Hey Amber , I 'm getting married this summer and I 'm thinking of trying the tips you gave that worked for you . Before I start looking into where I can get everything ( like the retinA &amp; lactisse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if you 're still a believer in these products ? It is my big day after all so just want to be sure = Btw , I 'm a huge fan of your blog you 're so amazing at what you do ! ! Cheers , Erin <p> YES ! I absolutely LOVE Retin-a and Latisse still ! You ca n't use either of them while pregnant or trying to get pregnant so I have n't used them in a while but I am so so excited to be able to use them again ! So I definitely recommend ! <p> Could you do another post about Retinoid skin creams ? Ive been wanting to try one , but am fearful of the intense peeling and other side effects Ive heard about . Also , any drugstore brands you recommend ? I know there are n't  a lot , but I 've heard good things about ROC . <p> Hey Amber ! Priscilla again ( sorry , obsessed with your blog ! ) I was curious to know how much Retin-A costs ? Dr. Oz said it has the ability to replace collagen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Youve heard the rumors " but now you 've got proof . There is absolutely nothing in the world that compares to the sweet sensation of a babys skin . It feels good , it smells good " heck , it even tastes pretty sweet when you kiss it . But there 's a downside to that brand-new and delicious epidermis : Newborn skin is ultrasensitive to a host of potential irritants . Some might cause bumps , others a bright-red rash . Most of these baby blemishes are perfectly normal and will pass with time , especially if you know how to treat them . here 's a roundup of the most common skin conditions that can develop in your babys first year , . <p> Hey Amber , I do n't  know if you remember me . Im Sarahs friend you met at the parade a while ago . I am excited for you and David . I just love his family . I saw you mentioned Latisse . My sister and did a trial of Latisse and Li lash and we like Li lash better . I 'm sure they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheaper and easier to get . We thought it worked at least as well if not better : ) I 'm not recommending you switch before the wedding , but just a thought . Good luck on the wedding ! ! I 'm sure I will see you around . <p> Hey Amber , I do n't  know if you remember me . Im Sarahs friend you met at the parade a while ago . I am excited for you and David . I just love his family .

I just use a mascara wand from the mall makeup counters to apply it . Anyways it is worth a try cause its super cheap and from the comfort of your home . Haha just one of my new tips ! Sometimes its kinda dark for the first day or two but fades . <p> I use retinA on my skin too , but I have the most difficult time to get the peeling to stop ! However , it works like a charm for on the spot acne treatment . Ca n't wait to see wedding LONG ...

But yeah they are the same shoes in that post Amanda mentioned = I actually cant see them on the site anymore but maybe the link from that post will lead you to them ! xoxo <p> Question for youIm thinking of getting eyelash extensions for my wedding . Would you recommend getting them or do they ruin your natural lashes ? I probably would n't get them redone afterwards because they are a little pricey ! I would love to hear your advice ! <p> Sarah ! ! Congrats on getting married ! ! Honestly I say get them because they will be so nice to have on your honeymoon and then you do n't  have to worry about putting make up on ! Especially if you are doing tropical .. so nice that you can swim with them and still feel pretty and not have mascara dripping down your face ! <p> They do n't  ruin your lashes if you do n't  pull them off .. if you have a habit of picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly and the only part that sucks is when you have like 4 left on each eye and look like a weirdo so during that phase I just put on false lashes to cover it up or cut them to my natural length if that makes sense ! Have the best day and do n't  worry about any details of the wedding .. let your family take care of all of that ! = xoxo

@@98070288 @2270288/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> A lot of you have been asking about what I eat/do for a diet for about a year now . And I am finally getting around to telling you all . This is the diet I do before a vacation or special event or something .. in just my day to day life I try to eat as healthy as I can but i do n't  worry about not having carbs after lunch and I will eat actual desserts I just try not to too late at night . I usually find something good that I love and keep going back to that . you could say I get in food ruts .. but I love my tasty ruts . I do n't  have strict guidelines .. I just try to stay away from carbs and sugar as much as I can but mostly I try to eat healthy and exercise a lot . I am still a girl with a raging hormonal sweet tooth so I am always craving sweets . I try to do alternative healthier sweets , but sometimes I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream . So I do , I just make sure to balance that with physical activity . <p> *I will post my work out routines/tricks soon ! <p> Breakfast : <p> 1 . steel cut oats with sliced bananas and vanilla almond milk . If you have n't tried vanilla almond milk- I highly recommend ! I used to add loads of brown sugar to my oatmeal or cream of wheat but with vanilla almond milk you do n't  have to , its a much healthier alternative ! ( make sure you do n't  get the unsweetened kind .. I sometimes accidentally do that because it will still say vanilla so it tricks ya .. but its gross ) <p> 2. vanilla yogurt ( any brand , I get whatever generic brand has the best deal that day ) and add grapes or strawberries or raspberries .. just whatever fruit I have laying around at the time *I also eat this whenever I am craving sugar or sweets <p> 3. bacon and eggs . my favorite way to do it is lay the bacon down , I do 3 pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack 2 eggs right on top of them like you would a fried egg and just let it cook however you like your fried egg . Does that make sense ? It ends up being a fried egg with 3 pieces of bacon cooked inside and I just eat it like I would a piece of pizza haha <p> Lunch : *I do n't  have carbs after lunch time so I try to take advantage of lunch time and have a sandwich or something ! <p> 1 . sliced cucumbers with sliced turkey . I get two of the cucumbers and a slice of turkey and put them together like a sandwich and then I dip it in light ranch ( its better in cafe rio ranch .. but what is n't better in cafe rio ranch ? ? ) . I have a few of those along with a half sandwich with light mayo , whole wheat bread , cucumbers , and turkey . I love to put chips in my sandwiches to give it texture but cucumbers do the same thing and are healthier . <p> 3 . Bruschetta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the glaze its so much better than the liquidy- vinegar .. if you do n't  know what that means just ask someone at the grocery store and they should know what you 're talkin about ! ) <p> Dinner:1. chicken breast dipped in egg whites and then dipped in blended up fiber one cereal baked in the oven . - It essentially tastes like breaded chicken only the fiber one is a healthier alternative . <p> 2 . Salads . I am a savage when it comes to salads I just put anything I have in a Tupperware , throw some light dressing on and shake it up . I either broccoli , cucumbers , tomatoes , cheese , corn , chicken , seriously whatever I have . <p> 3 . Mmmm I lovvvve making shredded chicken with seasoning and adding corn to it and then getting a head of lettuce and just make lettuce wraps with it . Its so yummy . <p> 4 . Veggies . I usually just have squash and asparagus and saute them together with some olive oil and whatever seasonings sound good at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your blog for a while now and have finally plucked up the courage to comment . I know this is your diet when you want to look good before holiday or whatever , but what would your typical day-to-day diet menu look like ? I 'm finding it hard to get the balance between dieting and eating normally . You look so healthy , and you manage to balance eating in moderation with work and a baby ! So I 'd love to know how you factor in food with all that . xoxox <p> I was so excited when you said you 're " a savage " when it comes to salad because you put ANYTHING in one . I 'm the same way- because of habits learned from my garbage disposal of a mother . My fiance absolutely hates it though . He s constantly telling me that a certain dressing does n't  go with a certain type of lettuce and CERTAINLY not with corn , green peppers , broccoli , soy beans , carrots , tomatoes.etc . So I just thought that was hilarious and awesome ! <p> This is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't  eat carbs after lunch does that mean you avoid breads , pastas , crackers , cereal , etc ? I guess I 'm just trying to figure out what 's a carb and what 's not . <p> Actually , its not a stupid question at all ! Its a very common misconception = fruits and veggies are carbs , just like breads , cereals , rice and pastas . I think what Amber means is that she avoids starches after lunch . Although in my opinion , while potatoes are technically a starch , I think if you keep the portion small , and eat the skin , they 're pretty satisfying with dinner . Sweet potatoes are even more nutritious . Happy eating !

I love being around talented people , it is so so inspiring . <p> There was something extra special about this trip and I am not sure if it was just because the Honolulu Magazine team was SO amazing and gracious or just because Honolulu is absolutely amazing , but this trip just felt really special for us .

@@98070299 @2270299/ 10589 @qwx870589 10588 @qwx870588 <p> My baby boy is one month today ! ! ! So I thought I would share some of my favorites so far . I know I am still a new mom but I feel like you figure out quick what you like and do n't  like especially since you get such a variety of things at showers and what not . So here we go .. <p> 1 . Petunia Pickle Bottom Carryall I have a few diaper bags and I have to say this one is my favorite ! I mainly love how structured it is and I have loved its zip out changing pad so much more than my diaper bags with the roll up pad . <p> 2 . Giraffe Pacifier Love this because it helps the pacifier not to fall out so much . The giraffe kind of weighs it down and helps keep it in . I got one of these as a gift and went and got a few more . <p> 3 . Cakes Cotton Candy Nursing Bra I got a variety of nursing bras and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its by far my favorite ! ! Its so great and so so comfy . <p> 4 . Elephant Ears These are so so great for when he s just hangin out and I lay him down during the day or to use in his swings or in the bassinet . He is so much more content when I use these because it supports his head and makes it easier for him to fall asleep ! <p> 5 . Cable Knit Blanket Softest blanket ever and best blanket to swaddle with .. he does n't  budge . We got a few of these and I love them . Since it is summer though we really only use them at home . <p> 6 . Aden and Anais Swaddle Blankets I do n't  love to swaddle him in these at night because I feel like he wiggles around and gets out of them way easier but they are great for little blankets to take out during summer because they are so lightweight and my poor guy gets so hot so easy ! ! <p> 7 . Bambo Diapers Zulily sent us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am so glad because I do n't  think I would have known about them otherwise . Pampers , Costco , Huggies , etc all seem pathetic compared to these ! They are so thick and absorb so much .. I almost hate that I got accustomed to them because now I cant really use anything else definitely worth the extra money in my opinion . <p> 8 . Slouch Headwear Beanies Love love love these ! - I love the fit of them and that they do n't  fall off every two seconds ! Plus lots of cute colors <p> 9 . Carters Long Sleeve Onesies My favvvvorite onesies ever ! I do n't  know what it is but I swear they just look so stinking adorable on newborn boys . We brought him home in the gray one and I got tons of emails asking about my insta and what brand it was , so this is the set it came in ! <p> 10 . Baby Aviators He has yet to wear these but I am throwing them in this mix because I got them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear them ! I mean seriously how cute are they ? ? ? <p> 11 . Fisher-Price Swing HE STINKING LOVES THIS THING ! ! ! My sister in law gave it to us and he would just lay in it wide eyed all day long if I let him .. If he is fussy I put him in this and just like that he is happy as can be ! He loves his mamaroo but I have to say he loves this more ! <p> 12 . Zoe Organics I have the whole line and love it all ! Especially the lavender oil roll on and bath soap ! <p> That is all I have for now ! I will share more as they come and feel free to share any of your favorites in the comments ! Would love to hear ! <p> Oh and PS do n't  forget to check here for baby gear on sale at Nordstrom right now ! It opens for the public today = <p> Try two of the Aden and Anais swaddle wraps works like a charm ! Do one swaddle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worked wonders with my little one when she was little . Those blankets were my fave ! I literally owned 12 . <p> I found the same issue with the swaddle blankets . I love love their little sacs that have snaps though . My little guy stays all bundled in tight all night . I really think its why he s such a good sleeper through the night . When he s not in this he wakes up way more often ! <p> I love posts about baby products and mama products . I became a Momma in October to my boy , Rocky . I agree with you on the Pacifier , no doubt the best . Thanks for sharing , I will be looking into these items more ! <p> My baby girl absolutely loves her swing as well ! We got it for her at 3 months , and she sleeps in it so well ! I love how the top spins and has a mirror for her to look into . I have had quite the rounds with diapers . Right now my baby girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I am thinking about trying the Honest brand diapers . I will let you know what I think = Have you tried these yet ? <p> Gah I would never take him out of onsies and little hooded clothes ever . I wo n't lie , I myself have a cable knit blanket . The best thing alive might have to send this list to my cousin who recently had a baby too = x

There is an app though , called Keep Shopping , that can help you organize everything you need to buy and it makes the whole holiday process run a little smoother . Basically you can scroll through a feed of products that are available for purchase ( you can sort these and scroll through categories to make it more relevant ) and then as you see something you like , you can add it to a collection to buy later or you can add it to your cart . You can also add products to Keep from your favorite sites . Ready for the best part though ? You can shop from ANY STORE like J. Crew , Anthropologie , Etsy , Nordstrom , One Kings Lane , etc. and check out all at once . That way it saves you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process at every single store online . I honestly think that is the coolest thing ! I am so lazy haha and I hate typing in my shipping info , billing info , and all that over and over again so I was very excited about this . <p> Another reason I love this app is because I always get stuck shopping in the same places . I have my go to online stores and if say , a green coat , is no where to be found on my go to sites I assume it exists no where in this world haha . This helps me find way cute pieces that I normally would n't have found . <p> I have a bunch of collections made over on Keep with lots of cute items and gift ideas for the holidays ! So be sure to head on over to my profile and follow me to see more fun things I find ! xoxo <p> One checkout ! I need to check this out !

I have been meaning to do it for so long and just keep forgetting ! ! So please keep emailing requests for posts , I promise I will do them ! = ( eventually ) <p> Okay so I feel a little weird giving advice or tips or what not about working out because its not like I am in great shape , but I do love working out so I will share anyways . So I have recently been getting into dub step and techno ! I do n't  necessarily like to listen to them when I am just hanging out but when I am running or doing any form of cardio they are AMAZING ! Seriously . I came home from the gym yesterday like a giddy school girl raving to my roommates about how much I love dub step haha because I had the most amazing work out all thanks to my amazing playlist ! Music totally motivates me to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I listen to when working out : <p> ( if you do n't  like the first two songs , listen to them when doing cardio and I promise you 'll change your mind ! ) <p> **Also buy the clean version on iTunes of all these unless you want an earful of- belligerent-ness <p> While talking about working out .. I think its funny when girls use the excuse , " I do n't  have time " . You always have time , you 're just too lazy to make time . If you have time to get on facebook or pinterest or watch a show , you have time to go to the gym and do 30 minutes of cardio or at least do sit ups and push ups while you watch bachelor . Plus , you can read a book for school or study while doing cardio AND I have recently been doing weights while doing cardio to make my work outs go by faster . <p> Also , I am kind of sick of girls who pin all of these pictures of girls they want to look like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin to be beautiful " or " It does n't  matter what my body looks like , my husband loves me no matter what " <p> You 're right . You are beautiful just the way you are and your husband will love you if you gain 30 pounds . But if you want to look like those girls you keep pinning , I suggest getting your butt to the gym and doing something about it. - <p> ***And boys . if you expect us to have Victorias Secret model bodies then you better have a six pack and some awesomely strong arms to go along with those high hopes.And please . stop working out just your top half . You look ridiculous . <p> i am absolutely laughing my head off at this postin fact , i am in school , and my teacher keeps looking at me laughing so hard .. i went through all of your old posts on fitness , i am a gym addict , but wonder if i am ever even making progress . you are too funny , but this was sooo helpful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been procrastinating getting into a tight shape for the summer but thanks to this post , I feel overly motivated I may possibly run laps around my work right now to get a jump start . I love the guys who only work out the top half ! ha ha tell it how it is . <p> Jackie ! ! Okay yeah those two are hard to find on iTunes and they do n't  have clean versions on iTunes of them either so I just searched them on youtube and then converted it from youtube into and mp3 ! if you do n't  know how to do that just google " youtube to mp3 converter " and then you 'll copy and paste the link into the converter ! Its super easy I do it whenever songs are n't  on iTunes ! and ah I know I have been wanting to get spotify ! ! !

I kind of think they are rather expensive ( at least for such a quick read its expensive ) , or maybe I am just super cheap . But something about reading a magazine feels girly to me and since I love them and love looking at the ads and seeing all of my favorite models and reading new random tips , I treat myself to them every now and again . <p> So a couple weeks ago something came over me and I found myself at the Target register buying a Womens Health magazine . I made sure I read it from cover to cover so my $4.99 would n't go to complete waste ( I tell you , I am pretty darn cheap . ) Anyways , I saw this cool article about watermelon juice . <p> They said that in a recent study mice were fed a diet high in saturated fat and cholestrol and the mice that had watermelon juice with that diet gained 30% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is due to an amino acid called citrulline which is also found in garlic , onions , and chickpeas . <p> Anyways , I thought that was pretty cool and my husband and I decided to give it a try . I was kind of nervous to make Watermelon Juice because my thinking was , here we have this delicious watermelon , if the drink sucks , it will be gone and I wo n't even have a delicious drink ! But luckily , it is really yummy ! ! And it also has other benefits like helping with aging , and kickstarts your metabolism for the day ! Whether this is all true or not , I am not a scientist .. but I think the drink is good anyways , so I am running with it ! <p> Hey Amber , I just started following your blog a few weeks ago and really enjoy it , but now I especially do after this post ! I 'm actually the Associate Editor at Womens Health , and I 'm glad it was our magazine that you decided to pick up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact-checking process , so you can believe the powers of watermelon ! <p> Keep up the great blogging , and hopefully you read my article on page 74 ! = <p> Haha k I totally did n't  even plan that and was actually so mad when I realized because I thought it was maybe too matchy matchy and could n't tell if it was cute or not ! ! But I am glad you like it that makes me feel better ! ! ! = Thanks girl ! ! ! <p> Ok , I am going away from the watermelon comment ( which looks delish by the way and my have to try ) and have to agree with magazine prices . OMG are they serious ! Like you , I do n't  buy them very often . Actually only when I travel . So this weekend I will succumb to powers that be and buy some mags . Welcome back ! <p> Laura ! !

Thanks in advance = <p> I 'm thinking about putting a juicer on my wedding registry . Is it super time consuming ? When you make the juice is it like a meal replacement ? I need to make some healthy additions to my diet before the wedding : ) <p> Yeah I do it as a meal replacement ! ! Juicing is n't time consuming but if you do n't  clean the juicer right away then it dries and takes a long time to clean ! We love juicing though so I would recommend it !

Maybe because I am sick or maybe because my skin freaks out when its my time of the month . <p> I was frantically tossing everything in my house around like a rag doll searching for my Retin-a and finnnally found it last night and already my skin feels better . I also went out and bought a new face wash last week .. I never buy expensive face washes .. I mean its on your face for a matter of seconds I cant imagine it has time to do much for your skin anyways besides take your make up off and cleanse . I spend more money on toners and creams that have time to work over night . <p> Since a lot of you ask for my nightly routine I figured I would share ! <p> I kept seeing these " yes to " skin care lines at Target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . They have other kinds " yes to berries " for anti aging , " yes to tomatos " for acne , but I found that while all the others ( berries , tomatos ) received- around 3 stars this one ( carrots ) was getting 5 stars on almost every website . It really is amazing ! ! I have only used it for a week but my skin feels really soft and clean after , which is exactly what I want in my face wash . And no it does n't  smell bad ! At least I do n't  think so ! <p> Arcona is an AMAZING skin care line ! They were sponsors of a few shows at fashion week in September and they were using a bunch of their products on the models at various shows before they would go have their make up done . I got to talk with some of their reps and get samples of all their products and I have kept purchasing 3 of their products after the samples were gone and this is one of them ! These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my pores and clean my skin even further than my face wash . It also helps to clear up blemishes and has vitamins to help nourish your skin . A lot of people do n't  use toners or do n't  realize what they can do for your skin , so if you do n't  use one I highly recommend getting one , you 'll love it ! <p> I have recommended this product before and I have gotten emails from readers saying that of all the products I have recommended this is by far their favorite ! It really does work WONDERS ! I use it every night around my eyes AND every morning before I put on my makeup after I do my sugar scrub . It helps moisturize the skin around your eyes which is soo so important . It is the thinnest layer of skin on your face and needs to be taken care of unless you want to age a lot faster = so I would definitely say to go get this .. even though it is a bit pricier .. an eye cream is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Since I have really really oily skin , I cant use heavy creams so I use this serum as my moisturizer for the rest of my face the nights I DO NT use retin-a ( you sleep with retin-a on your face so those nights I only use my eye dew ) This is a serum that moisturizing and is an anti aging serum that will help keep your skin youthful . This is the serum I got for my husband too .. men do n't  love doing the whole routine like we do so this is a good basic that they can serve as an eye cream and moisturizer for their whole face . <p> i just wanted to say thank you for introducing me to the yes for carrots range . I went out and bought yes to tomatoes ( for acne prone skin ) moisturizer and it has made a huge difference . I had the worst skin after exam study period and over night 50% had gone NOT EVEN KIDDING . thankyouuuuu , and it was n't even that expensive . Paraben free products make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will def. be using this on all my flights this year as well to prevent icky dry skin . <p> Jane ! I know what you mean about it looking weird over it since it is a stickier serum . I actually put my concealer on after my foundation .. so I will put on the eye dew , put on my foundation , then my concealer , then use my hands to blend around my eyes and blend any lines from the foundation ! It works for me , so maybe that will help ! <p> Sylvie ! ! YES ! I have SUCH oily skin ! ! ! I use the Loreal oil blotting pads like 5 times a day haha by the end of the day they are filled with oil ! Honestly I just use those pads .. I use Revlon Photo Ready Foundation and it does n't  necessarily help but it is a lot better than others . I also love Bare Minerals Matte Powder to put over my foundation and it helps with the oilyness A LOT ! I will have to try milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Amber ! I have the Arcona Eye Dew and I cant figure out how you use in the morning before your concealer .

I was n't sure what the weather would be like ( weather apps are generally off a bit , in my experience of traveling ) so I brought a Summer outfit and a Winter outfit ( haha hence Davids backpack = ) but turns out I needed the Winter outfit because it was FREEZING ! And naturally David thought it was perfect weather , meanwhile I am literally shivering . <p> Pretty much the whole time we were there I was trying to convince David that we HAVE to move there . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that cute bakery for breakfast every morning . " " Now see , we can take Chauncey on walks in Central Park ! ! ! " you get the point . I was probably really annoying but at least I got him to agree with me ! Ideally we would go move to Belgium or Germany or something -thats my dream- but I do n't  think that will happen , so New York is my next option = The city life is too good for me to handle . <p> I 've lived in Germany for the past 2 years and it is a great place to live ! I love it here . Were really close to Belgium too . Brussels and Brugges are beautiful places to visit . I feel like Germany is not on the top of most peoples lists of places to go but there is so much to see here . And driving on the autobahn is so exhilarating ! ! ! <p> That is so cool that your hubby lived in Croatia and speaks Croatian ! My hubby is Croatian and I lived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but should be moving back home to Philly soon ( waiting on visa paperwork ) anyway so happy to catch up and see you guys are happy newlyweds ! = <p> Oh no way ? ! That is so fun ! ! I could see how you would get sick of it after that long ! I do n't  think I could do it long term but it would be fun for the first 5 years of marriage or something = Thanks for commenting ! xx <p> haha , world is a small place , me and my husband live near park Maksimir , and David , your croatian is great , thnx for saying hello = @Amber , if you plan to come , summertime is the best time for you to see croatia , not only zagreb , the adriatic coast is great too . I follow you guys on facebook , too when i have time , so keep up the good work ! Pozdrav iz Zagreba ! = <p> I have always wanted to move to nyc to ! i lived there a little bit during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! i died over the one of you coming out of the subway ! it was so stunning and memorable !

Oh get real girl the jacket would look awesome on you ! I really think anyone can pull off a well tailored trench ! Sometimes the cheaper ones are boxy .. but the well made ones form to your body better ! You should try one = and I know we need to talk out hubs into moving to NYC ! <p> Oh my heck girl ! ! I 'm so incredibly jealous right now ! After seeing these , I definitely need another trip to NYC right NOW ! You look incredibly gorgeous as well , and props to your husbandhe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , haha . <p> Thank you ! I actually do n't  edit them color wise .. I usually brighten them a bit but other than that I am photoshop challenged so I do n't  do any of that but with the 50mm lens it captures colors REALLY well so no editing is really even necessary ! And ah I know I am so embarrassed my cousin just texted and told me I spelled it wrong too haha after staring at a screen for a long time my brain starts to shut down ! But yeah I fixed that = thanks girl ! ! <p> You are GORG ! ! I am obsessed with you love your style , your hair , all ! And I LOVE that you mix higher end designers w/ F21 , etc. for us normal girls = What size is your sweater ? I cant decide &amp; I 'm close to your build . I love the fitand the F21 blue/green/black stripe top you recently posted , size ? I just want to copy EVERYthing you do ! Amazing ! ! ! You are a doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Thank you so much ! Okay so in this sweater I got a medium I feel like sweaters should be a little loose ya know ? ! Then for the striped top I got a small ! It looked like it ran looser so I went with a small ! ! Thanks for your sweet comment ! xo <p> Amber , it would be so cool if you added your nail polish color for all of us polish-a-holics = I love all your unique colors ! ! ! &lt;3 p.s . I caved and bought the Revlon Posh color and have gotten so many compliments on it ( sorry I copied you , but it 's so hard to find the perfect shade of green ! ) . Also I love how colorful you keep your outfits even in cold weather ! &lt;3 <p> Girl are you kidding , copy me all you want ! ! ! That 's why I share where everything is from so you girls CAN copy me ! ! = And good I am glad you love it ! I went on a nail polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to share them all with you girls ! This one is Essie Bikini So Teeny ! ! ! xo <p> Amber , what great photos ! It looks like you guys had an awesome time ! I love all of the beautiful colors with the fresh fruit , sunshine , people . The photo that touched me the most is the one of David with the Croatian couple . How cool is it that you can go to a city and find such a diverse population ? That is what makes our country so wonderfully unique and in light of the recent tragedies it warmed my heart to see three strangers with one thing in common ( language ) laughing together on a street corner . That is what the U.S. is all about , people of different backgrounds coming together to find common interests . I think that if more people could speak face to face and share a few laughs , there would be a lot less hate and a lot more love . Thank you for sharing . <p> Aw thanks so much for sharing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them converse and laugh together ! I agree , there would be a lot less hate if we could all just talk face to face more and laugh together ! ! They were so happy to see an American who could speak their language so well , it was so fun to see ! Thanks again for commenting ! ! ! = xo <p> Hey girl ! Just wondering how tall you are ? I know you have TOTALLY answered this before but I 'm 59 ? and those Jbrands fit you so well ! I have trouble finding skinnies that fit right ( knees always in the wrong place ) being that I 'm taller than most . You look fabulous ! <p> Dani ! Yeah I am 510 " but honestly J Brands are some of the only jeans that fit me well ! I do wish these were a little longer , I usually go with 32 inch inseam but its nice to have 29 inch inseam also because they look better with flats sometimes in my opinion ! ! = oh the joys of finding jeans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in philadelphia , LITERALLY 2 hrs outside of NYC and havent been since I was about 12 ? I think its time I go . My boyfriend and I need to do more spontaneous trips like you and David . Were both off today , let 's see if I can convince him <p> ahhh Amber you made me want to visit NYC again . Its been 5 years since I last visited and my husband has n't  been before . I NEED TO GO NOW ! And if you guys lived there , I would be totally jealous ! Love the fun fact that your hubster can speak Croatian ! X <p> You will ! ! I used to look at my friends who were married and think the same thing and wonder if I would ever find a love that perfect- but you totally will I promise ! ! ! And yes I am dying to move to Germany , we could be neighbors ! ! = <p> I swear that all boys think they can wear t-shirts in any weather that includes sunshine . ( Even if its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my bf decided to go sweaterless on a night that was VERY cold . <p> What a fun day trip ! ! I love your coat and turquoise ring !

I always tell myself if I am going to invest in something it better be black or white because they are so timeless and obviously go with everything I am also just a sucker for leather . And obviously everyone needs a good , quality cross body and some black booties . <p> For you leather lovers out there while I was in NYC , David and I stopped by Marissa Webbs home to say hello and to look at her gorgeous home ( my dream NYC home , and do n't  get me going on her closet. ) and she was telling me that to keep her leather tight she soaks them for a few hours and then sticks them in the dryer ! ( NOT the washing machine though ! ) Which I would have never thought to do and she said most do n't  because its kinda scary messing with leather especially when you invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . - She makes some of my all time favorite pieces- like the ones that you lose sleep over thinking of ways you can make the money to purchase them or justifying just buying them right then . <p> Anyways , I hope you all have an amazing weekend ! ! I have no idea what our plans are but I do know we are leaving for Barbados on Sunday ! ! So get ready for lots of pics ! I will also be shooting a look book for Swim Spot while I am there so stay tuned and follow my instagram ( @amberfillerup ) for all my pics = <p> Ahhh those booties ! I often find myself wearing black a little too much . But you are right Classic and worth the investment . Yay vacation ! Sorry in advance for the broken heart you will feel for having to leave your puppy . He will be so tickled when you guys get home . Its a good feeling to be missed = <p> Aw I know I am so sad to leave him ! But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( how cute is that ? ? ) with other dogs so he will probably really enjoy it ! He has n't  been around other puppies since we got him so I am excited for him to play with others ! ! But yes I will miss him like CRAZY ! ! <p> I 've only been following your blog and instagram since this week , and I LOVE it ! Its really nice to hear about someones real life but I appreciate it so much because you have great style and find your clothes for affordable prices ! I follow quite a lot of fashion blogs and I can only get ideas for my dream closet not real life ! Its so refreshing and ACTUALLY useful . Thanks ! <p> Oh my gosh I am loving those leather shorts and your right they will go with anything ! ! So jealous your going to Barbados , that is definitely a place on my travel list along with many others of course lol !

I do n't  think I would love it as much if I did n't  get to see all of the magic behind the scenes . I love fashion , but I love hair and make up ( and modeling/models ) more , so it has been so fun getting to see all the magic happen ! The first show I went to was Peter Som . <p> Like I told you guys , I am interviewing the designer , hair stylist , and make up artist for each show . For Peter Som I do n't  have the inside scoop on the make up ( it was my first show and I got so caught up in the hair part ! whoops ! ! ) But for the hair they went for a wavy , rockerish look . The inspiration was kind of a East meets West , he said " its a girl who lives in the upper East side in a wealthy area but has a rebellious side . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they : <p> 1 . sprayed Hydrate Finish by Wella all over the hair ( product pictured below ) <p> 2. twisted hair up and blow dried it <p> 3. added pastel-colored extensions <p> 4. - tousled- hair and finished with a light hair spray <p> I always want my hair looking messy and beachy but never thought to do it like that ! So I will definitely be trying this and posting pictures of it soon ! minus I probably wo n't do colored extensions .. we will see though because apparently I am a punk rocker : <p> someone tagged me in a comment on this pic so I saw it that way and thought it was hilarious . <p> - I saw my favorite blogger , Tuula ( Jessica Stein ) and my jaw accidently dropped . If you know me you know how much I adore her ! She was backstage taking pictures and I am usually not the type to go ask for a picture with a celeb ( she is a celeb in my eyes haha ) but for her I had to . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? And after introducing myself this is the first thing I say : <p> " oh my gosh you are my cutest blogger ! " <p> WHAT ? ! ? ! you idiot . ahhh . <p> hahaha I meant to say , " you are my favorite blogger , you 're the cutest ! " <p> But I was so nervous/excited I jumbled them together ! But luckily she is thee nicest girl on the planet . Seriously couldnt be sweeter which just made me love her even more .
