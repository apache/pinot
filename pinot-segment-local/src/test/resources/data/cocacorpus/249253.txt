The triggers can be pretty much anything ( but at this point they 're somewhat generic ) . Some triggers you may encounter are : <p> A Ritual Altar with pedestals is assembled ( only happens in dimensions where rituals can be performed ) <p> A entity/a few entities spawning <p> An item from a loot pool ( like strongholds chests , dungeon , pyramids , mineshafts , even the bonus chest ) <p> A random structure is generated ( structures found in AbyssalCraft can be found here , - except the larger- buildings ) <p> A random number of items from a loot pool ( maximum 4 , minimum 1 ) <p> An item from one of the AbyssalCraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You receive some free Potential Energy ( if you have a Necronomicon in your inventory ) <p> A structure from a schematic is generated ( more about this further down ) <p> A Potion Effect is applied to all entities within a certain radius of the block <p> A couple of different entities spawn in masses <p> You 're suddenly pulled into the Dark Realm <p> A random Disruption is activated <p> A Shoggoth infestation is triggered <p> An Antimatter explosion is thrown at you <p> A judgement day-scaled Shoggoth infestation is triggered <p> There will likely be more types of triggers later on , and there 's also an API you ( or a mod developer you persuade ) can use to add your own triggers ( alternatively you can use existing ones , but with your own stuff ) .

@@4146264 <h> Mob Grinding Utils Mod <p> Mob Grinding Mod- aims to encourage Minecraft players to make their new method in farming mobs for drops and experience . The mod adds a fully modular system allowing players to explore and get the most out of their mob farms . You will find in the following list of blocks , items and various features . <p> Mob Fans ( Moves Mobs &amp; Players in the Direction it Faces ) <p> The mob fans allows players to push mobs- all over the place in all directions even vertical . The Mob Fan Block has 3 upgrade options to expand it 's capabilities Width , Height and Distance modifiers . Click the block to Open a GUI- to add- upgrades . Mob Fans are activated with a redstone signal and can also be used to move players . Placing a single block anywhere in the direct path of the Mob Fan will limit it 's range to that block . Mob Launchers and Air Elevators are some of the fun ways these blocks can be used . <p> The Absorption Hopper is a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within it 's range . The Basic range for an Absorption Hopper is a 3 block radius this can be increased with upgrades . Click the block to Open a GUI for the upgrades . The Absorption Hopper can store 16 Buckets of Fluid XP in it 's internal tank and has a large inventory for item collection . The Absorption Hopper can be configured on every side to push out items to inventories OR Fluid XP to fluid tanks . Other mods ( such as Ender IO ) can pull both Fluids and Items from sides . Breaking an Absorption hopper will drop all the items it contains but the fluid will be lost <p> Absorption Hopper Distance Upgrade <p> Singularity Tank ( Portable Fluid Tank Holds 32 Buckets ) <p> The Singularity Tank is a basic fluid tank that will hold 32 Buckets of any fluid . The Singularity Tank will retain any fluids it contains when broken which makes it a simple and portable fluid transport system . <p> XP Tap ( Attach to Tank to spawn XP Orbs ) <p> The XP Tap can only be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XP Tap can be turned on and off when required to convert Fluid XP , contained in the tank , back in to XP Orbs for when you need to top up your XP levels . <p> Iron Spikes . ( Spikes for Mob traps ) <p> Iron Spikes are a basic block that can be placed on any side of a solid block . Iron Spikes will damage mobs- and players when they come in to contact with them . Mobs will drop XP and their normal drops . <p> The Mob Masher ( Mashes up Mobs ) <p> The Mob Masher is a block used to maximise mob drops by being modular with several upgrade options . Vanilla enchants are available as upgrades beyond normal levels . Click the block to Open a GUI for the upgrades . The upgrades are as follows : Sharpness , Looting , Smite , Fire Aspect , Bane of Arthropods and a special non-vanilla upgrade , Beheading which increases mob head drops ( 10% per level up to 100% ) . Compatibility with Ender IO means Enderman heads will also drop if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed on any side of a solid block and is activated via a redstone signal . <p> Both these blocks work in the same way for their respective boss . When a Muffler is placed in the world the sound of the boss death is negated this removes the annoying thump heard globally for Wither Boss Farms . The Muffler Block effect has an 8 block radius for sound cancelling . Vanilla now features stacking Boss Bars which can be annoying and take up a lot of screen space no problem just click on The Muffler Block and the respective boss bars will be hidden from view ( click again to show the bars ) . The Boss Bar hiding option is player independent not global . <p> Fluid XP <p> Just a fluid version of XP Note : If Ender IO or Open Blocks ( if/when it updates ) are loaded ; Mob Grinding Utils will defer it 's registration and textures to the other mod 's versions . <p> Mob Swabs &amp; GM Chicken Feed Items ( Mob eggs in survival ) <p> Just use a Mob Swab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will retain that mob 's DNA ' and give you a Used Mob Swab . Then craft the Used Mob Swab with Seeds and a Bucket of Fluid XP this will give you some GM Chicken Feed . When you feed a Chicken with the GM Chicken Feed , something magical happens and the Chicken will drop the Mob Spawn Egg you wanted . Mob Spawn eggs ( as of MC 1.8+ ) can be right clicked on to a Monster Spawner Block and will change the spawner to the same mob as the Mob Egg . This means with other mods that allow you to move spawners you can create tailor made mob farms . Note : Vanilla mobs with variants eg. Wither Skeletons , Husks and Donkeys are not supported in this version but are planned for the future . Some mods still do n't register their mob 's spawn eggs correctly and as a result some modded eggs will not work . @qwx35681 <p> config mob grinding utils @qwx35683

Yes , " realistic " is what we repeatedly talk about to thousand of topics . However , you will find in this mod some better options that do not affect much to the vanilla game but still worth trying . Now let 's go into details : <p> Configuration Options : - <p> Main options : - The primary " realistic survival " option settings . <p> " Flint Tools " : Wooden and stone tools are gone , and you ca n't harvest logs by punching trees . There 's actually a bit more to it than that . This option is , after all , the core point of the mod , and includes a number of interconnected changes . Flint and " bone-encrusted stone " tools are added to the game , as are knives , which are like small swords that can " silk touch " vines and grass like shears and are used in a number of new recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cant harvest a block with a particular tool , you cant destroy it with that tool , either . <p> " Get Rocks from Stone " : Chopping at stone with a pickaxe does n't  produce cobblestone . It produces rocks . Digging up dirt blocks will also often yield rocks . Rocks can be used in a number of new recipes to produce various types of stone , and can also be chipped down through the simple expedient of throwing them at the ground to break them to produce flint . ( Throw them by right-clicking , by the way . Do n't  just drop them . ) Rocks can be thrown at mobs , too , and will do a few points of damage , so they 're also useful as ranged weapons until such time as you have a bow and a supply of arrows . <p> " No Flint from Gravel " : You only get flint by breaking rocks . You cant find it in gravel . If this option is selected , you wo n't find flint naturally , so if you also have " Flint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the ground before you can make any tools ! ( If you do n't  have " Get Rocks from Stone " set true , then this option has no effect . ) <p> " Primitive Torches " : Primitive torches are sticks wrapped with oily rags . They wont burn for long , but will at least provide you with light to last out a night before you 're able to mine coal . But theyll go out if they 're rained on . <p> Crafting recipes : - A few ( at least nominally relevant ) recipes . <p> " Add Nuts " : Adds acorns and pinecones to the game . Acorns fall from oak and dark oak leaves , and can be eaten directly . Pinecones fall from spruce leaves , and can be broken to find pine nuts , which can be eaten . This gives you a few extra food options early in the game . ( Yes , both acorns and apples can fall from the same tree . I might do something about this at some point . Apples ought to fall from apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bread " : Bread must be baked . Combining three wheat now just gets you bread dough , which must be cooked in a furnace before you have bread . ( I may eventually tackle coding an oven , so all " cooked " food items actually have to be cooked instead of being made on a crafting table . ) <p> " Egg Dishes " : Eggs are delicious , so this option allows you to craft and eat a few basic egg dishes . It also allows you to make cheese by smelting buckets of milk , since eggs and cheese go so well together . What does this have to do with " realistic survival " ? Well , um I love eggs , and would n't realistically survive if I could n't cook and eat them . Hows that ? <p> The specific items you can create are : <p> Toast ( 1 hunger , 0.3 saturation ) <p> Cheese Wedge ( 2 hunger , 0.3 saturation ) <p> Fried Egg ( 3 hunger , 0.6 saturation ) <p> Cheese Sandwich ( 4 hunger , 0.6 saturation ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> Cheesy Mushroom Omelette ( 8 hunger , 1.2 saturation ) <p> Scrambled Eggs and Bacon ( 10 hunger , 1.2 saturation ) <p> The Most Important Meal of the Day ! ( 12 hunger , 1.5 saturation ) <p> " Flesh to Leather " : Rotten zombie flesh may be " cooked " into patchwork flesh , which can be crafted into leather . <p> " No Sticks from Planks " : Crafting sticks from planks is just silly . You should find sticks by breaking leaf blocks . <p> " No Wool from String " : String is useful for many things , but no , you cant turn it back into wool . If you want wool , find some sheep . <p> " Web to String : Webs can be crafted into string . <p> " Wool to String " : Wool blocks can be crafted into string . <p> And few other extra options which you may find out when experiencing the mod .

Note that it uses normal bronze ingots not imbued ones , and you can use any wood type to craft it , not just birch . <p> Now that you have a basic wand and a Vital Extraction spell , you can go to any tree in your world and hold right click while looking at one of the logs . Make sure you put the Vital Extraction spell in your offhand in order for this to work . The logs will begin to turn into- Dead Logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking logs . <p> For each log that you harvest , you will collect up to 25 essence in your wand . Shift+rightclick to check how much you currently have stored . <p> Once you have a- decent amount of essence stored in your wand , you can start using some basic spells , described in the next section . <p> Basic Spells : <p> Now that you have a wand and some essence stored in it , you can create some simple spells that do n't  require an altar to craft . Every spell has a cost , in essence , that is consumed every time you cast it . The first spell you will be able to craft is the Magic Lantern spell , which has the sole purpose of placing torches for 5 essence . The crafting recipe is shown below . Note that it uses normal bronze and not imbued bronze to craft . <p> There is one other spell that you can use before getting an altar . This spell , the Contained Explosion spell , can be used to summon an explosion the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This costs 50 Essence , and will not harm any blocks or the player who cast the spell due to the contained nature of the explosion . Note that the bronze in the recipe is not imbued . <p> Using spells is fairly simple . At the moment , the only way to cast a spell is by having the spell card in your offhand and a wand in your main hand . Simply right-click on the ground to cast the spell at that location , consuming essence from the wand . <p> If you do n't  have enough essence left in your wand to cast a spell , you will be notified of this and the spell will not work . <p> Cryptic Transmutation <p> Once you have created all the basic spells , you will want to get an Altar in order to progress further in the mod . This is a somewhat complex item to craft , and requires several steps . Firstly , you will need to go to the Nether in order to gather blaze powder for the Cryptic Transmutation spell . The crafting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it uses normal bronze , not imbued . <p> Now that you have the spell , you need to fill your Basic Wand with 1000 essence , which is the amount required to use the Cryptic Transmutation spell . Once you have enough essence , right-click on a diamond block with your wand while the spell is equipped , and it will turn into an altar . <p> Now that you have an altar , you can begin to create Imbued items , and use them to upgrade your wand and create more advanced spells . <p> Tier 1 Altar <p> Now that you have an Altar , you can place it in the world to construct the most simple type altar , which can only perform the most basic magic . Shift+Rightclick the altar with your want to see the level of altar you have constructed . <p> You can throw items on top of the altar to add them to the inventory . If you break the altar while it contains items , the items will drop , allowing you to get them back . The altar can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that you have a basic altar setup , you can begin using it to craft items . The first items you will want to craft are Imbued Bronze Ingots . Throw four gold ingots , four iron ingots and four bronze ingots onto the altar and right click twice with your want to confirm the crafting . <p> Now that you know how to use your altar , you can move onwards and create a Tier 2 altar , which will let you craft more complex items and progress further through the mod . <p> Tier 2 Altar <p> When you shift+rightclicked your basic altar with a wand , you saw that it was only a Tier 1 altar . However , with only a small amount of chiseled quartz blocks and hardened clay , you can easily construct the next tier altar , which is the final tier implemented at the moment . The Tier 2 altar requires building a small platform below the altar exactly like it is shown in the picture below . This design is n't final and will be changed later in the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you hold your wand and shift+rightclick the altar , you can check what tier it is . <p> This more advanced altar is able to craft more complex items , as mentioned before . One of the first items you will need to make with this altar is an Imbued Log . Craft this with three gold nuggets , two imbued bronze ingots and one log , as shown below . <p> Upgrading your Wand <p> Now that you have a Tier 2 altar , you can craft an Advanced Wand , which has a 10000 essence capacity and can not break when collecting essence . It also had an added feature that enables you to collect essence from ore , giving you far more essence than you were able to collect from logs earlier on . <p> In order to create this wand , you will need two imbued sticks and one imbued bronze ingot . To craft Imbued Sticks , you will first need some Imbued Planks . <p> Now that you have imbued planks , you can convert them into sticks just like you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imbued Sticks instead of regular ones , which are needed for the advanced wand and many other items in the mod . <p> Now that you have all the items required , you can craft the wand . Note that the recipe uses an imbued bronze ingot , not a regular one . <p> With your new Advanced Wand , you can right-click on any vanilla ore to extract essence out of it . This will convert it into a worse type of ore , but you can extra essence from the worse ore as well , however this will continue degrading the ore until it is just stone . With this process , you can get thousands of essence from high tier ores such as Diamond and Emerald . <p> Enhanced Extraction <p> Now that you have imbued items , you can start to improve your essence extraction methods . Whilst extracting essence from trees may have been acceptable in the beginning , with some of the more powerful spells detailed below , you would need thousands of trees just to cast them once , making it unrealistic to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can begin to extract essence directly from ores , giving you thousands of essence at a time instead of under 100 essence per tree . Note that it uses imbued sticks and ingots to craft , not the regular types . <p> Place this spell in your offhand , and with your wand in your main hand , right click any vanilla overworld ore . <p> Your wand will fill up with huge amounts of essence , and the ore will degrade a bit , allowing you to continue extracting essence until it turns into plain stone . It is recommended to use at least an advanced wand to do this as otherwise you will fill up your wand very fast and end up wasting the excess essence . <p> Better Spells <p> With the imbued items you now have access to , you can craft more advanced spells that give you access to more powerful abilities. - One of the advanced spells you can craft is the Rapid-fire spell , which allows you to shoot hundreds of arrows very quickly at the cost of 100 essence initially then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses imbued sticks and imbued bronze ingots to craft , not the regular variants . <p> Another advanced spell that you can now craft is the Hunger spell . This spell consumes 500 essence and- brings your hunger and saturation levels up to full in one use . Note that it uses imbued sticks and imbued bronze ingots to craft , not the regular variants . <p> These spells are used in the same way as the basic spells , by putting them in your offhand and using the wand in your main hand to cast it . <p> JEI- Integration <p> If you are confused about any features in the mod , install JEI ( Just Enough Items ) alongside Enhanced Progression , and click any item in the JEI interface to read about what it does .
