Memory , usually referred to as Random Access Memory ( RAM ) , is the place where an application loads its data during processing , while a hard disk drive ( HDD ) is usually the place where data is stored for long or short term retention . The line blurs at paging ( otherwise known as swap space ) , where a portion of the HDD is turned into memory for the computer to swap out applications and data from memory to the disk . In this way , the HDD is made into memory , which , while slower than the RAM in the system , can be usefully used to create larger virtual memory spaces for systems . Most systems will create a swap space ( paging space ) that is equal to two times the real RAM space on a computer .

This metaphor may help you to keep in mind the difference , since they are often confused , mostly in the specific amounts of each that are in your computer system . <p> In a computer system , you will also find another kind of memory , called Read Only Memory ( ROM ) , in which the system keeps file that are to only be read , like system firmware or BIOS .

In the case of RAM , the data is lost , which is why you shut down major OS platforms , to flush the state of the memory and the application to disk , which retains the data when the system is turned off . <p> I hope that the above helps you with your question .

@@96142335 @342335/ <h> Answer Wiki <p> No problem at all . Just plug in and enjoy . Part of the specification for USB 3.0 was backwards compatability with USB 2.0 and USB 1.1There are stories of some specialist drivers not being 100% happy , but your basic plug in hardware should have no problems at all . You wo n't get USB 3.0 transfer speeds with a USB 2.0 device , but it should run just as it did before . <p> Actually the trick lies in the design of the socket and a plug . In USB3.0 they have additional connectors which remain unconnected when USB2.0 device is connected to the USB3.0 host ( or if USB3.0 device is connected to USB2.0 host ) . If the electronics does n't detect additional data signals , it act according to USB2.0 standard . That is why you need extra dedicated USB3.0 cables which are more expensive as plugs contains more connectors and there is more wires in the cable .

If you were to replace a component such as a video card without IPR you could pay between $100 and $300 for a replacement card and an additional $100 for a two hour service fee to install it . <h> IPR is fully transferable <p> Your investment in IPR is transferable to the next owner of the product , giving long-term added value for resale and peace of mind . <h> Battery Life Protection NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is protected ! memoryexpress will replace the product 's orginal battery ONE TIME during the IPR coverage period if it fails to hold a 60% charge* . <p> *memoryexpress reserve the right to replace the battery with a third-party battery if the orginal replacement battery is no longer available . <h> IPR Frequently Asked Questions <h> What is the difference between the manufacturer 's warranty and IPR ? <p> IPR goes far beyond the standard manufacturer 's warranty . With all replacement hardware being new and not refurbished , a trouble free exchange for defective parts is ensured . <p> Another important difference is that you do n't need to ship a defective product back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement ; you simply bring the product to the nearest memoryexpress to have it replaced . <h> What if my product has been discontinued ? <p> If your IPR covered product has been discontinued or memoryexpress is unable to provide the exact same product for replacement , an equivalent item with the same or similar technical specifications will be provided . <h> I have important information ; can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive ? <p> Absolutely , if your notebook is within the IPR coverage period and becomes defective , as long as the exact same model of notebook is still available . <p> *Major hardware changes like this may require you to reactivate Microsoft Windows. *This procedure is only possible if your old hard drive is still operational . <h> I ordered online in Canada and there is n't a local memoryexpress , how can I use IPR ? <p> For online customers in Canada that live out of town or in cities where there is not a local memoryexpress , memoryexpress will pay 2-way shipping* to and from memoryexpress for all defective products with an IPR plan . A prepaid waybill will be provided for returning the defective product to memoryexpress for testing . memoryexpress will also cover the cost of shipping to send you a replacement product . <p> * Not available for the Northern Territories . <h> Is my data covered under IPR ? <p> Unfortunately memoryexpress is unable to warranty or guarantee any customer data due to the complexity and severity of intellectual property claims . <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my system ? <p> We recommend that the IPR plan be purchased on the entire system as we only replace components covered with IPR . This means that if you were only to purchase IPR coverage for just the motherboard and not the CPU we would only be able to replace the motherboard even if the replacement board no longer supports the original CPU type . <h> Is a projector bulb covered by IPR ? <p> The In-Store Product Replacement plan does not cover components considered by the manufacturer as consumables such as projector bulbs , printer ink/toner cartridges , and disposable batteries . <h> If I do n't purchase IPR does that mean memoryexpress will not warranty my product ? <p> No , memoryexpress will always take care of our customers with our standard 1-year warranty . Within the first year of purchase memoryexpress can handle warranty claims to the manufacturer for you , but can not provide an in store product replacement without the purchase of an IPR plan . <h> What 's Not Covered Under IPR <p> An In-Store Product Replacement will only be provided for defective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a software issue such as a driver incompatibility , software corruption , viruses or other malware , a memoryexpress service technician will restore your system to factory new condition at your nearest memoryexpress . If data backup is required , requested and achievable an additional service charge will apply . <p> memoryexpress does not warranty or guarantee any customer data due to the complexity and severity of intellectual property claims . <p> IPR does not cover physical damage ( including liquid damage ) or product abuse , nor does it cover products that have been altered or modified . <p> IPR does not cover the replacement of product(s) due to loss or theft . <p> IPR is not valid if any security seals or serial numbers have been removed , tampered or altered . <p> Due to the nature of special order products they may take longer than 5 working days for replacement . <p> Systems that are liquid cooled are not eligible for IPR coverage . <p> *IPR for a computer system covers only the case and components included within the case . External peripherals are not included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are considered separate products . <h> Disclaimer <p> Before an In-Store Product Replacement is provided a memoryexpress technician must test and confirm the validity of the claim . At this time the technician will determine whether the product can be repaired within a maximum of 5 business days or if a replacement product is needed . <p> On some occasions the repair of custom built computer systems may take longer than 5 working days , this is due to the difficulty in diagnosing some software / hardware problems with uniquely configured systems .

@@96142600 @342600/ 57471 @qwx917471 <p> LSI battery backup units are add-on modules that protect against data loss in the event of a server or power failure by providing emergency power to the cache memory . When power is restored , the data not yet written to the hard drives can be retrieved from cache memory . <p> LSI provides a family of intelligent battery backup units ( iBBUs ) for use with its high-performance RAID controllers . The LSI iBBUs provide an inexpensive alternative to using an uninterruptible power supply ( UPS ) and a second level of fault tolerance when used in conjunction with a UPS . <p> The LSIiBBU08 , used with the MegaRAID SAS 9260 and 9280 series controllers , provides higher ambient temperature tolerances and increased serviceability while protecting the integrity of cached data in the event of a power or server failure . <h> Features <p> Helps protects integrity of cache in the event of power or server failure <p> The LSIiBBU08 can tolerate higher ambient temperatures around the battery backup unit as compared to the previous generation battery , with tolerances of up to 55C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remote mount option available which allows customers who have limited chassis space or a constrained thermal environment to reposition the battery backup unit away from the RAID controller card for cooling purposes . A lower temperature environment will generally help prolong the service life of a battery backup unit , while high temperatures and extreme conditions will shorten the battery life . For example , if the battery is set to a 12-hour DRT and 45C mode , it may not require replacement for the life of the RAID controller1 . However , using a 48-hour DRT and 55C mode with your battery may cause a situation where the battery requires replacement after the first year of use2 . <p> Multiple Modes of Operation and Retention Time <p> The LSIiBBU08 allows for multiple modes of operation , which let the user select a shut-off data retention time ( DRT ) of 12 , 24 , or 48 hours with as - sociated operating temperatures , learn cycles , and estimated service lives . The MegaRAID controller firmware will use the LSIiBBU08 until it calculates that the battery can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of power loss to the server . With previous generation MegaRAID batteries , there was only one mode of operation with a retention time of 72 hours .

In the event of a power failure during this learn cycle , the controller is designed to accommodate that there is still enough energy left in the battery to provide the selected retention time ( 12 or 24 hours ) . Because the learn cycles can be performed as needed by the BBU without impact to the write cache policy or performance , this is called a transparent learn cycle . <p> During the learn cycle in 48-hour DRT modes , the controller is forced to a write- through cache policy for the duration of the discharge/recharge process , as the Relative State of Charge crosses the boundary where the stated retention time can - not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the disk and helps protect against data loss during a potential power loss . While this is similar to the existing learn cycle process for the LSIiBBU07 with a 72 hour DRT , it does allow for much shorter learn cycles .
