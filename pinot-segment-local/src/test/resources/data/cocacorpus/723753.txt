@@83882358 @5382358/ <p> The assumption that bogs down most banks is the cost to originate and service loans . Typically , your finance people identify all of the costs associated with originating and servicing the loans . The lenders argue about full cost versus incremental cost of making loans . And it goes on and on ! My goal is to help put these costs in perspective and minimize the drama associated with this aspect of the process so that you can begin getting the benefits of a disciplined pricing process . <p> First , let me start with the good news . The assumptions regarding the cost to originate and service loans are probably the least important of all the assumptions . The key for this assumption is to be directionally correct and logical . I 'll clarify what I mean in just a minute but let me reiterate a very important point from my previous post about determining the appropriate funding curve for your loan pricing model ; using your exact overhead numbers is one of the biggest mistakes in the loan pricing process and will often cause you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your bank is probably like most banks in that you do n't know the exact cost to originate and service loans . More good news : you do n't need to spend $20,000 or $100,000 to figure this out . That said , let me caution you against one of the biggest mistakes I see in this area : do n't take your average overhead ratio ( say roughly 3% for this example ) and multiply it by the dollar amount of your loan . This generates a $30,000 cost for a million dollar loan , a $3,000 cost for a hundred thousand dollar loan , and $300 for a $10,000 loan . Sound about right to you ? I did n't think so . If you say that the cost breakdown between lending , deposit gathering , and general administration is approximately 40 percent , 40 percent , and 20 percent , your costs would be $12,000 , $1,200 , and $120 . These numbers are equally ridiculous , right ? <h> Here are Some Reasonable Overhead Cost Numbers to Use , But First <p> At the risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you some reasonable numbers for a good starting point and then I 'll start ducking as you and my competitors take shots at me . But first let me provide you with a little background and logic to help you become comfortable with the numbers I am going to provide . At the very least , I think I can get most of you to agree with my thought process . <p> If we think about the cost to originate a loan , I think we will all agree that originating a $1,000,000 commercial loan is not 10x the cost of originating a $100,000 loan . Rather , the majority of the costs not passed onto the borrower are very similar . The biggest difference probably involves your approval process . For example , a lender can typically approve a loan up to a given dollar amount . At the next dollar amount , the loan committee will approve the loan and the largest loans require board approval . Of course , some of you may have an additional tier or two . <p> I also find it helpful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's see if we can get some agreement here . The cost to service a typical commercial real estate loan is much higher than a typical commercial installment loan , but much lower than a construction loan . In other words , the cost to originate and service loans is dependent on the size and the type of the loan . <p> Let 's add one more factor : the complexity of the loan . I believe that loans made to existing , high quality borrowers are more often either relatively simple or involve average complexity to originate and service . Loans made to newer borrowers , lesser quality borrowers or to a borrower involving multiple entities , etc. are typically more complex to originate and service . Make sense ? <h> Now , How About Those Reasonable Numbers to Use ? <p> Here are some numbers to get you started : <h> Commercial Construction Loans <p> Origination Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $200,000 <p> $850 <p> $1,000 <p> $1,250 <p> $200,000 $600,000 <p> $1,000 <p> $1,500 <p> $2,000 <p> $600,000 $1,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2,200 <p> $3,000 <p> $4,500 <p> Servicing Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $200,000 <p> $70 <p> $85 <p> $100 <p> $200,000 $600,000 <p> $70 <p> $125 <p> $200 <p> $600,000 $1,000,000 <p> $110 <p> $125 <p> $250 <p> $1,000,000 + <p> $140 <p> $155 <p> $280 <h> Commercial Real Estate Loans <p> Origination Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $200,000 <p> $600 <p> $700 <p> $875 <p> $200,000 $600,000 <p> $750 <p> $1,250 <p> $1,650 <p> $600,000 $1,000,000 <p> $1,488 <p> $1,750 <p> $2,500 <p> $1,000,000 + <p> $1,988 <p> $2,750 <p> $3,500 <p> Servicing Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $200,000 <p> $50 <p> $60 <p> $75 <p> $200,000 $600,000 <p> $50 <p> $80 <p> $125 <p> $600,000 $1,000,000 <p> $75 <p> $90 <p> $150 <p> $1,000,000 + <p> $105 <p> $120 <p> $180 <h> Commercial Installment Loans <p> Origination Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $50,000 <p> $350 <p> $425 <p> $650 <p> $50,000 $200,000 <p> $500 <p> $650 <p> $800 <p> $200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> $1,275 <p> $1,500 <p> $2,000 <p> $1,000,000 + <p> $1,875 <p> $2,500 <p> $3,000 <p> Servicing Expenses <p> Loan Amount <p> Simple <p> Average <p> Complex <p> 0 $50,000 <p> $35 <p> $40 <p> $50 <p> $50,000 $200,000 <p> $50 <p> $60 <p> $75 <p> $200,000 $600,000 <p> $50 <p> $80 <p> $125 <p> $600,000 $1,000,000 <p> $75 <p> $90 <p> $150 <p> $1,000,000 + <p> $105 <p> $120 <p> $180 <p> Let 's provide a quick gut check for these numbers . Assuming two commercial installment loans $70,000 and $700,000 , I have a cost to originate of $650 and $1,500 , respectively . I am going to guess that you will say the differential is not nearly this high . Going back to my earlier comment that we need to be directional correct , let 's take a look at the profitability of these loans under a couple of scenarios . This will help us to determine whether we should refine these numbers further . <p> First , since most banks do n't do a good job of differentiating their pricing based on loan size , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are priced the same . The $700,000 loan generates an ROE of 18% and the $70,000 loan generates an ROE of 4% . As discussed in a previous post ( Loan Pricing Opportunities that Do n't Hit Your ROE Targets ) , the smaller loan simply does n't have enough dollars to absorb the costs . In order to bring the smaller loan up to the 18% ROE through rate alone , we would need to charge an additional 188 basis points . This certainly is n't always possible or even a good idea . I will discuss numerous ways to enhance the profitability of small loans with minimal impact on volume in a future blog post . <p> For those of you politely thinking that it does n't cost $650 to originate the $70,000 loan , I will do you one better and eliminate this cost altogether . Go ahead and guess what the ROE is now ! Did eliminating the origination cost take the ROE from 4% to 5% , 10% or 15% ? If you guessed 6.57% , you win the jackpot ( and if you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that I can invest in your bank ) ! The takeaway point here is that the amount of the origination cost had very little impact on the profitability of this loan . <p> Alright , some of you may be thinking that it 's the servicing cost that drives the profitability of this loan . Tell you what , I am going to leave the origination cost at zero and lower the $60 servicing cost . How low do I need to take the servicing cost to get this loan to an 18% ROE ? If you said $10 you are correct ( again , please call me if you 're generating these numbers off the top of your head ! ) . So , all you need to do is get your employees to work for free and get most of your service providers to reduce their costs by about 85% in order to justify pricing these two loans the same ! More importantly , you can see that being logical and directionally correct is the most important part of generating these assumptions ( being generally correct is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Now let 's take a look at the $700,000 loan . If we double the overhead , the ROE goes from 18% to 17.41% . Alternatively , if we cut the overhead by half , the ROE goes to 18.30% . The impact is slightly more if I make changes to the servicing cost but it is not significant . <p> As you can see , figuring out the exact overhead and servicing costs does not have much impact on how we price these loans . <p> If you do n't want to use the numbers I provided above or you want to understand the differences in my numbers , here is a way to quickly gain some further insight . You can take your standard loan categories and rank them by origination and servicing cost from highest to lowest . You can estimate an approximate factor to apply based on the loan type or requirements for the approval process . Again , do n't dwell on this process . Just get a couple of your senior lenders in a room and quickly come up with your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog post will cover the most important assumptions : the loan loss provision and capital . After that , I look forward to talking about how to help you make more money and grow more profitably !

@@83882366 @5382366/ <h> Loan Pricing &amp; Profitability Modeling Spreads vs ROE Targets <p> What metric should you use to determine the relative profitability of your commercial loan opportunities ? <p> Many banks still use spread-based pricing instead of using risk-adjusted ROE . After all , spread is easy to calculate and use , while risk-adjusted ROE pricing requires a dynamic loan pricing model . While I am a big fan of simplicity , the big danger of using spread to price your commercial opportunities is the negative impact on asset quality and growth . Specifically , the highest quality loans are overpriced and the weakest pass credits are underpriced . <p> The experience of one bank that converted from using spread to a risk-adjusted ROE pricing system is very illustrative : <p> This particular $1 billion southwestern bank , and there are so many like it in every part of the country , was experiencing almost no growth despite a vibrant market . The bank had excess capital and a net interest margin that was the envy of most but was perhaps at the root of their problem . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and I 'm not using these terms interchangeably ) to the detriment of profitability AND asset quality . How can this be , you ask ? As important as spread and net interest margin are , they are too narrowly defined to be good profitability measurements for loan pricing . <p> Let me be very specific to make sure everyone appreciates this crucial aspect of pricing . In most markets , loans to the highest quality borrowers , especially larger loans , are very competitive ; these loans tend to have spreads between 2.5% and 3.5% . So often a focus purely on spread causes banks to pass on high quality loans to avoid reducing the net interest margin . <p> Now let 's look at a smaller , lower rated , pass credit . Let 's say this credit has a 5% spread . In most scenarios , this credit would increase the net interest margin so banks with a spread focus would be all over it . <p> What happens if we look at these credits from a return on equity ( ROE ) perspective ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smaller lesser quality deal had about an 8% ROE . <p> In other words , this spread or margin-based focus had the unintended consequence of making this bank uncompetitive on the highest quality loans , and more competitive on the lesser quality , pass credits . <p> Two additional factors compounded the issue at this particular institution and in situations like this . First of all , lenders are smart people . They stop going after the best quality loans when they recognize that they are unlikely to be able to price these opportunities at levels needed to get approved . Further , and not surprisingly , the bank got a reputation as not being very competitive on its pricing . <h> Empower your lenders to compete for the best borrowers <p> One of the best things about changing your approach to pricing is that once you have given your lenders the green light to become more aggressive when pricing the best quality loans , they really get after it . The numbers add up really fast for almost any bank . In this particular case , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar loans were plentiful in their market . Conservatively , imagine each lender at your bank picking up just one larger loan per quarter . For this bank , using only one million dollars per loan , the bank would have grown by $80 million . In reality , they grew about three times faster than this once they moved to an ROE-based pricing system . <p> Depending on your market and your capital , managing this highly profitable , quality loan growth can become your next challenge ! Fortunately , you are unlikely to face any unintended consequences and virtually every aspect of this has a positive impact on both short and long term bank performance . <p> Interestingly , this particular bank did not see a decline in their net interest margin . The bank 's liquidity was such that they sold securities to fund their first wave of loan growth . As a result , their margin actually increased . As growth continued to ramp up , margins only declined slightly , due to the bank 's very disciplined approach to all pricing opportunities .

@@83882377 @5382377/ <h> How to Determine the Capital Calculation in PrecisionLender <p> The PrecisionLender solution is a RAROC based tool , where risk adjusted net income is divided by risk adjusted capital . We use the simplified term ROE ( return on equity ) to indicate that ratio . <p> The numerator is the after tax net income generated by the loan or deposit . The denominator is risk adjusted capital that is necessary to support the opportunity being priced . <p> The purpose of this article is to explain how the capital component is determined within the PrecisionLender solution , particularly as related to amortizing loans . <p> The numerator of the equation is annual average risk adjusted after tax net income which is the average interest income on the loan ( there is a slightly different concept on deposits ) plus the amortization of loan origination fees less loan origination costs less the sum cost of funds , loan servicing costs and loan losses . This is adjusted by federal and state taxes due on the income . Typically the loan loss is adjusted for the risk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk . The denominator is risk adjusted capital . <p> Regulators require financial institutions to have a certain level of capital so that the bank or credit union can take a variety of risks in their lending and deposit operations , such as credit , interest rate , liquidity , compliance and operational . If everything goes well and all borrowers pay back their obligations on a timely basis and interest rates do n't change significantly , there would be limited or no need for capital , unfortunately the economy and the institution 's market place rarely reacts perfectly . Having a sufficient amount of capital can offset losses when the marketplace does n't act as planned . <p> Because there is a regulatory component that can come into play some models may use the maximum of either the regulatory or the strategic risk capital . The issues with regulatory capital when applied to an individual loan is that this capital is meant to measure a pool of assets and there are four capital measures for banks and at least two for credit unions . How these measurements are applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From a shareholders and financial institutions point of view the more important measure of capital is its productivity and how it mitigates against the risks . This is sometimes referred to as Strategic or Economic Value . While regulatory capital used by most financial institutions provides certain set levels regardless of the risk , a truer measure of capital should take the various risk profiles into account . This is the primary method used in PrecisionLender . <h> First Step <p> The first step used in determining this Strategic Value is to calculate the Loan Loss and Credit Capital for an unsecured loan of various durations at the different risk ratings . At PrecisionLender we do this by performing a risk rating migration analysis . <p> The initial analysis is to track the changes in the credit rating of current borrowers , typically over a one year period . We use the information to determine probability of default ( PD ) at different risk levels . This PD will usually increase with longer maturity loans . Clients provide us with a form similar to the one below for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan loss reserve needed for an unsecured loan at a 12 month duration . A transition matrix is developed from this information which is the basis of determining the credit capital and loan loss for periods in excess of 12 months ( further information can be found on our support site ) . <p> The results are presented similar to the example below : <p> We have found that if the 12 month and 120 month durations are placed in the PrecisionLender solution the interpolation in between is similar to the data shown here for multiple durations . In addition , this analysis provides information to determine the value of a guarantee provided by the borrower or an outside party . <p> The two essential components within a RAROC calculation , those being the very important equity or risk adjusted capital and the second is loan loss reserve used in the determination of net income or risk adjusted return . <p> The capital can include three components : <p> Credit capital which is the amount of capital needed to meet a 99.9% probability of losses of a loan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events that the institution can not control , such as the tornado that destroys a branch or unusual movements in interest rates caused by some major foreign event . <p> An institution will often set a minimum capital level . Thus for a cash secured loan the combination of credit and unmitigated capital might be a very low number , however due to regulatory or board pressures the institution may require a higher capital amount . The third component is a minimum or floor level . <p> The first component is determined by using the credit capital results from the migration study . The levels determined are multiplied by the exposure at time of default ( EAD ) this is generally the loan amount . <p> The exposure can be influenced by the recovery rate on collateral pledged and the expected value of borrower or other parties ' guarantees . Where there is collateral an adjusted exposure at default is used ( aEAD ) . <p> The PrecisionLender tool does monthly calculations throughout the term of the loan . For a five year loan , there are 60 balance sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if or when a loan might default , all 60 of these calculations would be required . A similar process is used for the determination of loan loss . <p> It should be noted that the unmitigated capital level is multiplied by the total loan exposure , not adjusted for collateral or guarantees for each monthly period . <h> An example <p> Let 's use as an example a 36 month fully amortizing loan with an initial value of $1 million that makes monthly payments . Let us further assume that the institution requires a minimum 7% capital on this loan and the recovery rates for any collateral pledged or guarantees made are 45% and 20% , respectively . The loan loss percentage , credit capital and guarantee factors for the risk rating associated with this loan are as follows : <p> If these values are interpolated to determine the values for a loan with 36 months remaining , the credit capital would be the interpolation between 120 months and 12 months or 14.44% or 10.00% + 24 * ( 30.00% 10.00% ) /108 . <p> The loan loss is 0.38% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows these values from 36 to 12 months , all of the values for durations less than 12 are equal to the stated twelve month values . It should be noted that the tables that follow are in spread sheet format , this is for demonstration purposes only . Actual calculations within PL are through the use of dynamic programming languages . <p> In the case of an unsecured loan with no guarantees the aEAD is the average expected loan level for each month . Thus , at 36 months remaining or at the start of the 3 year loan the aEAD is $1 million , while at one month remaining it would be $29,237 or the final principal payment . At the 36 months the credit capital required is the product of $1 million and 14.44% or $144,444 , while at one month it is $29,237 and 10.00% or $2,924 . <p> The unmitigated capital would be $10,000 and $292 , respectively . The sum of the credit capital and unmitigated in this situation would always be above the 7% minimum in this case , so no additional capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average over the 36 months for the total risk adjusted capital is $69.763 , this is summing the value for each month of the 36 periods and dividing by 36 . Similar the loan loss for the period with 36 months left in the loan is the product $1 million and the annual loan loss percentage of 0.38% , this value is then divided by 12 to obtain a monthly amount or $319 , in the final month the value is $4 , the annual average over the three years is $1,499 . <p> The table that follows shows the calculation for each month over the term of the loan , also shown is the output from the financial statement from PrecisionLender . The columns are listed as A , B , C etc. , where there is a calculation as in column F it is shown as the multiplication or addition of various columns , B*C . The Credit Capital Factor and Loan Loss Percentage ( Columns C and I ) are shown as the interpolation values from the table above . <p> When Collateral is pledged , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complicated . <p> The first thing that needs to be done is to determine the recovery value of the collateral . In our example we are assuming a recovery rate on collateral of 45% . If the stated amount of collateral is say $1,111,111 the recovery value is $500,000 . PrecisionLender assumes that this value remains constant throughout the term of the loan . The recovery value is subtracted from the loan exposure to determine the aEAD , thus in the first month of the loan , when the loan outstanding is $1,111,111 the aEAD is $1,111,111 less $500,000 or $611,111 . ( There would be no principal amortization in the first month . Not until the end of the first month when the payment would be received . ) <p> The value of the loan declines each month with the principal payment made by the borrower . By the 20th month or with 16 months left , the loan value is less than $500,000 . At that point the aEAD is zero and the credit capital amount is also $0 . The unmitigated amount would still be 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , in this example the 7% minimum comes into play and by the sixth month of its life some additional other capital is required to meet the minimum ( floor ) level . Once the credit capital is no longer required the other capital equals 6% ( 7% minimum less the 1% unmitigated ) . The loan loss percentage is also multiplied by the aEAD or a monthly amount of $159 for the first month in the life of the loan ( 0.38% time $500,000 divided by 12 ) . <p> By the 20th month , the loan loss reserve is no longer required since the net recovery value of the collateral is sufficient to cover the exposure outstanding . The average for the equity and the loan loss in this example is $37,453 and $454 , respectively , see the table below . Note in columns C and F , if the calculated value is negative , zero is used . <p> The calculations become more complicated when guarantee(s) are involved . Let 's assume in addition to the collateral there is a personal guarantee in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The net recovery value of the guarantee is thus $40,000 . The aEAD remains as discussed in the prior example , however in the calculations the monthly loan loss is different . <p> This being : ( ( Exposure less recovery value of collateral ) less net recovery of the guarantee ) , if the net value is positive , and loan loss percentage plus a second factor of the net recovery of the guarantee times the loan loss percentage on the opportunity and the loan loss percentage on the guarantor ( often the same ) . Thus for the loan , if there is 36 months remaining and using the basic example ( $1 million loan with a 3 year term ) the aEAD is $500,000 , the annual loan loss percentage is 0.38% for both the opportunity and the guarantor at 36 months , thus the equation is : ( $500,000 $40,000 ) * .0038 + $40,000 * .0038 * .0038 = $1,748 + $1 , on a monthly basis this becomes $147 . Clearly the second factor does not add much to the loan loss reserves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is : credit capital percentage times the sum , if positive of aEAD less the net recovery of the guarantee plus the product of credit capital percentage , guarantor factor and the net recovery of the guarantee . Thus for the loan , if there is 36 months remaining , the equation is : ( $500,000 $40,000 ) * .1444 + ( $40,000 * .1444 * .3156 ) = $68,268 . The first part of the equation is only used as long as the Exposure less the recovery value of collateral is greater than zero . <p> This guarantee would result in a reduction in required capital to $37,029 and annual loan loss reserve of $392 . The table below shows the calculations with a $200,000 guarantee and a net recovery amount on collateral of $500,000 . <h> Conclusion <p> The use of credit migration analysis provides sufficient information to determine credit capital and loan loss percentage based on various durations . It also permits the calculation of guarantee factors . These can be used to determine the amount of capital required to support loans and be within the 99.9% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital requirements as well as loan loss amount .

@@83882395 @5382395/ <h> Background <p> The CFPB issued a final ruling in January of 2013 , implementing the " Ability-To-Repay " requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act . <p> TILA section 129C(a) states that a creditor may not initiate a mortgage loan unless they have made a reasonable , good faith determination that a consumer has a reasonable ability to repay the loan . <p> TILA section 130(a) and ( k ) outline the consumers rights to seek restitution for damages if the creditor did not comply with the ability-to-repay requirements . <p> However , TILA section 129C(b) provides a safe harbor from any recourse if the loan is considered to be a qualified mortgage . <p> To complicate the issue , there are actually two different levels of presumed compliance when it comes to qualified mortgages . <p> If the loan is considered a higher-priced mortgage loan , then the loan is subject to a rebuttable presumption of compliance .

A higher-priced mortgage loan ( HPML ) receives less protection than a non-HPML , so it is better to avoid the HPML label if possible . <p> Originally , the CFPBs ruling was simple . For a first-lien mortgage to avoid the HPML tag , the annual percentage rate could not be more than 1.5 percentage points above the FFIECs published Average Prime Offer Rate ( APOR ) .

@@83882401 @5382401/ <h> Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income Opt-in or Opt-out ? <p> Most community banks when filing their December 2014 Call reports in January or early February 2015 will need to determine whether they want to " opt-in to or out of " including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ( AOCI ) in regulatory capital . The new capital regulations issued in mid-2013 allow almost all community banks the option of including or excluding AOCI from the determination of regulatory capital . It is expected that just about every community bank will opt-out . This decision can have significant impact on a banks operation . <h> What is Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ? <p> AOCI is used to sum up unrealized gains and losses on items that have not yet been settled . In other words there could be a loss or gain in a certain financial instrument if liquidated immediately in the current market place , but if held on to , there is no direct effect on net income . The most important example is a security held in an " Available for Sale " ( AFS ) basis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value on the books of the institution . If the security is sold , currently this gain or loss would affect net income , but if not sold the difference between book and market is simply an unrealized amount . Under current accounting standards , this unrealized level is considered part of AOCI , which can affect book but not regulatory equity . <p> Every quarter , if not more frequently the market value of the security changes and thus the AOCI level . If AOCI is positive this will increase the banks GAAP capital and if the institution does not opt-out their regulatory capital . If , however , the value of the security declines , the AOCI can turn negative and will reduce a banks capital ratios . While unrealized gains or losses on investment securities represent the vast majority of most banks AOCI , there are several other components that can come into play , this includes : <p> The main driver of AOCI , however , is the unrealized gains or losses on AFS securities . As of June 30 , 2014 , over 88% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains or losses . Or , in other words what happens on movement of interest rates and their effect on banks investment security values determines AOCI . <h> Why is This Important ? <p> AOCI can , and does , change on a regular basis . The first chart below shows how unrealized gain or loss to tier 1 capital changed between the very low interest rate environment of March 2013 and the higher intermediate yields at the end of December 2013 , and then the slight fall in interest rates by March 2014 . As can be seen there were a number of institutions where the absolute unrealized loss to Tier 1 capital was in excess of 10% . Due to the further declines in intermediate yields by June 2014 , the percentage of banks with significant negative AOCI and unrealized losses has further declined as shown in the second chart . <p> Thus for most banks that choose to opt-in , their regulatory capital would have improved in the first half of 2014 , even absent of any profit , due to the increase in AOCI . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead to volatility in regulatory capital . Most banks do not desire this volatility , in good times and especially not in bad times . <h> What about Held to Maturity on all Securities ? <p> One way of reducing unrealized gains or losses is to avoid having securities available for sale . This can primarily occur in one of two ways , the first is to invest any liquidity in fed funds sold , very short term money markets , or deposits at other banks , the Federal Home Loan Banks or balances at the Federal Reserves . A surprisingly large number of banks ( almost 10% of the total ) have taken this route . While many of these banks are small , there are several institutions with assets in excess of $1 billion . <p> The other means is to purchase investment securities and just designate them as Held to Maturity ( HTM ) . The bank is not able to sell these securities prior to maturity , except for a very limited number of situations . Sale prior to maturity generally means all other securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a sale of HTM securities tends to cause conflicts with outside accountants and regulators . Thus , HTM may reduce the liquidity of the investment portfolio , but it also reduces volatility in unrealized gains or losses . <p> Most banks today have only a limited number of HTM securities . These are often small local municipal issuance with limited marketability . They may also include certain asset backs or trust preferred which can not be readily sold . In fact as of June 30th , only about 18.5% of investment securities at community banks are designated as HTM . It is the potential for reduced liquidity that rightfully causes many banks to limit the number of HTM securities . While many HTM securities can be used for repurchase agreement collateral , that market can be limiting , particularly during a period of stress . <h> Interest Rate Volatility and Unrealized Losses <p> The issue is not much of a factor in the current interest rate environment ( October 2014 ) , but becomes critical as yields increase . As noted , in December 2013 many institutions received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of simple examples can demonstrate what rising interest rates means . Let 's assume that a bank has $500 million of regulatory assets and a Tier 1 capital ratio to assets of 10% ( $50 million of capital ) . Assume further that 20% of the assets are in five year AFS bonds with a coupon of 2% with current yields at the same level . There are no other investment securities . If the bonds were purchased without any premium or discount , book and market would be the same . However , if yields immediately increased in increments of 100 basis points ( bps ) up to 400 bps , the market value of the bond would decrease and the unrealized loss would increase . As a percentage of Tier 1 capital , this ratio would grow appreciably . <p> The first table shows this effect : <p> The next two tables shows the effects if the bonds had a maturity of ten and two years . <p> In the case of the two year bonds or the equivalent of a portfolio with a duration of about 1.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the portfolio of ten year bonds , or a duration of about 8.6 years , it would be best to hope that securities as a percentage of total assets is 2% and not 20% . A more explicit way of saying this : make sure your resume is up-to-date . <p> The graphs below show these results for a random sample of banks based on estimates of their portfolios . These are all community banks , generally with assets of between $500 million and $4 billion . As can be seen , most of these banks do not have an issue if interest rates remain at present ( October 2014 ) levels . A few of them are in pretty good shape , even with a rise of 400 bps . It should be noted that this is a random selection of banks and is not meant to represent what will happen to all banks . However , there will certainly be a number of banks where a rise in interest rates of 3 or 4% will have a significant negative effect on their unrealized AFS gains and losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was very popular several years ago . Unfortunately banks could find themselves in a similar situation , although perhaps without the false arrest . After all , the question that might be asked today is : why worry ? Early next year just about every bank that can opt-out of including AOCI and thus unrealized AFS security losses in regulatory capital will do just that . Thus , in theory , changes in AOCI , whether positive or negative will have no effect on a banks capital ratio . While the original bank capital proposal included AOCI , the final regulation made it optional . As many have argued , there is currently no requirement to book changes in the market value of the loan or deposit portfolio in regulatory capital . Why should securities be treated differently ? <p> So , all is good . In fact , why even write this article ? Well , here comes the sting . Unfortunately , although the capital regulations permit the " opt-out " provision , there is an addition provision that states : <p> " Notwithstanding the availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have reserved the authority to require banking organizations to recognize all or some components of AOCI in regulatory capital " <p> It further states that : <p> " The agencies will continue to expect each banking organization to maintain capital appropriate for its actual risk profile , regardless of whether it has made an AOCI opt-out election . Therefore , the agencies may determine that a banking organization with a large portfolio of AFS debt securities , or that is otherwise engaged in activities that expose it to high levels of interest-rate or other risks , should raise its common equity tier 1 capital level substantially above the regulatory minimums , regardless of whether that banking organization has made an AOCI opt-out election " <p> Or a simple example may suffice . A bank has a comfortable level of capital well above capital minimums , say 20% higher . Rates rise 300 bps while investment portfolio duration and size remains relatively unchanged , after all no one wants to sell bonds that might be priced below book . The bank has a profile similar to the average of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement " adequately capitalized is not so bad , " may be used more frequently at that bank .

@@83882468 @5382468/ <h> The Five Cs of Bank Vendor Assessment and Selection <p> A rigorous method for evaluating software vendors based on a framework you know and trustIn the earliest days of society , " banking " was pretty straightforward . We loaned money to people we knew and trusted , and we had a pretty good idea if they were going to pay us back . But today , things are a bit more complicated lenders and borrowers are n't  nearly as connected , but we still need to underwrite each borrowers ability to repay . So how do we get to that same comfort level BEFORE we hand over the cash ? The answer : The 5Cs of Credit the modern framework for understanding the credit worthiness of each and every borrower . <p> The story is n't so different when it comes to buying subscription-based software solutions . Todays landscape is like the Wild West , and knowing which vendors we can count on is getting more and more difficult . So , how do we choose ? How do we ensure that the vendor we select is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a framework that we know and trust , so what if we took a credit underwriters approach to vendor selection ? Enter , The 5 Cs of Vendor Assessment and Selection Company , Culture , Customers , Churn , and Conditions . <p> By exploring a series of very specific questions and breaking down the answers , we can quickly determine if a software vendor is truly worthy of our trust and our cash . <h> A bit of background <p> Over the years , we 've done thousands of product demos for banks and credit unions all across the country . We 've also seen our share of demos , and most vendors seem to be getting better and better at sharing an engaging story , highlighting their best features , and minimizing their flaws . Its no surprise that you walk away from most with a favorable view . <p> So how do you separate the promise from the reality ? What questions could you ask each vendor to help underwrite their claims ? <p> The great news for banks and credit unions is that there 's already a trusted framework @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the heart of one of your most important activities : credit underwriting . <p> The credit underwriting process is a disciplined method of asking questions and gathering the most pertinent facts and evidence to underwrite a borrowers promise to repay a loan ( plus a nice return ) . Most credit underwriting processes are based around a very useful framework known as The Five Cs of Credit Character , Capacity , Capital , Collateral , and Conditions . <p> We analyzed the demos we 've done over the years , and asked ourselves : What were the best questions we were asked by a potential client either during the demo or even later as a part of their vendor due diligence process ? Two very interesting patterns emerged : <p> The prospective clients who consistently asked the best questions took a credit underwriters approach to vendor and solution assessment and vendor due diligence . They were trying to underwrite the promise of the webcast/demo with facts and evidence . <p> The questions they asked could be grouped into what we will call here The Five Cs of Vendor Assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Conditions . <p> Its no coincidence that these five Cs map over , almost directly , to the Five Cs of Credit likely because those who apply the credit discipline to their vendor selection process tend to view solutions more like assets ( loans ) that require an initial investment of both time and capital but should , if the promises are kept , pay back the investment plus a meaningful return with minimal risk . Their goal is to underwrite that risk . <p> Company &amp; Culture <p> The first , and perhaps most obvious and important , questions that you must ask yourself are , " Is this someone that I would be proud to do business with ? Can I trust them to deliver ? What if things go wrong ? " But again , these are questions we must ask ourselves judgments that we must reach in the end . What questions can we ask the vendor that would reveal facts and evidence to help us answer these questions ? <p> There 's an old saying in credit underwriting : a " 1 Credit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a borrower with both the proven ability to repay and the moral character to actually do so . You can think about these first two Cs ( Company and Culture ) in a very similar way . <p> Understanding the Company ( its size , financial strength , ability to attract and retain great people ) will help you underwrite their ability to deliver . Understanding their Culture ( how they measure customer success , how they handle difficult situations , how transparent , open , and honest they are ) will help you understand whether or not they will actually deliver on their promises . <h> Questions <p> Company <p> How large is your company ? <p> How large is the group within the company that supports , maintains , and develops this product ? How big was it a year ago ? Two years ago ? <p> Is that group dedicated to this product or shared with other products ? <p> How many developers are dedicated to this product ? How long has each of them been dedicated to and working on this product ? <p> Culture <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you measure customer success ? <p> Who within your company will be responsible for ensuring OUR success ? <p> Tell me about a case where a customer was unsuccessful . Why werent they successful , and what did you do about it ? <h> Interpreting the Answers <p> You can learn a great deal about a potential vendors Company and Culture by asking these simple questions , but in many cases , how they answer can reveal even more . Do they answer in terms that are more relevant to you , or to them ? Even more telling , do they answer in ways that seem to obfuscate the most relevant details ? <p> For example , take the first question , " How large is your company ? " Do they answer in terms of employees , revenues , or market capitalization ( terms relevant to them ) , or do they openly describe the actual size of the group dedicated to developing and supporting the product that they are asking you to buy ? Companies of all sizes will sometimes try to puff out their chests and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way allows honesty and openness to shine through . <p> When assessing the Company and its ability to deliver , you want to understand how much they 're actually investing in product development and support . Is their investment growing or shrinking ? The number of issues you encounter and the pace at which they resolve them is directly related to their investment in this specific product . The fact that they have 5,000 employees serving other clients using other products is , at best , irrelevant ; at worst , its a deliberate distraction or overstatement . <p> The Culture questions are , in most cases , far more important and telling . They can be summed up simply " How do you know if your clients are getting a return on their investment ? What do you do if they are n't  ? " The answers you get here , just like in credit underwriting , will have an enormous impact on how you view the Conditions of this relationship ( the fifth and final C ) . <p> There are two big things to look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ask how they measure customer success , they may try to answer using customer satisfaction survey results . Customer satisfaction is necessary , but not sufficient , to ensure customer success . Pay close attention to their answers here and see if they " foot " with their customer retention answers in the Churn section below . High customer satisfaction with low customer retention indicates that their satisfaction surveys are doing a poor job of measuring success . <p> Every vendor should be able to tell a story ( or two ) about an unsuccessful customer . No vendor is perfect , and there will always be cases where things just did n't  work out . Through these stories , you should get a sense of the vendors level of openness and honesty . Do they blame the customer ? Do they blame external factors such as the economy ? Or , do they focus on what they could have done better during the sales or delivery processes ? And most importantly , what did they do about it ? Did they make things right ? <p> Customers <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on your part . In return , the vendor offers the promise of a return on that investment , an ROI . There are really only three meaningful ways this return can be delivered : <p> Increased Revenue through : <p> Volume improvement ( sell more ) <p> Pricing improvement ( charge more ) <p> Decreased Expense through : <p> Increased efficiency ( do more with less ) <p> Elimination of expenses/loss ( just need less ) <p> Decreased Risk through : <p> Reduced likelihood of losing revenue <p> Reduced likelihood of increasing expenses <p> Any vendor should be able to connect their solutions value proposition to one or more of these . If the value is n't crystal clear very early in the process , its probably time to move on as there 's no need to underwrite a loan to someone with no clear path to even repay the principal . <p> Growth and retention ( See Churn below ) of customers are very strong evidence of a positive ROI . If these number are flat , or worse yet , declining , you should be very concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the product , support , and service . A declining customer base often leads to just the opposite . If they described a growing level of investment in the product , but show a declining customer base , eventually something is going to give . <h> Questions <p> How many customers do you currently have ? <p> How many are actively using exactly the same solution were considering ? <p> How many customers did you add last year ?

About your company overall ? <h> Interpreting the Answers <p> As with the Company section , the first question here will give them the chance to overstate or embellish the number of relevant customers . If they say they have 10,000 customers and it becomes apparent ( after question 2 ) that only 50 are using the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they overstated any other claims ? <p> The goal is to narrow things down to the set of customers that are most relevant to your situation , and determine whether future investment in this product will be aligned with your needs . If their existing customer base consists of a certain type of bank and that 's where they 're growing , you should expect future investment to be focused primarily on that group . Assess what that means for you ( it could be good or bad ) , and if they have customers who are similar to you , ask for names so that you can speak with them . <p> Churn <p> Jeffery Gitomer said it clearly in the title of his book : " Customer Satisfaction is Worthless , Customer Loyalty is Priceless " . While the previous section focused on customer growth , this section focuses on something far more important : customer attrition , commonly known as Churn . <p> Many solutions today are offered as " Software as a Service " or on a subscription basis . Churn is the ultimate measure of loyalty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option , customers only keep paying for things that are producing benefits that exceed their costs . Think of it this way a company charges $10k per year , and conducts an " annual survey " of its customers . This survey has only one question : " Did you receive value that greatly exceeds your investment ? " If you answer " yes " to this question , you staple a check for $10,000 to your response . If you answer " no , " you have just churned . <p> Churn is the single best metric for underwriting the vendors value proposition . It correlates more than anything else with actual customer success . Buying any subscription-based solution and not asking the vendor about churn would be like booking a loan without asking to see financials . <h> Questions <p> Who are your best/strongest competitors and how do you compete with each of them ? <p> How many clients have you lost to each competitor ? Why ? <p> How many clients have switched from each competitor to you ? Why ? <p> If clients have left you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ( before the initial term of the contract was even up ) ? If so , what did you do ? Did you refund the remainder of their term ? <h> Interpreting the Answers <p> Churn , and its counterpart Retention Rate , are the most important metrics for assessing the health of any subscription-based business . This is just as true for a software business as it is for a cellular phone business , a cable TV business , or even a lawn service . <p> Like a lot of the ratios that a credit analyst might review to underwrite a loan , Net Revenue Renewal Rate is a fairly straightforward concept of the dollars up for renewal in the last 12 months , what percentage of those dollars renewed ? What is good about this metric is that it takes into account such things as : <p> Was the vendor forced to cut the price just to keep the business ? <p> Is the vendor just losing clients ? <p> Are customers expanding their relationship with this vendor and buying more stuff ? This could lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign . <p> Unfortunately , like all metrics , this one has some blind spots . It misses customers who left in the middle of their contract since they werent up for renewal . This is especially true for vendors who do a lot of multi-year contracts . In fact , the main incentive for some vendors to push multi-year commitments is , in fact , to slow the rate of customer churn ( more on this in the Conditions section below ) . The fifth question should help you to understand if this is the case and if the churn numbers are understated . <p> The discussion around Competitors is really where the best vendors will truly separate themselves . If there are four competitive vendors for a particular product , odds are that you will get the straightest and most honest answers from the market leader . Theyll likely have the lowest churn and will compete on results and references based on actual customer success . Others may compete by pushing significantly lower prices with longer terms . Its not unusual for the market leader to have 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client that might churn away to a competitor . <p> Conditions <p> Just as in credit underwriting , you must also understand and evaluate the Conditions of the deal in the context of what you 've learned from the other four Cs . In the end , these Conditions serve to either mitigate , or exacerbate , the risk . <h> Questions <p> Generally , you 'll see the actual terms in a written proposal and/or a formal contract , but its still worth asking these questions directly and listening closely to the response . Its also important to take notes and ensure that the actual contract reflects the answers you were given . <p> How do you price your solution ? <p> Do you offer a guarantee ? Why or why not ? <p> What is your typical contract term ? Why ? <p> What level of service and support is included ? Do you charge for upgrades ? <p> What happens if we grow our assets organically ? Through acquisition ? <h> Interpreting the Answers <p> With vendor assessments , the linkage between the Conditions and the other four Cs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the vendor is setting the proposed terms and conditions . If you 've done a good job of assessing the Company , Culture , Customers , and Churn of this vendor , the Conditions will fall right into place " That 's exactly what I expected . " <p> Let 's look at a simple example . Consider the case where a vendors new customer growth is slowing , and at the same time , they 're losing existing customers to competitive solutions . When they offer you a rock-bottom price in exchange for a 5-year commitment , is it really any mystery as to why ? Caveat emptor indeed . <p> Putting the Pieces Together <p> The trend toward buying powerful , highly specialized solutions ( particularly cloud-based software solutions ) will likely continue as more banks look to improve performance , increase efficiency , and reduce cost . And it makes sense when a vendor focuses on solving a very specific problem , competitive pressure forces them to build a better mousetrap . After that , the very best vendors spend their time listening carefully to their users and then incorporating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefits of the entire pool . <p> The trick , of course , is identifying the vendors you can truly rely on . Fortunately , youve already developed a framework for understanding which borrowers are most likely to pay you back . There 's no reason you should n't know the same thing about your vendors .

@@83882646 @5382646/ <h> Pricing Into the Headwinds <p> I was kayaking this weekend and as I headed out across the lake , the headwinds I was paddling into reminded me of many of the conversations I 've been having with bankers lately about loan pricing . When kayaking , paddling harder into the wind is less important than maintaining a steady pace and keeping the boat pointed in the right direction . The progress seems slow at first , but you soon realize that you 're getting closer to your destination with every stroke . <p> Every lender I talk with today seems to feel like they 're up against the stiff headwinds of low interest rates and competition each time they sit down with a borrower . Most believe there 's nothing they can do except " tough it out " which usually translates to " match the competition " . This is dangerous and unnecessary . <p> If you think about it , matching the competition means they 're basically pricing your loans ( and building your portfolio ) for you . This would be like letting the wind decide where I have lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it certainly is n't the spot I planned when I put the boat in the water . <p> Taking your bank in the direction you choose is n't all that different from paddling a boat decide what kind of portfolio you want to end up with and then make sure that every loan you book moves you in that direction . Weve written about the concept we call it the pricing dynamic . We believe that it captures the essence of an effective loan pricing management system , and we think that those that follow its core principles will be successful regardless of which way the wind blows .

But the borrower says he s planning to go with Bank Down The Street , which is offering a rate that 's 50 basis points lower . <p> Some lenders throw up their hands right then . The deal does n't  fit their rate sheet so then , oh well . <p> Great lenders start asking questions . " What can you tell me about this deal ? " <p> Perhaps then you find out how , exactly , Bank Down The Street is offering such a low rate . Maybe its because part of the loan is guaranteed . That could be the end of the story . But the great lender channels his inner annoying child and asks about the guarantee : Whos providing it ? What are the details ? <p> In this hypothetical , the guarantor is the borrowers father-in-law . Again , this could be the end of the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the answer , and he detects that the borrower is less than thrilled at the prospect of " owing one " to his father-in-law . So the great lender asks more questions and finds out that the borrower would be more than willing to cut a few months off the length of the loan if it means he can get the same low rate and not have to rely on his father-in-laws guarantee . <p> By asking questions and listening to the answers , the great lender has gathered enough information to turn the tables and win another deal for his bank . <p> In the end , the only people truly annoyed are the lenders working at Bank Down The Street .

A disciplined and objective methodology to set loan prices based on risk is a necessity . Many banks pay lip service to this requirement but too often cite the need to match the competition as a reason not to abide by it . To be effective , loan pricing should take into account the entire customer relationship , the loan loss provision and cost of risk , an equity allocation , the duration of the credit and its funding cost , and the risk rating of the credit . A secondary benefit to a disciplined approach to loan pricing based on objective factors is that it provides a solid defense from charges of unfair or discriminatory pricing in small business lending " <p> We could n't agree more !

Maybe the customer has a couple of loans like that with the bank and you 've even earned their deposit business . Youve built a solid relationship and have become their go-to banker . <p> But rates have fallen quite a bit since you booked those loans . The borrower could easily re-price and save themselves a lot of money . And it would n't take much to discover where todays rates are information like that is coming at us from practically every direction .

At that point , you 've become the banker they did n't  hear it from . <p> So , do you go out and proactively re-price , hoping to trade a bit of todays profit for an even stronger relationship , or do you ride it out ? <p> During a recent lending strategy session we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $250MM bank in Louisiana ( a PrecisionLender client ) asked this very question . Its a tough question and I do n't  have all the answers , but the best way Ive ever heard about how to think about this , how to manage the art of lending in situations like these , also happens to be one of my all-time favorite baseball analogies <p> Suppose that we had an un-drafted rookie free agent on our baseball team . We signed him to a 2-year contract , and were paying him the league minimum . In his first year he bats .400 and hits 40 home runs he s the Rookie of the Year , an All-Star , and the fans love him . Now that he s an All-Star and Rookie of the Year , he s immensely valuable and we 've got a really low " cost of funds " on that rookie .

If we do , were going to pay him closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , but we get to keep him on our roster for a lot longer and earn money for a long , long time . Or , do we wait for him to become a free agent , knowing that when that happens everybodys going to be bidding on him ? <p> There is no hard and fast rule here there is no mathematical answer . These are decisions that require our best human judgement judgement based on all of the quantitative AND qualitative information we have . <h> Quantitative Considerations <p> The current economic value of the relationship including loans , deposits and other fee based business .
