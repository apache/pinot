Join us this afternoon for a perspective from Dr. Melissa Cady , board certified physician in anesthesiology and pain medicine who teaches with osteopathic and allopathic approaches . Dr. Cady has suffered from chronic pain , which she has managed conservatively despite the opportunity to do more risky interventions . Paindemic offers the rational approach of the anti-Pain Lifestyle as a solution to addressing chronic pain effectively with less risk . <p> ABOUT PAINDEMIC <p> Are you suffering from chronic pain ?

Millions are suffering . The United States is the most advanced society in the world ; yet , the majority of pain medications , procedures , and surgeries are not solving this Paindemic . <p> Paindemic will open your eyes to what you should know . Too many unnecessary and risky interventions are being done with little benefit and at great expense .

She currently practices medicine in Austin . <p> Her initial desire to become an author originated from her realization that one of the greatest needs within the medical system is education , which is undervalued , underpaid , and therefore , under-delivered . Cady 's belief is that education of the general public can empower and direct people toward better choices and health while avoiding unnecessary medical interventions . <p> Melissa Cady takes great pride in building rapport with patients by being educational and practical despite the overwhelming pressure by the medical system to minimize time with patients , move more quickly , or succumb to irrational expectations or politics . @qwx103384 <h> Thank you for supporting Melissa Cady and your local independent bookstore ! @qwx103378 @qwx103381 @qwx103385 @qwx103379 @qwx103386 <p> 0 Items @qwx103388 @qwx103377 @qwx103382 @qwx103387 @qwx103383
